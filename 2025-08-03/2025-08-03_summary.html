Former Fox News host boosted lies that Trump lost 2020 election because of electoral fraud

The US Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro – a former Fox News host and staunch Donald Trump ally who boosted lies that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of electoral fraudsters – as the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital.

Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county judge who joined Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote along party lines.

In a statement issued by Pirro after the vote, the Republican said she was “blessed” to have been confirmed as the US attorney for Washington DC. “Get ready for a real crime fighter,” said Pirro's statement, which called the US attorney's office she had been confirmed to lead the largest in the country.

Before her media career, Pirro spent over a decade as a Republican district attorney in Westchester county, New York, and also served as a county judge.

She hosted her own Fox show Justice with Judge Jeanine. And more recently, she became a co-host on the Fox show The Five.

Pirro used her time at Fox News in part to publicly support the baseless claims that Trump lost his first presidency to Joe Biden in 2020 because of voter fraud. In 2021, she was among several Fox News hosts named in the defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused the network of knowingly airing false claims about the company's voting machines after the previous year's election.

Fox ultimately settled the lawsuit for $787.5m and has acknowledged that the fraud claims were false.

Pirro has been serving as the interim US attorney since May, when her fellow Republican Trump nominated her to the post months into his second presidency. She was nominated after Trump withdrew the nomination of conservative activist Ed Martin, his first choice for the role. A key Republican senator, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, had said he would not support Martin's nomination.

In announcing Pirro's nomination in May, Trump praised her record, and said that she was a “powerful crusader for victims of crime” and someone who “excelled in all ways”.

“Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position,” the president added.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Saturday published a statement exalting Pirro as “a warrior for law and order”.

At the end of his first presidency, Trump pardoned Pirro's former husband, Albert Pirro Jr, after he had been convicted in 2000 on federal charges of fraud and tax evasion.

Pirro is one of a number of Trump loyalists with ties to Fox who have joined the president's administration. Other prominent ones include her fellow ex-Fox News host Pete Hegseth, the embattled defense secretary, and the former Fox Business personality Sean Duffy, the embattled transportation secretary.

In June, US senator Adam Schiff accused Pirro of “blind obedience to Donald Trump is nearly unrivaled among his ardent supporters”.

“For an important prosecutorial position like this one, the country has a right to demand a serious and principled public servant,” Schiff said. “Jeanine Pirro is not it.”

Despite Pirro's confirmation, the US Senate left Washington DC on Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of Trump nominees despite days of contentious, bipartisan negotiations.

An irate Trump went on social media and told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “GO TO HELL!”

New biography of the Duke of York claims ‘punches were thrown' after heated argument became physical

Prince Harry has denied he gave Prince Andrew “a bloody nose” during a fight at a family gathering in 2013.

According to an excerpt from a new biography of the disgraced Duke of York, published in the Daily Mail on Saturday, the pair had a heated argument that escalated into a physical altercation. “Punches were thrown over something Andrew said behind Harry's back”, the author Andrew Lownie claimed.

The alleged fight began when “Harry told [his uncle] he was a coward not to say it to his face. Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”

Lownie's biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, also claims Andrew told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, would “not last more than a month”.

He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017.

Late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.”

The duke and duchess have sent a legal letter to the Daily Mail over the publication of what their spokesperson described as “gross inaccuracies, damaging and defamatory remarks”.

The Guardian has approached Buckingham Palace and representatives for the Duke of York for comment.

Prince Andrew fell from grace after a disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. The duke was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021.

The book claims Harry and his brother, William, had “problematic” relationships with Andrew for years and that Andrew was also rude about William's wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales.

King Charles has allowed his younger brother to stay in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park owned by the crown estate. However, last year the king ended Andrew's allowance, estimated at £1m annually, raising questions about future arrangements.

The source quoted in Lownie's biography claims the Prince of Wales is keen to “evict” the duke and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who lives with Andrew though the couple divorced in 1996.

According to Entitled's source, “[William] also loathes Sarah … and can't wait for the day when his father throws them both out. If Charles doesn't, I guarantee you the first thing William does when he becomes king is to get them evicted.”

Harry broke ties with his family citing the “toxicity” of royal life and alleged racism towards his wife, moving with his young family to Canada and then the US in 2020. In 2022 he published a memoir, Spare, in which he detailed strains in his relationships with his father and brother.

Earlier this year he told the BBC he had forgiven his family and would “love a reconciliation”.

Lando Norris made it three wins from his last four races on Sunday with a hard-fought victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
    


            Despite a disastrous start which saw him slip from third to fifth in the opening seconds, the McLaren driver benefited from an improvised strategy to pit just once and managed to hold on to the lead despite a late challenge from teammate Oscar Piastri.
    


            The Australian driver started and finished in second, meaning he is now just nine points ahead of Norris in the drivers' world championship.
    


            “That was tough, we weren't really planning on the one stop at the beginning but after the first lap that was our only option to get back into things,” Norris told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward.
    


            “The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat out, it's rewarding even more because of that, the perfect result today.”
    


            Charles Leclerc began in pole position courtesy of a brilliant final lap in qualifying, but endured a difficult race and has now won just one of the last 16 races in which he has started at the front of the grid.
    


            He finished in fourth after being overtaken late on by George Russell, who claimed his first podium finish since he won the Canadian Grand Prix in June.

            For the first half of the race, Leclerc looked in total control. But during lap 29, cracks began to show as the Monégasque driver signaled to his team that something they had discussed before the race was affecting his car. He told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward that there had been an issue with the car's chassis.
    


            By the time he pitted on lap 40, Leclerc came out behind Norris and could not challenge the English driver.
    


            Suddenly, it was Piastri who looked most likely to catch Norris, especially after lap 51 when – on fresher tires – the Australian caught Leclerc and breezed past him at the first opportunity.
    


            “This is so incredibly frustrating. We've lost all competitiveness,” said Leclerc on the team radio. “Now it's just undriveable, undriveable. It's a miracle if we finish on the podium.”
    


            With just under 20 laps remaining, Piastri used his better tires to make up the 8.5-second gap on Norris, but could not quite pass him despite a thrilling attempt at an overtake on turn one with two laps to go.
    


            A seventh McLaren one-two of the season ensured a 200th grand prix victory for the team. No team has more than the 13 victories that McLaren has managed at Hungaroring.
    


            “I pushed as hard as I could,” Piastri told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. “After I saw Lando go for a one (stop), I knew I was going to have to overtake on track which is much easier said than done here.
    


            “It was a gamble either way. Today, unfortunately, we were just on the wrong side of it.”
    


            Elsewhere, Fernando Alonso finished in fifth, one place ahead of Gabriel Bortoleto, who achieved the best finish of his rookie season.
    


            Max Verstappen, who was racing for Red Bull for the 200th time and confirmed this week that he was staying with the team, finished in ninth.
    


            Lewis Hamilton's disappointing weekend did not see any improvement. A day after he called himself “useless” and suggested Ferrari should drop him, the British driver, who has eight wins on this track, finished in 12th.

From a dinosaur in the Prairies to the ‘world's largest axe' in New Brunswick, Globe readers told us which monuments are worth more than a pit stop

Road-trip season is in full swing, reminding many Canadian travellers it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

But let's face it: When you're driving down a long stretch of highway for hours at a time, sometimes the journey can get a tad monotonous.

That's where Big Things come in. You know, those massive roadside monuments and statues that demand your attention when you drive by, offering a precious chance to stretch your legs and snap a photo to put in the family album. A flying saucer, a gargantuan gnome or even a giant blueberry could pop up quickly on the horizon.

With countless monuments to choose from, we asked Globe readers to share their favourite attractions everyone should see at some point, and you delivered. Some are quirky, some are colossal and all 100-per-cent Canadian.

From coast to coast, here are 16 attractions to make the trip worth your while.

Sue Nicholson and her husband were getting the grand tour of Kamloops from a cousin while visiting the interior B.C. city, and there was only one thing they wanted to see. “He was somewhat taken aback when we asked to see the fish statue,” wrote Nicholson of the nearly five-metre wide, open-mouthed creature created by wood carvers in Kamloops. Nicholson recalled her cousin saying he had never been asked to see it before. “We thought it was a salmon, but it's actually a local strain of rainbow trout.”

Howard the nearly nine metre tall gnome has a storied past on Vancouver Island, and Nanaimo local Liana O'Brien tells it best: “He was built in the 1990s to advertise a racing track that eventually closed. Howard remained in his position at an Esso station at Nanoose Bay, until he grew bored and decided to go walk about. He now resides in Saanich, but local bylaws have discriminated against him saying he is 17 inches too tall, so he is only allowed to come out and stand tall and proud four weekends a year to celebrate local events. He is otherwise incarcerated in storage at a nearby farm.”

.

A prehistoric being named Tyra, four times larger than a real T-Rex, has been guarding Canada's own slice of Jurassic Park for decades. Allan Hobden visited the first statue, which has since been replaced, on a family road trip in 1960. “As a kid I was amazed at how big it was,” he wrote. But Hobden, a very brave 12 year old, wasn't intimidated by the massive beast, posing with his fists raised in the air as if to fight it while his father took a picture

The giant aluminum pysanka is a tough egg to crack. Nine-metres long and more than three-storeys high, the Ukrainian-style painted Easter egg pays homage to the many early Ukrainians who settled in Vegreville. And it was a popular submission, with readers from as far as Quebec praising its brightly coloured shell. Matt Funk in Kelowna, B.C., remembered seeing it featured on the alien sci-fi show The X Files, when a snow globe containing a miniature of the egg – a popular souvenir from the town – was used to reveal a password to a secret file.

The same love of science-fiction is alive elsewhere in Alberta, where the aptly named town of Vulcan has embraced its Star Trek connection with a model of a USS Enterprise ship where the main series is set. Chris Jones in Toronto says it's his pick because “it's the weirdest one I can think of! And c'mon, they have a transporter.” Lloyd Hummert and his wife, Betty, live in California, but stopped by the town in 2019 on their “see the rest” of Canada trip. Between their travels together and apart, they've boldly gone to all 10 provinces, all three territories and where no man has gone before.

Mac the Moose is a jaw-dropping 10-metres tall and weighs a whopping 10,000 kilograms, and he provides a jolly welcome for drivers passing east and west on the Trans-Canada Highway. Debbie Ristimaki says there were “plenty of laughs and memories created” when she and her partner took their mothers, ages 96 and 80, on a road trip from Winnipeg to Banff in June, stopping to see Mac each way. Seeing the moose was also a special moment for Shirley-Anne Blackadder, whose 2023 road trip around Saskatchewan completed the Vancouverite's quest to visit every province and territory in Canada.

Chuck the Channel Catfish stirred up controversy when he was erected to attract American fisherman across the border to the “Catfish Capital of Canada,” and now he's still helping reel them in. Selkirk local Dave Wilkinson says there was heated debate in 1986 as some argued “it should be one of the first visible monuments upon entering the town” and petitioned council to move it out of Selkirk Park. “Despite ongoing tensions surrounding Trump's trade war, Selkirk continues to draw U.S. tourists, who come to fish for catfish in the Red River,” said Wilkinson. The freshwater fish recently got a fresh coat of paint.

Anyone driving east past Toronto on the 401 has done a double take at this iconic landmark — a giant, smiling apple greeting you as you drive by. At that point, you must be thinking you took a wrong turn toward New York, but the real Big Apple is located in Colborne, Ont. Reader Kristen Watson said she stopped in and was surprised to find a market selling pies and even got “a completely unexpected and exciting chance to climb a twisted stairwell up inside the Big Apple.”

Ontario's Highway 11 is a veritable treasure trove of roadside attractions. Kallie Berens highlights Chimo the Polar Bear, located right outside the downtown core of Cochrane in northeastern Ontario. The town is home to the world's only habitat dedicated entirely to polar bears – there was a time where you could swim in a pool with them, separated by glass – and the adorable bear statue welcomes you in. “Overall, the journey up Highway 11 makes for a memorable road trip,” she said, adding that small towns offer interesting stops. “I would recommend travelling up that way to anyone looking for a rich historical adventure with a wilderness twist.”

While working as a university summer student for a team at Forestry Canada, Globe reader Tom Alves had the chance to visit towns all along Highway 11. One standout from the journeys is the flying saucer at the edge of Moonbeam, Ont. It's huge, silver and straight out of a 1950's sci-fi movie. “It's just so unique and kitschy, I absolutely love it,” Mr. Alves said.

Sudbury, Ont.'s giant nickel is, as reader Stephen Podetz says, “not only big, but built to last.” He first saw it on a camping trip at five years old and said that 25 years later, it was just as impressive. Sudbury is known for its nickel production and is still a major source of the mineral in Canada. “ I think of it as the granddaddy of all big things,” he said.

Did you know Quebec has its own sea monster? Locals named the elusive creature, rumoured to reside in the depths of Lake Memphremagog, Memphré. And while visitors might not be so lucky as to catch a sighting of the real thing, reader Sue Nicholson highlighted the city of Magog's topiary statue of the creature, made of greenery and jutting out of a pond.

You'd think Paul Bunyan dropped something when visiting the Big Axe in Nackawic, N.B. Kevin Kitchen travelled to its home by the St. John River and “it did not disappoint.” Rising almost 15 metres into the sky, the axe was commissioned in the early nineties to celebrate the region's forestry industry.

Shediac, N.B., is a go-to destination for travelling lobster lovers – boat tours take you up close and personal with freshly-caught crustaceans, but one catch is bigger than the rest. Sitting at about 10-metres long and 5-metres high, the a giant lobster roadside attraction signals to tourists what the town's all about. As reader Diana Colleran says, “It's a beaut!”

Reader Meg Hughes recommends taking a trip to Oxford, N.S., to catch a glimpse of the town's giant smiling blueberry. The town is known for its wild blueberries – it's one of the biggest producers in Canada – so don't miss your chance to take a selfie.

Potato fans travel near and far to catch a glimpse of the giant spud in front of the Canadian Potato Museum in O'Leary, PEI, built to inform travellers on the history of potato farmers in the region.

            This past spring, when I pointed my car out of Inverness to begin a loop around Scotland's craggy northern shoreline, I was expecting trouble ahead. A decade ago, when the North Highland Initiative — a development charity set up under then-Prince Charles — renamed the circuit the North Coast 500 and started promoting the drive to tourists, I had been unconvinced it would work. I approved of any initiative aimed at drawing more visitors to a neglected part of my homeland, but recasting the ramshackle roads of the North Highlands as a desirable destination seemed like a stretch.
    


            Back then, the thought of the drive evoked memories from half a century before — of me and my nauseated siblings squashed inside a rusty Ford station wagon as it rolled through mile after mile of monotonous moorland. Also dampening my enthusiasm were recollections of the food endured in my 20s when introducing my girlfriend of the time to the region. She came up from England expecting langoustines leaping out of creels and venison from stags gralloched, or disembowelled, where they fell on a nearby bed of purple heather. More often than not, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she had to settle for deep-fried scampi and frozen peas, garnished with a smear of tartare sauce squeezed from a plastic sachet.
    


            Yet the idea of making these overfamiliar highways and hostelries the theater for epic road trips worked. As a promotional move, the North Coast 500 was a masterstroke — too much of one, by most accounts. Thanks to the alchemy of marketing and social media, the 516-mile (830-kilometer) circuit, which starts and finishes in Inverness, became an irresistible, Instagram-friendly pilgrimage for people around the world, overwhelming the ability of the aging and underpopulated region, and its roads, to handle the pilgrims.
    


            Locals began losing patience with what happened next: Nose-to-tail motorhomes on single-track roads, grill dads scorching seafront meadows with disposable barbecues, everywhere becoming an open-air toilet. A decade after its launch, the NC500 is now seen as a textbook case of overtourism. At the end of last year, Fodor's Travel added the NC500 to its 2025 “No List” of destinations it recommends avoiding, on the grounds that the route's popularity had made it a threat to the natural environment and a “nuisance” to roadside communities.
    


            But has it all been bad? When I drove the route, primed for a visit to a tourism-ravaged landscape, what I discovered was as much a case for the defense of the much-maligned road trip as an indictment of its negative impact.
    


            No tarmac was melted in the making of the digital phenomenon of the NC500. The roads are hardly any better under their new name than they were in the decades before the North Highland Initiative came up with the idea of marketing them as a destination, or a challenge, in themselves.
    


            Even so, the rechristened route captured the imagination of travel writers and visitor numbers soon began to rise. Everyone seemed to heap praise on the route. No one mentioned the annoying swarms of tiny biting midges that plague Scotland's west coast in the summer.
    


            As the positive publicity snowballed through the years, I began to find myself lured by thoughts of revisiting places with names as romantically resonant as Durness, Ullapool and Applecross. The Covid pandemic intervened before I had the opportunity to live out that daydream and by the time Britain had emerged from lockdowns, the image of the NC500 had changed.
    


            The founders imagined showcasing a Scotland of sea eagles soaring above secret coves and singing sands. When they envisioned sights that would linger for a lifetime in the mind's eye, they didn't have in mind little pagodas of soiled wet wipes used to cover the toilet tracks of wild campers caught short miles from the nearest public restrooms.
    


            When Richard and Jane Alcorn moved seven years ago to Thurso, near the northeastern tip of Scotland's mainland, to open a bed and breakfast, being close to the NC500 was part of why they chose the location. That decision has been rewarded with steady growth in visitors to their cosy Aurora B&B, but Richard says he understands why some of his fellow residents have come to resent the route.
    


            “Initially the idea was for people to come in their cars, stay in local accommodation, buy from local restaurants and use local facilities. It was an admirable idea and we have seen the benefit of that,” he said. “What you've seen since the second lockdown is people trying to have a freebie holiday. More and more caravans and camper vans, people parking up in lay-bys and trying to do it on the cheap. You can see why people get upset with camper vans parking in front of their living room windows, and then there's the abuse they get when they ask them to move on.”
    


This boiled bag of offal is banned in the US. In Scotland it's a fine-dining treat



            Thousands of people signed up to Facebook pages dedicated to chronicling such bad behavior. A backlash gathered momentum. As did misgivings about the NC500 brand passing from royal patronage to private ownership: Since 2018, North Coast 500 Ltd has been under the control of Anders Holch Povlsen, a Danish billionaire and Scotland's biggest landowner.
    


            I was wondering about this as an old school friend and I set off on a drizzly Sunday in late April. Our first stop was Dingwall, a small town located in rich farming land to the north of Inverness that I remember from my childhood as the well-manicured home of a late aunt and uncle.
    


            Lunch options were sparse and, on the High Street, the boarded-up shell of the semi-derelict Commercial Bar was an eyesore reminder that the town has known better times since it was founded as a Royal Burgh authorized by the Scottish Crown precisely 999 years ago. A bit of overtourism might not be the worst thing that could happen here, I thought, not for the last time on our trip.
    


            For the first two-thirds of our journey, we squinted at the views through a misted-up windscreen and wipers on full swipe, failing to spot any evidence of tourists making a nuisance of themselves. There were plenty of camper vans on the roads, but it appeared to be too early in the season for the traffic jams and blocked ambulances the Facebook sites had primed me to expect. Over four days, the only time we got stuck behind a slow-moving vehicle, the culprit was the clearly lost driver of a superstore home-delivery van.
    


            Tourism can be an easy scapegoat for problems it didn't create and cannot be expected to fix, I thought as we turned into the Old School restaurant and rooms on the banks of the fjord-like Loch Inchard on the North West Sutherland coast. Like many of the establishments on the NC500, this place has been geared to turning around most of its six bedrooms almost every day. Guests are encouraged to check in between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., eat dinner between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., breakfast by 9 the following morning and be gone by 10 a.m.
    


            The model can make it feel like “regimented and rushed” has succeeded “rough and ready” as the go-to descriptor for Highland hospitality. But any fears I had were dispelled by a few glasses of red wine and a stew of locally shot venison of the kind my girlfriend and I could only dream of back in the day.
    


            In the morning, the Old School's owner, Lisa MacLeod, shared her thoughts on the impact of the NC500, starting with an aspect of tourism that sometimes gets forgotten in the costs/benefits debate — the pleasure it has brought to those who might never have visited without it, and the sense of pride and satisfaction that offers to hosts.
    


            “Obviously there are negative parts to it, but generally all these people get to see this most amazing part of the world that they probably wouldn't have known about otherwise,” she said.
    


            While the NC500 has been good for her seasonal business, MacLeod says it was always unrealistic to expect tourism alone to fix big issues such as the tendency of young people to leave the area for opportunities — or just the excitement — on offer elsewhere. “The majority of people who live here either work offshore in the oil industry, or on the fish farms which bring a lot of young families in,” MacLeod said. “The hotels and the B&Bs are not really what makes the money.”
    


            After a traditional Scottish fried breakfast, we set off to spot puffins, skuas and razorbills on Handa Island, where the sun appeared for the first time on our trip, splitting the clouds to light up the wildlife reserve's lovely bays in azure hues more usually associated with the Caribbean.
    


            By the time we rolled into the nearby coastal village of Scourie a few hours later, it was properly warm and we were ravenous. Which was well timed because here, at the bottom of one of the steep slender smallholdings, known as crofts, that run down to the bay is the kind of all-day Scottish dining venue I'd been fantasising about for decades.
    


            As we walk up to Grant and Heather Mercer's Crofters Kitchen food truck there is a hum of quiet contentment from the surrounding picnic tables and the sight of Heather updating the daily-changing  specials blackboard is equally reassuring. Grant, a 33-year-old with 17 years of experience under his head chef's hat, has just taken delivery of some wild halibut from a local fisherman and, hours after it was landed, it is going straight on the menu.
    


Why Scotland's ‘ghost' whisky distilleries are coming back to life



            It is just the kind of thing this veteran of Scotland's long-hours hospitality culture envisaged himself doing when he and Heather first decided to embark on this business venture. Their goal was to spend more time together as a family, while taking advantage of the demand generated by the NC500's success to serve up the kind of locally sourced, seasonal fare that remains the exception rather than the rule in these parts.
    


            The halibut, grilled to moist, flaky perfection and served with orzo pasta in a wild garlic pesto, is one of the nicest things I've ever eaten in Scotland. How long I'd waited for this! As we ate, the Mercers' 15-month old son was toddling about. With his blond hair, he reminded me of my oldest boy at that age. My son's mother, the girlfriend with the aversion to scampi suppers, died suddenly 20 years ago, and I felt a stab of sadness that she was not here to enjoy the scene.
    


            Like the NC500, the Crofter's Kitchen was celebrating an anniversary. It's one year since it opened and the Mercers have been basking in five-star reviews while planning the next stage of their field-to-fork adventure — using a government business grant to convert a shipping container into indoor seating to serve food all year round, bringing more tourism revenue into the local community.
    


            “As well as sourcing all the seafood locally, we produce a lot of our own vegetables and we also buy salads from other crofters, pork, and venison that's been shot on their land that I'll help them butcher,” Grant told me.
    


            “The container will allow us to open almost all year round which will be great for the locals especially in the winter when there is not much open around here. The nearest Chinese takeaway is in Ullapool, a good 45-minute drive away.”
    


            I know from my own experience of living in one of Scotland's wet and windy corners that infrastructure is not just about parking places and smooth roads. A steady stream of visitors can be the difference between a local store with barely filled shelves and one laden with unexpected choices. As Grant Mercer points out, every halibut delivered by hand to the Crofter's Kitchen is a fish that is not being loaded onto a truck for export — an economic pivot that balances the impact of the NC500's tourists against the environmental costs of the region's participation in a globalized fishing industry.
    


            Heading in a counterclockwise direction, as we did, the road south of Scourie is where the route is at its most breathtaking.
    


            Long before anyone had thought of the NC500 concept, the mountains of Assynt and the Applecross peninsula were a favoured destination for clubs of classic car owners. It was easy to understand why as we glided towards our final overnight stop on meandering corniches lined by banks of sun-drenched flowering gorse. James Bond's Aston Martin would be a good fit for the timeless elegance of these vistas but even in my slightly bashed Volvo, I had the pleasant feeling that I might be starring in a commercial for a posh watch brand.
    


            These sections of the route are endowed with such beautiful natural assets, it made me reflect on how the NC500 concept has also helped entice visitors to neighboring areas less blessed in the looks department. I also wondered why they were not inundated with tourists and the associated pressures decades ago — had they been, perhaps the infrastructure now coming under strain might already have been upgraded.
    


            Precise data on the economic impact of the NC500 is hard to pin down and often contested, but most analysts agree that the route has helped boost visitor numbers in the broader Highland region (up from 5.1 million in 2012 to 8.4 million in 2023, according to the local council), while tourist spending has grown less quickly (from £1.38 billion to £1.68 billion in the same period.).
    


            VisitScotland, the national tourism body, says the NC500 has undeniably raised the region's international profile and drawn in extra visitors to the benefit of the local economy.
    


The sleeper train that's a wild ride to another world



            “The global attention of the route has created some challenges, and we know there is a careful balance to strike between the benefits that tourism brings and ensuring communities feel comfortable and capable of welcoming visitors,” a spokesman said, highlighting the body's efforts to spread tourism over the whole year, encourage longer stays and plug infrastructural gaps exposed by increased tourist numbers.
    


            Since 2018, VisitScotland has distributed £20 million, or about $27 million, through a Scottish government fund to develop rural tourism infrastructure, including many projects around the NC500, like parking, public toilets and motorhome facilities, the spokesman said.
    


            Such efforts have yet to persuade the skeptics that the route's problems can be mitigated without a reduction in visitors. According to the travel experts at Fodor's, the impact of NC500-led overtourism is now so severe it is “steadily changing the region's culture,” while a recent article in the New York Times was headlined: “Should You Drive Scotland's ‘Ultimate Road Trip?' Locals Say Maybe Not.”
    


            Our trip left me unpersuaded — especially given that around one in seven of the region's jobs depend on tourism. Even if it were true that the culture of the Highlands is being re-sculpted by the invisible hand of tourism, would that necessarily be a bad thing?
    


            Our final hotel on the route provided an answer of sorts. It was the only one I'd been able to find in a 30-mile radius offering two single rooms for under $200 a night and my heart sank as we checked in — the hotel's public bar revealing itself as a grim haven from the brilliant sunshine, where the early evening crowd formed a depressing tableau of Scotland's public health challenges.
    


            Inspecting my closet-sized room, I clocked the polyester sheets and fraying carpet, but failed to spot that I'd be destined for a dawn wake-up thanks to the absence of proper curtains.
    


            Later on, getting ready for dinner in a nicer spot, we bumped into a former manager of the hotel and fell into good-humoured conversation about the lack of gentrification at his old place of employment.
    


            “It's a bit of a rough old place,” I said.
    


            “Mmm,” he replied. “You should see it when the fishermen are in.”

			Revealed: First lady was key factor in US president's decision to launch air strikes on Syria during first term

As Donald Trump was flying back from Scotland, he revealed how he had discussed the horrific images of starving children in Gaza with his wife, the first lady.

“She thinks it's terrible,” he told The Telegraph aboard Air Force One.

“She sees the same pictures that you see and we all see. Everybody, unless they are pretty cold-hearted or worse than that, nuts … there's nothing you can say other than it's terrible when you see the kids.”

Melania Trump has kept a low profile during her husband's second term. Her rare appearances at the White House have sparked “Where's Melania?” headlines and questions about whether she is a part-time first lady.

But her influence can be spotted in Mr Trump's policies, and she is credited by insiders for being the “quiet force” behind the president's tougher stance on Russia.

For Melania, it is not a new role.

The Telegraph can reveal that she was a key factor in Mr Trump's decision to launch air strikes on Syria during his first term following a chemical weapons attack by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

A former White House official said she was horrified by videos of children dying in Khan Shaykun in 2017 and impressed upon her husband the need to act.

Mr Trump abandoned his campaign promises not to intervene in Syria's civil war, and launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea at a government airbase in Syria.

It was the first time that the US acknowledged striking Assad targets.

The former official said Mrs Trump was highly influential in the decision.

“I think she reacts to human suffering as a mom, without a policy or political filter, and shares her gut reaction with her husband,” they said.

Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University and an expert in the role of first ladies, said Mrs Trump was performing her role in a highly unconventional way, rejecting the traditional role of simply appearing beside her husband at public events.

Her approach may mean she is underestimated by the media and public at times.

“It may be that she does have more influence on her husband's thinking about issues than the general public might initially recognise because they seem to have this very traditional marriage in terms of gender role: He's the boss. She's the helpmate,” she said.

“But I think there has to be more to her than that, in that she has gone her own way a number of times.”

Mrs Trump, 55, was born Melanija Knavs in the part of Yugoslavia that is now Slovenia.

She launched her career as a fashion model at the age of 16, and met her future husband in 1998, when she was 28. Mr Trump was recently separated from Marla Maples, his second wife.

They married seven years later and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.

She was an unconventional first lady from the start, being only the second foreign-born woman to hold the position (after England-born Louisa Adams) and the first to have once appeared naked on the front cover of a magazine.

She did things her own way during Mr Trumps' first term, waiting for five months to move down to Washington DC from New York so Barron could finish his school year, and broke with her husband over family separations at detention facilities at the southern border.

She made headlines in 2018 with a jacket she wore during a visit to see migrant children separated from their families. “I really don't care,” read a statement on the back, “do u?”

It caused an uproar on social media as commentators pondered its meaning.

Mrs Trump later said it was a message to reporters who used anonymous sources to undermine her.

“In fact, I decided to let them know that their criticism would never stop me from doing what I feel is right,” she said in her 2024 memoir, entitled Melania.

She also used her book, published a month before the election, to speak up for abortion access. It marked a clear break with much of the Republican Party and her husband, who had taken a more conservative stance.

“Some people, they see me as just the wife of the president, but I'm standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts,” she told Fox News ahead of Mr Trump's second inauguration.

“I don't always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing, and that's OK.”

Mr Trump recently described his wife's influence when it came to the conflict in Ukraine, describing her sceptical take on Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, and his warm words.

“I go home, I tell the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation,'” Mr Trump said. “She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.'”

That turned her into an immediate heroine in Ukraine.

She was nicknamed “Agent Melania Trumpenko” and memes quickly spread showing Ukrainian iconography on her clothing.

Prof Jellison added that Melania was often underestimated in public because of her heavily accented English.

“It wouldn't surprise me that she does have some differing opinions, and might assert those to her husband behind closed doors and might have an influence on his thinking,” she said.

The first lady's office did not respond to a request for comment.

For her part, Mrs Trump told GQ in 2016 that she had plenty of opinions and shared them with her husband.

“Nobody knows and nobody will ever know,” she said about the advice she gives him... “Because that's between me and my husband.”

Itamar Ben-Gvir attended holy site in breach of ‘status quo' arrangements with Muslim authorities

Saudi Arabia has joined condemnations of far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to al-Aqsa mosque today.

The minister of national security travelled to the holy site and prayed there with a reported group of 1,250 people. Police were pictured alongside Ben-Gvir.

Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation and Jews can visit but may not pray there.

“The foreign ministry expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's condemnation in the strongest terms of the repeated provocative practices by officials of the Israeli occupation authorities against al-Aqsa mosque,” a statement on X read.

“The Kingdom affirms that such practices fuel the conflict in the region.”

Here is a recap of today's events

Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited and prayed at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Sunday, triggering fears that the provocative move could further escalate tensions. The visit to al-Asqa mosque came as hospitals in Gaza reported that 27 more Palestinians seeking food aid were killed by Israeli fire.

During his visit, Ben-Gvir renewed calls for Israel to “declare sovereignty over Gaza” and to “encourage voluntary migration”.

Ben-Gvir's visit was swiftly condemned as an incitement by Palestinian leaders as well as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Sufyan Qudah, spokesperson for the foreign ministry in neighbouring Jordan, which serves as the custodian of the al-Aqsa mosque, condemned what he called “provocative incursions by the extremist minister” and implored Israel to prevent escalation.

The Palestinian ministry of health reported that 119 people were killed in the past 24 hours amid ongoing Israeli strikes, including 15 bodies recovered from beneath rubble. The ministry said the total death toll since the start of the war on 7 October 2023 has now reached 60,839, with 149,588 people injured.

The health ministry also reported that six adults have died as a result of famine and severe malnutrition within the past 24 hours. According to the ministry, this brings the total number of deaths attributed to hunger related causes in Gaza to 175, including 93 children.

The humanitarian organisation Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that one of its staff members was killed and three others wounded in an Israeli attack on its Khan Younis headquarters in southern Gaza early this morning.

Thousands of Palestinians protested in the occupied West Bank's major cities, rallying against the war in Gaza and in support of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

Fresh clashes broke out in Syria, straining a fragile ceasefire and calling into question the ability of the transitional government to exert its authority across the whole country.

French president Emmanuel Macron has condemned Hamas' “inhumanity without bounds” after the group released videos showing two visibly emaciated Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Israel's far-right National Security Minister conducting a Jewish prayer on the Al-Aqsa compound in east Jerusalem drew condemnation from the Palestinian Authority, which called it a “dangerous escalation”, as well as Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Itamar Ben Gvir publicly carried out the highly contentious move - that violates a long-held understanding at the site - on Sunday.

In a statement filmed at the compound, Ben Gvir said that Israel should respond to the “horror videos” of two Israeli hostages released by Palestinian militant groups this week by “extending Israeli sovereignty over the entire Gaza Strip” the same way it imposed it on the Temple Mount.

Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in 1967, in a move not recognised by much of the international community.

Ben Gvir's action was described by the Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz as a “provocation”.

Renewed sectarian clashes in southern Syria's Druze-majority Sweida province killed at least four people on Sunday, a war monitor said, as Damascus accused local groups of violating last month's ceasefire.

The province witnessed deadly clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouins in July that drew the intervention of government forces and tribal fighters who came to support the Bedouins.

Syrian state-run news agency SANA accused Druze groups loyal to influential spiritual leader Hikmat al-Hijri of breaching the ceasefire by attacking government troops in Tal Hadid, killing one security forces officer and injuring others.

In a statement, the Syrian interior ministry accused local groups of “launching treacherous attacks against internal security forces in several locations and striking some villages with rockets and mortars, resulting in the killing and wounding of a number of security personnel”.

They came in full force in the pouring rain, armed with umbrellas and ponchos and waterproof prams. One man even carried a surfboard. This is Sydney, after all.

At least 100,000 people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday as part of a growing global call for a ceasefire in Gaza. It was double the estimated turnout, described by New South Wales police as the largest protest to descend on the city in memory.

The massive column of rain-soaked marchers snaked their way across the entire 1.2km length of the bridge. Police temporarily ordered a halt over fears of a crowd crush because of the “huge number of people taking part”.

On Saturday, after the NSW supreme court had ruled in favour of the march proceeding, the Palestine Action Group had crystal ball gazed and said Sunday's bridge crossing would be an “immense march for humanity”.

Pro-Palestine protesters crossed the Harbour Bridge on a wet and wintry Sydney day, armed with umbrellas and ponchos and waterproof prams. One man even carried a surfboard. This is Sydney, after all. Read the full piece here:

Protesters gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to demand an end to the war in Gaza and the return of all hostages still held in the territory.

The rallies took place after Hamas released video footage of the hostage Evyatar David who was in an emaciated state.

COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has said that four tankers of UN fuel had entered Gaza to help in operations of hospitals, bakeries, public kitchens and other essential services.

Israel blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza but, in response to a rising international uproar, it announced steps last week to let more aid reach the population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, approving air drops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys.

UN agencies say airdrops are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and open up access to the territory to prevent starvation among its 2.2 million people, most of whom are displaced amidst vast swathes of rubble.

COGAT said that during the past week over 23,000 tons of humanitarian aid in 1,200 trucks had entered Gaza but that hundreds of the trucks had yet to be driven to aid distribution hubs by UN and other international organisations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he spoke with the International Red Cross's regional head, Julien Lerisson, and requested his involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages held in Gaza.

French president Emmanuel Macron has condemned Hamas' “inhumanity without bounds” after the group released videos showing two visibly emaciated Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Hamas and its Islamic Jihad ally have released clips showing captives Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David, who were kidnapped during the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.

“An abject cruelty, an unlimited inhumanity: this is what Hamas embodies,” Macron posted on X.

“France's absolute priority and imperative is the immediate release of all hostages,” he added.

Macron, who has said France will recognise a Palestinian state in September, promised to work “tirelessly” to “promptly restore the ceasefire, and to enable the massive delivery of humanitarian aid, still blocked at Gaza's borders”.

He also argued that Hamas must have no part ruling Gaza once the war ends.

“We demand the total demilitarisation of Hamas, its complete exclusion from any form of governance, and recognition of Israel by the state of Palestine.” he said.

‘We don't take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians': Athens mayor rebukes Israeli ambassador

The mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, has sharply criticised Israel's ambassador to Greece following claims that the city authorities were failing to tackle antisemitic graffiti.

In an interview published on Sunday by the Greek newspaper Kathimerini, ambassador Noam Katz said Israeli tourists felt “uncomfortable” in the capital and accused Athens of inaction against “organised minorities” responsible for antisemitic vandalism.

Doukas responded on X: “We have proved our strong opposition to violence and racism, and we do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians.”

He went on to call the ambassador's focus on graffiti “revolting” at a time when “an unprecedented genocide is taking place in Gaza.”

Family of Israeli hostage held in Gaza accuses Hamas of starving him

The family of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza said that Hamas is starving him after the release of a video in which he appeared emaciated and weak.

The footage, released on Saturday, shows Evyatar David speaking in what appeared to be a Hamas tunnel in Gaza. In scenes that have caused outrage and dismay in Israel, he is shown digging what he says could be his own grave. In comments made under duress, he urges the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire.

The family of David released a statement responding to the video, accusing Hamas of starving David for propaganda.

“We are forced to witness our dear son and brother Evyatar being deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza – a living skeleton buried alive. Our son has only a few days left to live in his current condition,” the family said.

They called for humanitarian aid that enters Gaza to be allowed to reach David and urged the US and Israeli governments to do everything possible to secure his release.

Read the full story here:

The Palestinian ministry of health has reported on Telegram that 119 people were killed in the past 24 hours amid ongoing Israeli strikes, including 15 bodies recovered from beneath rubble.

Hospitals across Gaza recorded 866 injuries in the same period, with emergency crews reportedly unable to reach many victims still trapped in debris or lying in the streets.

The ministry says the total death toll since the start of the war on 7 October 2023 has now reached 60,839, with 149,588 people injured.

Between 18 March and today, the ministry has documented 9,350 deaths and 37,547 injuries.

Among those killed in the last 24 hours, 65 were reportedly attempting to access humanitarian aid, raising the total number of such deaths to 1,487, with more than 10,578 wounded in similar circumstances.

New outbreaks of violence overnight into Sunday rocked Syria at two flashpoints, straining a fragile ceasefire and calling into question the ability of the transitional government to exert its authority across the whole country.
  In the north, government-affiliated fighters confronted Kurdish-led forces who control much of the region, while in the southern province of Sweida, they clashed with Druze armed groups.
  The outbreaks come at a time when Syria's interim authorities are trying to maintain a tense ceasefire in Sweida province after clashes with Druze factions last month, and to implement an agreement with the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that would reintegrate large swaths of northeastern Syria with the rest of the country.

Thousands of Palestinians protested in the occupied West Bank's major cities on Saturday, rallying against the war in Gaza and in support of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

One of the largest marches took place in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority located just north of Jerusalem, with hundreds gathering at the main square, waving Palestinian flags.

Many protesters carried photos of Palestinians killed or imprisoned by Israel, as well as photos depicting the hunger crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip, where UN-backed experts have warned that a “famine is unfolding”.

“My son is in [Israel's] Megido prison and he suffers from many things, such as the lack of medicine the lack of food,” Rula Ghanem, a Palestinian academic and writer who took part in the march, told AFP.

She said that her son had lost 10 kilograms and suffered from scabies in jail.

Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that “Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed and will not change”.

The comments follow outrage that far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir led a large group to the Al-Aqsa mosque, also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, to pray, in defiance of a long-standing convention.

Jordan, which acts as the site's custodian, condemned the minister's latest visit there as “an unacceptable provocation”.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society has shared this footage after it said that one of its staff members was killed and three others wounded in an Israeli attack on its Khan Younis headquarters in southern Gaza early this morning.

Israeli newspapers have dedicated their front pages on Sunday to the plight of the hostages following the release of videos showing Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David.

Maariv decried “hell in Gaza” and Yedioth Ahronoth showed a “malnourished, emaciated and desperate” David.

Right-wing daily Israel Hayom said that Hamas's “cruelty knows no bounds”, while left-leaning Haaretz declared that “Netanyahu is in no rush” to rescue the captives.

Saudi Arabia has joined condemnations of far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to al-Aqsa mosque today.

The minister of national security travelled to the holy site and prayed there with a reported group of 1,250 people. Police were pictured alongside Ben-Gvir.

Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation and Jews can visit but may not pray there.

“The foreign ministry expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's condemnation in the strongest terms of the repeated provocative practices by officials of the Israeli occupation authorities against al-Aqsa mosque,” a statement on X read.

“The Kingdom affirms that such practices fuel the conflict in the region.”

Witnesses hear blast shaking city shortly after midnight on Sunday; Ukraine strikes in Russia kill three people, officials say. What we know on day 1,257

See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage

Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday, the military administration of the Ukrainian capital said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters' witnesses heard a loud blast shaking the city soon after midnight. The reported attack comes days after Russia's worst airstrike of the year on Kyiv, which killed at least 31 people, including five children, and wounded more than 150.

Ukraine on Saturday said it hit military targets and a gas pipeline in drone attacks in Russia, where local authorities said three people were killed and two others wounded. Ukraine's SBU security service said the strikes, carried out on Friday night by long-distance drones, hit a military airfield in the south-western town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk. They caused a fire in an areas where Iranian-built Shahed drones – relied on by Russia to attack Ukraine – were stored, the SBU said.

The SBU said the strikes also hit a company in Russia's southern Penza region, which it said “works for the Russian military-industrial complex”, making military digital networks, aviation devices, armoured vehicles and ships. The governor for Russia's Penza region, Oleg Melnichenko, said on Telegram that one woman had been killed and two other people were wounded in that attack.

Russia's defence ministry said its air-defence systems had destroyed 112 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory – 34 over the Rostov region – in a nearly nine-hour period, from Friday night to Saturday morning. An elderly man was killed inside a house that caught fire due to falling drone debris in the Samara region, governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev posted on Telegram. In the Rostov region, a guard at an industrial facility was killed after a drone attack and a fire in one of the site's buildings, acting Rostov governor Yuri Sliusar said. “The military repelled a massive air attack during the night,” destroying drones over seven districts, Sliusar posted on Telegram.

More than 120 firefighters were trying to extinguish a blaze at an oil depot in the Russian city of Sochi that was sparked by a Ukrainian drone attack, a regional governor said early on Sunday. In the Krasnodar region where Sochi is located, a fuel tank with a capacity of 2,000 cubic metres was on fire, Russia's RIA news agency reported. Rosaviatsia, Russia's civil aviation authority, said on Telegram that flights were halted at Sochi's airport to ensure air safety.

Both sides deny targeting civilians in their strike in the war that Russia launched with a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv says that its attacks inside Russia are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to Moscow's war efforts and are in response to Russia's relentless strikes on Ukraine.

Indian oil refineries will continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have said, before threatened US sanctions next week against Moscow's trading partners over the war in Ukraine. Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true. “I understand that India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That's what I heard. I don't know if that's right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens.”

Ukrainian authorities said on Saturday that they had arrested several politicians in connection with a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, shortly after an uproar over the independence of anti-graft bodies. A law passed in late July stripped the National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) of their independence and placed them under the supervision of the prosecutor general, himself appointed by the head of state. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday backtracked and restored the bodies' independence after an outcry from the country's allies and the first anti-government street demonstrations since Russia's invasion.

The NABU on Saturday said it and the SAP had exposed “a scheme for the systematic misappropriation of budget funds allocated by local authorities for the needs of the defence forces, as well as the receipt and provision of unlawful benefits on an especially large scale”. It said the scheme involved inflating prices for electronic warfare and drone equipment, and then funnelling off 30% of the contract amounts. The suspects include a member of parliament, heads of district and city administrations, members of the National Guard, and executives at defence companies. The NABU said it has made four arrests so far but did not identify those detained.

Zelensky said in a statement: “I am grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work … It is important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption.”

A fire that broke out near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after Ukrainian shelling has been brought under control, the Russian-installed administration of the plant in Ukraine said on Saturday. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia plant in the first weeks of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have accused each other of firing or taking other actions that could trigger a nuclear accident. The plant's administration said on Telegram that a civilian had been killed in the shelling, but that no plant employees or members of the emergency services had been injured. The station, Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, is not operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool.

Republican senators left Washington for their August recess without passing a major Russia sanctions bill, effectively handing U.S. President Donald Trump full authority to decide whether to follow through on his threat to penalize Moscow if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine by Aug. 8.

Trump warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire, the U.S. would impose tariffs on countries that continue importing Russian oil. As a preview, he announced 25% tariffs on India — a far cry from the 500% rate outlined in the Graham-Blumenthal bill that has yet to reach a Senate vote.

“I think (Trump)'s going to be very careful about what he does,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), told the Hill. “But I think he is clearly disappointed in Putin, and I think he is now coming around to recognizing that many of us were right.”

Trump has recently expressed growing frustration with Putin's refusal to deescalate, calling Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine "disgusting." He also said on Aug. 1 that he had ordered nuclear submarines to the region in response to recent threats from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. "Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences," Trump posted on Truth Social. "I hope this will not be one of those instances."

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), co-author of the sanctions bill with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said he would consider it a win if Trump imposed even a portion of what the Senate proposed. “We propose in our bill 500 percent. If it's 250 percent, I could live with it. Even if it's 100 percent, possibly. But you ought to impose bone-crushing sanctions that will stop them from fueling Russia's war machine,” Blumenthal told the Hill.

Some Republican senators said the Senate missed a key opportunity by leaving Washington without voting on the Graham-Blumenthal sanctions bill. Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, the second-ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. should continue ramping up pressure on Russia and ensure Ukraine remains well-armed.

Head of North America desk

Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. She is based in Edmonton, Alberta. Olena has a master's degree in publishing and editing from the Institute of Journalism in Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Olena was a 2016 Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow who worked for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for six months. The program is administered by the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia.

Work is ongoing between Ukraine and Russia as the warring parties prepare to each exchange 1,200 Prisoners of War (POWs), President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 3.

Key anti-corruption agencies restored after controversial vote, as well as Trump shortens deadline for Russia peace deal.

The unidentified civilians "armed with bats and metal pipes, damaged a vehicle and inflicted bodily injuries on a soldier" as the officer was attending to enlistment activities, officials allege. In response to the incident, a serviceman fired a non-lethal weapon at the civilians, allegedly in self-defense.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Aug. 3 announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kryvonozhko, who has been serving as the Air Force's acting head since the end of last August. 

Russia has been attacking a key bridge in Kherson Oblast since late on Aug. 2, local officials reported.

A Russian missile strike hit the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv overnight on Aug. 3, injuring seven and damaging homes and civilian infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials.

Oleksii Kuznetsov, a member of parliament who belongs to Zelensky's Servant of the People party, allegedly accepted kickbacks for inflating military contracts. He has been dismissed from his parliamentary faction pending the outcome of the case.   

The number includes 920 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

A drone strike resulted in a major fire early on Aug. 3 at an oil depot in Russia's resort city of Sochi, setting ablaze a 2,000-cubic-meter fuel tank, local authorities said.

Republican senators left Washington for their August recess without passing a major Russia sanctions bill, effectively handing Donald Trump full authority to decide whether to follow through on his threat to penalize Moscow. 

The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe and one of the ten largest globally, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) conducted a joint operation with local partisans to blow up a minibus in occupied Melitopol, killing all five soldiers of the Russian-backed Akhmat unit on board. 

Russian forces are "looking for vulnerabilities in our defense, and conducting active combat operations in several directions simultaneously," Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. 

Kyiv has submitted an updated version of the Ukraine Plan for the European Commission's consideration, following the EU's decision to cut the next tranche of the Ukraine Facility due to incomplete reforms.

Charlie the 10-year-old yellow lab likes surfing so much, he will grab his surfboard and run toward the water. His humans sometimes have to hide his board if they want to chat with friends on the beach.

Charlie joined about 15 to 20 other canine wave riders in Pacifica, 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of San Francisco, on Saturday at the World Dog Surfing Championships, an annual contest that draws thousands of spectators to Pacifica State Beach.

Pooches competed against similarly sized peers for a chance to appear in the finals. Additional heats featured multiple dogs surfing tandem or riding with people.

Labs, terriers and spaniels in monogrammed life vests dog-paddled out into the Pacific. Once out on the waves, their owners helped them hop on colorful boards and hang ten as the crowd cheered from the beach.

Judges scrutinized how long the dogs remained on their boards, how long they held their balance and whether they performed any tricks, like turning around while riding.

Iza, a 5-year-old French bulldog, won the single surfer heat for medium-size dogs for the first time this year, her owner David Fasoli said.

Fasoli found “pure joy” during the pandemic when he brought home a surfboard from his job at Costco and taught Iza to balance in the swimming pool. The two soon started swimming in the ocean and learning to ride waves as passersby at the beach watched in awe. Now, their competitions are all about defying expectations.

“I have a disability — I only have one hand — so a nonsporting human combined with a nonsporting dog breed, we are kind of phenomenal, defying the odds of what people think we're capable of doing,” Fasoli said after Saturday's competition.

Charlie, who has his own Instagram page, entered the extra-large single surfer heat. He also rode tandem with two other dogs in what their humans called “The Dream Team.”

“He loves the crowd,” owner Maria Nieboer said.

Charlie and Nieboer's husband, Jeff Nieboer, prepare for waves together. When Jeff spots a good one, he turns the board around and tells Charlie to “get ready.”

He pushes the board forward, and Charlie scrunches down and rides the wave as long as he can. Charlie can even steer the board by leaning and surfs toward an awaiting Maria on shore.

He doesn't have to be rewarded with treats for any of it.

“Charlie does what Charlie wants to do once we're in the water,” Jeff said.

Contest winners received medals and bragging rights.

Charlie's “Dream Team” compatriot, fellow yellow lab Rosie, was in four heats. The 4-year-old's owner, Steve Drottar, said she is “stoked” after they go surfing, which they do four to five times a week back home in Santa Cruz.

“It's like, hey, we actually did something today, right? We did something together as a team,” Drottar said. “And the fact that you can do something as a team with your dog creates a different bond than you have when you just take your dog for a walk.”

He can tell Rosie feels a sense of accomplishment afterward because she is extra happy, wags her tail extra hard and snuggles even more than usual.

“It's like we go home on the couch and it feels like she's saying, ‘Thank you,' ” Drottar said.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has launched an investigation into former Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two separate federal criminal cases against former President Donald Trump during the Biden administration, between Trump's two presidential terms.

On Aug. 2, the Office of Special Counsel confirmed it was investigating whether Smith's conduct through his efforts to prosecute Trump constituted a form of improper political activity. The office is an independent federal agency separate from the DOJ, tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service law, such as the Hatch Act restricting political activities by federal employees. The office has no criminal enforcement power but does investigate violations and has the authority to impose fines and other sanctions.

10:33 JST, August 3, 2025

SINGAPORE (AP) — The Americans set a world relay record and piled up three gold medals Saturday in what's been an otherwise frustrating swimming world championships for them.

And at the heart of the turnaround on the next-to-last day of the worlds in Singapore was none other than 28-year-old Katie Ledecky, the most decorated female swimmer in history.

Despite the world record in the mixed freestyle 4×100 relay — 3 minutes, 18.48 seconds — the story was Ledecky remaining unbeaten in the 800 freestyle.

She first won that race in the 2012 Olympics and has never lost since in a major competition.

Perhaps for the first time in her career, Ledecky was given only a 50-50 shot by many to beat the 18-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, the star of these worlds with Frenchman Leon Marchand.

McIntosh's best time this season was 8:05.07 — just behind Ledecky's world mark of 8:04.12 set earlier this year.

After 700 meters, McIntosh of Canada was ahead by 0.14 seconds, but she faded and Ledecky won in 8:05.62 with Lani Pallister of Australia taking silver (8:05.98). McIntosh (8:07.29) settled for bronze.

McIntosh has won three individual gold medals in Singapore and was trying for five. She will come up short, though she will be the favorite in Sunday's 400 individual medley.

Ledecky said she was unaware she was trailing and, when asked about it, glanced down at a race-results sheet to confirm it.

“I didn't know,” she said. “I just knew it was close the whole way. There were times where I thought I was just going to break away. I was just happy I was up there.

“You just never know when you dive in what everyone's tactics are going to be — or what's going to happen,” she added. “It was fun to just to be in that kind of a race. Just try to make small moves just here and there.”

Ledecky has won 23 gold medals at world championships and 30 overall. Add to that nine Olympic gold medals and 14 Olympics medals overall. If you're counting, that 44 Olympic and world medals.

McIntosh, who won three gold medals in the Paris Olympics, hates losing and she showed it afterward with her comments. They were short and right to the point.

“Obviously, that's not even close to what I wanted; time-wise, place-wise, how I executed the race. Nothing,” she said.

Gretchen Walsh of the United States won the 50 butterfly in 24.83 seconds for her second individual gold of the worlds. Earlier in the worlds she won the 100 fly. Alexandria Perkins of Australia claimed silver (25.31) with bronze for Roos Vanotterdijk of Belgium (25.43).

“It feels great to be like myself again in the water after kind of a rocky week,” said Walsh, referring to the ” acute gastroenteritis ” that the Americans have battled in Singapore following a training camp in Thailand.

“Two-time world champion. Can't complain with that,” Walsh added.

Paris Olympic 50-free gold medalist Cameron McEvoy of Australia repeated his title in the worlds, winning in a quick 21.14. Ben Proud of Britain was the silver medalist (21.26) and American Jack Alexy took bronze (21.46).

Defending champion and world-record holder Kaylee McKeown of Australia won gold again, taking the 200-meter backstroke in 2:03.33. American Regan Smith took her fourth silver medal in Singapore (2:04.29) with bronze for American Claire Curzan (2:06.04).

Maxime Grousset of France picked up his second gold, taking the 100 butterfly in 49.62, just off the world record of 49.45 by American Caeleb Dressel. Noe Ponti of Switzerland took silver (49.83) with bronze for Canadian Ilya Kharun (50.07). Grousset also won the 50 fly.

It was only the second world record set in these championships. It came on a night when the United States won three gold medals, by far its best performance in what had been a lackluster championships for the team.

The relay team members were: Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske.

The Americans how have eight gold medals, one ahead of Australia with the championships closing on Sunday. The Americans have 26 overall and Australia has 17 overall.

The only other record set in the meet came earlier in the week with Marchand shattering the 200 IM record (1:52.69). He'll try to break his own 400 IM record on Sunday, a mark of 4:02.50 set in the 2023 worlds in Fukuoka, Japan.

Explosions and smoke were observed today by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stemming from a nearby auxiliary facility that the plant reported was under attack.

The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe and one of the 10 largest globally, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

The IAEA team heard the blasts and saw smoke coming from the direction of the facility, according to Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. The plant's staff informed the team that the auxiliary site was struck by shelling and drones starting around 9 a.m. local time, coinciding with military activity audible to the IAEA personnel. 

Smoke from the targeted area remained visible to the team into the afternoon, despite the facility being located 1,200 meters from the plant's site perimeter. The incident is the latest in a string of recent events highlighting the persistent nuclear safety risks stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine.

“Any attack in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant – regardless of the intended target – poses potential risks also for nuclear safety and must be avoided,” Grossi said. "Once again, I call for maximum military restraint near nuclear facilities to prevent the continued risk of a nuclear accident."

Meanwhile, Russia also appears to be constructing power lines in occupied southern Ukraine, a move that could link the Zaporizhzhia plant to Russia's energy grid, the New York Times reported on May 27, citing a new Greenpeace report.

Satellite imagery featured in the Greenpeace report indicates that since early February 2025, Russian forces have laid over 80 kilometers (49 miles) of high-voltage lines along the Sea of Azov coastline, connecting occupied Mariupol and Berdyansk. 

Experts from Greenpeace believe this construction aims to connect these new lines to a major substation near Mariupol, which could then be linked to the Zaporizhzhia plant, located approximately 225 kilometers (139 miles) away.

A drone strike resulted in a major fire early on Aug. 3 at an oil depot in Russia's resort city of Sochi, setting ablaze a 2,000-cubic-meter fuel tank, local authorities said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on Aug. 3 imposing sanctions against 94 individuals and five legal entities, primarily targeting the captains of Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" vessels.



Work is ongoing between Ukraine and Russia as the warring parties prepare to each exchange 1,200 Prisoners of War (POWs), President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 3.

Key anti-corruption agencies restored after controversial vote, as well as Trump shortens deadline for Russia peace deal.

Victoria Mboko receives against Coco Gauff during a match at the National Bank Open in Montreal on Saturday.Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images

Victoria Mboko's stellar run at the National Bank Open hit a new level Saturday.

The Canadian rolled to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over No. 1 seed Coco Gauff of the United States, winning the women's singles match in just 62 minutes to advance to the quarterfinals at the WTA 1000 tournament.

Mboko, a rising star who has climbed from a No. 333 ranking to 85th in the world this year, saved all four breakpoints against the world No. 2 Gauff, who committed 22 unforced errors in the fourth-round match at IGA Stadium.

The 18-year-old from Toronto, who entered the tournament as a wild card, is the last Canadian standing in the singles draw, both in Montreal and at the 96-man Masters 1000 event in Toronto.

Mboko became the second youngest Canadian to reach a WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 1990, behind only Bianca Andreescu.

She's also only the second teenager — and first Canadian — to defeat Gauff, as well as the first player this season to not drop a single game on serve against the star American.

After major support for Eugenie Bouchard early in the tournament, the buzz in Montreal shifted around Mboko as the teenage sensation took centre court — and she delivered before a sellout crowd.

“Your support was incredible,” Mboko told the crowd in French after a chorus of “Olé, Olé, Olé!” chants echoed around the venue.

“I'm really happy to win today.”

Mboko looked ready to meet the moment early, flashing the powerful groundstrokes and blistering serve that have made a mark on the pro tour this season.

Gauff, meanwhile, made unforced error after unforced error, firing some shots long and many more into the net during a swift, 25-minute first set.

The 21-year-old double-faulted on the third point of the match, leading to an early break for the Canadian, who rattled off seven straight points into the next game.

Mboko broke again in the fifth and seventh games while holding serve. In the seventh game, Gauff doubled-faulted and sent two shots into the net in succession to lose the set.

Gauff found a rhythm early in the second set and earned three breakpoint chances with the match tied 3-3, but committed an error each time as Mboko hung on to win the game.

With Mboko leading 5-4, Gauff doubled-faulted twice to set up two match points for the Canadian.

Gauff, this year's French Open champion, scraped by with three-set wins in Rounds 2 and 3. She struggled with her serve, striking a whopping 37 double faults in the two matches combined — adding six more on Saturday.

Mboko and Gauff met once before in May, when the Canadian won the first set but dropped the next two on clay at the Italian Open.

Mboko will play the winner of Saturday's late match between Zhu Lin of China and Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

Playing in only her seventh WTA main draw, she advanced to the quarterfinals of a 1000-level tournament for the first time, knocking off higher-ranked opponents at each step.

Mboko opened with a win over 79th-ranked Kimberly Birrell, then upset 23rd seed and former Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin before snapping Marie Bouzkova's seven-match winning streak with a relentless comeback and taking down Gauff, dropping one set the whole way.

It's the latest chapter in a breakthrough season for Mboko, who also played in her first two Grand Slam main draws, reaching the French Open third round and Wimbledon second round.

Her impressive record in all competitions this season improved to 50-9, including 24-8 against players ranked above her.

In Saturday's day session, Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine and Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan advanced to the quarterfinals.

Kostyuk, the 24th seed, recovered from a first-set loss to defeat McCartney Kessler of the United States 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round.

The ninth-seeded Rybakina also rallied for a 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 win over Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, who defended three match points before losing. Kostyuk and Rybakina will play each other in the next round.

            Hours after President Donald Trump told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “go to hell” in a Saturday post on social media, the Senate headed into recess without reaching a deal over confirming Trump's nominees.
    


            Senate Republican leader John Thune, Schumer and the White House had been engaged in a round of intense talks to end the standoff so senators could return to their home states, sources briefed on the conversations told CNN.
    


            Schumer had requested federal funds be released and that Trump agree not to push another legislative package that would slash federal funding, sources told CNN.
    


            But, on social media, Trump called Schumer's demands “egregious and unprecedented,” a sign that talks had collapsed.
    


            Trump had wanted the Senate to confirm his nominees even if that meant skipping the August recess, but his post showed he wasn't interested in agreeing to Democrats' terms.
    


            “Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL! Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS,” he wrote.
    


            On the Senate floor Saturday night, Thune asked for unanimous consent for the chamber to vote on a handful of nominations and then break for a month.
    


            Democrats had been slow-walking Trump's lower-level nominees, forcing Thune to keep the Senate in session this weekend to confirm them. In the minority, Democrats have the power to force Thune to jump over time-consuming hurdles before the chamber can vote.
    


            Schumer made several demands to agree to let a batch of nominations be quickly confirmed by the Senate, according to the sources. The demands included the unfreezing of federal funds for an array of programs, including the National Institutes of Health and foreign aid.
    


            The New York Democrat also wanted Trump to agree that he won't attempt to push through another package to slash federal funding known as “rescissions” — after a $9 billion package to codify some cuts was approved earlier this summer.
    


            Schumer said in a news conference Saturday night that Democrats were “serious” about finding a “reasonable path” to allow bipartisan consideration of Trump's nominations, but that the president wouldn't agree to the terms.
    


            “In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating. Is this the ‘Art of the Deal'?” Schumer said, pointing to a poster printed with Trump's social media post.
    


            Schumer declined to get into details of the negotiations with the White House and Thune but said that both sides were “getting close on a whole lot of issues, and Donald Trump just pulled the rug out from under people.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and to Thune for comment.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's far-right national security minister led prayers on Sunday at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, drawing international condemnation and escalating tensions as Israel faces strong criticism over the war in Gaza. 

Itamar Ben-Gvir has frequently visited the contested Jerusalem hilltop compound during the war in Gaza.

Jews revere the site as the Temple Mount, where the biblical temples once stood. It is the holiest site in Judaism. Today, it is home to the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. Tensions at the compound have frequently spilled over into violence over the years. 

It was the latest act of defiance by the 49-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel's most influential politicians.

Here is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:




Since Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Palestinians consider the mosque a national symbol and view visits by Jewish leaders as provocative and as a potential precursor to Israel seizing control over the compound. Most rabbis forbid Jews from praying on the site, but there has been a growing movement in recent years of Jews who support worship there. Ben-Gvir has long called for greater Jewish access to the holy site.

Ben-Gvir was visiting to mark the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples, key events in Jewish history. 

Visits like Ben-Gvir's are legal. Israeli media said the visit was the first time that a sitting minister actively and vocally led prayers. Ben-Gvir also called for Israel to conquer and declare sovereignty over all of the Gaza Strip and encourage “voluntary” migration from Gaza in order to end the war and bring the hostages back. Palestinians say the migration plan is a disguise for forced expulsions.

In response to Ben-Gvir's visit, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the status quo at the site had not changed and would not change to allow Jewish prayer. 

Ben-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. The army banned him from compulsory military service when he was a teen, deeming his views too extreme. 

Ben-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late radical rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's car in 1995.

“We got to his car, and we'll get to him too,” he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.

Two years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O'Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.

The political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.

Ben-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.

With a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.

Ben-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents. In an episode in 2022, he brandished a pistol and encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood. In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country's police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.

As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.

Ben-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party, into power.

“Over the last year I've been on a mission to save Israel,” Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. “Millions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.”

Ben-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure — encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu's contentious attempt to overhaul the country's legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.

Ben-Gvir temporarily resigned from Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet earlier this year to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. 

The ceasefire ran from Jan. 19 to March 1. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remained of their homes, and there was a surge of humanitarian aid.

Ben-Gvir's resignation did not stop the ceasefire, but it did weaken Netanyahu's governing coalition. Ben-Gvir rejoined the cabinet when Israel ended the ceasefire and returned to active combat in Gaza in March 2025. 

Last week, the Netherlands banned Ben-Gvir and far-right Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich from entering the country. Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway imposed financial sanctions on the two men last month.

Israeli forces on Sunday killed at least 27 Palestinians seeking food at different aid distribution sites in Gaza after opening fire on the hungry crowds, according to reports.

The latest casualties amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza come as Palestinians were hit by a severe famine, leading to food shortages in the region. U.N. officials claim Israel deliberately created Gaza's hunger crisis by blocking humanitarian aid to the territory. The Israeli military controls the entry and exit points into the Gaza Strip.

Witnesses described Sunday's events as indiscriminate gunfire.

“I couldn't stop and help them because of the bullets,” said a man named Yousef Abed, who was traveling to a distribution site with crowds of people.

“Troops were trying to prevent people from advancing. They opened fire and we fled. Some people were shot,” said Hamza Matter, a Palestinian eyewitness seeking aid at another location.

Hospital officials also commented on the news, with southern Gaza's Nasser Hospital saying it retrieved multiple bodies from routes near distribution points in Khan Younis and Rafah. It said more were killed by Israeli troops near the Morag Corridor in southern Gaza.

Others were killed near a site close to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, according to the nearby Al Awda Hospital.

The hospitals' figures bring the total casualties to 27 deaths, four more than the initial death count.

The reported gunfire occurred near food sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which took over Gaza aid distribution in May. The organization has faced international criticism over recent outbreaks of deadly violence at its distribution points.

Israel has carried out similar gunfire in recent days, leading to dozens more deaths at these sites.

The Israeli military said its troops have only fired warning shots toward the hungry crowds approaching distribution sites and claimed the casualty figures have been greatly exaggerated.

The death toll figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

TOP TRUMP OFFICIALS WITKOFF AND HUCKABEE VISIT GAZA AID SITES AS HUNGER CRISIS WORSENS

The United States is determining the best course of action for delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza to relieve the suffering. Late last week, the Trump administration sent special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee to the war-torn region to assess the humanitarian crisis for themselves. Witkoff and Huckabee are expected to report back to President Donald Trump and formulate a final plan for food and humanitarian aid.

The pair's visit came days after Trump said the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza to address “real starvation.” Trump's comments contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insisted there was no starvation in Gaza happening at the hands of Israel.

Kamala Harris and Stephen Colbert discuss what they claim is a "broken" political system on "The Late Show."

Former Vice President Kamala Harris is back in the national spotlight with her forthcoming book about her short-lived 2024 White House campaign, and she is generating a buzz about whether she'll try again in 2028.

While politicos are keenly watching Harris for her next moves, she's also being eyed by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., who is investigating whether top Biden administration officials covered up evidence of a mental decline in former President Joe Biden.

Comer all but guaranteed his committee would be contacting Harris during an appearance on "The Ingraham Angle" last week. He joined Fox News Channel just after Harris announced she would not be running for governor of California, as some have speculated, and will instead embark on a listening tour to hear from Americans and try to boost fellow Democrats across the country. 

"I think that that's another great thing about Kamala Harris not running for governor – she's gonna have more time to come before the House Oversight Committee and testify about Joe Biden's cognitive decline," Comer said. "So I think that the odds of Kamala Harris getting a subpoena are very high."

COMER DISMISSES BIDEN DOCTOR'S BID FOR PAUSE IN COVER-UP PROBE: 'THROWING OUT EVERY EXCUSE'

During a recent appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," Harris distanced herself from any immediate electoral ambitions. She emphasized she wanted to hear from all voters, however, not necessarily ruling out a future presidential run.

"I believe, and I always believed, that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that, they're not as strong as they need to be," Harris said.

"And I just don't want to for now, I don't want to go back in the system. I want to, I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people. I want to talk with people. And I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote."

Jonathan Turley, a Fox News contributor and professor at George Washington University Law School, told Fox News Digital the optics of a congressional subpoena would be less than ideal for a potential 2028 candidate.

"This is a tough question for Harris, who clearly has aspirations to run again," Turley said when asked if he would advise Harris to appear. "The committee can compel her to appear. However, the optics of forcing a subpoena are not exactly optimal for someone who wants to run again for this office."

He added, however, that Harris would be a "natural" target for Comer's probe.

"Harris held a unique spot within the inner circle of the White House," Turley said.

But both he and former House Oversight Committee ChairTrey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News Channel host, were doubtful that bringing Harris in would yield much new information.

"Is it worth investigating? Absolutely. Is it worth getting her take on it? Yeah. Is she going to cooperate? No," Gowdy told Fox News Digital. 

The former South Carolina congressman, who also served as a federal prosecutor, predicted that Harris' lawyers would seek to bury any potential appearance in a quagmire of legal proceedings stemming from executive and/or presidential privilege claims.

"That privilege has been invoked by both parties repeatedly during congressional investigations," Gowdy said.

"Leaving the names out of it, just for the sake of an analogy, I can't think of an advisor that would be closer to a president than his or her vice president. So, by the time you're litigating the issue of whether or not you can compel a vice president to talk about conversations that he or she had with a chief of staff, with a spouse, with the president, with the president's physician – you'll be as old as I am by the time that's litigated."

Turley said House investigators would have to be armed with "specific" questions to avoid someone like Harris being able to answer with "a matter of opinion."

Gowdy agreed Harris was a "legitimate" witness to bring in and that the issue of Biden's autopen use, particularly for pardons, "warrants further scrutiny."

He warned, however, that a potent subpoena comes with consequences for noncompliance.

"Prosecutors can send cops and have [people] brought in. Congress can't do that. Judges can send the marshals or the sheriff's deputies out to bring a witness in if the witness is recalcitrant. Congress can't do that," Gowdy said. "So your power is only as good as what you can do to enforce it."

A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on Comer's subpoena threat when reached by Fox News Digital.

Spokespeople for Harris and House Oversight Committee Democrats did not return requests for comment.

Pope Leo XIV remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine who could not join their celebration in his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth on Sunday.

ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV on Sunday told more than a million Catholic youths at a closing Mass for a weeklong encounter with the next generation of faithful that they are “the sign that a different world is possible” where conflicts can be resolved with dialogue, not weapons. 

In his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth, Leo remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine and other countries at war who could not join their celebration. 

“We are closer than ever to young people who suffer the most serious evils, which are caused by other human beings,” Leo said. “We are with the young people of Gaza. We are with the young people of Ukraine, with those of every land bloodied by war.”

“My young brothers and sisters, you are the sign that a different world is possible. A world of fraternity and friendship, where conflicts are not resolved with weapons, but with dialogue.”

The young people camped out in sprawling fields southeast of Rome overnight after attending a vigil service on Saturday, also presided by Leo who has been ferried from Vatican City by helicopter. The special Jubilee celebration is part of the Holy Year that is expected to draw 32 million people to the Vatican for the centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.

The Vatican said more than 1 million young people were present, along with 7,000 priests and 450 bishops.

During the Sunday homily, Leo urged the participants to “spread your enthusiasm and the witness of your faith” when they return home to some 150 countries.




“Aspire to great things, to holiness, wherever you are,” Leo urged the young faithful. “Do not settle for less. You will then see the light of the Gospel growing every day, in you and around you.”

Leo reminded the crowd that their next encounter will be during World Youth Day, set for Aug. 3-8, 2027, in Seoul, South Korea. 

The week has been a joyous gathering marked by bands of youths singing hymns as they move down cobblestoned streets, praying the Rosary in piazzas and standing for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to priests offering the sacrament in a dozen languages.

Leo also shared some tragic news on Saturday: two young people who had made the pilgrimage to Rome had died, one reportedly of cardiac arrest, while a third was hospitalized.

Rain overnight awakened the faithful but didn't dampen their spirits.

“At least we were a little covered, but we still got a bit wet. We lost our voices a little. It was cold, but we woke up to a beautiful sun and view,” said Soemil Rios, 20, from Puerto Rico. “Despite the difficulties, it was very nice and very special to have been part of this historic moment.”

Sister Giulia De Luca, from Rome, acknowledged that “waking up was a bit tough,” but that she was looking forward to seeing the pope again.

“It will be very nice to conclude a very intense week together. Definitely a lot of fun, but also very challenging in many ways,” she said.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asserted his belief that Joe Biden “was not running things” by citing the former president's lack of communication.

Biden's former chief of staff, aides, and White House physician have taken turns testifying to the House Oversight Committee regarding Biden's cognitive acuity. The former president is fighting off allegations that he experienced a cognitive decline during his term, while his witnesses have pleaded the Fifth Amendment during questioning.

According to Cruz, he heard concerns about Biden's abilities long before he left office. Cruz appeared on Fox News's My View with Lara Trump on Saturday to lament that little is still known about Biden's term.

“The single most frequent question I would get: Who's running things? Here's the terrifying answer: I don't really know,” Cruz said. “I can tell you: in four years that Joe Biden was president, you know how many times I spoke with him? Zero. Not once.”

During Biden's term, Democratic senators held the majority in the chamber. Even as two senators left the party to become independents, they often still caucused with the Democrats, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris's tiebreaking vote ensured wins for Biden's party.

“Joe Biden was not running things that I know,” Cruz said. “Who actually was making the decisions? D***ed if I know, and I don't know anybody who else knows either.”

Biden confirmed he used the White House autopen, a machine that allows someone to duplicate the signature of the commander in chief onto a document, due to the large number of clemencies he granted. The former president set a record in presidential pardons, commutations, and clemencies for over 4,200 people.

Former Biden aide Stefanie Feldman was revealed as the manager of the autopen. Feldman has yet to appear before Congress.

BIDEN'S DEFENSE OF AUTOPEN BACKFIRES, SPARKS OUTRAGE

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) suggested he might subpoena Biden, former first lady Jill Biden, and former chief of staff Ron Klain as part of the investigation into the former president's autopenned orders after the committee hears from more aides.

Joe Biden referred to the investigation as “crazy” and claimed all Republican lawmakers who were questioning his cognitive decline were “liars.”

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Thomas Engels is the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration at the US Department of Health and Human Services.



            Organ donation can be a profound last gift of life. I think about the future my grandson will inherit, especially when it comes to something as urgent and deeply personal as organ donation or transplant. If he or someone he loves needs an organ transplant, I want him to know the system is safe, fair and worthy of his trust.
    


            Sadly, our US Department of Health and Human Services investigation of the organ transplant system has revealed everyone's worst nightmare: a systemic disregard for the sanctity of life. We found numerous cases of medical providers starting the organ donation process on living patients. In response, we have threatened to shut down a large organ procurement organization unless it implements our corrective action requirements. We have also imposed strict reporting protocols for the organ transplant system and required that families and hospitals receive clear, complete information about the donation process.
    


            How did the organ transplant system fail to protect some of our most vulnerable Americans? It operated behind closed doors for decades, dominated by a single private contractor. Too many patients waited for answers that never came, and families whose loved ones' organs were pursued while still alive were left with nowhere to turn when such atrocities occurred. Only a sick system prioritizes profit over patients.
    


            That ended thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    


            At the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), we are undertaking a sweeping overhaul of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the entity legally responsible for managing the organ waitlist and allocation nationwide. Our reforms are rooted in two fundamental truths: Patient safety is not optional, and every life is sacred.
    


            For far too long, patients, hospital staff or grieving families were forced to report serious safety concerns and misconduct to the very contractor managing the system. This left families unheard, frustrated or even silenced. That era is over.
    


            Now, under our new reforms, those concerns can come directly to the regulator HRSA. We brought federal oversight into the heart of the process, making it clear there will be no compromise on safety and accountability.
    


            We've also proposed new data requirements for organ procurement organizations (OPOs), requiring full documentation of every step in the donation process, from contact with hospitals to interactions with donor families. These reforms aren't just about performance tracking. They're about restoring safety and dignity to a system that lost sight of both.
    


            And when horrifying failures come to light, like the shocking case in Kentucky in which organ procurement was nearly performed on a patient who showed signs of life, we act immediately. For the first time, HRSA issued a corrective action plan to an OPO, and we will not hesitate to do it again. No American should ever have to wonder whether their life will be treated with reverence at the hospital.
    


A man was wheeled into surgery to harvest his organs. Weeks later, he left the hospital alive



            The systemic failures weren't just operational — they were structural. For nearly 40 years, OPTN was governed by a single private entity: the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We ended a monopoly that suppressed innovation, enabled conflicts of interest and delayed reform.
    


            HRSA conducted a historic national election to establish an independent OPTN Board of Directors. This new board includes transplant surgeons, living donors, organ recipients and advocates, bringing a range of expertise and experience to the forefront of reform.
    


            We are also modernizing the transplant system by expanding the pool of best-in-class vendors to expand the capacity and performance of the system. With bipartisan support, HRSA now has the authority to directly collect OPTN registration fees from transplant hospitals, helping sustain long-term reforms and reduce reliance on any single contractor.
    


            Our work is informed by conversations with transplant surgeons, patients, donor families, advocates and hospital staff. These voices have made one thing abundantly clear: Change cannot wait.
    


            Secretary Kennedy has demanded accountability across HHS, and President Trump has shown unwavering commitment to ending complacency in systems that cost lives. The old system operated behind closed doors. We opened them up.
    


            We are building a system that is ethical, transparent and centered on the sacred sanctity of life. There is more work to do, but we are making progress quickly, just like the rest of the Trump administration. We will not rest until every registered organ donor, patient and family have confidence in our nation's transplant system. Because that's what Americans deserve and what every life demands.

            European countries hoping to mirror Italy's controversial practice of sending some asylum seekers rescued at sea to overseas deportation centers have been dealt a setback by Europe's top court.
    


            On Friday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that while Italy could still utilize the centers it runs in the Albanian cities of Shengiin and Gjader, who can be sent there must be more closely examined to ensure that asylum seekers aren't being sent back to dangerous situations in their home countries.
    


            The court said that a country of origin can only be considered “safe” after it has been “subject to effective judicial review,” and that a country must be demonstrably safe for all its population, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.
    


            The ECJ ruling will almost certainly impact new EU asylum regulations, which are set to take effect next June and are designed to allow member states to create their own “safe” country lists to expedite and outsource the asylum process.
    


            The EU's own list, meant to be a guide, includes Bangladesh, Columbia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia, despite human rights campaigners warning that those countries aren't safe for all who live there.
    


            “The proposed EU list of ‘safe countries of origin' deems certain countries, from which 20% or fewer applicants are granted international protection in the EU, to be safe,” Amnesty International said in a July statement. “However, the fact that up to 20% of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all,” it added.
    


            The ECJ ruling – which was based on two Bangladeshi asylum seekers who were detained in Albania but argued returning to Bangladesh was unsafe – comes as several European countries have expressed interest in developing their own deportation schemes like the Italian-Albanian partnership.
    


            While that partnership, a multi-million-euro investment of detention centers and “return hubs” in a non-EU country, has been viewed by some countries as a potential blueprint for success, a recent study by the University of Bari found that the Italian scheme has, so far, cost the country more than €74.2 million (approximately $86 million).
    


            The study called the scheme “the most costly, inhumane, and useless instrument in the history of Italian migration policies.”
    


            Still, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and then European Council president Charles Michel lauded Italy's 2023 landmark agreement, and in May 2024, the EU established a set of reforms designed to streamline Europe's approach to managing migration and asylum, particularly around migrants from so-called “safe” countries.
    


            Calling it “fair but firm,” the pact lays out wide-ranging reforms designed to ease the burden on countries that have historically taken the most asylum-seekers among the EU's 27 member states.
    


            Whether this ECJ ruling will dissuade the development of the detentions hubs remains to be seen.
    


            Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the court's decision as short sighted, saying that it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and protect national borders.”
    


            “This is a development that should concern everyone – including the political forces rejoicing today over the ruling – because it further reduces the already limited scope for governments and parliaments to regulate and administer migration,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, in Italy's detention centers in Albania, the lives of nearly a dozen people from countries deemed safe, including Egypt and Bangladesh, hang in the balance.

'Outnumbered' discusses President Donald Trump's Supreme Court victory allowing him to massively reduce the size of the Department of Education. 

Three years after leaving a sleepy Seattle suburb to run the school district in Fairfax County, Va., outside the nation's capital, Michelle Reid earns more money than the U.S. president and gets a car allowance. Now she wants a taxpayer-funded personal bodyguard.

In new job posting No. 25212BR on BrassRing, an online recruitment platform, the Fairfax County public schools superintendent is advertising for an "Executive Protection Agent," based at the school district's C-suite headquarters on Gatehouse Road in Falls Church, Va. The deadline for applicants is Aug. 5.

The new job would earn between $84,552 to $143,880, according to the FCPS pay scale for a "Unified Scale-Schedule B/Grade 006" job, paying far more than the starting salary of about $58,000 that a new teacher gets in the school district.

"The Executive Protection Agent is responsible for ensuring the personal safety, security and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences," the job description reads.

The new position comes at a time when public school officials, like Reid, are facing heightened accountability in the post-COVID era over curriculum, contracts, budgets and "diversity, equity and inclusion" policies. In 2021, the Biden administration targeted parents for charges of alleged "domestic terrorism" for raising concerns at school board meetings, but new email records have revealed the allegations were overblown and politicized.

Since taking over on July 1, 2022, Reid has come under fire for allegedly covering up scandals over improprieties in football recruiting, the withholding of National Merit awards from students and, most recently, defying Department of Education orders regarding Title IX protections for girls in sports and schools. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights just announced that Fairfax County Public Schools and four other northern Virginia school districts, including Loudoun County Public Schools, violated TItle IX protections by discriminating against students on the basis of sex.

Last November, the all-Democratic school board voted unanimously to renew Reid's four-year contract and increased her annual salary to $424,146 from $380,000, more than the salary of New York City's education chancellor. Board members also gave her a $12,000 annual car allowance. In contrast, the U.S. president earns $400,000 annually.

Over her tenure, Reid has been notoriously suspect of leaks, which occurred this week with frustrated school district personnel anonymously raising the alarm bell over the new bodyguard position. The job description notes three times that applicants must demonstrate "discretion," noting in one mention that applicants "must demonstrate a high level of discretion and maintain strict confidentiality in all aspects of the role."

The hiring of a personal bodyguard for a school superintendent is unusual, say experts. The 12th-largest school district in the U.S., Fairfax County Public Schools includes 180,714 students in 223 schools, according to the U.S. Education Department's National Center for Education Services. 

Meanwhile, the third-largest school district in the country, Chicago Public Schools, is about double the size as Fairfax County Public Schools, serving 322,809 students in 643 schools, according to the latest data, and its superintendent, also called its chief executive officer, doesn't have a personal bodyguard. 

School district spokeswoman Mary Ann Ferguson said, "Chicago Public Schools does not employ a personal bodyguard position for our superintendent/CEO."

Talk of the new job has angered local parents and school district staffers.

"Queen Reid demands all the luxuries suitable to her station. It's all 'equity for thee, but not for me,'" said Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, a local mother who has challenged Reid on numerous district policies.

"They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent," and that "is not a normal or customary position." - Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services

Unlike a teacher, the new bodyguard job doesn't require a bachelor's degree, but rather any "combination of education and experience equivalent to a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, security management, or a related field."

In the ad, Reid stipulates the job demands "exceptional flexibility," with an "unpredictable" schedule, "driven by the superintendent's daily activities and security needs."

The ad notes: "Must be available for irregular hours, including early mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays, travel, and extended on-call duty."

The job requires "knowledge of protective intelligence, behavioral analysis, and threat mitigation strategies," not to mention "skill in surveillance detection, open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, and incident reporting."

Reid has a few other requirements that frame the job as a clear bodyguard detail: "Ability to remain calm and make sound decisions under pressure, especially in sensitive or high-risk situations." 

Reid seeks an applicant with "experience in threat assessment and protective intelligence, a "focus on conducting investigations and executive protection" and "completion of executive protection training."

Steven Brasley, media outreach specialist in the district's Office of Communications, insisted nothing was out of the ordinary.

"Fairfax County Public Schools has long provided a security presence for the superintendent at public‑facing events, as part of the broader safety framework implemented by the Office of Safety and Security," Brasley said.

The Office of Human Resources, led by William Solomon, and Chief of Safety and Security Brian Lambert, recently "collaborated" on a "new Executive Protection Agent position description," Brasley added.

Brasley said the role "formalizes responsibility for executive protection — including personal security for the superintendent during various activities — while also supporting a wider array of responsibilities within the Office of Safety and Security that support the entire school division."

The school district's official explanation didn't include any reference to specific threats Reid faces.

Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, based in Cleveland, Ohio, said, "They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent," and that "is not a normal or customary position."

He noted, "The job description is one of the shortest I have ever seen for any school security department job," adding the job boils down to a "one-liner," looking for "executive protection" at work, public events, travel and "private residences."

Trump said, "It does not reference other duties which one would expect if, indeed, the job extends to other tasks. There is not even the typical ‘and other duties as assigned' on the posted job description, which could encompass other tasks beyond the executive protection of the superintendent."

Brasley said the new job "is designed to bolster FCPS's work," "identifying, assessing and mitigating risks of targeted violence against students, staff and schools."

There is no mention of "students, staff and schools" in the job description.

Brasley said that protection of the superintendent is "a component" of the role," but the role "participates in larger security and investigative initiatives across the district, such as the ongoing implementation of a new emergency response system and weapons screening."

There is also no mention of a "new emergency response system or weapons screening" in the job posting.

            A driver was killed and a passenger in his car injured after hitting a moose near the entrance to Alaska's Denali National Park and Preserve.
    


            The vehicle's collision with the moose occurred around 1 a.m. Friday, just south of the entrance to the Denali Park Road near Mile 235 of the George Parks Highway, also referred to as the Parks Highway, the park said in a statement.
    


            The 24-year-old male driver, who was from Bulgaria, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 24-year-old female passenger, who is from North Macedonia, was taken to a Fairbanks hospital.
    


            The National Park Service is investigating the incident and working with the Bulgarian Embassy to notify the driver's family.
    


            “The collision serves as a sobering reminder of the hazards of wildlife along Alaska's roadways,” the park said. “Moose, caribou, and other large animals are often active at dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours, and can be difficult to see.”
    


            The park urged drivers to slow down in dark conditions and use high-beam headlights.

Pop singer Justin Timberlake announced that he has been struggling with Lyme disease, bringing attention to a growing public health threat. 

Timberlake, 44, said in an Instagram post Thursday that he was “shocked for sure” by his diagnosis after he had been “battling some health issues” and feeling unwell during his Forget Tomorrow World Tour.

The singer said confirming the diagnosis at least helped him “understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.”

Lyme disease, spread by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common type of tick-borne illness worldwide. U.S. cases have rapidly increased in recent years, mostly in the New England and mid-Atlantic states.

Symptoms usually start within 3 to 30 days of a tick bite, with a rash developing in about 80% of patients. Other early symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes, making it difficult to distinguish from other illnesses.

However, without rapid antibiotic treatment, symptoms can rapidly progress to muscle weakness and paralysis, irregular heartbeats, arthritis and joint pain, and in rare cases, brain swelling or encephalitis.

Awareness of the rising prevalence of Lyme disease has been growing over the past several years, but the number of cases has been steadily increasing in the United States since the 1990s.

In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just shy of 16,500 cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. By 2023, cases had shot up to nearly 89,500 nationwide.

The CDC classifies states along the Eastern Seaboard, from Maine to Virginia, as high-incidence areas. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are also higher-risk states.

In 2023, more than 22,000 individual cases of Lyme disease were identified in New York, followed by more than 16,600 in Pennsylvania and nearly 10,000 in Massachusetts.

Seniors over age 60 are at the highest risk of contracting Lyme disease, followed by children between the ages of 5 and 14.

But it's not just a U.S. problem; cases are rising across Europe as well. A 2019 study estimated that over 1,000,000 people worldwide are affected by Lyme disease each year, with roughly a quarter of cases occurring in Europe.

While greater awareness of the disease among doctors and the general public has contributed somewhat to the rising number of Lyme disease cases, climate change also plays a significant role because it has created conducive conditions for a rising tick population.

A 2024 report from the Environmental Protection Agency found that rising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere have given ticks more habitats and improved breeding conditions.

“Warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitats and are, therefore, one of the multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease,” the EPA said.

Richard Marconi, a tick-borne disease researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, told the Washington Examiner that the tick population has been rising for several decades in North America and Europe because winters are getting milder.

“Specifically, if we're not having truly hard-freeze winters with multiple days of a very hard freeze, the tick population manages to survive pretty well. And as a result, in the spring, when the adult ticks lay eggs, those eggs are able to hatch,” Marconi said.

Marconi said climate change has resulted in trees producing more acorns and nuts, which mice and other small rodents feed on. When there are more rodents, ticks have more hosts, also called reservoirs, to infect and continue spreading the bacteria.

Marconi, who has been studying Lyme disease since the early 1990s, has been on the front lines of developing a human vaccine for the disease. His laboratory and research led to a veterinary vaccine for Lyme disease used to protect dogs called Vanguard CR Lyme.

There is no currently approved vaccine to treat humans with Lyme disease in the U.S., but Pfizer is in the midst of stage 3 clinical trials, the last stage before a drug can come to market.

The Pfizer product is a four-dose vaccine: three shots in the first year and then a fourth 14 months after the original dose.

The VCU team is working on a competing vaccine that will provide effective immunity without as many booster shots. However, development has been challenging because of the unique microbiology of the Lyme disease-causing bacteria.

Marconi predicted that Pfizer's Lyme disease vaccine will likely be on the market by 2027, but he said he's concerned that the vaccine skepticism of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others in the Trump administration could delay vaccine development.

“Vaccines are the most cost-effective way to deal with infectious diseases,” said Marconi, adding, “It's really a really unfortunate situation that there is this anti-vaccination movement occurring both in the government as well as in the public.”

Timberlake wrote in his Instagram announcement that we need “to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.” 

The pop singer had to make several cancellations or postponements during his tour, each time citing injury or illness. Timberlake postponed a show in New Jersey by one week and canceled two performances in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Columbus, Ohio.

Hosts of other celebrities disclosed Lyme disease diagnoses in recent years, including Ben Stiller, Shania Twain, Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, and Amy Schumer.

Marconi said celebrities bringing attention to the disease is good, but the most important thing is to be informed about whether you live in a high-risk area.

“Until vaccination is firmly in place, it's really important for people to be aware of the risks that are around them,” he said.

Once you know if you live in a high-risk area, you can take several steps to prevent tick bites and take action quickly if they occur.

Experts recommend so-called “tick checks,” which involve thoroughly examining your body after spending time outside.

“It's important that if one gets bitten by a tick, they remove it promptly,” Marconi said. “I also suggest saving the tick because there are many places that will identify the tick for you and tell you whether it's even the right type of tick that can transmit Lyme disease.”

The Food and Drug Administration recommends wearing light-colored clothing with long pants and sleeves. The agency also says to “tuck pant legs into socks and shoes, and tuck shirts into pants.”

It is possible to treat clothing and outdoor equipment with insect repellent containing 0.5% permethrin, but cat owners should avoid these products because the chemical is toxic to felines.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) mocked President Donald Trump after he held up most of the president's remaining nominees for at least another month.

Senators remained in Washington, D.C., over the weekend as Republicans looked to confirm the rest of Trump's civilian nominees. Democrats sought to delay the confirmations, with Schumer asking for funding withheld from the White House in exchange for the fast-tracking of the nominations. After Trump signaled that was a nonstarter and accused Schumer of “political extortion,” senators departed the capital for their August recess without a deal and with only a few more nominees confirmed.

Now, Schumer is seemingly taking a victory lap after blocking the nominees' confirmation and stoking Trump's ire, reposting Trump's Truth Social post that deplored his tactics with the caption “The Art of the Deal,” referencing the president's 1987 book of the same name.

In a separate post, Schumer laid out his justification for blocking the nominees, who he claimed were “historically unqualified.”

“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn't let him,” the top Senate Democrat said.

Senate Republicans sought to counter that claim on Saturday, with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) arguing the nominees were “noncontroversial” and accusing the Democrats of playing “partisan games.” Others posted a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term, which they said is “unprecedented.”

That statistic is set to remain unchanged until at least early September, when the Senate is back in session. Republican senators will reportedly eye rules changes then to cut down the time needed to confirm Trump's picks.

Senate Republicans managed to push through a few more nominees before departing, most notably Jeanine Pirro as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

But Schumer is celebrating his resistance against Trump, taunting the president by saying he “threw in the towel, sent Republicans home and was unable to do the basic art of negotiating.”

“He caved and got nothing,” Schumer added.

Schumer's resistance follows him previously caving on a separate battle with Republicans back in March over a potential government shutdown. After he helped advance a House-passed stopgap measure to fund the government, Schumer faced intense backlash from within his own party, leading to primary threats and calls for new leadership.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the Senate's progress on confirming President Donald Trump's nominees after the delay of August recess.

Hours of tense negotiations to strike a deal on President Donald Trump's nominees blew up Saturday night, and now lawmakers are headed home.

Senate Republicans and Democrats were quick to point the finger at one another for the deal's demise, but it was ultimately Trump who nuked the talks.

In a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of "demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees."

"This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name," Trump said. "Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!"

"Do not accept the offer," he continued. "Go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!"

Instead of finding a pathway to vote on as many as 60 of the president's nominees, all of which moved through committee with bipartisan support, lawmakers rapid-fire voted on seven before leaving Washington until September.

But Schumer treated Trump's move as a victory for Senate Democrats. He countered that it was the president who gave up on negotiations while he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., worked to find a bipartisan solution, "provided the White House and Senate Republicans met our demands."

"He took his ball, he went home, leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering what the hell happened," Schumer said, standing next to a poster-sized version of the president's post. 

"Trump's all-caps Tweet said it all," he continued. "In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating."

But prior to the president's edict, both sides of the aisle believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough to both meet Trump's desire to see his nominees confirmed and leave Washington.

Thune said that there were "lots of offers" made between him and Schumer over the course of negotiations.

"There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end," he said.

Senate Democrats wanted the White House to unfreeze billions in National Institute of Health and foreign aid funding, in addition to a future agreement that no more clawback packages would come from the White House.

In exchange, they would greenlight several of Trump's non-controversial nominees.

RECESS ON ICE AS REPUBLICANS HUNKER DOWN FOR HIGH-STAKES NOMINEE BLITZ

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., accused Schumer of going "too far" by upping the price tag on his demands.

"We've had three different deals since last night," he said. "And every time it's been, every time it's ‘I want more,'" Mullin said of Schumer's demands.

He said that Republicans weren't caught off guard by Trump's call to halt talks, and noted that the White House had been heavily involved in negotiations.

"You get to a realization that there was, it was never about making a deal," he continued. "They want to go out and say the President's being unrealistic, and because he can't answer to his base to make a deal like we have in every other president in history."

Now, Republicans won't pursue recess appointments, but Mullin noted that moving ahead with a rule change to the confirmation process when lawmakers return in September was going to happen in response.

"The asks evolved on both sides quite a bit over time," Thune said. "But in the end, we never got to a place where we had both sides agree to lock it in."

Senate Democrats, on the other hand, countered that their offer never changed, and that Republicans kept increasing the number of nominees they wanted across the line, and attempted to include more controversial, partisan picks.

Schumer wouldn't reveal the details of his demands, but charged that any changes to Senate rules would be a "huge mistake," and urged Trump to work with Senate Democrats moving forward, particularly as Congress hurtles toward yet another deadline to fund the government in September. 

"They should stop listening to him," Schumer said. "If they want to do what's good for the American people, they shouldn't be in blind obeisance to Donald Trump."

President Donald Trump directed his ire at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Saturday as Democrats continue to delay the confirmation of the president's remaining civilian nominees.

Senators have remained in Washington, D.C., over the weekend in order to confirm the rest of Trump's nominees, foregoing part of an August recess to get them over the line. As progress has reportedly not been made on a deal to fast-track the nominations, Trump, who is in New Jersey for the rest of the day, took to Truth Social to call out Schumer for an “egregious and unprecedented” demand that the White House release funding in exchange for the swift confirmations, going so far as to accuse him of “political extortion.”

“Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country. This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,” Trump posted.

The president urged Senate Republicans to reject any deal that involves releasing that funding, telling Schumer to “GO TO HELL!”

“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump added.

Trump's post follows frustration from Senate Republicans over Schumer's blockade, which they have called “unprecedented” and a “national embarrassment.”

TRUMP'S PRESSURE TO EASE NOMINEE BACKLOG FORCES SENATE INTO RARE WEEKEND SESSION

Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Katie Britt (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and others all took to X to blast Schumer's tactics, with some sharing a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term.

Schumer has claimed that the nominees are “flawed,” “compromised,” and “unqualified” and deserve more scrutiny in his justification for delaying the confirmation proceedings.

Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. 

The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented.

At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. 

“Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.”

Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.

Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying:

The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.

The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit.

An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions.

Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off.

But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling.

Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB's final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash.

“I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. 

Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.

“The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army's utility helicopters.

Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan's secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights.

Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.

Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA's air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation.

On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.

The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane's pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late.

An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.”

Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns.

The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, 

NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.

“What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.'”

If you're looking for a city that offers a robust job market and promising income growth, don't overlook mid-sized metro areas like Nashville or Omaha.

Both are in the top 10 U.S. cities for earnings and employment, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.

Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the 100 largest U.S. cities based on employment opportunity and earning potential.

Checkr calculated the employment opportunity score for each city based on unemployment rate, labor force growth, labor force size and percentage of jobs open. To calculate the earning potential score, they analyzed each city's real per capita personal income, 10-year income growth and the percentage of households earning more than $200,000.

Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr, says that mid-sized cities were "the big winners" based on their study, challenging the "standard big city domination" of jobs and wages.

"The geography of opportunity is shifting," he says. "If you're earning a good wage in a mid-sized city like Madison or Des Moines or Raleigh, your money might go further — even if you're earning less."

Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential.

Raleigh is part of North Carolina's "Research Triangle," a tech and science hub that encompasses North Carolina State University, Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

"The Research Triangle opens up a ton of opportunities in health care and education, so it's always going to be popular for jobs there," Radbil says.

Job growth has been "huge" in both Nashville and Austin, Radbil says.

Beyond the city's country music fame, Nashville is now known for its strong health-care, education and logistics sectors.

Due to the influx of tech companies, Austin offers plenty of high-paying jobs, according to Radbil. However, the city's growing cost of living can quickly eat into those salaries.

"The quality of life is great, but it's super expensive to live and to rent and to buy a home," he says.

Salt Lake City has been steadily growing in both "popularity and population," Radbil says.

The city has gained traction as a hub for tech and finance, resulting in a thriving job market.

"When it comes to Portland, Maine, affordability is huge," Radbil says. The city is becoming popular with remote workers, who enjoy its relatively low rent and housing costs.

Wages and job opportunities are both steadily increasing in Denver, and despite rising housing costs, Radbil says it's still not a "terribly expensive place" to live.

According to Radbil, Omaha has seen an influx of businesses moving to the city, which boosted its job market and wages. Still, the city remains "very, very affordable" in terms of living costs, he says.

Charlotte's labor force has grown by upwards of 10% in the last 5 years, Radbil says.

"There's a lot of financial business in Charlotte, which continues to draw people to that area as well," he says.

Charleston boasts a growing job market in the finance, health-care and tech industries.

It also offers promising pay: according to Radbil, the percentage of people making over $200,000 in Charleston is on the rise.

Indianapolis may not be as glamorous as a coastal city, but it offers a stable job market and reasonable cost of living, Radbil says.

"The Midwest provides a good business climate and good earning potential," he says.

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry has been the highest-paid NBA player for the past eight years. Next season, he's set to earn his biggest salary yet: $59.6 million, according to ESPN.

Curry also earns an estimated $100 million annually from endorsement deals with various companies, Forbes reports, including from his partnership with Under Armour, where he is president of the Curry Brand.

But when Curry was recently asked to confirm his current net worth during an episode of the 360 With Speedy podcast with host Speedy Morman, the 37-year-old point guard said he doesn't actually know, and doesn't care to find out.

"[Net worth] is not something I really worry about too much. I have somebody that takes care of that for me," Curry said.

Instead, "the idea of what I have going on is about creating a portfolio of stuff that is aspirational in terms of wealth," Curry said. "You want to have something you look back on and are proud of, knowing we've been blessed with so many opportunities and so many resources and so many relationships." 

Curry's focus on financial goals beyond his net worth is a "breath of fresh air," says Ben Smith, a certified financial planner and founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Too many people feel pressured to fixate on building the highest net worth possible, Smith says, and it's refreshing that Curry prioritizes "pursuing what he's great at" and making investments he's proud of along the way. That strategy will serve him better long-term because it will keep "the engine" of his financial health going for longer.

Curry's position is undeniably unique. As a high-earning athlete, he can afford to delegate his money management to professionals without worrying about his financial foundation eroding anytime soon.

Still, you don't need to earn millions to benefit from setting financial goals that don't revolve around your net worth, Smith says. In fact, obsessing over that number may hold you back from achieving financial milestones that might feel more rewarding, like finally taking a long-awaited family vacation or paying off your car loan early, he adds.

Here's what really deserves your attention if you want to feel in control of your money, and, better yet, learn how to manage it well, according to financial pros.

While net worth can be "a useful barometer" for understanding your finances, cash flow is a much more powerful indicator of your overall financial health, Smith says.

Rather than constantly poring over your assets and liabilities, focus on what you can track day-to-day: how much you're earning, how much you're spending on fixed expenses and discretionary purchases and what's left over. That basic awareness of what's coming in and going out will enable you to form a financial plan that's more action-oriented than just trying to accumulate wealth, Smith says.

Once you've got a handle on your cash flow, you can start targeting tangible personal goals, like building an emergency fund or paying off student loans, he says. Everyone should aim to make financial decisions that bring them pride, he says, and those measurable accomplishments are usually easier to celebrate than hitting a net worth goal.

Those who focus too much on their overall wealth often feel like they never have enough, Joy Slabaugh, a certified financial planner, licensed therapist and founder of Wealth Alignment Institute, previously told CNBC Make It.

No matter how large a client's net worth actually is, the desired amount is nearly always the same, she says: "a little more than what they actually have."

Instead of focusing on net worth alone, Slabaugh encourages her clients to reflect on how their financial decisions align with their personal values and long-term vision.

"[Net worth is] just one metric — and often a misleading one. I've seen clients fixated on their net worth while completely disconnected from their financial reality," Slabaugh said. "Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy."

Once you start using your money intentionally, covering essential expenses, savings, investments and even some joy, you've already won half the battle, she said. The rest is about making sure your money supports a life you actually want to live, and you aren't merely striving toward a financial mark that you will only increase with time.

In this article

This earnings season, a number of companies are demonstrating their resilience by delivering solid performance despite macro challenges and tariff uncertainties.

With their in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick stocks that can navigate short-term pressures with solid execution and focus on delivering attractive returns.  

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Database management software company MongoDB (MDB) is this week's first pick. In June, the company delivered solid results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026.

Recently, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman initiated coverage of MongoDB stock with a buy rating and a price target of $280. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on MDB stock with a price forecast of $263.

Bachman said that, according to Gartner, the database market is among the largest software markets at over $100 billion in annual spend, and MongoDB is a leader in the non-relational database segment. Notably, this segment accounts for about 25% of the overall market and is growing by about 20% year over year.

The 5-star analyst noted that feedback from Value Added Resellers (VARs) and users indicates that developers have a very positive view of MongoDB, a platform that is well-suited for customers with multi-cloud deployments. Bachman believes that MongoDB can be one of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) database winners.

"We think MDB is currently focused on improving its vector search capabilities to help win new workloads, including through M&A," noted the analyst. Also, Bachman expects MongoDB's cloud-based database offering, Atlas, to sustain low- to mid-20% growth through fiscal 2027. He expects MongoDB to deliver mid- to high-teens growth in fiscal 2027, while gradually enhancing profitability.

Bachman ranks No. 531 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%. See MongoDB Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

We move to ServiceNow (NOW), an AI-powered platform for business transformation. The company posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook, backed by increasing AI adoption.

Reacting to the Q2 print, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a buy rating on ServiceNow stock and raised the price forecast to $1,200 from $1,150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on NOW stock with a price target of $1,129.

Wood noted the impressive 21.5% growth (at constant currency) in ServiceNow's current remaining performing obligations, delivering a 200 basis-point beat. The top-rated analyst explained that this strong growth was driven by early renewals and AI strength in the enterprise business, which offset tougher federal spending conditions.

The analyst also highlighted that the company's generative AI suite, NOW Assist, delivered better-than-expected net new annual contract value, driven by higher deal volumes and increased deal sizes.

"We continue to view NOW as the best positioned SaaS [software as a service] vendor to monetize GenAI, and we expect momentum to keep building in 2H," said Wood. Overall, the analyst is very encouraged by the robust key performance indicators, with ServiceNow's new AI and data products and strength in the enterprise business offsetting headwinds resulting from tightening federal spending.

Wood ranks No. 352 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.3%. See ServiceNow Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at cloud-native and AI-powered data security company Varonis Systems (VRNS). On July 29, the company reported solid results for the second quarter of 2025, driven by continued momentum in its business.

Impressed by the performance, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised his price target for VRNS stock to $63 from $58 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a "neutral" rating on VRNS stock with a price target of $54.

Kothari highlighted that Varonis delivered a "clean beat/raise" across key metrics like annual recurring revenue (ARR), subscription revenue and free cash flow. The 5-star analyst added that Q2 conversion ARR was better-than-expected and aligned with strong checks and his preview.

Additionally, the analyst noted that the company again raised its full-year ARR guidance, which reflects improving upsell and net-new business opportunities. "GenAI, Copilot integrations, and MDDR [Managed Data Detection and Response] tailwinds are driving growing customer appetite for the full platform,"  said Kothari.

The analyst pointed out that SaaS ARR represented about 69% of overall Q2 ARR, up from 61% in the first quarter, with the company on track to complete its SaaS transition by the end of 2025. He added that Varonis now expects to exit 2025 with an 82% SaaS ARR mix compared to its previous estimate of 80%, backed by solid, broad-based demand from both new and existing customers.

Kothari ranks No. 85 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 73% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.7%. See Varonis Systems Statistics on TipRanks.

Artificial intelligence can lead to surprises in all sorts of places where a bill once would have been considered settled. 

The use of AI by Hertz (and European car rental company Sixt) to scan for damage on cars, which is then charged to the customer, is a new application of the technology that is creeping into consumer life unnoticed. But it won't be the last unexpected adjustment to the travel experience courtesy of AI.

Experts say consumers should expect to see businesses across the service industry deploying similar technology in the future, if they aren't already.

"As businesses seek to automate loss prevention and operational efficiency, we're witnessing the emergence of what I call 'algorithmic auditing' – the systematic deployment of AI to identify, classify, and monetize previously overlooked inefficiencies or losses," said Shannon McKeen, professor of the practice and executive director for the Center for Analytics Impact at Wake Forest University School of Business. The Hertz program, recently reported on by the New York Times, is the beginning of what McKeen describes as a broader transformation, and new fault line, in the service economy. 

"The implementation of these systems reveals a fundamental tension between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction and equity," McKeen said. The question isn't simply whether AI can detect a scratch on a rental car bumper. "It's whether businesses should charge customers for every microscopic imperfection that algorithms can identify but human judgment might reasonably overlook as normal wear and tear," he said.

McKeen says the dialogue between service agent and customer over costs will increasingly include a new term: "the machine says."

Hotels are working their way through these changes, according to Jordan Hollander, cofounder of Hoteltechreport.com, a research platform that helps hotels find new digital and AI products to improve efficiency.

"I've been seeing more hotels experiment with AI across operations, but not quite in the same way Hertz is using it for automated damage detection and billing. That said, we're not far off," Hollander said.

Some hotels, for instance, are already using AI-powered sensors to monitor air quality and trigger fines for smoking or vaping in rooms. But Hollander warns that sometimes the sensors trigger false positives.

"Like someone using a hairdryer or aerosol spray — and guests get hit with $500 charges without ever lighting up. It's not hard to imagine how that could go south quickly," Hollander said.

But unlike the car rental example, most hotels haven't automated the billing step yet.

"They're using AI more to flag potential issues — like a room that smells off, linens that don't meet standards, or maintenance problems — and then looping in a human for the final call," Hollander said. For now, the AI is acting more like a very observant assistant than a judge and jury.

"But it's clear that hotels are heading in the same direction," he said. "Between computer vision that can detect damage or wear in a room, and AI that analyzes guest behavior or room conditions in real time, the tech is already there." 

In a hospitality industry where trust is everything, there are reasons for hotels to move with caution. To date, many hotel operators are using AI to improve things like housekeeping efficiency, energy usage, and guest messaging — but they're being cautious about when and how it impacts the guest directly in a way that can be perceived to hurt the experience.  

"There's a risk of backlash if hotels start billing guests based solely on what an algorithm says. The moment a guest gets a charge and can't get a straight answer about why or how it was verified, you're in dangerous territory," Hollander said. "If guests feel like they're being watched or nickel-and-dimed by a machine, it undermines the relationship completely," he added. 

Recent experience in the hotel industry provides at least one cautionary tale, according to Hollander, referring to a custom-modified Alexa for hotels. "Years ago, the hot thing was voice devices, and that never really took off for this reason," he said.

A Hertz spokeswoman told CNBC that AI brings uniformity and consistency to the checkout process.

"For years, vehicle damage inspections have caused confusion and frustration. The process was manual, subjective, and inconsistent, and that isn't good enough for our customers or our business," she said.

She added that with digital vehicle inspections, Hertz is introducing "much-needed precision, objectivity, and transparency to the process – giving our customers greater confidence that they won't be charged for damage that didn't occur during their rental, and a more efficient resolution process when damage does occur."

Of the 500,000 rentals scanned so far, more than 97% showed no billable damage, according to Hertz, and damage incidents are declining at scanner-equipped locations.  

The Hertz spokeswoman acknowledged that the new system is still a work in progress.

"We know change of this scale takes time, and we're listening, learning, and improving every day. As we said from the start, our goal through this initiative is to enhance the safety, quality, and reliability of our fleet and to create a more consistent rental experience for our customers." 

AI excels at pattern recognition, but where it may fall short is with the nuanced decision-making that has historically characterized good customer service, according to McKeen.

"What makes these systems particularly problematic is the erosion of contextual judgment," McKeen said. Traditionally, business relationships relied on human discretion to navigate gray areas like "when does a scuffed tire represent normal use versus chargeable damage? When does a hearty portion in a restaurant satisfy a hungry customer versus being wasteful?"

Other companies will be watching Hertz closely to see how the AI experiment works out, he said, and then jump right in on the profit opportunity if it is determined that use of the technology won't drive customers away.

The use of AI for cost recouping isn't widespread yet because companies have not figured out the balance between customer trust and implementing AI, and the benefit, so far, doesn't outweigh the potential loss in loyalty, said Chuck Reynolds, managing director at L.E.K Consulting and a member of the firm's digital practice.

The key for companies to implement these cost recouping tools is transparency. "While the opportunity for AI is huge, organizations need to be thoughtful about embedding it as a copilot, not police or enforcer," Reynolds said. Sustomers will accept AI as part of the experience, he added, if companies are fair, visible, and design the AI experience with empathy. 

"AI has to have customer-centricity built into its core," Reynolds said, and companies have to keep a role for humans in the process to oversee and override the AI if necessary. "Organizations that do so without thinking through the entire process will have challenges with internal adoption and customer adoption," Reynolds said.

Customers should expect to see more of the technology Hertz is deploying in different settings, according to David Rivera, professor of hospitality and tourism at Flagler College. In addition to hotels, the future could include restaurants using AI to itemize plates to ensure accurate billing. But Rivera says all of this is being done with the goal of operational efficiency rather than to punish the customer. Use of AI in hospitality is evolving from passive data collection to active use of real-time decision-making tools, Rivera said, and that includes things like monitoring your rental car or how much you are raiding the mini-bar in your hotel room.

"The common thread is increased operational efficiency, enhanced guest satisfaction, and automation of traditionally manual tasks, with a layer of accountability and transparency for both guest and provider," Rivera said.

Not everyone is on board with that view, however.

"This trend is absolute overkill with AI solution capabilities," said Daniel Keller, CEO of cloud infrastructure company Influx Technologies, which provides data collection and data analysis tools. "This particular use of AI doesn't increase efficiency; it scrutinizes customers of small-margin service businesses looking to suck extra money out of guest experiences."

Mark Zuckerberg may be the most famous college-dropout-turned-tech-billionaire. Dylan Field is the latest, after his design startup Figma soared in its stock market debut this week.

The two entrepreneurs have something else in common: close ties to Peter Thiel.

Zuckerberg got his first outside check for Facebook from Thiel in 2004, soon before leaving Harvard University to build his social network in Silicon Valley. Facebook went public in 2012, the same year that Field scored a Thiel Fellowship, which gives money "to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom." Over 300 people have been selected since its inception in 2011.

Field, now 33, was part of the second batch of Thiel fellows, a group of 20 entrepreneurs who each took home $100,000. The program doubled that sum earlier this year. Like Zuckerberg, Field came to Thiel from the Ivy League, having spent two and a half years at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

On Thursday, Figma's stock price more than tripled in its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It rose again on Friday, wrapping up the week with a fully diluted market cap above $71 billion. Field's stake is worth about $6.6 billion. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, is now the world's third-richest person, with a net worth of over $260 billion. 

While the contours of Field's story may sound familiar, he's a very different kind of character.

"Dylan is, by far, the most humble billionaire I've ever met," said Joshua Browder, CEO of legal services startup DoNotPay and a former Thiel fellow.

Mike Gibson, who used to help run the fellows program as vice president for grants at the nonprofit Thiel Foundation, contrasts Field with another tech luminary.

"He's kind of like the anti-Steve Jobs," said Gibson, a co-founder of 1517 Fund, a venture firm that prides itself on investing in dropouts. "When it comes to Jobs' legend as this hard-charging a--hole, Dylan is the opposite."

The Apple co-founder, who dropped out of college after one semester, died of cancer in 2011, as his company was on its way to becoming the most valuable business in the world.

Field was poised to officially enter the billionaire ranks almost three years ago. With Figma having emerged as a leader in web-based tools for designing apps and websites, Adobe agreed to snap up its budding rival for $20 billion. But regulators in the U.K. said the tie-up would've hurt competition, and the companies scrapped the transaction in late 2023. Adobe payed Figma a $1 billion breakup fee.

Figma's IPO this week represented not only a massive valuation markup for the company but also served as a banner event for Silicon Valley, which has seen a dearth of high-profile IPOs since the market cratered in early 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

"The most important thing to remind myself of, the team of, is share price is a moment in time," Field told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Thursday. "We're going to see all sorts of behavior probably today, over the weeks ahead."

Figma declined to make Field available for an interview for this story.

Field's trek back to the Bay Area, where he'd grown up, began with a TechCrunch article about the fellowship. He submitted his application two hours before the deadline, on New Year's Eve of 2011, while he was a junior at Brown. He left out his SAT scores.

"It is my belief that the SAT is a poor reflection of aptitude and can easily be gamed," he wrote in his application, which he posted on LinkedIn years later. In the essay section, he was asked to offer a highly controversial take.

"Chocolate is repulsive," he wrote. "Even the smell of it makes me want to vomit." 

In response to a question about how he was going to change the world, Field said he was going to build better software for drones, and that he would "cofound a company with the smartest programmer I know and work on this problem."

That co-founder was Evan Wallace, who had been a teaching assistant for some of Field's courses at Brown. Wallace was technologically gifted, earning the nickname "computer Jesus," or CJ. But he was already 20, meaning he was too old to be eligible for a Thiel Fellowship.

Field scored the $100,000 from Thiel, and shared it with Wallace, convincing him to leave his academic pursuits. The pair moved into a small apartment in Palo Alto, California.

The drone software plan had gone out the window. Wallace wanted to develop something related to WebGL, a graphics rendering system for web browsers. A year later, they were showing investors a slick browser-based demo that allowed for the movement of a ball in a pool of water.

The obvious competitive target was Adobe, which was ending development of Fireworks, an app design product that it acquired with the 2005 Macromedia purchase.

"We thought, 'Wait, maybe there's an opportunity here,'" Field said on a podcast earlier this year.

"What we're trying to do is make it so that anyone can be creative, by creating free, simple creative tools in the browser," Field said in a 2012 interview for a CNBC special on the Thiel Fellowship.

In 2013, the founders started talking with investors about raising a seed round. Field showed the pool water demo to John Lilly of Greylock Partners at a Starbucks in Palo Alto. Lilly had previously been CEO of Mozilla, where an engineer developed software that led to WebGL. He was impressed with what he was seeing, but he didn't think it had much economic potential.

Figma took on seed funding from Index Ventures and other investors. The founders assembled a small group of employees at an office in Palo Alto. Progress was slow. Early versions of the product failed to impress potential users. Field was micromanaging.

When Figma would show the product to companies in the Bay Area, reception wasn't always great. Stress was building. Lilly, who ended up leading Figma's Series A round in 2014, came to the company's San Francisco headquarters the following August as struggles were mounting. Employees wanted changes.

"We both heard it," said Danny Rimer, the Index partner who led the seed funding, referring to conversations he and Lilly were having with staffers about Field.

"We sat down with him and explained to him the situation," Rimer said. "We heard it and we sort of said, 'Look, this is an impasse. You're going to have to adapt and change.' And he heard it and he changed. I think that's such a great character trait of Dylan, is to hear the information, be objective about it, process it and accept it and act accordingly, if it makes sense."

Around that time, Sho Kuwamoto joined the company. Kuwamoto brought with him experience from Macromedia and Adobe. Four months later, Figma launched its debut product in a free preview.

Field got involved with users. He replied to people on social media who were posting about Figma, telling them they were receiving access to the preview. He also sought out prominent designers.

Companies like Coda and Uber became early adopters. Some designers were excited by the idea of sharing documents by copying and pasting a URL, instead of having to deal with versions, formats and updates. Figma operated in the cloud, providing all the necessary computing infrastructure, so users didn't need their own powerful graphics cards.

It wasn't until September 2016 that Figma made the design editor available for free to the general public and made it possible for multiple designers to make changes in a single file simultaneously. That became the killer feature.

The software started gaining traction inside Microsoft. But there was an issue. Microsoft feared that Figma's lack of a clear business model might lead to a burial in the startup graveyard. Jon Friedman, a design executive at the software giant, visited Figma's headquarters to deliver the message, Field told CNBC in 2022.

"Look, we're all worried you're going to die as a company," Field recalled Friedman telling him.

The following year, Figma introduced its first paid tier.

By the time venture stalwart Sequoia Capital came on board in 2019, Figma was a hot commodity, raising its Series C round at a $440 million valuation. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed said some of his firm's portfolio companies had started migrating to Figma, and founders were using it for pitch decks.

"Companies often will show prototypes in board meetings of new products they want to build, and so the first thing we saw a lot of Figma links for was that," Reed said in an interview this week.

"It was a very easy investment," Reed said. "We went through some of our old investment voting data. I think Figma might have been the highest vote we ever had for an investment."

Sequoia's extensive roster of winners over the decades includes Apple, Google, LinkedIn, Zoom and WhatsApp.

Financial analysts covering Adobe started asking about Figma. Adobe, which had released the XD app for user experience design, responded, adding the startup to its official list of competitors.

But Adobe's market capitalization sat above $170 billion, and Figma wasn't even a "unicorn," a status reserved for startups worth at least $1 billion. Field told Forbes that some job candidates were hesitant to join because of the modest valuation. In 2020, the company raised a funding round from Andreessen Horowitz at a $2 billion valuation.

Then came Covid. Offices closed. The world went remote overnight. Figma's collaboration capability suddenly became critical to the way many more people worked.

"We asked ourselves: how can we help teams connect, have fun and enter a flow state during the earliest stages of the design process?" Field later wrote on Twitter.

The result was FigJam, a digital whiteboard that became Figma's second product, and represented a key step toward diversification.

The Adobe noise continued to get louder. In 2020, Field had discussions with Adobe executive Scott Belsky about a partnership or acquisition, but Field chose to stay the course. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen talked to Field about a possible deal in early 2021, but again the Figma CEO demurred, opting to raise a round at a $10 billion valuation.

"Our goal is to be Figma not Adobe," Field wrote in a 2021 tweet.

The environment quickly changed. By early 2022, with the Fed lifting interest rates to fight inflation, investors were selling out of high-growth tech and rotating into businesses with predictable profits. Sequoia was encouraging its startups to reduce costs.

Belsky again approached Field in April of that year, this time alongside David Wadhwani, who was leading Adobe's digital media business.

"Mr. Field expressed openness to understanding the terms of a potential acquisition of Figma by Adobe, and Mr. Field, Mr. Belsky and Mr. Wadhwani continued their discussion of the potential benefits of a combination the following week," Adobe stated in a regulatory filing.

Field was considering the implications of the rise of artificial intelligence.

"Look, when we did the deal with Adobe in the first place, my head space in 2022 was, "Oh my god, AI is coming. This is clearly exponential as a technology. I don't know what this does to us. Is this one-tenth our market, is it 10x our market? What does it mean for creatives and designers?" Field said in an interview with The Verge last year. "And I was like, it's better to team up in this world with Adobe and to navigate this together and to figure this out together than it is to go it alone."

In September 2022, Adobe agreed to buy Figma for about $20 billion, announcing that Field would remain in charge of his part of the business and would report to Wadhwani.

"Adobe has a unique opportunity to usher in a world of collaborative creativity," Narayen told analysts on a conference call the day of the agreement. "In my conversations with Dylan at Figma, it became abundantly clear that together we could accelerate this new vision, delivering great value to our customers and shareholders."

That opportunity never came. An intensifying regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe had made sizable tech deals more burdensome. Adobe was suddenly in the crosshairs, and the transaction was hitting repeated hurdles.

"We're worried this deal could stifle innovation and lead to higher costs for companies that rely on Figma and Adobe's digital tools — as they cease to compete to provide customers with new and better products," Sorcha O'Carroll, an official at the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, said in a press release in mid-2023.

Around that time, Field announced another step toward product diversification by introducing Dev Mode, which turns Figma designs into source code that can serve as a starting point for software developers. The reveal came at Figma's Config user conference in San Francisco, which attracted 8,000 attendees.

The U.K.'s investigation dragged on for months. Field was pulling double duty running the company and engaging with regulators. Adobe had said it expected to complete the deal in 2023, but time was running out. Regulators were proposing remedies that the parties didn't like.

"Even toward the final months, there were these moments of, 'Oh, this is going to go through,' and moments of, 'F---, what are we doing?'" Field told The Verge. "And obviously at the end, there's a mutual understanding of,' This decision has been made for us and let's call it.'"

On a Sunday in December 2023, Field gathered board members for a 10-minute call, informing them that the deal was off. The official statement followed early on Monday morning.

"It's frustrating and sad that we're not able to complete this," Field told The New York Times.

Not everyone in Field's orbit saw it that way. Grammarly CEO Shishir Mehrotra, a friend of Field's and longtime Figma user, said the whole ordeal was having an impact.

"You could see it in his face," Mehrotra said of Field, adding that he was relieved when he learned Figma would remain independent. "He was getting older right in front of us."

But Figma had some business concerns. Its net dollar retention rate, a measurement of the company's ability to sell more to existing customers, slid from 159% in the first quarter of 2023 to 122% by the end of the year, according to Figma's IPO prospectus. Figma chalked it up to a tough comparison from the year before, thanks to the launch of FigJam, and economic uncertainty that caused some clients to reduce seat counts. The retention rate bounced back to 132% in the first quarter of 2025.

During the 2023 winter holidays, Field considered ways to rally the workforce. After the new year, he announced internally that Figma would give extra equity to employees who joined or received promotions following the acquisition announcement, because the valuation was going back down to $10 billion. He said any employees who wished to leave would get three months of severance, with no hard feelings.

Fewer than 5% of staffers took him up on the offer.

As Figma pursues a go-it-alone strategy, it faces an existential question: Is the company ready for a future dominated by AI?

In May, Field took the stage at Figma's user conference before 8,500 attendees at San Francisco's Moscone Center, wearing a black "Config 2025" T-shirt. He walked the crowd through a slew of new products, including Figma Make, which draws on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a large language model from AI startup Anthropic.

"With Figma Make, you could take an existing design and prompt your way to a fully coded prototype," Field said.

A product manager, Holly Li, came up for a demo. At a laptop, she copied the design for a music player in the Figma editor and pasted it into a chat box, typing instructions to rotate the album art like a record while a song is playing. She showed apps created with Figma Make, eliciting some cheers, and returned to the demo.

"Okay. This time, the model had a little bit of difficulty, but that's okay," she said. The cloudy background image from the original design was gone, and track names became difficult to read. The crowd was silent. She brought up a working version in a different browser tab.

The feature went live last week. Mehrotra said it's off to a good start.

Other products in the market were built with generative AI in mind. They include Lovable, Miro's Uizard and Vercel's v0. Brent Stewart, an analyst at Gartner, said that Figma is "utterly, utterly dominant" in design but that some of the offerings from other companies look more impressive.

Andrew Chan, a former Figma software engineer, wrote in a blog post last year that "an interesting and ongoing question is whether Figma can repeat the success it had in design with other products."

Nadia Eldeib, a former Lyft product manager and CEO of startup CodeYam, tried Figma Make before the broad launch and put it up against Lovable and v0. Writing on Substack, she said it appeared to be at an earlier stage.

It's the sort of feedback that Field will read and send to his employees, known as Figmates. He reads support tickets and mentions of Figma's name on X, formerly Twitter. He took no time off to address such matters on the very day that his company was conducting its IPO, ultimately pricing shares $1 above the expected range.

Yianni Mathioudakis, a creative director in Maryland, tagged Figma in a post on Wednesday, asking if anyone had found a way to take a Figma Make design and bring it into the main design editor.

"Hi Yianni, we are working towards this and very excited about what it will unlock!" Field replied. "Please keep the Make feedback coming!"

Target is continuing to invest in its tech workforce as it tries to recapture the success it saw a few years ago.

EVP and operating chief Michael Fiddelke told investors in May that harnessing tech and AI would be critical to his work in the company's newly formed office that aims to accelerate its growth plan.

The Bullseye retailer has long brought a tech-savviness to its business that has set it apart from most other retailers: it first launched its e-commerce website in 1999, and its early engagement with mobile pickup and delivery services gave Target a massive lift during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the company employs a large tech team behind its increasingly complex business of physical stores, e-commerce business, retail media, and more.

And it pays well, salary data suggests.

Company filings with the US Department of Labor show Target sought to hire around 94 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the first half of this reporting year, largely in software development, information systems, and data science.

That number is up substantially from about 49 for the same period the years before, but roughly in line with the 98 records from two years ago.

By comparison, big-box rival Walmart has about four times as many US employees and requested visas for 1,750 workers.

Companies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers.

Business Insider analyzed how much money companies from Apple to Walmart are paying for tech jobs and other roles. Explore salary data from America's biggest employers.

Target has about 440,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees. Its starting wage for US hourly workers is $15 to $24. A Target spokesperson told Business Insider the company also offers retirement fund matching and a range of other benefits such as employee discounts.

The vast majority of the 10,777 jobs listed on Target's careers website at the time of this writing were for positions in the company's fleet of 1,978 stores. Within the 230 corporate openings, 139 were for the company's offices in India, and the rest were based in the US headquarters in Minnesota. The job listings included salary ranges.

Here's a deeper look at some of the roles Target disclosed for tech workers:

Senior Engineer: $103,605 to $184,700

Lead Engineer: $136,926 to $240,200

Principal Engineer: $122,741 to $353,000

Senior Data Scientist: $122,637 to $184,700

Lead Data Analyst: $139,298 to $200,200

Lead Data Scientist: $128,000 to $273,500

Principal Data Scientist: $211,536 to $347,600

Director Engineering: $206,398 to $289,700

Director Tech: $206,398 to $289,700

Principal Technical Program Manager: $251,576 to $311,900

Home - Crypto Presales - Top Crypto Presales Pepe Dollar and Nexchain AI Gain Interest From Ethereum (ETH) ICO Whale, PEPD Named As Favorite Presale

A major Ethereum (ETH) ICO whale has reportedly made moves into two of 2025's most talked-about presales: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and Nexchain (NEX). But sources close to the presale tracker say the whale's favorite — and largest position — is firmly with Pepe Dollar (PEPD), the MemeFi altcoin aiming to disrupt both meme culture and stablecoin functionality.








PEPD is everything traditional altcoins are not: playful, efficient, memeable, and fast-moving. It exists as a meme-stable hybrid with staking, DEX integration, and soon, a mobile MemeFi game. The Ethereum (ETH) whale reportedly favors PEPD not only for its low entry point and deflationary supply — but because of its viral appeal. In crypto, attention equals liquidity.

Early supporters say Pepe Dollar (PEPD) brings back the energy of Dogecoin, but with real utility. Unlike Nexchain (NEX), which still faces developer onboarding, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) already has a plan to integrate with top Ethereum-based swaps and roll out community governance via token-weighted voting.

Ethereum (ETH) whales are known for spotting trends early. In 2015, they bought ETH for pennies. Now, as AI tokens and meme-stable hybrids battle for dominance, they're making selective plays. This week's whale move suggests that while Nexchain (NEX) has tech appeal, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has the stronger ROI thesis.

PEPD is currently priced at $0.004688, with a projected launch price of $0.03695 — a potential 7x gain. With 58% of its Stage 1 presale already completed, the token is rapidly gaining momentum. The Ethereum (ETH) whale in question reportedly deployed over $50,000 into the PEPD presale in a single transaction.







Nexchain (NEX) offers an AI-powered smart contract platform focused on optimizing NFT, DeFi, and dApp experiences through machine learning. It targets developers and advanced users, promising automation, scalability, and modularity.

Despite a presale price of $0.096 and a launch forecast of $0.30, the project's biggest hurdle remains unclear usage. Multiple analysts have noted that while the AI label draws attention, it's not yet translating into ecosystem traction.

For Ethereum (ETH) whales, that signals caution — even if upside remains.







Both Nexchain (NEX) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) have presale potential. Nexchain offers a moonshot AI play, but Pepe Dollar is winning on cultural momentum and usability. Ethereum (ETH) whales betting big on PEPD suggests that 2025's breakout may not come from high-tech — but from high-engagement.

Ethereum (ETH) whales are watching both projects, but action speaks louder than speculation. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has earned a major vote of confidence and is quickly establishing itself as the best crypto presale for meme-driven gains. For investors who missed ETH's early days, this could be the next great opportunity.

Home - Crypto Presales - Ethereum ICO Investor Buy Best Crypto Presale Pepe Dollar, Why PEPD Will Make More Profits Than Snorter Bot (SNORT)

In the volatile world of meme coins, seasoned Ethereum investors are making a surprising pivot—into Pepe Dollar (PEPD). With the 2025 bull market in full swing, analysts now predict that Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is primed to outperform meme challengers like Snorter Bot (SNORT), offering better returns and long-term gains.



Ethereum early adopters have witnessed multiple meme runs—from Dogecoin to Shiba Inu—and they know the patterns. The key is timing, scarcity, and actual network traction. That's where Pepe Dollar (PEPD) excels. As an Ethereum-based Layer-2 token focused on MemeFi utility, PEPD is now being listed as a 200x to 300x opportunity by traders who previously rode ETH from $0.30 to $4,000.

Pepe Dollar (PEPD) isn't just a meme—it's a Layer-2 utility token designed for actual use cases. Its roadmap includes casino gaming integration, mobile wallet support, and decentralized tipping systems. The presale is still in Stage 1, offering one of the best early-entry points for those who missed the 2020 ETH boom.







Snorter Bot (SNORT) gained fast attention with its absurd memes, Telegram sniff bots, and comical NFT drops. But that's where the roadmap stops. It lacks the infrastructure to be used as anything more than a meme-based bet. Unlike Pepe Dollar (PEPD), SNORT doesn't offer transactional utility, developer tools, or staking rewards.

While SNORT's team has teased a meme-based game and sniff leaderboard, there are no confirmed partnerships or dApps supporting token demand. In contrast, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has already integrated into Web3 microgaming apps and is actively building out Pay-Fi features that connect meme culture with finance.

Pepe Dollar (PEPD) features a capped supply and deflationary burn system that mirrors the economic design of successful Layer-2 tokens. Ethereum ICO investors understand the power of scarcity and velocity—two things SNORT currently lacks. As the Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale advances, these mechanics are expected to tighten supply and increase floor pricing dramatically.

More importantly, the PEPD ecosystem includes more than just a whitepaper. With Telegram integration, Pay-Fi tools, meme casino access, and NFT staking features in development, the token's actual use cases support ongoing demand post-launch.







Ethereum ICO investors aren't just chasing laughs—they're looking for asymmetric upside with smart economic design. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) fits that mold. It's early-stage, meme-driven, and infrastructure-ready. With whale accumulation starting and top analysts flagging it as the best crypto presale, it's no surprise that seasoned ETH holders are rotating into PEPD.

Snorter Bot (SNORT) may still draw eyes and emojis, but in the battle of profits, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) appears better equipped to deliver real returns in 2025.

A major Ethereum whale moved 25,540 ETH—valued at approximately $86.6 million—from FalconX on August 2, 2025, marking a significant outflow following a prior deposit of 35,615 ETH totaling $130.11 million for staking purposes. This transaction comes after the same whale recorded an estimated $10 million unrealized loss from previous staking activities, highlighting the volatility and risk associated with large-scale crypto positions [1].

The movement has sparked speculation among market participants regarding the whale's strategy and the broader implications for Ethereum liquidity and staking dynamics. While no direct commentary from FalconX or regulatory authorities has been released, the transfer underscores the sensitivity of institutional crypto positions to market conditions. Analysts suggest that large movements from institutional players often signal shifting sentiment and could influence short-term price behavior [1].

Ethereum's current price stands at $3,487.18, with a total market cap of $420.94 billion. The asset maintains a dominance of 11.39% within the broader crypto market, although 24-hour trading volume has declined by 17.48% to $27.48 billion. Over the past 90 days, ETH has seen a 92.40% price increase, indicating a period of heightened activity and market engagement [1].

Coincu analysts have noted that emerging regulatory developments may impact institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in the near term. Market participants are closely monitoring for any substantive regulatory or technological shifts that could affect Ethereum's trajectory. Institutional investors, in particular, are grappling with the challenges posed by current volatility, with this recent $10 million loss serving as a stark reminder of the risks involved [1].

Market observers have pointed out that Ethereum liquidity has become increasingly volatile in 2025, and large transfers like this one could further disrupt stable pool dynamics if not offset by counter-movements. The absence of public statements from FalconX representatives or regulatory bodies has left the market to interpret the significance of this event independently [1].

The broader Ethereum community is watching closely, as such movements can have ripple effects across the market. However, without direct insight from key stakeholders or regulators, the full implications remain speculative. The event highlights the ongoing evolution of Ethereum's market landscape and the need for institutional investors to remain agile in response to shifting conditions [1].

Pudgy Penguins remains the top NFT collection by market cap, holding over 123,000 ETH despite a 53% decline in daily trading volume. The collection's floor price has risen to 14.05 ETH, and the average sale price increased by just over 2%, signaling continued holder confidence. This resilience contrasts with the broader market trend, where overall NFT sales have dropped 10% in the past week, with Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks experiencing declines of 43% and 42%, respectively[2].

Moonbirds posted the strongest performance in terms of liquidity, with trading volume increasing by nearly 19% to 201.2 ETH. The average sale price also rose by almost 11%, driven by 86 sales in a single day—the second-highest among the top five collections. This uptick highlights a shift in buyer behavior, with liquidity and active trading becoming more critical than volume alone[1].

Lil Pudgys maintained a market cap above 33,700 ETH, but its trading volume fell by 17%, and the average sale price dipped slightly. However, its floor price remained stable at 1.549 ETH, suggesting a degree of market confidence in the collection's value. In contrast, No Bad Trippers saw the most significant price jump, with the average sale price rising nearly 58%, despite a drop in sales by over a third. The collection recorded over 460 transactions in the past 24 hours, the highest among the top five, indicating strong short-term interest[1].

Milady closed out the list with a 25% drop in daily trading volume and a 31% decline in sales. Nevertheless, its floor price and average sale price remained steady, reflecting a cautious but firm stance from current holders. Collectively, these collections illustrate a market in transition, where some blue-chip assets hold value while others struggle amid reduced trading activity and shifting investor priorities[1].

The broader NFT landscape is also witnessing a potential pivot, with gaming-related assets and AI-curated collections attracting renewed attention. Monthly sales reached $574 million, marking one of the strongest performances of the year and pointing to a possible realignment in the types of NFTs that are driving investor interest. This development challenges the traditional dominance of older collections and suggests a market still in the process of defining its new equilibrium[3].

While platforms like OpenSea continue to play a central role in facilitating NFT trading, the evolving nature of the market underscores the importance of platform adaptability and innovation. OpenSea's ongoing support for token trading and onchain asset creation remains critical as collections and market dynamics shift[4].

Looking ahead, the SEED NFT Marketplace token has drawn speculative attention, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $1.29 by 2026 under a 5% annual growth assumption. These projections offer a potential framework for long-term strategy but remain speculative and should not be treated as guaranteed outcomes[5].

The mixed performance of top NFT collections reflects the sector's current volatility and sensitivity to both macroeconomic factors and evolving investor preferences. While traditional benchmarks are losing relevance, niche areas like gaming and AI curation are emerging as new drivers of value. Investors must remain agile, continuously assessing the unique dynamics of each collection to navigate this rapidly changing market effectively.

Ethereum price today: Ethereum (ETH) is retesting a crucial support zone near $3,400, raising questions over the sustainability of its current market structure.

While short-term volatility has unsettled investors, analysts suggest Ethereum remains positioned for a potential bullish rebound.

Ethereum briefly dipped below $3,450 on August 3, 2025, marking a 5.04% daily decline. The pullback mirrors a wider market correction affecting top digital assets, including Bitcoin. As of the latest data from the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) by Brave New Coin, ETH is trading just above $3,400, holding on to a pivotal support level that previously triggered a 10% drop in July.

Despite the decline, Ethereum's broader market structure remains intact. The asset continues to trade above the SuperTrend support at $3,368, indicating the underlying bullish trend is still in play.

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Technical analyst IncomeSharks explained that Ethereum is “back to the line that saw a 10% drop last time,” noting that a move down to $3,400 still fits within a bullish framework. This suggests that the recent pullback might be a healthy retest rather than a trend reversal.

Meanwhile, market observer Cas Abbé pointed out that Ethereum just experienced its biggest long liquidation event in over three years. He considers this a constructive development, arguing that it has eliminated excessive leverage and flushed out panic sellers. According to him, such a reset often attracts institutional buyers and paves the way for a more sustainable rally.

Ethereum's price action has formed a higher high and higher low pattern since early 2025, reaffirming its medium-term uptrend. As long as ETH can hold the $3,400–$3,368 level, the next target to the upside remains the psychological $4,000 level.

To corroborate the bull case, over a million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past two weeks, according to on-chain analyst Ali. A reduction in exchange balances is typically a sign that investors are moving assets to long-term storage, a vote of confidence in Ethereum's long-term value.

In addition, Ethereum has also reclaimed its decentralized finance supremacy. Ethereum is presently the leading blockchain by decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in the 24-hour and 30-day time frames, according to analyst AkaBull. He noted that some months back, alternate networks had briefly displaced Ethereum in volume and revenue, but Ethereum has now reclaimed its supremacy. He also remarked that “Ethereum is really back” as the network achieves new highs in daily transaction volume and other key metrics.

The recent drop in Ethereum is only a part of the broader risk-off movement in the crypto market. Rising macroeconomic uncertainty has led investors to reduce exposure to risky assets. Market capitalization of ETH is now at around $415 billion, and 24-hour trade volume stands above $18 billion.

While there's been no confirmation of the sell-off by Ethereum leadership, fundamentals in the ecosystem remain upbeat. Core metrics like validator rewards, staking activity, and Layer 2 volume all continue to buck challenges.

With the $3,400 support still in place thus far and fundamental technicals displaying stability, Ethereum could now attempt to bounce back. Market observers caution, though, that a confirmed close below the $3,368 SuperTrend support would transfer bear momentum.

Historically, these Ethereum pullbacks have been accompanied by strong recovery rallies. If accumulation continues and sentiment turns positive, Ethereum can retest the $3,800–$4,000 zone in the coming weeks.

Ethereum's recent price correction may appear sharp, but its market foundation remains firm. Technical patterns, on-chain data, and ecosystem activity suggest Ethereum is preparing for its next major move. As traders await confirmation of direction, the $3,400 zone stands as a critical level in determining whether the bulls can retake control.

A fresh theory from cryptocurrency analyst Seán Murray has reignited speculation about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious figure behind Bitcoin's creation. In a recent analysis, Murray suggests that Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Block (formerly Square), may be the individual who developed Bitcoin's original codebase [1]. The hypothesis draws attention to technical and circumstantial links between Dorsey and the cryptocurrency's early development.

Murray highlights that Dorsey has used C++ since the mid-1990s — the same programming language in which Bitcoin's initial code was written. This technical alignment, combined with Dorsey's involvement in the cypherpunk community and his early exposure to cryptography, adds weight to the theory. Additionally, Dorsey was active online in the 1990s, sharing content on cryptography and maintaining connections with early Bitcoin figures like Hal Finney and Adam Back [1].

The timing of Dorsey's activities also appears to align with key milestones in Bitcoin's early life. For example, Murray notes that Satoshi's forum registration on November 19 coincides with Dorsey's birthday. Similarly, the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney occurred on January 11, which is reportedly Dorsey's mother's birthday. These seemingly minor details, when taken together, contribute to the argument that Dorsey may have been behind Bitcoin's creation [1].

Further evidence includes a 2009 IP trace placing Satoshi in California, where Dorsey was also based. An early Bitcoin wallet address, starting with “1JaK,” is also seen as a potential nod to a nickname associated with Dorsey. Block's 2024 SEC filing, which mentions the company following “Satoshi Nakamoto's blueprint,” is interpreted by Murray as a subtle acknowledgment of Dorsey's possible role in Bitcoin's development [1].

While Dorsey has never publicly claimed to be Satoshi, Murray argues that his silence, timing, and consistent advocacy for decentralization and digital sovereignty support the theory. Unlike other high-profile candidates, who have either denied or been discredited, this theory continues to attract attention, particularly given Dorsey's long-standing support for the principles central to Bitcoin's design [1].

The implications of such a revelation could be significant for the cryptocurrency community and the broader financial landscape. If verified, it could reshape the narrative around Bitcoin's origins and add a new dimension to the understanding of its development. However, until definitive proof emerges, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the most enduring mysteries in modern finance.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ethereum whales have been significantly increasing their holdings amid a recent market dip, with over $400 million worth of ETH acquired by large investors. Institutional interest in Ethereum appears to be growing, as demonstrated by the accumulation of ether through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and expanded positions by specialized investment firms [1].

A major whale wallet, tracked by Arkham Intelligence, purchased approximately $300 million of ETH over three days via Galaxy Digital's OTC desk. This purchase, equivalent to roughly 85,000 ETH, occurred despite an unrealized loss of $26 million, signaling a long-term accumulation strategy rather than short-term speculation [1].

SharpLink, an Ethereum-focused investment firm, expanded its holdings by acquiring 30,755 ETH for $108.57 million at an average price of $3,530 per token. This purchase increased the firm's total ETH holdings to 480,031 tokens, valued at approximately $1.65 billion. Such large-scale acquisitions highlight the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a core digital asset [1].

On-chain activity for Ethereum has also surged, with Sentora reporting 931,000 active addresses in a single day—the highest in nearly two years. The increase in active addresses reflects heightened user engagement and network adoption, reinforcing a bullish outlook for Ethereum [1].

U.S. regulatory developments are increasingly favorable toward blockchain technology, further positioning Ethereum to benefit as a leading smart contract platform. According to venture capitalist Thomas Lee, continued dominance by Ethereum in institutional finance could drive its price toward $60,000, reflecting its expanding influence in global markets [1].

These developments suggest that Ethereum's role in global finance is strengthening. With rising on-chain activity, institutional buying, and supportive regulatory trends, Ethereum appears well-positioned for long-term growth in 2025 and beyond [1].

 BTC price is retesting a key support that previously triggered a 25% rally, potentially signaling a repeat move toward new all-time highs for Bitcoin. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's 50-day EMA bounce aligns with a bullish pattern targeting $148,000.

Old whale's 80,000 BTC selloff marks third profit wave, often a prelude to a recovery.

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 7.50% three weeks after establishing its record high at around $123,250. But analysts say this may be the final shakeout before a breakout toward $150,000.

On Sunday, Bitcoin retook its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) as support after briefly dipping below it a day prior. 

The 50-day EMA has served as a reliable support level for initiating fresh rallies. In June, for instance, a brief drop below this wave support preceded a sharp 25% rebound.

Now, BTC appears to be repeating the same setup, and analyst BitBull says that the cryptocurrency may undergo a June-like in the coming days. 

He argues that even a drop into the $110,000–$112,000 range would establish a “perfect bottom” for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for the next leg higher.

The 50-day EMA support further aligns with the neckline of Bitcoin's prevailing inverted head-and-shoulders (IH&S) pattern.

After breaking above this neckline, BTC has pulled back to retest it—a typical post-breakout move—and bounced, reinforcing the validity of the bullish reversal setup.

The successful neckline retest now signals that Bitcoin may be entering the continuation phase of its breakout, with the IH&S pattern targeting a move toward $148,250.

That is near the widely anticipated $150,000 BTC upside target for 2025, which many analysts expect to happen around October.

Onchain data further indicates that Bitcoin's ongoing price dip may lead to another major breakout. 

Bitcoin has seen three major waves of profit-taking by whales during the 2023–2025 bull market, according to CryptoQuant data. 

The first followed the March 2024 launch of US spot ETFs. The second came after BTC broke $100K post-Trump election in late 2024. The third occurred in July 2025 after a breakout over $120,000 triggered an 80,000 BTC selloff by an old whale.

Each wave of profit-taking preceded a period of price consolidation or moderate correction, lasting between two to four months, wrote CryptoQuant analysts in a report published Friday.

“These cooling phases have historically set the stage for renewed accumulation and a subsequent breakout to new all-time highs,” they say, adding:

Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is currently trading around $2.87 at press time after earlier losses. While the major digital asset is under pressure right now, analysis shows that its spot price is expected to appreciate strongly in the coming months. The $5 price target is expected to come into play near the end of the 2025 bull market. Still, Ripple's flagship digital currency is also likely to run into problems above it, as the liquidity map shows a black hole above the key resistance level.

According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Steph, XRP may start to face significant short-selling activity above $5. He tweeted “#XRP LIQUIDITY MAP SHOWS A BLACK HOLE ABOVE $5. BREAKOUT COULD GET VIOLENT” and posted this liquidity graph on X (formerly Twitter) in support of his argument:

The graph clearly shows a drastic drop in liquidity for the major digital asset once it overcomes the long-term price target of $5. This clearly correlates to the black hole concept in asset liquidity and could spell significant trouble for the digital currency if it isn't addressed on time. 

A liquidity black hole is a dreaded market phenomenon in which liquidity dries up suddenly, causing short sellers and spot traders to engage in a constant loop of selling, causing violent price swings and affecting the stability of the asset. 

This is very similar in practice to the concept of a bank run, in which depositors rush to financial institutions and make large withdrawals, resulting in an immediate liquidity crunch. It is a situation that a major cryptocurrency like XRP needs to avoid at all costs, or traders will pay a significant price.

Ripple, the parent company of the XRP project, may be able to improve liquidity as it still controls a large portion of the cryptocurrency's supply as part of its centralized infrastructure. However, any such liquidity management exercise will be made complex because of its escrow system.

In 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion of its XRP holdings into a cryptographically secured escrow. This system is designed to release a maximum of 1 billion XRP each month and not more. That is around $5 billion worth of XRP that it can use to manage liquidity on a monthly basis. 

It remains to be seen whether this control over market liquidity will be able to save XRP through a soft landing tactic so that it can perform at an optimum level near the culmination of the 2025 bull market.

The Bitcoin market has been showing signs of increasing selling pressure, with its recent price action hinting at an even deeper distribution phase unfolding beneath the surface. 

Wyckoff Pattern Reveals Imminent Breakdown

In an August 2 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson explained how the Bitcoin price may be at risk of a downturn over the coming months. The analyst based his conclusion on the Wyckoff Distribution model, a technical analysis framework that describes how smart money sells off assets at the top of a market cycle.

Wedson highlighted in the post that a 13-phase schematic is unfolding in real-time, which signals that the institutional investors (known as “smart money”) are preparing to exit the market, even as the retail traders remain hopeful.

The analyst started his breakdown with the Preliminary Supply (PSY) phase, where there are subtle signs of institutional sales, and a Buying Climax, where price hits a peak due to exhausted demand. This phase is then followed by an Automatic Reaction (AR), a sharp drop in Bitcoin's price, defining the bottom of the distribution range.

The fourth and fifth phases are Secondary Tests (ST), where price retests the highs of the distribution range, but with weaker momentum and volume. As the pattern matures, the price enters Phase B with sideways movement, confusing retail participants as the institutions quietly offload their coins.

The most irrefutable signs appear in phases C and D, where there is first a Sign of Weakness (SOW), often characterized by a strong breakdown with volume; this is a major signal of demand fading. Then, there is a Last Point of Supply (LPSY), a weak rally towards the upside, which typically creates good setups for shorts. 

Finally, still within phases C and D, a break of ICE leads to a deeper fall, after which a second LPSY trap follows to seal the distribution. 

Is The Altcoin Rally Underway?

Going further, Wedson pointed out that the market makers are rotating into altcoins. According to the analyst, altcoins are already exiting their accumulation zones and are being positioned for structural markups, reflecting increasing interest in the altcoin market.

In contrast, Bitcoin has entered a weekly distribution phase, which may reflect as a weak or modest performance in the near term. Wedson added that, by the end of 2025, there will be a full rotation from BTC to altcoins, and then finally to fiat.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,439, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

 TradFi giants made 345 blockchain investments between 2020–2024, with G-SIBs leading 100+ deals across tokenization, custody and payments. 

Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Japan's SBI Group have emerged as the most active players in traditional finance backing blockchain startups, according to a new report by Ripple in partnership with CB Insights and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technologies.

Between 2020 and 2024, global banks participated in 345 investments in blockchain companies, most of them in early-stage funding rounds, per the report. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs led the pack with 18 deals each, while JP Morgan and Mitsubishi UFJ followed closely with 15 investments.

Mega-rounds, deals worth $100 million or more, were a key focus. Banks contributed to 33 such rounds during the four-year window, pouring capital into firms focused on trading infrastructure, tokenization, custody, and payment solutions.

Notable examples include CloudWalk in Brazil, which raised over $750 million across two rounds backed by Banco Itaú and others. Likewise, Solaris in Germany secured over $100 million from SBI Group and later became a majority acquisition target.

Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), a group of financial institutions with such significant economic weight that their failure could trigger global financial instability, accounted for 106 deals, including 14 mega-rounds valued at over $100 million each.

US and Japanese institutions led in deal volume, but Singapore, France, and the UK were also active. In total, over $100 billion was poured into blockchain startups between 2020 and 2024 across more than 10,000 deals globally.

Ripple's survey of over 1,800 global finance leaders also found that 90% believe blockchain and digital assets will have a “significant or massive” impact on the industry within three years.

The momentum is also supported by regulatory developments, including the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in the US and Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) in the EU, both of which provide a clearer framework for digital asset operations.

Backing the investment trend is soaring demand for real-world blockchain applications. According to a Citi report, stablecoin volumes hit $650–$700 billion per month in Q1 2025, and more banks are launching their own stablecoins to offer programmable money without exposure to volatility.

Looking ahead, tokenization is expected to be a defining trend. Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimate that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

 Senior Contributor. 

Solana's SOL and Ripple's XRP are very popular digital tokens. Both of these tokens have drawn the interest of investors around the world, and they have managed to become some of the most valuable digital assets by total market capitalization.

Investors might consider putting their money into one, or both, of these cryptocurrencies, so this guide can help provide them with information they need to make well-informed decisions.

SOL is the native digital asset of Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform that developers can use to create apps. The platform is capable of handling impressive amounts of transactions, so interested parties can build all kinds of software programs on it. Solana has a unique proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism that uses an innovation called proof-of-history (POH), which helps enable significant transaction volume.

Another major draw of Solana is its low transaction fees. At the time of this writing, Solana's median fee per transaction was $0.00064, which was far lower than Ethereum's median fee of roughly $0.51.

XRP is the native digital asset of a blockchain called the XRP ledger, which can settle transactions in a time frame of three to five seconds. XRP can function as a bridge currency, meaning that it can be used to exchange one fiat currency for another without relying on a centralized intermediary like a financial institution or bank. Ripple has generated significant visibility over the years, and its digital asset, XRP, has repeatedly ranked as one of the most valuable digital currencies by total market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.

One major draw of XRP is its low transaction fees; the token can settle transactions for $0.0002 each.

Solana uses a POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH, in which the system provides each individual block with a timestamp. This unique innovation has provided the Solana network with high bandwidth and very low transaction costs. The platform processes thousands of transactions per second.

Ripple relies on a blockchain called the XRP Ledger, which records all transactions involving XRP. The ledger has its own unique consensus mechanism called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which is capable of approving transactions even if some participants do not act appropriately.

Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, due to its unique POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH. At the time of this writing, the network was processing roughly 3,750 transactions per second, according to the Solana homepage. Ripple, on the other hand, can process 1,500 transactions per second.

Both Solana and Ripple use smart contracts, although they are used for different purposes. Solana is a platform for decentralized applications or dApps, and its smart contracts are called “programs.” Users can harness these contracts by executing transactions that contain instructions telling them what to do.

Ripple smart contracts are different in that they allow participants to make transactions without a centralized intermediary. Ripple smart contracts work by holding funds in conditionally held escrows. Once the needed conditions are met, the escrows release the relevant funds.

There is more than one way of measuring a digital asset's adoption, with one of those being transaction volume. As mentioned, the Solana network can process roughly 3,750 transactions per second. Figures for XRP transactions on the Ripple network came with a monthly cadence, and the network processed more than 10 billion XRP transactions every month between July 2024 and July 2027, according to XRPSCAN figures from The Block.

If one wants to evaluate SOL and XRP as speculative assets, they can look at the total market capitalization of these digital currencies. At the time of this writing, XRP was the third-largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. Solana's SOL was the sixth-largest by this particular measure.

The XRP token has gone from being worth $0.01 in late 2013 to roughly $3.21 at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. This represents an increase of roughly 32,000%. There are many predictions involving the XRP cryptocurrency. One such prediction, which appeared on the Binance website, indicated that the digital token would be worth close to $4 by 2030. The page displaying this prediction stated that the exact figures contained were formulated based on the input of verified Binance users and third parties.

The SOL token has also displayed some very impressive returns over the years, going from roughly $0.66 in April 2020 to approximately $187.00 at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. This represented a gain of more than 28,000%. Some analysts have predicted that under certain conditions, the SOL token could surpass $1,000 by 2030, according to a Benzinga article. More specifically, this price forecast is based on Solana's ability to scale successfully while avoiding security issues. However, other market observers are less bullish, voicing their concerns about Solana's repeated network failures and competition from rival platforms like Ethereum.

The regulatory environment is still far from mature, and this creates uncertainty for both SOL and XRP. In July 2025, the crypto community lauded the approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), the first piece of federal legislation specifically written for cryptocurrencies. However, policymakers have a long way to go, as U.S. lawmakers were considering both the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act at the time of this writing.

As of now, the extent to which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have jurisdiction over digital currencies has not been clarified. More specifically, the CFTC has asserted that it has jurisdiction over virtual currencies under the Commodity Exchange Act, a claim that has been upheld in federal court.

However, the SEC has previously taken action against those involved with certain digital currencies. The CLARITY Act is meant to shed some light on exactly where the jurisdiction of these two government agencies lies.

In 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance.US, in which it claimed that SOL was an unregistered security, according to CoinDesk. The Solana Foundation, a nonprofit whose website describes it as being “dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana ecosystem,” disagreed with this assertion, claiming that SOL is not a security.

The regulatory status of XRP is complicated. In 2023, a federal judge ruled that Ripple's sales of XRP to institutions did in fact represent sales of unregistered securities. However, the same judge decided that Ripple's sales of XRP through exchanges did not represent sales of securities. At the time, the judge fined Ripple $125 million, according to CoinDesk.

While Ripple had previously stated that it planned to appeal, CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in June 2025 that “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they've previously said.”

This should leave the current ruling, along with the $125 million fine, in place.

XRP is meant to provide liquidity for those looking to send money from one place to another. A good use case for these is remittances, where an individual might send money to their relatives overseas. By using XRP, a user can make a cross-border payment that will settle quite quickly. The XRP token can also be used as a bridge currency, making it so that parties can make a transaction using two different fiat currencies without going through a centralized intermediary like a financial institution.

The XRP token is also used to pay for transactions that take place on the XRP ledger.

SOL has many use cases. For starters, it is the native digital asset of the Solana network, and as a result, users harness it to pay the network's transaction fees. Some of these rewards then go to validators.

Another use case of SOL is staking. Users can stake their SOL in order to contribute to the security of the network and also earn rewards by doing so.

Past that, holders of SOL can use the token to vote on potential network upgrades.

Both SOL and XRP have experienced some very impressive upside during their lifetimes. Past that, analysts have made some very bullish predictions about how much the two digital tokens could appreciate. As stated earlier in this article, one prediction contained on the Binance website indicated that XRP could be worth over $4 by 2030. A separate panel of experts, whose input was featured in a Benzinga article, stated that XRP could reach $5.81 this year.

Analysts have also supplied bullish predictions for SOL, with market observers stating in a Binance article that it could surpass $180 this year and $230 by 2030.

Investors should keep in mind that both XRP and SOL are speculative assets. They are not like stocks, which represent ownership rights in companies that generate revenue and earnings. They also don't make regular interest payments like many bonds. In other words, interested parties cannot perform fundamental analysis on XRP and SOL the same way they would analyze shares of stock (or bonds).

Nobody knows what the future will hold. However, investors may want to keep in mind that SOL is the native digital asset of the Solana blockchain, which has benefited from significant activity over the years. In 2024, more than 80% of decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions took place on the Solana network, according to a Helius report. Further, during the first five months of this year, close to $900 billion' worth of DEX trading volume took place on this network.

Ripple, on the other hand, has been relevant for over a decade. Ripple first came into existence in 2012, and its native token has therefore been around longer than Solana's SOL, as Solana first became available to the public in 2020. Ripple's XRP also benefits from a robust community, which has some very enthusiastic supporters. The engagement this token receives on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) is a testament to how much support it has.

Bottom Line

Investors considering XRP and SOL need to remember that while these two have both generated significant visibility and some very compelling gains over the years, they are both speculative assets that do not produce income, revenue or earnings.

Risk is inherent to investment, and it is difficult to reliably predict how these digital assets will perform in the future. At the same time, investors should remember that if the entire crypto space continues to draw investment and rise in value, SOL and XRP could both continue to appreciate.

Which Has A Higher ChanceOof Mass Adoption, SOL or XRP?

Nobody knows for certain what the future will hold. However, if the future mirrors what has happened in the past, Solana's SOL has a better chance of obtaining mass adoption, considering how much traction it has generated during its relatively brief lifespan. 

Is SOLOor XRP Better For Short-term Trading? 

Short-term cryptocurrency trading is highly risky and subject to market manipulation, and it would be difficult to name one of these digital assets as better for this particular purpose. Any investors who are considering such activity should perform thorough due diligence. 

What Are The Biggest Risks For Investing In SOL? 

SOL is a purely speculative asset, and its price is driven by factors like hype and sentiment. Many have described Solana as an “Ethereum killer,” and its native token SOL could potentially fall in value if competitor platforms rise in popularity. 

What Are The Biggest Risks For investing In XRP? 

XRP is a purely speculative asset, and its price fluctuations are driven by hope and sentiment. The XRP token has generated significant visibility as the native token of the XRP Ledger, and if one or more competitors take the market position of this blockchain, it could cause the XRP token to lose favor and fall in value. 

Is It A Good Idea To Hold Both SOL and XRP?

While diversification, or not putting all your eggs in one basket, is always a good idea, there are many ways to establish a diverse portfolio of digital assets without owning both SOL and XRP. There are thousands of digital assets available, and if investors are considering any of them, they can benefit from conducting thorough due diligence.

Trump Media's $2B bitcoin buy and $300M options plan could reshape Bitcoin market outlook. Explore price predictions, technical levels, and a short-term trade setup.

Trump Media and Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT) has gone all in on digital assets, announcing in its Q2 2025 earnings report that it holds $2 billion in bitcoin and bitcoin-related securities. 

The company also allocated $300 million to an options-based strategy targeting BTC, so it's going to get even more crypto exposure. 

This puts Trump Media in the top U.S.-listed companies with significant bitcoin reserves.

Total assets grew 800% year-over-year to $3.1 billion as the company built up its crypto treasury and raised institutional capital. 

The Q2 release showed the company's first positive operating cash flow of $2.3 million from its core media business, a sign of financial stability.

Trump Media's hybrid crypto portfolio includes spot BTC and instruments like bitcoin ETFs and trusts. By holding these diversified assets, the company can maintain liquidity and capture long-term upside.

The company's CEO, Devin Nunes, said the liquidity from this will drive product expansion, including Truth+ streaming service, AI integrations, and a potential Truth Social utility token. Trump Media also hinted at launching crypto ETFs and managed products to tap into institutional demand.

Key points from Trump Media's Q2 2025 strategy:

DJT closed at $16.92 on Friday, down 3.81% on the day and 50% year-to-date. Despite the stock volatility, the company's deepening into crypto may impact market sentiment and institutional interest in bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is at $113,985 after breaking below a symmetrical triangle. The 4-hour chart is bearish with three red candles in a row like the “Three Black Crows” pattern. The 50-period SMA at $116,852 is now resistance capping upside.

RSI is coming up from oversold (31.71) but still at 41.69 with no bullish divergence. Price is facing resistance at $114,939. If it fails to clear this level, it could retest $112,043 and then $110,065.

Trade Idea: Short if BTC is rejected between $114.9K-$115.5K with stop above $116.9K and targets $112K and $110K. Close above $117K invalidates this bearish view.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the first BTC-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6.2 million in its public presale, with $6,278,761 out of a $21,644,097  target. The token is priced at $0.0115, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon.

Designed to merge Bitcoin's security with Solana's speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity.

The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

PayPal has launched a new feature called “Pay with Crypto”, allowing U.S. merchants to accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. For the first year, merchants pay a promotional fee of $0.99 per transaction, then 1.5 percent thereafter. Customers pay with crypto via wallets like Coinbase or MetaMask. PayPal converts the crypto into its stablecoin PYUSD, then into U.S. dollars for the merchant This move follows the launch of PayPal World – a global partnership connecting major digital wallets. PayPal president and CEO Alex Chriss said, “These innovations don't just simplify payments – they drive merchant growth, expand consumer choice, and reduce costs.” (Source: Bitcoin Magazine)

Can we agree that cryptocurrency is becoming a real currency? It's been around now for years and has grown not only in popularity but stability. The President has his own meme coin for goodness sake! Where is this heading? For me, it's obvious. More consumers will be using crypto in the not-too-distant future for their daily transactions in lieu of options in order to avoid fees. And more merchants will encourage the use for this reason. PayPal, a respected brand in the financial services space, is jumping ahead of this. It's a big step forward.

HubSpot has officially launched its first CRM connector for Anthropic's Claude, bringing real-time customer context into the AI assistant to supercharge business workflows. Teams can ask questions in plain language about their CRM data and Claude can generate tailored answers/summaries based on each team's unique context in HubSpot. For example, marketing teams can ask Claude to locate a contact who opened an email campaign but didn't click through. Sales teams can request a summary of active deals by name and amount. Visualizations like charts and graphs can be generated for further analysis. Users only see CRM data they're authorized to access. The CRM connector is available to all HubSpot customers with a paid Claude subscription. (Source: MarTech Cube)

Make no mistake: this is a reporting tool. And that's a good thing. Enabling users to do more natural language queries of their data and get quick, intelligent responses has long been an unreachable goal for many CRM administrators. For now at least, nothing is being done with this data other than displaying it on demand for users. I'm hoping as integrations like these evolve, more agentic AI options will appear.

Business Technology News #3 – Amazon pulls out of Google Shopping ads.

Amazon has made a dramatic global retreat from Google Shopping ad auctions, ending its participation across 20 international domains. This sudden move is shaking up the digital advertising landscape. In just days, Amazon went from appearing in 30 percent of Shopping auctions to zero – affecting millions of impressions. Experts call the shift “colossal,” likening it to Amazon's pandemic-era ad pullback. Many of speculated on what's behind this decision suggesting Amazon is shifting toward its own ecosystem, or this was a strategic pause after Prime Day. It remains to be seen if this is temporary or a long-term strategy shift, but Amazon's disappearance is reshaping ad dynamics – giving competitors a rare chance to shine. (Source: Search Engine Land)

I'm not so surprised. Amazon is an e-commerce search giant on its own. Does it really need Google? When I search for products I usually go right to Amazon. And even if I find a product on Google I see if Amazon carries it. I imagine many consumers do the same. I'm betting Amazon looked at the ROI – given this kind of behavior – and determined it best to cut their participating with Google. I wouldn't be too concerned if I was an Amazon merchant.

President Trump's newly unveiled AI Action Plan aims to supercharge U.S. innovation by cutting red tape and accelerating AI development – but it's not just for Big Tech. Small businesses could see major ripple effects. Deregulation means more AI tools hitting the market – voice assistants, automated lead follow-ups, and social media content generators could become more accessible to small firms. With fewer barriers, mom-and-pop shops might afford AI tools that were once reserved for enterprise giants. However fewer rules mean more risks and small businesses must vet tools carefully for security, reliability, and ethics. Trump's action plan is a significant opportunity for startups who offer AI solutions like chatbots and marketing automation. To stay ahead, small businesses should train their teams of basic AI literacy and AI tools that are tailored to their industry. (Source: Times Square Chronicles)

One other thing: until this legislation appeared many states were taking it upon themselves to regulate the use of AI and my expectation is that activity will also decline. On the one hand, various rules from all over place would create more complications for businesses using AI. On the other hand, AI is scary. But – being in the space myself – I never felt confident that government regulation would do much to stop its growth so I'm in agreement that we might as well lean into it.

Anthropic gave its AI model – Claude (nicknamed “Claudius”) – full control of a real-world vending business and the results were both fascinating and hilariously chaotic. A small shop was set up with a with a fridge, baskets, and an iPad for checkout. Instructed to operate as a business owner, Claudius handled inventory, pricing, customer service, and supplier negotiations. Human staff acted as physical proxies, restocking based on Claudius' instructions. The results were mixed. There were inventory missteps and a discount disaster where Claudius gave 25 percent off to Anthropic employees – nearly all its customers. Claudius also hallucinated a fictitious employee. On the positive side, the AI was able to find niche suppliers quickly, it created a “custom concierge” service and resisted unethical requests. Anthropic's takeaway: Despite losing money, the experiment showed AI's potential in business roles – with major caveats. Anthropic believes AI middle managers could be viable with better tools and safeguards. (Source: AI News)

This is like letting a high school kid running a business. They're going to make stupid mistakes. But that high school kid – like its AI counterpart – will ultimately get older and more experienced. And when that happens they're better suited to do many of the tasks they couldn't do before. It's inevitable.

Each week I round up five business technology news stories and explain why they're important for your business. If you have any interesting stories, please post to my X account @genemarks.

It looks like institutional investors are really getting into Ethereum these days. I mean, we're talking about a serious uptick in institutional accumulation, with corporations owning around 1% of the total ETH supply and projections hitting 10% by year's end. This isn't just some passing phase; it's a full-blown market shift towards decentralized finance and enterprise blockchain applications.

With all this institutional capital flowing into Ethereum, market liquidity is getting a major boost. This is great for crypto banking and all that, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for smaller fintech startups. Sure, they might find some collaboration opportunities, but they're also up against intensified competition and regulatory scrutiny. In short, it's a dog's breakfast out there.

And then there's the whole staking thing. It's good for stabilizing prices but bad for smaller startups that need liquid ETH for their daily operations. The shrunk supply could make it even tougher for these startups to get their hands on ETH when they need it.

Asian fintech startups are caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, institutional capital can be a sweet deal. On the other, it's like a double-edged sword of increased competition and regulatory headaches. The market is getting crowded, and standing out is becoming a Herculean task.

Let's not forget the compliance nightmare. More institutional money means more regulatory oversight. Startups have to build strong compliance frameworks, which takes time and money. Messing this up can lead to nasty penalties, complicating things even further.

As for what's next, the recent whale activity in Ethereum is a mixed bag. Some analysts think the drop in whale and institutional activity means a correction is coming. Others think the big players are still accumulating because they believe in Ethereum's long-term future. Who knows?

For small fintech startups, keeping an eye on these trends is key. They'll need to adapt their strategies to avoid getting swallowed whole. This could mean diving into smart contract payroll and crypto payroll integration to streamline operations and attract more customers.

So there you have it. The surge of institutional investment into Ethereum is shaking up market liquidity while throwing small fintech startups for a loop. They've got to be quick on their feet to navigate this new reality, but who knows what the future holds?

Dogecoin fell 4% in 24 hours, dropping from $0.20 to $0.19 amid increased trading activity and global economic concerns.

Trading volumes surged significantly, indicating strong selling pressure and high-conviction exits from the market.

DOGE faced resistance at $0.202–$0.203, while support formed around $0.188–$0.190, suggesting potential for continued volatility.

Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins.

DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets.

XRP fell nearly 9% in 24 hours, driven by institutional selling, with volumes more than doubling the daily average.

The asset found short-term support at $2.75, but recovery efforts stalled below key resistance at $2.84.

Global trade tensions and macroeconomic shifts contributed to the broader sell-off, affecting risk markets.

XRP plunged nearly 9% in the 24-hour session ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), falling from $3.02 to as low as $2.75 before staging a mild recovery to $2.82. The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated.

The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off.

 Bitcoin and Ether could fall back toward the $100,000 and $3,000 level amid concerns of more tariffs, a sluggish credit market and slowed job creation, Arthur Hayes argues. 

Maelstrom Fund chief investment officer Arthur Hayes has warned that mounting macroeconomic pressures could drag Bitcoin back down to the $100,000 level — and he's already taken crypto profits in anticipation.

Hayes linked the recent crypto pullback to renewed tariff fears sparked by the disappointing Non-Farm Payrolls report, which showed just 73,000 new jobs added in the US in July — a sign of economic fragility.

Hayes also pointed to sluggish credit growth in major economies stunting nominal gross domestic product growth in warning that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) could fall further toward the $100,000 and $3,000 levels.

His comments on Saturday came in response to an X post from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, which highlighted that Hayes recently offloaded $8.32 million worth of ETH, $4.62 million of Ethena (ENA) and $414,700 of the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin.

The Hayes' wallet that carried out the recent selloffs now holds $28.3 million worth of tokens, with $22.95 million parked in the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

Hayes' comments echo wider fears that macro headwinds could stall crypto's momentum. Tight credit, renewed tariffs and a softening job market may pressure risk-on assets, testing investor conviction and potentially triggering a correction.

Bitcoin has fallen over 7.7% from the $123,000 all-time high it set on July 14, while Ether is down 12.5% since eclipsing the $3,900 barrier on July 28, CoinGecko data shows.

A Bitcoin price drop to $100,000 would mark an 18.7% correction.

However, many industry analysts think Bitcoin is past the days of major double-digit pullbacks.

Among them is Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that since BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF filing in June 2023, Bitcoin has experienced “much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns.”

Mitchell Askew, head analyst of Bitcoin mining firm Blockware Solutions added: “The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over.”

Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have taken another step toward closer ties in crypto and blockchain. According to reports, the two countries held a high-level virtual meeting this month.

Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, spoke with Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency. They agreed to share know-how on digital finance, build joint rules for virtual assets, and push blockchain projects together.

Reports have disclosed that Pakistan wants a formal deal. The country has proposed a Memorandum of Understanding to cement cooperation in the crypto sector.

Pakistan formed its Pakistan Crypto Council after appointing Bin Saqib as special adviser to Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb. Bin Saqib now serves as CEO of the Council, while Aurangzeb acts as its chairman.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed off on Pakistan's Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. That law sets up an independent regulator for cryptocurrencies and virtual assets.

Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor praised Pakistan's steps. He called it a sign that the country knows how to handle this new market.

Reports have also highlighted plans for joint work on blockchain research. Both sides want to run training sessions, share studies, and test new finance tools.

They talked about regulatory checklists, digital wallets, and how to protect investors. They agreed to meet again soon to iron out details and draft the MoU.

Bilateral trade is already on the agenda. According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, officials aim to boost annual trade volume to $100 million.

In the fifth session of their Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, both sides signed several economic and technical cooperation protocols. They want more exports, fresh imports, and revived joint business councils. They will hold trade fairs, B2B meetings, and business forums to spur deals.

Reports say the two governments plan to improve regional routes. They will work on postal services, air links, rail lines, and cargo roads. Both sides see better transport as key to linking landlocked Kyrgyzstan with Pakistan's ports.

Based on reports, the next move is the formal MoU on crypto cooperation. Once signed, it will bind both governments to a shared rulebook. They hope that a clear law will attract global investors and protect local users.

The Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, will guide that process. It spells out licensing rules, audit needs, and penalties for fraud.

Society has long struggled with petroleum-derived plastic pollution, and awareness of microplastics' detrimental effects on food and water supplies adds further pressure.

In response, researchers have been developing biodegradable versions of traditional plastics, or "bioplastics." However, current bioplastics face challenges as well: Current versions are not as strong as petrochemical-based plastics and they only degrade through a high-temperature composting system.

Enter researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, who have solved both problems with inspiration from the humble leaf. Long before plastic, humans wrapped their food in leaves, which easily biodegrade due to an underlying structure of cellulose-rich cell walls. WashU's chemical engineers decided to introduce cellulose nanofibers to the design of bioplastics.

"We created this multilayer structure where cellulose is in the middle and the bioplastics are on two sides," said Joshua Yuan, the Lucy and Stanley Lopata Professor and chair of energy, environmental and chemical engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering. Yuan is also director for the National Science Foundation-funded Carbon Utilization Redesign for Biomanufacturing (CURB) Engineering Research Center. "In this way, we created a material that is very strong and that offers multifunctionality," he added.

The technology emerged from working with two of the highest production bioplastics today. In a study published in Green Chemistry earlier this year, Yuan and colleagues used a variation of their leaf-inspired cellulose nanofiber structure to improve the strength and biodegradability of polyhydroxybutrate (PHB), a starch-derived plastic; they further refined their technique for polylactic acid (PLA), as detailed in a new paper just published in Nature Communications.

The plastic packaging market is a $23.5 billion industry dominated by polyethylene and polypropylene, polymers made from petroleum that break down into harmful microplastics. The researchers' optimized bioplastic, called Layered, Ecological, Advanced and multi-Functional Film (LEAFF), turned PLA into a packaging material that is biodegradable at room temperature. Additionally, the structure allows for other critical properties, such as low air or water permeability, helping keep food stable, and a surface that is printable. This improves bioplastics' affordability since it saves manufacturers from printing separate labels for packaging.

"On top of all of this, the LEAFF's underlying cellulose structure gives it a higher tensile strength than even petrochemical plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene," explained Puneet Dhatt, a PhD student in Yuan's lab and first author on the article.

The innovation was in adding that cellulosic structure that WashU's engineers replicated, cellulose fibrils embedded within the bioplastics.

"This unique biomimicking design allows us to address the limitations of bioplastic usage and overcome that technical barrier and allow for broader bioplastic utilization," Yuan said.

Circular economy ready

The United States is uniquely positioned to dominate the bioplastics market and establish a "circular economy" wherein waste products are reused, fed back into systems instead of left to pollute the air and water or sit in landfills.

Yuan hopes this technology can scale up soon and seeks commercial and philanthropic partners to help bring these improved processes to industry. Competitors from Asian and European research institutions also are working to develop similar technology. But U.S. industries have an advantage due to the country's vast agriculture system -- and WashU is near the center of the nation's agrichemical industry.

"The U.S. is particularly strong in agriculture," Yuan said. "We can provide the feedstock for bioplastic production at a lower price compared to other parts of the world."

The "feedstock" Yuan is referring to are chemicals such as lactic acid, acetate or fatty acids like oleate, products of corn or starch fermentation by microbes that serve as bioplastic factories.

Pseudomonas putida, for instance is a microbial strain widely used in the fermentation industry, including to produce a variety of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), including PHB.

McKelvey Engineering researchers have designed ways to convert various wastes, including carbon dioxide, lignin and food waste, into bioplastics using strains such as P. putida. With improved bioplastic design, Yuan's research further fills in that loop, with a version of PHB and PLA that could be produced much more efficiently and degrade safely into the environment.

"The United States has a waste problem, and circular reuse could go a long way to turning that waste into useful materials," Yuan said. "If we can ramp up our bioplastic supply chain, it would create jobs and new markets," he said.

The study "Biomimetic layered, ecological, advanced, multi-functional film for sustainable packaging" was supported by NSF EEC 2330245, NSF MCB 2229160, and U.S. Department of Energy BETO (Bioenergy Technologies Office) Projects.

The study "Integrated design of multifunctional reinforced bioplastics (MReB) to synergistically enhance strength, degradability, and functionality" was supported by NSF MCB 2229160, and U.S. Department of Energy BETO (Bioenergy Technologies Office) projects including EE 0007104, DE EE 0008250, and others.

While chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of lung cancer treatment, it often weakens the immune system it relies on for long-term control. Now, researchers have found a way to turn this weakness into strength -- by transplanting healthy mitochondria into the tumor environment. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combining mitochondrial transplantation with cisplatin not only enhanced immune cell infiltration but also reversed tumor metabolism and improved the drug's effectiveness. This innovative approach transforms mitochondria from mere energy suppliers into active allies in cancer therapy, showing potential to reshape how we treat aggressive lung tumors.

Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, yet its effectiveness is hampered by toxic side effects and emerging resistance. Moreover, chemotherapy damages immune cells and reduces their presence in the tumor microenvironment, limiting long-term control. Adding to this challenge, tumors can hijack immune cell mitochondria through nanotube-like structures, further dampening immunity. Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for some, but many patients still fail to respond. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for strategies that restore immune power and metabolic balance during chemotherapy.

Researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine and Nantong University published a study in Cancer Biology & Medicine that introduces a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. They investigated whether direct mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. By combining functional mitochondria with cisplatin, the team aimed to not only improve tumor response but also restore immune vigor inside the tumor microenvironment. Their findings mark a significant step toward integrative treatments that energize both cells and immunity.

The researchers isolated functional mitochondria from human cardiomyocytes -- cells known for their high energy output -- and transplanted them into NSCLC tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Alone, mitochondrial transplantation did not harm cancer cells, but when combined with cisplatin, it significantly amplified tumor suppression. This synergy reduced the IC50 of cisplatin from 12.93 μM to 6.7 μM, indicating greater drug sensitivity. Tumors in mice shrank more dramatically with the combination therapy than with chemotherapy alone, and immune infiltration markedly increased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a striking shift in tumor metabolism: downregulation of glycolysis and hypoxia genes, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways -- reversing the Warburg effect. Markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, P53) and stemness (HIF-1α, CD44, CD133) were suppressed. Importantly, mitochondrial transplantation also restored mitochondrial activity in immune cells, enhancing the function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The treatment caused no additional toxicity and preserved body weight and organ integrity. This work demonstrates that mitochondria can serve as metabolic and immunologic reinforcements, transforming the tumor landscape into one more susceptible to immune attack and chemotherapy.

"This research introduces a powerful dual-action strategy," said Dr. Liuliu Yuan, lead investigator of the study. "By replenishing immune cells with functional mitochondria, we are not just enhancing their energy -- but restoring their ability to fight. At the same time, tumor cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. It's like rearming the immune system while disarming the tumor. This could be a promising avenue for patients who don't respond well to conventional treatment."

This discovery lays the groundwork for a new therapeutic paradigm -- one that leverages the mitochondria's unique biology to augment cancer treatment. In patients with advanced NSCLC, mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs while minimizing immune suppression. Beyond lung cancer, this approach may extend to other tumors where immune dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming are barriers to treatment success. With further refinement and clinical trials, mitochondrial transfer could evolve into a versatile platform for combination therapies, helping clinicians push past the current limits of cancer care and into a new era of bioenergetic and immune restoration.

Tantalizing Battlefield 6 morsels have been making the rounds ever since the title's official announcement last month. The iconic shooter franchise is poised to make its return this year with a back-to-basics approach, something sorely missing from contemporary FPS titles. Add to that the disappointing response to COD: Black Ops 6 and EA has found themselves stirring the perfect concoction of demand for an AAA game launch. A couple of days ago, it revealed the relatively modest hardware requirements for the upcoming Battlefield 6 and, today, we allegedly have our first performance report to pick over.

Popular Twitch steamer, Bruhskey, took to social media to show off the game's average performance. Running at 1440p, they were able to get over 300 FPS on a setup consisting of an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D CPU and an RTX 5080 GPU — both attractive top-end components. Upon this foundation was 32GB of 6400MT/s DDR5 memory running in a 1:1 ratio, which explains the excellent 6.7-8.5 total system latency the streamer was able to achieve. The game is still under embargo so they couldn't say much, like whether any upscaling was used to hit those numbers, but in general ~300 FPS in a modern blockbuster title remains impressive.

BATTLEFIELD 6 Average fps performance was very good, NUMBERS/SPECS BELOW👇 330-370fps gpu310-330fps cpu6.7-8.5 PCL Latency Not allowed to show screenshots but for those asking, 9800x3d + 6400 1:1 2133 32gb + 5080 3200mhz core AND no optimized nvidia driver.August 1, 2025

In the same thread, Bruhskey mentioned that their friend rocking an Intel Core i9 14900K, and the same RTX 5080 GPU, were short about 110 FPS compared to the 9800X3D, signaling that the extra L3 cache in the AMD CPU was being utilized very well by the game engine.

Please add a sprinkle of salt to these comparison numbers, which we can't guarantee are representative of the finished game, or be certain were based on reasonably equivalent 9800X3D vs 14900K systems (all else being equal), among other potential issues.

The 14900K is the Blue Team's best-performing consumer desktop CPU at the moment, but it only has 36MB of L3 cache whereas the 9800X3D has 96MB, and in this case it trails behind its Ryzen counterpart by roughly 30%. This is a good sign for 3D V-Cache CPU owners because, if Bruhskey's right, they'll be able to get the most out of their processors, ensuring minimal chances of a processor bottleneck here.

These performance numbers aren't just limited to PC either, by the way, as the devs are working hard to push 60 FPS across all consoles as well. In an interview with Tech & Co., Florian Le Bihan, Principal Game Designer at Battlefield Studios, said optimization was one of the most important things to get right. Not only does every console, including the Xbox Series S, get a 60FPS mode by default, but you'll be able to cross that barrier with Performance Mode. On PC, of course, the sky (read: your hardware) is the limit, so it's great to see an AAA launch in 2025 not bogged down with unrealistic requirements.

Bruhskey did not attach any screenshots or gameplay clips to support their claims (because the game is under embargo) but it is probable that the game was running natively at 1440p since there was no mention of frame-gen or DLSS anywhere in their thread. That being said, Battlefield 6 will support all the major upscalers and feature real-time environmental destruction that the franchise is known for. The game is set to release on October 6, 2025 with an open beta planned for August 9-10. Everything seems to be lining up nicely for Battlefield's comeback, and initial impressions have been nothing but positive, to say the least.

Every new campaign for Critical Role provides a shakeup in some way, whether it's a new location or cast of characters. With the upcoming fourth campaign, the Actual Play series sees its biggest change yet with Brennan Lee Mulligan in the Game Master's seat.

Mulligan, who runs games for his own Actual Play series Dimension 20 over on Dropout and the Critical Role miniseries Calamity, will take helm of a full campaign set to begin on October 2. During Critical Role's live event on Saturday, he came on stage as part of the announcement. This new campaign will be set outside the Exandria setting of the first three—”Vox Machina,” “Mighty Nein,” and “Bells Hells”—and help to give original Critical DM Matthew Mercer a break.

“We've been enormous fans of Brennan's for many years now, and…he felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new,” said Critical alum and CEO Travis Willingham. “Critical Role has always been about genuine connection through storytelling first and foremost, and as Brennan himself will tell you, he's still played more TTRPGs away from a camera than in front of it. His passion and drive for worldbuilding is infectious, and it's been an absolute joy to spark off him as we forge ahead.”

For Dimension 20 fans wondering how this change affects that show, Mulligan will still to lead that show. Per Variety, he recently renewed his contract with the media company for another three years, which includes a “new long-term contract for nonstop new seasons of D20,” said Mulligan on Instagram. At least two of those seasons will bring back the Intrepid Heroes who've headlined Fantasy High, Unsleeping City, and the current season Cloudward, Ho!. His separate Actual Play series Worlds Beyond Number will also continue.

“Needless to say, I'm finally playing almost as much tabletop as I'd like to!” he continued. “It's a gift, honor, and privilege to set out on this new epic adventure with Critical Role.”

'And now the fun really begins'.

Christian ‘Peri Fractic' Simpson has confirmed that his much touted community-led acquisition of Commodore has been signed, sealed, and paid for. The Retro Recipes YouTuber announced the finalizing of the Commodore Corporation BV deal on the streets of the Netherlands this week, flanked by an assortment of Commodore legends of old, under the banner “We did it! Commodore is home!”

In the triumphant video short, Simpson breathlessly addressed his audience, stating that “We just made history. Together, we've just signed the final contract and paid in full, ahead of schedule, to complete the acquisition of the whole Commodore Corporation BV, and all 47 original Commodore trademarks, the oldest, dating back to 1983.” Behind him, you can see familiar Commodore stalwarts like David Pleasance, Leo Nigro, and Colin Proudfoot. Actually, there is a clearer view of the Commodore 'takeover' team in a Facebook post by Commodore International Corporation (see below).



In his street-filmed mini episode, Simpson continued, “And it all means that Commodore is finally in the hands of those who truly care - the community and the original employees… And now the fun really begins as Commodore reboots, not just as a retro brand with next-gen ideas, but as a digital detox brand, picking up right where we left off in the 90s. Therefore, we will be positioned to free society from toxic tech, and bring joy back to computing – 90s and Y2K style.”

This sounds positive for fans of both retro computing and new gadgetry, which plays to the strengths of home computers from a few decades past. The will and talent seem to be there. Moreover, Simpson seemed especially pleased that funding had come through, early, so this deal was signed sealed and delivered ahead of schedule.

We already witnessed the first product launch of the ‘new' Commodore, Last month we reported on the Commodore 64 Ultimate computer launch. In brief, it is a machine pulled together from various enthusiast projects, but it is welcome to see it packaged and marketed in a connected way, and priced from $299, as long as you're partial to beige – more cosmetically adventurous models ramp up in price.

Some more hints at what to expect going forward are provided by the latest updates to the official Commodore.net about page. Here, Simpson (we assume) expands on his “digital detox brand” idea, as well as the direction that will lead to “retro futurism” under the Commodore banner.

Personally, as someone who didn't enjoy the 8-bit home computer era nearly as much as the following 16-bit era, I'd like to see some more ‘futurism' from the revamped Commodore. However, I am aware that Cloanto are the current custodians of the public-facing Amiga Inc. brand with its excellent Amiga Forever emulation products.

Controversial crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun finally got his suborbital ride into space today from Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, four years after he put in the winning $28 million bid for a seat.

Five other spacefliers were alongside Sun when Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket ship rose from its launch pad at the company's Launch Site One in West Texas at 7:43 a.m. CT (5:43 a.m. PT) for a 10-minute trip.

When Sun emerged from the crew capsule after the flight, he made a thumbs-up gesture, then stepped down to kiss the ground.

“I wished to go into space since I was a child, and after almost 30 years, it's come true,” Sun said on Blue Origin's webcast. “For this mission I waited four years, but we finally delivered it. I really appreciate Mr. Bezos and his team to make it possible. … This is my first commitment and step to space, and we will have more.”

Sun is the founder of a blockchain venture called Tron and an adviser to HTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. When the 35-year-old, Chinese-born billionaire won Blue Origin's space auction in 2021, it was meant to guarantee him a spot on New Shepard's first crewed flight that summer. Instead, Sun put his reservation on hold, reportedly due to scheduling conflicts.

While Sun was waiting for his flight, legal complications arose: In 2023, he became the subject of a federal investigation over alleged market manipulation and unregistered sales of crypto asset securities. But that case was put on hold in February, and a couple of months later, Sun earned a place of prominence at a crypto dinner with President Donald Trump by purchasing the biggest share of the $TRUMP meme coin. 

Last month, Tron Inc. became a publicly listed company on Nasdaq.

Today's mission, known as NS-34, marked the 34th flight and 14th crewed flight for Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital space program. This flight followed the standard profile for crewed missions: The autonomously controlled, reusable rocket ship's hydrogen-fueled booster sent the crew capsule to an altitude of 65.7 miles (105.7 kilometers), just above the 100-kilometer Karman Line that marks the internationally accepted boundary of outer space.

At that height, the NS-34 crew members experienced a few minutes of zero gravity and got an astronaut's-eye view of Earth beneath the black sky of space. Then, at the end of the ride, they made a parachute-assisted touchdown not far from their launch pad.

Sun's five crewmates for NS-34 reflected varied backgrounds. Here's the list:

“It was an honor to see so many nations represented on our flight today,” Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for the New Shepard, said in an online recap of today's mission. “The view of our fragile planet from space has a unifying effect on all who witness it, and I am always eager to see how our astronauts use this experience for the benefit of Earth.”

Blue Origin has now sent 75 people on suborbital space trips, including Russell and four other people who have taken multiple trips. The company doesn't typically reveal how much its customers are paying for their flights. Sun's case is the rare exception, due to the fact that the 2021 auction was conducted publicly. 

Sun's $28 million fare went to Blue Origin's nonprofit educational foundation, the Club for the Future. Most of that money was distributed in the form of million-dollar grants to 19 space-focused nonprofits. 

In addition to the crew, today's flight carried more than 1,500 digital postcards and 16,000 physical postcards for the Club for the Future's “Postcards in Space” program, which collects messages from students around the world. Sun set up his own “To the Sun” program to collect messages — and carried more than 1,000 of those messages into space on a thumb drive.

Sun's space ride isn't his only notable purchase: Last December, he made headlines when he spent $6.2 million to purchase a work of conceptual art featuring a banana that was duct-taped to a wall — and then ate the banana.

And for what it's worth, Sun isn't the only controversial crypto figure to take a trip on New Shepard. In February, Blue Origin withheld the identity of one of its spacefliers on the NS-30 mission. An analysis of photos and references to the flier in public records, including the Federal Aviation Administration's list of spaceflight participants, suggested that the mystery man was an Australian crypto entrepreneur named Russell Wilson (not to be confused with the former Seahawks quarterback).

In response to emailed inquiries, a Blue Origin representative told GeekWire that the company works with a third party to accept crypto payments for spaceflights.

Pro-focused features combine with modular design.

Gaming accessory maker Turtle Beach has announced the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, a new modular game controller under its Victrix esports brand. Successor to the original Victrix Pro BFG, the new controller builds on the design by Performance Designed Products (PDP), the manufacturer behind the original model which was acquired by Turtle Beach in 2024.

The latest Reloaded model now comes with a reconfigured Fightpad module with improved ergonomics, as well as updated Hall Effect thumb sticks and triggers. The company will be offering it in black and white color variants with a dedicated model for Xbox which is compatible with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows. An officially licensed PlayStation version will also be available, offering compatibility with the PS5 and PS4 consoles alongside Windows, again.

The modular aspect of the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded controller allows it to adapt to various genres and play style, including fighting games, first-person shooters, and RPGs. Users can swap between three modules and 11 interchangeable components including various thumb sticks, a selection of D-pads, and thumb stick gates that can attach to the bottom of a joystick or thumb stick limiting the directions in which the stick can move.

The controller also comes with patented 5-stop hall-effect clutch triggers with a Hair-Trigger mode that allows adjustable sensitivity, which makes it suitable for FPS gamers. Additionally, there is a 6-button Fightpad module which features Kailh microswitches that are claimed to deliver tournament-level accuracy.

The included USB Type-A dongle offers low-latency and a range of up to 30-feet, while the 2,000 mAh inbuilt-battery offers up to 20-hours of backup. Alternatively, players can use the included braided USB-C cable for wired operation. There is also a 3.5mm audio jack with Sony 3D Audio support on the PlayStation variant.

The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is on sale in the UK and EU regions starting at £179.99 and €199.99 respectively. For customers in the US, the controller is now available for pre-order on Amazon at $209.99, and will officially start shipping on September 28.

This AMD 7800 XT was cooked, literally.

We've seen our fair share of repair jobs recently, but this one takes the cake for being the most botched attempt—before it hit the legendary desk of Northwest Repairs. They brought back a dead 5090 to life not too long ago, and this time it's an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, one that survived being baked in an oven. Instead of the intended reflow that would've otherwise fixed it, the card just died. Fret not, though, as it reached the hands of a master chef.

Let's walk back a bit and add some context. The owner bought this XFX Speedster 7800 XT Merc 319 from Facebook Marketplace, and it never worked, so it was sent to Northwest Repairs for assessment. Once on the bench, our host Tony opened it up and was greeted with flux residue all over the board, indicating a reflow was (poorly) attempted previously. Upon further inspection, the GPU core looked intact, but its retention frame came undone the moment it was touched. This drove down the chances of a successful repair to "0.1%," according to Tony, but since the core wasn't cracked, all hope was not lost yet.

The right way to reflow a PCB is by putting in on a BGA rework station and heating momentarily while regulating temperatures. This ensures the flux melts properly, allowing the solder to reflow in a natural, calculated way. Baking the board in the oven can cause a sudden thermal shock which can warp it or—worst case scenario, crack the on-board components, including the GPU core itself. That's an irreversible fate but, fortunately, the 7800 XT had not slipped that far.



The fix, then, was simple... by expert standards. Put the PCB under a thermal camera to detect any anomalies and address them one by one. Right off the bat, the GPU core was seen exhibiting short bursts of heat that looked like mini explosions. Moreover, running a memory test showed that three memory chips were faulty. This confirms why the reflow attempt from before did not work; the VRAM likely has ripped pads underneath that need to be reballed now. As such, Tony got to work on not just taking out the memory chips, but also the core itself.

A beautiful montage follows... which ends up in failure. The GPU, despite having a reballed core and memory, still doesn't boot. A memory test is run again and one of the VRAM chips turns out to be the culprit. Our repair guy wasn't sure at this point whether he did a bad job repairing the pads, or whether the chip was simply a goner. Nonetheless, he replaced the last suspect memory chip with a new one known to work and, voilà, the card finally posted. As a final measure, Tony replaced the thermal pads before reassembling the card since the original ones were "all junk to begin with."

This repair job shows the importance of ingenuity, a core (no pun intended) human trait, mixed with our tenacity. Not everyone can afford to casually buy a new graphics card if their current one dies on them, especially if you're in a region with shoddy warranty systems or dealing through the second-hand market. Service shops like Northwest Repair help keep hardware out of landfills, ensuring there's a safe haven for parts stuck in a coma. After all, there's a certain convenience associated with tinkering with your own components, and it serves as a key constituent of this custom gaming PC hobby we're all enrolled in.

Equally crucial is to not downplay the sheer craftsmanship involved in such a task. Replacing a GPU's memory is a tall order in of itself, let alone reballing the core. The 7800 XT in question came with non-human blood and poop marks over the PCB as well, but that's an uninteresting detail compared to everything else the repair entailed. Because we're used to seeing crazy shunt mods and DIY goodies left and right, it might not stand out as special but remember that these are professionals operating at the top of their game.

Nintendo just confirmed that its Switch 2 console can potentially overheat when used in hot environments. According to its X (formerly Twitter) post [machine translated], both the original Switch and the newer Switch 2 must be used in ambient temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees Celsius (41 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit). It also warned against using its consoles outdoors, especially as temperatures in Japan have been soaring above 35 degrees Celsius recently.

“Using Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a hot environment may cause the console to become hot. Please use it in a place between 5 and 35°C, as it may cause a malfunction,” Nintendo Japan's customer service posted on X. “Recently, the temperature has been exceeding 35°C for several days. Please be careful when using outdoors.”

気温が高い場所でNintendo SwitchやNintendo Switch 2 を使用すると、本体の温度が高くなることがあります。故障の原因となる可能性がありますので、5～35℃の場所でご使用ください。最近は35℃を超える日が続いています。屋外で使用する際はご注意ください。August 1, 2025

Many users have already reported the overheating issue on the Switch 2 in early July, with the console's fans spinning at max speed trying to cool the unit. There were also several instances of the handheld crashing — both in handheld and docked modes — with one even saying that it became too hot to hold. More concerningly, these incidents weren't limited to AAA titles like Cyberpunk 2077. There were reports of this happening even while playing less demanding games like Splatoon or Pokémon.

Beyond that, this warning is also concerning for players based in hotter climates. Some regions, especially in the Middle East, the Sahara, and South Asia, often experience temperatures far exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. So, players based in this area would have trouble playing with the Switch 2 unless they're in an air-conditioned area. And as global temperatures continue to soar, we can only expect more areas to experience higher ambient temperatures, causing more consoles to experience overheating.

The Nintendo Switch 2 received a major hardware upgrade from the original Switch. But despite that, it's still a woefully underpowered console compared to modern handhelds like the GPD Win 5 and the Ayaneo Next 2. Although most of its fans buy it for its Nintendo exclusives, the company's decision to have more AAA games available on its platform means that its hardware will be pushed to its performance and thermal limits by more demanding, less optimized titles.

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


DeepCool has been delivering innovative, interesting, and often budget-conscious PC cases and cooling products for more than a decade. Its current lineup includes air and AIO coolers, computer cases, keyboards, power supplies, and other accessories. We've been impressed by the company's AK620 and Assassin IV air coolers in the past. In 2014, the Beijing-based company was banned from selling products in the U.S., but has continued to produce and improve its cooling products for markets elsewhere.Today we'll be testing the successor to the Assassin IV, the Assassin VC Elite, as its name implies, features an upgraded vapor chamber coldplate that DeepCool claims increases cooling performance to the point it's rated to handle CPUs with up to a 300W TDP.



Will DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite make our list of best coolers on the market? On its merits, yes. But again, if you are in the United States, you'll have to looke elsewhere, no matter how good the Assassin VC Elite's performance is – and make no mistake, its performance is excellent.

The packaging for the cooler is similar to the Assassin IV, having a square brown box with a cover which showcases the cooler and its design. The cooler is protected by a plastic cover and foam packaging, with the accessories contained in an adjacent box.



Included in the box are the following:



 ▶️ Enhanced vapor chamber coldplate and seven copper heatpipes



To transfer heat away from the CPU, this air cooler features seven copper heatpipes connected to the newest feature present in the Assassin VC Elite, which also gives it its name – a vapor chamber (VC) coldplate.



This new design is said to increase the cooling power of the Assassin VC Elite by 20W compared to the Assassin IV, with a TDP rating of up to an impressive 300W.



▶️ Change from quiet to performance modes at the flick of a switch



Like its predecessor, the Assassin IV, DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite supports two modes of operation: Performance and Quiet modes. Performance mode allows the cooler to run at its full speed, whereas quiet mode places a speed limit on the fans to ensure low noise levels.

▶️ Checkerboard Matrix fin design

One of the eye-catching features of the Assassin VC Elite is its use of a checkerboard matrix on its fins, a design choice which is said to help maintain increased levels of air pressure.



The checkerboard matrix is only incorporated into one side of the cooler; the other sides of the heatsinks use a jigsaw-style fin design.



▶️ Sturdy metal backplate

For users of Intel platforms, a sturdy metal backplate is included – much stronger than typical backplates included with air coolers!



▶️ Complete RAM Compatibility, no matter the size of DDR5



On standard AMD and Intel systems, the DeepCool Assassin VC Elite will not overhang or interfere with DIMM slots in any way, ensuring full compatibility with the tallest DDR4 or DDR5 RAM sticks.

▶️ Premium DM9 thermal paste

DeepCool includes its premium DM9 paste with the Assassin VC Elite, which is one of the best thermal pastes out there,on par with ID-Cooling's Frost X45!



▶️ Mixed size fans

Like its predecessor, the Assassin IV, DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite sports two fans of mixed sizes – 120mm and 140mm, which is said to create a “vortex” effect that increases static air pressure.



▶️ Adapter for (optional) third fan

For those who want the absolute best performance possible, DeepCool has included a bracket adapter that will allow you to install a third fan to the unit if you desire. But as we'll see in testing, that's not necessary for most setups.



▶️ Two-in-one screwdriver with Torx and Phillips support

DeepCool also includes a basic screwdriver that supports Phillips screws on one end and torx screws on the other.



▶️ Real world testing configuration – Intel LGA1700 and AMD AM5 platform:

I place an emphasis on having results that are comparable to real-world use. This means I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they really are. And some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions.

I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is used.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

In order to prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

We've recently added testing of AMD's new flagship sixteen-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is one beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market – and can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

As with previous DeepCool products, this cooler's installation is fairly easy.



1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.



2. Next you'll need to install the standoffs. Intel users will slide the black standoffs onto the backplate's studs.



AMD users will instead take the silver standoffs and screw them against the motherboard.



3. Next, you'll want to take the mounting bars and apply them to the standoffs, then secure them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy how to apply thermal paste guide.

5. Next, you'll need to take the unit's cover off, and pull the middle fan from the unit – make sure you disconnect the PWM cord before doing so. Then take the cooler, press it against the mounting bars, and secure it with the included screwdriver.



6. Reinsert the middle fan.



7. Reattach the unit's cover and connect the PWM cables to your motherboard, and you are good to go.

Stability issues cited as the reason.

Gigabyte has quietly removed an unofficial PCIe 5.0 option from its B650 motherboards with the latest BIOS updates. The change has sparked significant furor among enthusiasts who noticed the tweak after flashing their boards. This only affects the PCIe x16 slot reserved for GPUs, and not the x4 M.2 slots that Gen5 SSDs would use.

According to reports on Reddit and Chiphell, the removal first occurred in BIOS version F35 for models like the B650 Gaming X AX V2. Users who previously saw a “Gen 5” setting for the primary PCIe x16 slot in BIOS now found the option missing entirely, with link speeds capped at PCIe 4.0. Rolling back to BIOS F34 brings PCIe 5.0 support back, confirming this was a BIOS functionality change.

Interestingly, Gigabyte never officially advertised PCIe 5.0 support for B650 motherboards. AMD's specifications clearly limit full PCIe 5.0 capability to the B650E and X670E chipsets. However, because some B650 boards share PCB layouts with their “E” counterparts, the feature remained accessible—at least until now. Moreover, B650 boards do have 4x PCIe Gen5 lanes meant to serve an SSD but not enough for an actual Gen5 GPU.

So, why remove it? According to folks on Chiphell, enabling Gen 5 on B650 boards was causing stability issues for some GPUs. An MSI insider known as “Hugable Carrot” even suggested that other vendors may follow Gigabyte's lead, calling PCIe Gen 5 graphics cards “too troublesome” on these mid-tier chipsets.

However, the removal of this PCIe x16 slot feature wasn't listed in Gigabyte's BIOS changelog, and this lack of transparency has drawn criticism. The same Reddit user, who first reported this change, also shared benchmarks in his post showing a slight performance drop after updating to F35—losing 15 points in Steel Nomad and 3–5 FPS in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Dying Light 2. While PCIe 4.0 x16 is more than enough for modern GPUs, issues can arise when bandwidth is halved to x8, which can significantly impact performance on low-end cards like the RTX 5060 Ti.

For now, Gigabyte has already pulled BIOS F35 from its support page and replaced it with F36, which likely keeps the PCIe 5.0 option disabled. If you value that Gen 5 toggle—even if it offered no real-world gains for most people—staying on F34 might be your best bet.



As highlighted by others, removing PCIe 5.0 from B650 boards likely comes down to stability and compliance. PCIe Gen 5 signals require stricter PCB design and higher-quality components to maintain integrity, which B650 boards weren't officially validated for. Allowing users to enable Gen 5 could lead to unpredictable behavior, RMAs, and compatibility headaches—issues Gigabyte (and AMD) want to avoid.

The bigger question is whether this sets a trend. If that MSI insider is correct, more vendors could start locking down “hidden” Gen 5 support on mid-range boards, reinforcing AMD's segmentation between B650, B650E, and X670E chipsets.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

At the turn of the 20th century, the renowned mathematician David Hilbert had a grand ambition to bring a more rigorous, mathematical way of thinking into the world of physics. At the time, physicists were still plagued by debates about basic definitions—what is heat? how are molecules structured?—and Hilbert hoped that the formal logic of mathematics could provide guidance.

On the morning of August 8, 1900, he delivered a list of 23 key math problems to the International Congress of Mathematicians. Number six: Produce airtight proofs of the laws of physics.

The scope of Hilbert's sixth problem was enormous. He asked “to treat in the same manner [as geometry], by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an important part.”

His challenge to axiomatize physics was “really a program,” said Dave Levermore, a mathematician at the University of Maryland. “The way the sixth problem is actually stated, it's never going to be solved.”

But Hilbert provided a starting point. To study different properties of a gas—say, the speed of its molecules, or its average temperature—physicists use different equations. In particular, they use one set of equations to describe how individual molecules in a gas move, and another to describe the behavior of the gas as a whole. Was it possible, Hilbert wondered, to show that one set of equations implied the other—that these equations were, as physicists had assumed but hadn't rigorously proved, simply different ways of modeling the same reality?

For 125 years, even axiomatizing this small corner of physics seemed impossible. Mathematicians made partial progress, coming up with proofs that only worked when they considered the behavior of gases on extremely short timescales or in other contrived situations. But these fell short of the kind of result that Hilbert had imagined.

In 1900, David Hilbert came up with a list of 23 problems to guide the next century of mathematical research. His sixth problem challenged mathematicians to axiomatize physics.

Now, three mathematicians have finally provided such a result. Their work not only represents a major advance in Hilbert's program, but also taps into questions about the irreversible nature of time.

“It's a beautiful work,” said Gregory Falkovich, a physicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “A tour de force.”

Consider a gas whose particles are very spread out. There are many ways a physicist might model it.

At a microscopic level, the gas is composed of individual molecules that act like billiard balls, moving through space according to Isaac Newton's 350-year-old laws of motion. This model of the gas's behavior is called the hard-sphere particle system.

Now zoom out a bit. At this new “mesoscopic” scale, your field of vision encompasses too many molecules to individually track. Instead, you'll model the gas using an equation that the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann developed in the late 19th century. Called the Boltzmann equation, it describes the likely behavior of the gas's molecules, telling you how many particles you can expect to find at different locations moving at different speeds. This model of the gas lets physicists study how air moves at small scales—for instance, how it might flow around a space shuttle.

“What mathematicians do to physicists is they wake us up.”

Zoom out again, and you can no longer tell that the gas is made up of individual particles. It acts like one continuous substance. To model this macroscopic behavior—how dense the gas is and how fast it's moving at any point in space—you'll need yet another set of equations, called the Navier-Stokes equations.

Physicists view these three different models of the gas's behavior as compatible; they're simply different lenses for understanding the same thing. But mathematicians hoping to contribute to Hilbert's sixth problem wanted to prove that rigorously. They needed to show that Newton's model of individual particles gives rise to Boltzmann's statistical description, and that Boltzmann's equation in turn gives rise to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Mathematicians have had some success with the second step, proving that it's possible to derive a macroscopic model of a gas from a mesoscopic one in various settings. But they couldn't resolve the first step, leaving the chain of logic incomplete.

Now that's changed. In a series of papers, the mathematicians Yu Deng, Zaher Hani, and Xiao Ma proved the harder microscopic-to-mesoscopic step for a gas in one of these settings, completing the chain for the first time. The result and the techniques that made it possible are “paradigm-shifting,” said Yan Guo of Brown University.

Yu Deng usually studies the behavior of systems of waves. But by applying his expertise to the realm of particles, he has now resolved a major open problem in mathematical physics.

Boltzmann could already show that Newton's laws of motion give rise to his mesoscopic equation, so long as one crucial assumption holds true: that the particles in the gas move more or less independently of each other. That is, it must be very rare for a particular pair of molecules to collide with each other multiple times.

But Boltzmann could not definitively demonstrate that this assumption was true. “What he could not do, of course, is prove theorems about this,” said Sergio Simonella of Sapienza University in Rome. “There was no structure, there were no tools at the time.”

The physicist Ludwig Boltzmann studied the statistical properties of fluids.

After all, there are infinitely many ways a collection of particles might collide and recollide. “You just get this huge explosion of possible directions that they can go,” Levermore said—making it a “nightmare” to actually prove that scenarios involving many recollisions are as rare as Boltzmann needed them to be.

In 1975, a mathematician named Oscar Lanford managed to prove this, but only for extremely short time periods. (The exact amount of time depends on the initial state of the gas, but it's less than the blink of an eye, according to Simonella.) Then the proof broke down; before most of the particles got the chance to collide even once, Lanford could no longer guarantee that recollisions would remain a rare occurrence.

In the decades since, many mathematicians tried to extend his result, to no avail.

Then, in November 2023, Deng, now at the University of Chicago, and Hani, of the University of Michigan, posted a preprint that teased the desired proof. A forthcoming paper, they wrote, would build off their latest result to investigate “the long-time extension of Lanford's theorem.”

Other mathematicians didn't know what to make of the announcement. “I didn't think it was possible,” said Pierre Germain of Imperial College London. Deng and Hani didn't even usually work with particle systems; until that point, they'd mainly been studying systems made up of waves (like rays of light).

So mathematicians eagerly awaited the promised proof.

Deng and Hani's 2023 result involved an analysis of the transition from the microscopic scale to the mesoscopic scale in the context of waves. About a year before the mathematicians posted their paper online, Deng was at a conference, where he met with a graduate student at Princeton University named Xiao Ma. They ended up discussing Deng and Hani's work, and how they might adapt the methods to particles. Doing so would allow them to extend Lanford's result—to show that particle recollisions are rare even on longer timescales.

It was an idea that Deng and Hani had already been considering. Impressed by Ma's insights on the topic, Deng invited him to help them turn their intuition into a proof.

The trio hoped to focus on a much-studied scenario where mathematicians had already proved the second, meso-to-macro step in Hilbert's sixth problem. In this scenario, a dilute gas of spherical particles is trapped in a box. If a particle hits one of the box's walls, it reappears on the opposite wall.

But to prove the harder micro-to-meso step for this setting—thereby resolving Hilbert's sixth problem—Deng, Hani, and Ma had to port their wave-based techniques over to particles. So they started in a setting where that task would be a little bit easier. They worked with a gas whose particles are distributed randomly in an infinite amount of space; unlike the particles in the boxed gas, which keep bouncing off each other forever, these particles eventually disperse and stop colliding. “In the whole-space case, there is a shortcut,” Deng said.

The three mathematicians first needed to tabulate the different patterns of collisions that might occur in their gas, and how likely each of those patterns was. They could easily rule out scenarios with particularly high rates of recollisions. This left them with a finite, though still massive, number of patterns to analyze—each involving a certain subset of particles colliding, in a certain order. Once they knew exactly what each pattern entailed, they could use that information to estimate its likelihood of occurring.

But that often felt like an impossible task, because many of the patterns involved huge numbers of particles and intricate, indirect interactions between them. “The structure of these sets [of colliding particles] gets exceedingly complicated,” Deng said. In principle, the mathematicians would need to keep track of every one of these particles simultaneously to compute the probability estimates they needed.

That's where Deng and Hani's previous work on waves gave them an important insight. In that result, they'd figured out ways to break up complicated patterns of interacting waves into simpler ones. They'd carefully crafted their technique so that, by working with only a few waves at a time, they could still get a good estimate for the likelihood of the more complicated complete wave pattern.

They hoped the same idea would work in the particle setting.

But after a collision, particles behave very differently from waves. For instance, particles, unlike waves, bounce off each other, greatly affecting the resulting pattern of collisions and its probability of happening. Deng, Hani and Ma needed to rework the details of their strategy from the beginning.

Zaher Hani studies solutions to equations that arise in oceanography, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics.

First, they tackled the simplest cases, in which each particle collides just a few times over a very short time span, with no recollisions. They then gradually moved on to harder and harder cases—longer amounts of time, with more collisions and recollisions.

It was as much an art as a science. “The intuition was developed gradually, starting with some unsuccessful attempts,” Deng said. They had to get a sense for how to slice up large, complicated patterns of particle collisions in a way that would simplify their calculations while keeping their estimates highly accurate.

“This is a process that takes months,” Hani said. “We would be stuck constantly.” Nearly every day, they jumped on a Zoom meeting to talk things through. “Much to the dismay of my wife, some of them happened very late at night, or very early in the morning,” Hani said. “I would put my daughter to sleep, and then we would have two or three hours of Zoom meetings.”

Finally, by the spring of 2024, the trio was sure they had covered everything. Their proof, which they posted online that summer, confirmed that recollisions had to be very, very uncommon. They'd shown, as they'd hoped to, that in their infinite-space setting, Boltzmann's description of the gas could be derived from Newton's. The microscopic and mesoscopic scales fell under a single rigorous mathematical framework.

“I think it's outstanding work,” said Alexandru Ionescu, a mathematician at Princeton who was also Deng's and Ma's doctoral adviser. “These are some of the most significant advances in many, many years.”

They were now ready to return to the gas-in-a-box setting, where they could finally solve Hilbert's sixth problem.

It didn't take long for them to extend their result from the infinite-space setting to the boxed one. “Eighty percent of the proof is still the same in the whole-space case,” Deng said.

In March, they posted a new paper that combined their proof with the earlier results connecting the Boltzmann equation to the Navier-Stokes equations. The logical chain was complete: They'd shown that, for a realistic model of a gas, a microscopic description of individual particles does indeed ultimately give rise to a macroscopic description of the gas's large-scale behavior.

The work didn't just mark the resolution of a major case of Hilbert's sixth problem. It also provided a rigorous mathematical resolution of an old paradox.

At the microscopic scale, where particles act like billiard balls, time is reversible. Newton's equations predict both where a particle comes from and where it's going. The future is not fundamentally different from the past.

But at the mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, there is no going back in time. “We know very well that, going forward in time, one ages but does not rejuvenate; heat does not spontaneously pass from a cold body to a warm body; a drop of ink in a glass of water spreads, darkening the liquid, but does not spontaneously return to the small, round shape it originally had,” Simonella wrote. Neither the Boltzmann equation nor the Navier-Stokes equations are time-reversible; if you try to run time backward, the results will be nonsensical.

To Boltzmann's contemporaries, this was perplexing. How could a time-irreversible equation be derived from a time-reversible system?

But Boltzmann argued that there was no paradox: Even if each particle can be modeled in a time-reversible way, almost every collision pattern ends up with a gas dispersing. The chance of, say, a gas suddenly contracting is essentially zero.

Lanford had confirmed this intuition mathematically for his very short time frame. Now Deng, Hani, and Ma's result confirms it for more realistic situations.

Going forward, mathematicians—who are still poring over the details of the new proof—want to test whether similar techniques might be useful in other, even more realistic contexts. These might include gases made up of particles of different shapes, or particles that interact in more complicated ways.

Meanwhile, Falkovich said, these sorts of rigorous proofs can help physicists understand why a gas behaves a certain way at various scales, and why different models might be more or less effective in different scenarios. “What mathematicians do to physicists,” he said, “is they wake us up.”

Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all reported quarterly earnings this week, and there was a common thread tying them together: a boom in AI spending and plans to increase it even more, beyond analyst expectations.

Although capital expenditures above expectations often don't tend to make investors particularly happy, it had pretty much the opposite effect this week, especially for Meta and Microsoft, both of which saw a pop in their stock following the releases.

And for Microsoft, which posted its largest ever quarterly capital expenditure forecast, the boost in shares led the tech giant to become the second-ever company to hit $4 trillion market valuation, when it briefly breached the threshold on Thursday.

The move was largely because both Meta and Microsoft finally had the revenue to show for their investments.

Meta's ad revenue, which is a huge moneymaker for the tech giant, for the past quarter came in a couple billion dollars ahead of Wall Street expectations, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed that to the deployment of artificial intelligence in the ad system. Zuckerberg went on to assure investors that this surprise increase in revenue was bound to continue, saying that his multi-billion dollar investment into building a team dedicated to creating “superintelligent” AI will lead to even more payoffs for its advertising business.

Microsoft reported that sales were up 18% from last year and that revenue for its cloud computing platform Azure had surpassed $75 billion this fiscal year, up 34% from last year. Revenue from the company's productivity and business processes segment also exceeded expectations, and company executives shared that the business software sales were boosted partially thanks to widespread adoption of its AI product Microsoft 365 Copilot.

All the news combined brings to mind one question: Is Silicon Valley's AI bet finally starting to pay off?

Meta has been in the midst of a multi-billion dollar AI push after Zuckerberg admitted that the company had fallen behind competitors in the AI race. The push has been marked by high profile strategic talent hires, and particularly the poaching of OpenAI employees tempted by multi-year deals worth millions of dollars.

In the meantime, the company is going all in on data centers as well. Last month, Zuckerberg said that Meta would be investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI data centers. The company's first of multiple multi-gigawatt data centers is to be unveiled next year, and Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads account that just one of these data centers “covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.”

This week, Meta said it's expecting to shell out between $66 billion and $72 billion this year, and that it expects to spend even more next year on data centers and hiring.

Microsoft, on the other hand, said that it is expecting to spend more than $100 billion next year, with much of it going toward AI. This upcoming quarter alone, the company is eyeing $30 billion in capital expenditures, again mostly for AI, in what is a record forecast for the company.

Apple also posted better than expected revenue on its earnings report this week, but that was mostly attributable to iPhone sales. Despite that, CEO Tim Cook told investors during the company's earnings call that the tech giant was planning to “significantly” increase its investments in AI to catch up with rivals and was open to acquisitions to do so.

One of the biggest concerns when it comes to AI is regarding spending. Even though Silicon Valley is pouring in countless dollars—over $300 billion this year alone, according to numbers from the Financial Times—not everyone believes demand for AI will scale up accordingly. And if it does not, it would cause a major problem for the industry.

In a paper published earlier last month, the Federal Reserve claimed the biggest challenge with generative AI was not the potential of the tech itself but rather getting people and businesses to actually use it. The technology isn't necessarily adopted widely outside of tech, science, and finance fields, and is deployed mostly by large firms. 

As the technology gets better, demand for AI is bound to increase, too, but by just how much is a mystery. If that demand does not grow as expected, the Fed paper warns, it could have “disastrous consequences,” much like the railroad overexpansion of the 1800s and the economic depression that followed.

The answer to whether or not AI demand will scale up to the level of investment is still not a definitive yes or a no, but this round of earnings gave a substantial dose of hope to the AI bulls.

But the risk for overspending is still there, as the tech giants continue to make record pledges of investment: if the increase in investments isn't followed by a tangible increase in demand and revenue, especially for the companies' core businesses, then the possibility of “disastrous consequences” is still there.

At the end of May and the start of June, Real Madrid focused heavily on incoming transfers. They signed Dean Huijsen and appointed Xabi Alonso as the new coach.

Trent Alexander-Arnold also arrived from Liverpool for £10 million - more than the club initially wanted to pay. Since then, there have been only a couple of further signings.

Franco Mastantuono joined shortly before the Club World Cup, while Álvaro Carreras signed just after the tournament ended. Since then, the focus has shifted to outgoings and contract extensions.

A few players have left Castilla for greener pastures, with more departures rumoured, while several players have also signed new contracts.

The latest is Brahim Díaz, who will remain a Real Madrid player for the next five years.

The agreement is already in place, according to a report from MARCA. He has also rejected offers from other clubs in the process.

The report states that Fenerbahce tried to sign him earlier this summer, while Benfica made a recent inquiry - both approaches were turned down by the player.

From both the player's and the club's side, it has been clear that the relationship should continue.

What makes it even better is that Brahim probably would have had a starting role at both Benfica and Fenerbahce, but he turned them down to remain a crucial squad player, as he seems to be happy with his role.

He has been impactful in that role, often used in tight games to unlock defences.

Brahim still needs to work on parts of his game, such as not holding onto the ball for too long and making the right final pass.

However, even during the Club World Cup, it was clear he was improving under Xabi Alonso in their short time together before the season began.

There is excitement about what more he can offer over the coming years.

Hopefully, Brahim Díaz continues to grow as a player, remains a key squad option, and stays at the club for as long as he remains valuable.

With a season as long as the last one, it was made clear in the worst way possible that Real Madrid always need brilliant squad players like Brahim Diaz, and he will once again be crucial for the club - there is no doubt about it.

U.S. men's national team winger Timothy Weah looks set to leave Juventus ahead of the 2025–26 European season, with a move to Ligue 1's Olympique Marseille reportedly lined up.

Weah, 25, joined the Serie A giants in 2023 but struggled to make a significant impact and looked to be outside of head coach Igor Tudor's plans for the upcoming season. Tensions became frayed. Last week, Weah's representative, Badou Sambague, spoke out against Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, accusing the Turin club of showing “total disrespect” to his client after Comolli criticized Weah's push to join Marseille over other clubs. 

“The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli fired back. “And the offer hasn't arrived yet.”

Now, it appears as though a deal will be done. Marseille have “verbally agreed” to loan Weah for the 2025–26 campaign in a deal which includes an obligation to buy, per Fabrizio Romano. The Ligue 1 outfit are expected to pay €1 million ($1.16 million) for the loan through the end of the season before committing to a €14 million ($17.4 million) transfer fee next summer.

The clubs have also reportedly agreed on €3 million ($3.48 million) of add-ons and a sell-on clause for the player who scored seven goals in 78 matches with the Bianconeri. 

Signing with Marseille, Weah joins demanding Italian manager Roberto de Zerbi. He also returns to France's top flight, where he previously had stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Lille. With the latter, Weah scored eight goals in 107 matches, helping them win a surprise Ligue 1 title in 2020–21. 

The new club and return to the league should also set Weah up for regular minutes ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in North America, where he could be among the key pieces for the USMNT. 

This summer, Weah was unable to join the USMNT for the Concacaf Gold Cup due to Juventus FIFA Club World Cup commitments, but only played 45 minutes in their four matches through the quarterfinals of the tournament. 

With Marseille, he becomes the latest North American to join the club alongside Canadian center back Derek Cornelius. He will hope for a better fate than another Canadian, Ismael Koné, who had a very public falling out with De Zerbi and is now at Sassuolo in Serie A. 

Marseille open the Ligue 1 season against Rennes on Aug. 15, and will also compete in the 2025–26 edition of the UEFA Champions League.

Tottenham Hotspur are now trying again to sign a France international after they failed to convince him to come to N17 during the January window.

Thomas Frank has admitted that Tottenham may not be done adding to their forward line this summer, despite landing Mohammed Kudus from West Ham earlier this summer.

That might be down to the fact that Heung-min Son is edging closer to a move to Los Angeles FC.

Now, the Lilywhites have expressed an interest in a Paris Saint-Germain star just two weeks before they take on the Ligue 1 giants in the UEFA Super Cup clash.

It was revealed last month that Tottenham had been contacted about Randal Kolo Muani's availability after his permanent move to Juventus stalled.

It has now been revealed by The Times that Spurs have renewed their interest in the forward as Thomas Frank's men look to add to their attack after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White.

The outlet says that the North Londoners were keen on landing Kolo Muani in January prior to his move to Turin, and they are now trying again this summer.

According to a recent update from TBR Football, PSG are demanding €50m (£43.3m) for Kolo Muani after Luis Enrique deemed the striker surplus to requirements.

However, the same update revealed that Manchester United and Newcastle United are also interested in the Frenchman.

Earlier this summer, Chelsea were also credited with an interest in Kolo Muani, which means that a deal for the former Eintracht Frankfurt man may not be straightforward for the Lilywhites to complete.

					Bridging the gap				

Paryaj Lakay, a sports betting and casino company based in Pétion-Ville, has supported the Haitian men's under-17 soccer team by donating 19.8 million gourdes—about $150,000—to aid their preparation for the Qatar 2025 FIFA World Cup in that category. This donation highlights betting platform funds as a new source of financing for Haiti's sports sector and renews its longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship.

CAP-HAÏTIEN — Sports betting and casino company Paryaj Lakay, Haitian Creole for Home Bet, has partnered with the Haitian Football Federation (FHF) to help prepare the men's under-17 national soccer team for the 2025 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in Qatar in November. According to its Aug. 1 Facebook post, the Pétion-Ville-based company has donated through its foundation 19.8 million gourdes—approximately $150,000—to the FHF to ensure the team arrives in the best possible condition for the competition. 

“They are our future,” the betting platform officials wrote. “There's no bigger pride than waving our flag for the world to see.”

The donation is among the largest ever made by a Haitian betting platform to a national sports entity—signaling the country's growing reliance on private betting sponsors amid chronic underfunding from the government and lack of transparency from national federations. The country's sports sector, particularly soccer, has a longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship—notably the lottery industry, mostly known as bòlèt. 

FHF confirmed the partnership in a July 31 statement, adding that a donation feature is also active on the ParyajLakay.com site to allow public contributions.

“Through this gesture, the Paryaj Lakay Foundation reaffirms its commitment to Haitian youth and launches a call for national mobilization,” the statement read.

Despite appreciation for the donation, many Haitians remain concerned that the funds won't be used as intended.

“We can't trust them [FHF],” said Varona Jean-Charles, a soccer fan from Léogâne. “Yes, Paryaj Lakay is trying to save the team, but people in the federation might not use all of it on the team. We must have doubts. We live in a corrupt country.”

Jean-Charles, 28, said he still plans to contribute through Paryaj Lakay's platform—but with reservations.

“If they misuse my money, karma will hit them,” he said, calling for  Haiti's Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) to audit FHF spending.

Others echoed his sentiments on social media.

“It would've been great if this money did exactly what it's supposed to do,” wrote Facebook user Vilgard Charles.

“Yes, Paryaj Lakay is trying to save the team, but people in the federation might not use all of it on the team. We must have doubts. We live in a corrupt country.”

The exact breakdown of how the $150,000 will be used remains unclear, and neither FHF nor Paryaj Lakay responded to messages from The Haitian Times seeking comment.

The FHF has long faced allegations of embezzlement and unaccountability. In 2017, for instance, FIFA donated half a million US dollars to rehabilitate six fields damaged by Hurricane Matthew—funds that failed to yield visible results.

In 2019, Haiti's senior men's national team made a historic run to the Gold Cup semifinals, yet players never received their promised bonuses. According to  AyiboPost, the federation received $200,000 from CONCACAF for that tournament.

This pattern of missing funds continues to cast doubt on even well-intentioned contributions.

Haiti's under-17 team is currently in Port-au-Prince with 26 players for the first phase of training. On July 29, they defeated local club Abeilles FC in a friendly match. They will travel to the south and the north this month to continue with their training and play more warm-up games. 

The second phase will take place in Jamaica from August 31 to September 14. The final phase will be held in Spain from September 15 through October 31 before traveling to Qatar.

At the 2025 U-17 FIFA World Cup,  Les Grenadiers will face Egypt on Nov. 4, England on Nov. 7, and Venezuela on Nov. 10 in the group stage.

The Newcastle striker is at the centre of this summer's longest-running tug of war in a throwback to some epic transfer tussles of the past

Newcastle wantaway Alexander Isak is pulling out all the textbook moves to force a switch to Liverpool; having told the Magpies he wants to leave, the striker has been left out of a friendly, pulled out of the pre-season tour and, of course, gone 'AWOL'. It's a throwback to some of the great transfer sagas of years gone by, and it seems to have some way to run yet.

A matter of days after Liverpool made their interest clear, Isak was sent home ahead of Newcastle's friendly defeat to Celtic having been unsettled by the intense speculation surrounding him. Then, after Al-Hilal joined the race for his signature, the striker was left out of the Magpies' pre-season tour to Asia due to a supposed thigh injury.

Reports that he had gone 'AWOL' soon followed amid the Tynesiders' refusal to sell, and it emerged that he had been training at former club Real Sociedad in Spain, rather than at Newcastle's facilities, in a bid to get back to full fitness. Isak wants to join the Reds, and it's even been claimed that he could even take the 'nuclear' option of unilaterally terminating his contract to make the move happen.

This one's not over yet, but how does the saga centring around Isak compare to some of the most infamous in football history? GOAL runs through the top 10:

World Cup

This is the eighth in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. The previous articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962. This time, it's the turn of England in 1966.

The codifiers of association football had a mediocre record at the World Cup until hosting it. England hadn't entered the first three tournaments because the FA were still refusing to be a part of FIFA. In their four attempts since deciding to take part, England had twice reached the quarter-finals, but had twice been eliminated at the group stage.

Yet England still enjoyed great reverence across the footballing world. In 1963, the FA celebrated its centenary by hosting a game between England and a Rest of the World XI, a genuine collection of the best footballers from every other nation. England won 2-1. Even accounting for home advantage and the unfamiliarity of the opposition players with one another, it's clear England had outstanding individuals. The spine of Gordon Banks, Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton were all arguably the best in the world in their position.

But they needed home advantage to become the world champions. And while hosting the tournament has always increased the chances of success, particularly in the early days of the World Cup, this was the first time since the opening two editions — Uruguay and Italy — that the hosts actually won it.

Upon taking charge of England in October 1962, Alf Ramsey declared that England would win the World Cup. It was a bold claim.

But this was a manager who had recently completed something even more unlikely than winning the World Cup with the host nation. In 1955, aged 35, he'd taken charge of Ipswich Town, in the third tier of English football. Two years later, he won promotion to the second tier. Four years after that, he won promotion to the First Division. And then he promptly won the title at his first attempt. Even when considering that the gap between the divisions was less substantial than in the modern age, this was an unprecedented transformation of a club. Sensing things couldn't get much better, he left Suffolk for the England job.

Ramsey had been a no-nonsense England full-back in his playing days, including at World Cup 1950. He also scored the final goal in England's most famous defeat, the 6-3 loss to Hungary at Wembley in 1953. He was never overwhelmingly popular with the press or supporters, but he never tried to be.

He remained in charge of England for another eight years after this World Cup success, before being sacked when he failed to qualify for World Cup 1974. He was barely seen afterwards, aside from a brief stint in charge of Birmingham City, when he'd originally joined to serve on the board. But Ramsey really only had two major jobs in his coaching career, and he won the First Division and then won the World Cup.

Ramsey was, in a sense, the first proper England manager. Until the Second World War, there had been no official position of head coach, and the squad was selected by a selection committee. This seems bizarre today, but in a world before matches were widely televised, and when all weekend matches kicked off at the same time, it was thought that keeping across the entire First Division (and beyond) was impossible. England merely had a ‘trainer' in charge of tactics.

Walter Winterbottom is generally considered England's first official head coach, but he was also the FA's first director of coaching, and used to joke — maybe half-joke — that “the job had a sideline to it: manager of the England teams”. The plural reflects that he was in charge of both the main England team and the amateur equivalent, and genuinely seemed to consider this of less overall importance than his other role. Besides, he also had his squad picked by an eight-man selection committee.

Ramsey, almost routinely described as ‘not an establishment figure', wasn't going to stand for any of that and was given full control of picking the England squad and starting XI. “It's a new position,” he said upon his appointment. “This sort of thing has never been done before and I think we'll have to find out what we can do. It's something that has to be established and something that one has to find out about.”

Ramsey was considered unusual for picking a full 22-man squad for every international break; in the days before substitutes, it was previously considered enough to pick a much smaller group.

England's success didn't convince everyone that the position of England manager was necessary. In the early 1980s, Brian Glanville, the most revered 20th-century English football writer in English football, wrote a World Soccer column claiming that England had generally coped fine without one, although this was partly a dig at the poor performance of Ramsey's successors, Don Revie and Ron Greenwood.

Surprisingly, for a country not renowned for being overly interested in tactics, England are unique in that their World Cup-winning side had a nickname describing their tactical approach: these were ‘Ramsey's wingless wonders'. A telling sign of this approach is that England's centre-forwards can be seen taking throw-ins in the final.

The idea of playing without wingers was almost unthinkable before World Cup 1966. English football's most adored players were wingers — in the previous decade, they'd fielded Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney in the same side. And in Ramsey's early days in charge, he put great emphasis upon the importance of wingers. But his sides became increasingly narrow. He started the tournament with Manchester United's outside forward John Connelly, something of a forgotten figure, in the side. But by the end of the tournament, England barely had any width at all.

The eventual starting XI was difficult to describe in terms of system, but players had very clear characteristics. Moore was the refined ball-playing defender, while Jack Charlton was more old-school. Both full-backs pushed forward. Nobby Stiles was a combative defensive midfielder who came under fire for his tackling during this tournament, and his presence allowed Martin Peters to roam. On the right, Alan Ball was something between a box-to-box player and a wide man, and notable for his sheer energy in the final, while Charlton very vaguely played from the left but was more of a No 10.

Up front was the biggest talking point. Jimmy Greaves, the greatest goalscorer in English top-flight history, dropped out of the starting XI through injury midway through the tournament and never regained his place. Hurst, who had only made his debut earlier in the year but had headed the quarter-final winner against an infamously physical Argentina side, remained in the team. Ramsey also stuck with Roger Hunt, who lacked Greaves' natural talent but had a reputation as a hard worker.

That, for many, symbolised Ramsey — an admirer of disciplined workers rather than talented individualists.



You can make a case for various players. Hurst scored a hat-trick in the final. Moore was the captain and became the symbol of England's victory. Banks was a truly legendary goalkeeper. Ball was the best performer in the final.

But ultimately England's true star was Bobby Charlton, a player who won that year's Ballon d'Or and finished second in the subsequent two years. A rampaging attacking midfielder who was the all-time top goalscorer for both Manchester United and England until Wayne Rooney surpassed him in both respects (Harry Kane since surpassed Charlton and Rooney for England goals), he produced the best individual moment of England's campaign with a brilliant goal in the group stage win over Mexico, running from the halfway line, feinting to go on his left foot, before chopping onto his right and firing into the top corner from 30 yards.

“He was one of the greatest players I have ever seen,” Ramsey later said. “He was very much the linchpin of the 1966 team. Early in my management, I knew I had to find a role suitable to Bobby's unique talents.” That was a particular compliment from a manager who hadn't appreciated the talents of other big-name attackers. Charlton, unusually considering he was England's third-most advanced player, wore No 9 in the tournament, partly a reflection of the fact that Ramsey had previously used him as a centre-forward.

Charlton's best display for England came in the semi-final win over Portugal, where he lit up the game with his passing — sometimes considered a relative weakness compared to other greats in his role — and also scored both goals in a 2-1 win.

The quality of that display led to him being quieter in the final, however. West Germany manager Helmut Schon was so scared of Charlton's goalscoring threat that he instructed Franz Beckenbauer, at this point renowned as an exciting attacking midfielder, to man-mark Charlton out of the game. Broadly speaking, Beckenbauer managed that, but possibly at the expense of West Germany's own attacking threat.

Overall, a really good game between two sides — Beckenbauer's role aside — focused on pushing forward and attacking. Helmut Haller put West Germany ahead after a rare mistake from Ray Wilson, before Hurst headed home unmarked from Moore's flighted free kick.

Goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski was often criticised for not coming to claim this cross — and the way he stood behind his line and simply pointed at Hurst did look rather odd — but he'd previously taken a bad knock when coming for another cross and was therefore hesitant to leave his line again.

Peters seemed to have won the game with a simple volley at a corner, after Hurst's effort had been blocked and looped up into the air, but then defender Wolfgang Weber scored an even scrappier goal to equalise in the penultimate minute.

That meant extra time. Ramsey famously told his players that they'd won the game once, and now they had to do so again.

There are two options from extra time. You can argue that England's goal to go 3-2 ahead is the most famous moment — on the turn, Hurst smashed the ball against the bar. It bounced down onto the line and then out. The goal was given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who became referred to as “the Russian linesman” in England, although he hailed from present-day Azerbaijan. In fact, he's such a hero in the otherwise unremarkable footballing nation of Azerbaijan that the country's former national stadium was named after him.

Without wanting to go over the nuances of a 59-year debate and the various modern technological attempts to prove it one way or another, it seems unlikely the ball actually crossed the line. The common argument from Hurst is that it must have been over because England striker Hunt turned away to appeal for the goal rather than heading in the rebound. This is somewhat disingenuous; Hunt wasn't at the right angle to tell, and the ball was bouncing slightly past him anyway.

England at least scored a fourth, although there was further confusion here. Referee Gottfried Dienst had put his whistle to his lips, seemingly about to blow for full time, before waving on the play. This meant some England supporters had started their pitch invasion with the play still going on, with Hurst sent in behind by a long ball. This prompted the most famous commentary line in British sporting history, courtesy of the BBC's Kenneth Wolstenholme. “Some people are on the pitch! They think it's all over,” and then, as Hurst slammed home another goal, “It is now.”

It was Moore's second assist of the final, and more significantly, Hurst's third goal — his hat-trick is analysed in more detail here. He remained the only hat-trick scorer in a World Cup final until Kylian Mbappe's for France in 2022. Hurst now proudly declares that he's the only hat-trick scorer in a World Cup final to finish on the winning side.

England were hardly hailed as spectacular winners across the world, especially in an era when Brazil were regularly winning the tournament with wonderful football, but this was a tournament of few genuine contenders. Caution and discipline in their first four matches, when they were underwhelming but kept four clean sheets, gave way to more impressive displays in their last two matches. They were the better side in open, entertaining games against both Portugal and West Germany.

It's difficult to identify who else should have won it. Hungary started promisingly before fading. The most praise was generally reserved for two first-time qualifiers: North Korea, who famously defeated Italy and then went 3-0 up against Portugal before losing 5-3. Portugal, the other key debutants, had the most revered player at the tournament, Eusebio. But they lost to England fair and square in the semi. The majority of matches were considered somewhat drab and overly aggressive at a time when a more defensive approach to football seemed to be on the rise.

The 1966 success is sometimes retrospectively framed as ‘the worst thing that could have happened to English football', as it convinced them to knuckle down and focus on hard running over talent. That always seems overly contrary, and besides, that wasn't Ramsey's fault — unlike Winterbottom, he wasn't the FA's director of coaching, too. His task was to win the World Cup, and he did.

As the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) prepared for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the conversation surrounding the squad became less about tactics and matchups—and more about who wasn't there. The absence of Christian Pulisic and other key American stars drew sharp criticism from pundits, former players, and fans alike. The decision has drawn mostly outrage, with some fans and former players labeling the move unpatriotic.

But now, a respected USMNT legend has come to the defense of Pulisic and his fellow absentees, backing their decision to rest and blasting their critics with a harsh nine-word claim that has reignited the national debate.

The 26-year-old's exclusion from the Gold Cup was not a surprise to U.S. Soccer insiders. The Milan forward played 57 matches for club and country in the 2024-25 season and requested time off to physically and mentally recharge. With the World Cup less than a year away, the decision was jointly made between the player, his team, and U.S. Soccer officials.

“Christian and his team approached the federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer,” U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker explained. “After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs.”

Despite this, the absence of Pulisic, along with other key players like Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, and Timothy Weah, sparked fierce criticism—most notably from Landon Donovan, who suggested some players lacked the commitment to represent their country.

During Fox Sports' broadcast of the UEFA Nations League final on June 8, Donovan appeared to criticize Pulisic—without naming him directly—by drawing a comparison to Cristiano Ronaldo. “This is what it means to represent your country. If you don't want to take that opportunity seriously and responsibly, then don't come in,” Donovan said. “Ronaldo is 40 years old. He's tired. He's still out there grinding.”

The remarks set off a firestorm. Pulisic responded days later during an appearance on CBS Sports' Call It What You Want. “To question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line,” he said. “My body started talking to me… I thought about what would be best for me leading into next year and the World Cup.”

Now, former USMNT captain Marcelo Balboa has joined the conversation—and he's not holding back. Speaking on the Call It What You Want podcast, Balboa defended Pulisic and criticized the growing negativity aimed at American stars.

“We all want to see soccer grow. We want this team to do well,” Balboa said. “Tell me—what good does it do, beating up Christian Pulisic every day, or Tyler Adams, or Weston McKennie? It makes no sense.”

And then came his boldest statement, a nine-word critique that captured attention across the U.S. soccer community: “There's a fine line between being negative and being an idiot.” Balboa acknowledged that scrutiny is part of the job, especially with the national team under a global spotlight, but emphasized that constructive criticism must not devolve into personal attacks. “We wanted this kind of pressure as athletes… But I've got their back and always will.”

While Mexico celebrates another historic milestone, questions loom around one of the region's other traditional powerhouses — particularly Christian Pulisic and the USMNT, who find themselves in unfamiliar territory.


CONCACAF's final stage of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup will feature 12 national teams split into three groups of four. Each team will play six home-and-away matches. The winner of each group will qualify directly for the World Cup, while the two best runners-up will move on to the intercontinental playoffs, giving the region a chance to send a record eight teams to the tournament.

Six-time world player of the year Marta came off the bench to score twice, including an equalizer in stoppage time, as Brazil came from behind three times before winning the penalty shootout 5-4 against Colombia on Saturday to secure their ninth Copa América Femenina title.

The 39-year-old Marta entered the match in the 82nd minute and scored in the sixth minute of stoppage time to level for Brazil at 3-3, before scoring again in extra time to have the Brazilians in front for the first time in the match.

Leicy Santos scored in the 115th to bring Colombia back level at 4-4 as the match went to a penalty shootout.

Goalkeeper Lorena Da Silva then saved two penalty kicks in the shootout to clinch Brazil's fifth title in a row at the continental championships, and beat Colombia for the fourth time in the past five finals.

Marta, who has played in six World Cups and six Olympics, has 122 goals in 206 games with Brazil.

Angelina Alonso in the 45th and Amanda Gutierres in the 80th also scored for the Brazil team that won the silver medal at the Paris Olympics, losing to the United States in the final.

Gutierres scored her sixth goal of the tournament to finish as the top scorer alongside Paraguay's Claudia Martinez.

Linda Caicedo in the 25th, Mayra Ramirez in the 88th and Santos scored for Colombia. The Colombians also had an own goal by Brazil defender Tarciane in the 69th as it took the lead three times before being pegged back in an extraordinary final.

The Brazilian women have won eight of the nine editions of the Copa América and are considered the best team in South America. Their best finish at the World Cup was runner-up in 2007, and they have reached the Olympic final three times.

Saturday's match at Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado in Ecuador was a rematch of the 2022 final that was played in Colombia and that Brazil won, 1-0.

Mark Lajal delivered a courageous performance to dramatically fend off five championship points to win the Bloomfield Hills Challenger and capture his second title at ATP Challenger Tour level. That same day, thousands of miles away in Estonia, Lajal's grandfather, Tõnu, was laid to rest.


Lajal wrote an Instagram post, dedicating his biggest career trophy to his grandfather, who was closely following the 22-year-old's career. The Estonian received the difficult news while in Los Cabos, where he was in the qualifying draw for the ATP 250.


“Definitely the first couple of days, you think about him, you think about the fact that you're never going to talk to him again,” Lajal told ATPTour.com, speaking about the loss of his grandfather. “It's a bizarre feeling. It's something you're not really used to and you gotta learn to live with it I guess.”


One of Lajal's fondest memories with his grandfather came earlier this season, when Tõnu was able to watch Estonia win a Davis Cup tie against Venezuela. It was the final time Tõnu saw his beloved grandson compete in person, a moment now even more meaningful following Tõnu's passing.


"He came to watch that match I played in Estonia and he really enjoyed it,” Lajal said. “That was definitely a nice memory, that he was there for the win.”


As Tõnu's health declined, Lajal continued to make his grandfather — and entire family — proud by his progress on the ATP Challenger Tour. But the quick, yet inevitable, timing of his Tõnu's passing presented a challenge while on the road.


“I think I handled it quite well because we all kind of knew that it was going to happen sooner or later. He was getting old and it was unfortunate, his health was getting worse,” Lajal said. “I didn't expect it to happen this soon, but I had already accepted that the timing was coming.”




After leaving Los Cabos, Lajal travelled to the ATP Challenger Tour 100 event in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he eventually saved five championship points — four behind his own serve — to dispatch Andres Martin 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6(9) after a three-hour, 22-minute battle. Lajal lifted the trophy in the air and looked up to the sky.


“It was very nice to do it because they had a ‘sending away' with our family in Estonia on the day of the final,” said Lajal, now at a career-high No. 147 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I think everything was perfect timing.”

The moment Alexander Zverev's career shifted was as raw as sports get. He was flying on court, one win away from reaching the top spot in the world rankings and chasing Grand Slam glory. Then, just like that, his season and his climb came to a painful halt. Fans and experts still wonder how different things would be if not for what happened at Roland Garros that day.

Zverev has been one of the most consistent players on the ATP Tour in recent years. In 2022, he recaptured his best form and was closer than ever to the World No. 1 ranking. But during the French Open semifinal that year, an ankle injury forced him off the court and brought his career goals to a screeching stop. Lately, Zverev has opened up about that moment and why it was so tough for him to deal with.

On a recent episode of the “Nothing Major” podcast, host John Isner got straight to it, asking Zverev: “Would you say that match at Roland Garros is, so far in your career, your biggest career setback?”

Zverev didn't hesitate: “Yes, and I'll tell you why.” He went on to say:

“It's not because I lost that match, right? Like everybody keeps saying, ‘Oh, I would have won a match.' Well, actually, he was up a set when it happened. Of course, it was an incredible match. I felt like I was playing some of the best tennis of my life, but the thing that was so upsetting to me was like just imagine: I lose that match, right? I lose that match, it's Rafa on Clay, at Roland Garros, millions of people lost to him there.”

 

Alexander Zverev's comeback is one of the greatest injury comeback stories in recent memory. From sustaining a brutal ankle injury, tearing all his ligaments and screaming at the top of his lungs due to the pain, then two years later, he's once again falling to his knees 1/2 pic.twitter.com/jNZp6wtfGT

He dug deeper into what stung the most: “But the one thing that people don't realize, I was 45 points away from the number one spot for three months. I needed to win one match, just one match at any tour level tournament to become world number one. That's the thing that hurt me the most, right? Because I was playing the best tennis of my life.”

Going over his results, Zverev laid it out: “In 2021, I won six titles. I won the Olympic gold medal. I won the world finals. I won two master's events, and then 2022 started. I started off playing well as well. I made semis of Monaco, finals of Madrid, semis of Rome, semis of Roland Garros and then the ankle injury happens like I lose that match fine but I go to Halle and I make quarters of Halle, I'm world number one, right?”

To wrap up, Zverev talked about what could have been without that injury: “That's the thing that killed me because I broke seven ligaments and shattered three bones, so there's really not much I can do about it and even without that the way I was playing, I felt like I was in my best ever position to win a grand slam, to win Wimbledon, to win US Open, to win something big because the way I was playing.”



On June 3, 2022, Zverev faced Rafael Nadal in a dramatic clash that went deep into a tiebreak, with Zverev controlling rallies and pushing the clay-court legend. But then disaster struck as he rolled his right ankle, tearing three lateral ligaments and fracturing bones in his foot. He had to retire while trailing 7-6, 6-6, ending a three-hour, 13-minute slugfest where he had saved set points and built a lead in the second set.

That injury was more than just a loss on the scoreboard and a drop in rankings. He went through surgery, missed Wimbledon, and watched as the group known as the Big Three's run in the top two ended without him there. After getting back on tour, Zverev came close but finished as runner-up at 2024 Roland Garros to Carlos Alcaraz and at the 2025 Australian Open to Jannik Sinner.

Still chasing that first Grand Slam, Zverev keeps working. Nadal, his opponent that day and often a mentor, has shown support and belief in the German's future, telling him in Mallorca that “when you're aggressive, it's very hard to outplay you” and that he “truly believes” Zverev will get over the hump and win a major.

French Open winner Carlos Alcaraz opened up on his unique rivalry with fellow Slam winner Jannik Sinner and how he overcame the Italian at a Roland Garros final that ranks right up there with some of the greatest tennis matches of all time. 

Alcaraz said that he believed that closing a slam was going to be tough on Sinner and that he would get his chances to make his way back into the match. 

“I simply thought about coming back little by little: one point, then another point, then another point, especially those three points,” he said in an interview to the Financial Times. “Closing a Grand Slam is very, very difficult, so I knew that I would have chances. That's why I stayed calm. I knew it wasn't going to be easy for him.”

Alcaraz also spoke about the mental warfare during a match of this significance that took place in this year's French Open. The Spaniard revealed that his confident demeanor was also one that he portrayed in order to not show any weakness.

“It was a bit the image I wanted to give as well,” he said. “At no time did I doubt that I could come back, but obviously you have to show an image of self-confidence at all times. As soon as you show weakness to the other, that's it – you are lost.”

Alcaraz also spoke about his relatioship with Sinner. While the initial years of a Roger Federer-Rafa Nadal rivalry was respectful yet distant, the same isn't necessarily true for this generation's greatest two tennis players. 



“Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it. We talk, we train together sometimes. And in the end you forge a good relationship, a beautiful relationship … We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter. For me that is one of the virtues and values of sport,” said Alcaraz, who will next be a part of the US Open.

Emma Raducanu is facing an uphill battle to secure a seeded position at the US Open after her comprehensive defeat against Amanda Anisimova at the WTA 1000 tournament in Montreal.

Anisimova hammered Radudanu 6-2, 6-1 in a defeat that will set alarm bells ringing for the Brit, who looked helpless as she was blown away in a match that was all over in a little over one hour.

Raducanu had beaten Anisimova in their previous two clashes in 2025, so she will have been shocked by the scale of the defeat against her friend and rival who reached the Wimbledon final last month.

Now Raducanu needs a strong run at the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati later this month to have a chance to break into the top 32 of the rankings and secure a seeding for the final Grand Slam of the year at the US Open.

She may need to make it through to the quarter-finals in Cincinnati to get a seeded berth in New York, as that would give her 215 points.

Emma Raducanu's biggest fear came back to haunt her in crushing Amanda Anisimova defeat

What prize money & ranking points did Emma Raducanu earn at Canadian Open?

A last-16 appearance would be worth 120 points and that may also be enough if other players drop down the rankings.

She could also opt to play in the WTA Tour 250 event in Cleveland or the WTA 500 tournament in Monterrey the week before the US Open, if a seeded berth in New York is a driving ambition.

Being seeded would help Raducanu avoid the prospect of taking on players such as world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, newly crowned Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek or the in-form Anisimova in the opening couple of rounds at the US Open.

Raducanu doesn't have any ranking points to defend over the next few weeks, as she did not play any tournaments ahead of the US Open last year due to some bizarre scheduling decisions.

Her reluctance to play in qualifying for big tournaments she did not qualify for on her ranking meant she headed into the US Open with limited match practice on US hard courts last year.

She predictably lost in the first round against Sofia Kenin, so she has a huge chance to gain plenty of ranking points over the next few weeks.

While she may now come up short of a seeding for the US Open, she could finish that tournament well inside the top 30 of the rankings if she has a good run of results in New York and according to former British No 1 Tim Henman, Raducanu is making progress in her career.

“This is not about the next four weeks for Emma, it's about the next four years and where she can go,” Henman told Tennis365 in an exclusive interview.

“What is success? It is for her to get back into the top 30 or maybe the top 10? It's about being the best version of yourself and maximising your potential.

“Now she has got a good team around her and I hope she sticks with it. Petch has been around the game for a long time and has been good for her.

“She has played lots of tournaments, been on court for a lot of matches and built up that physical resilience over what is a long season.

“I'm sure she will be licking some wounds after that defeat [against Swiatek] and the upside of finishing early at Roland Garros is she can put the clay court shoes away, head home and get ready for grass. I don't have any concerns so long as she keeps on this path.”

Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko upsets top-seeded Coco Gauff in just 62 minutes to reach the National Bank Open quarter-finals; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Coco Gauff was sent crashing out of the National Bank Open in Montreal in straight sets by Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko.

The 18-year-old, ranked 85 in the world, needed just 62 minutes to beat the top seed 6-1 6-4 and book a place in the quarter-finals.

"Your support was incredible," Mboko told the crowd in French after a chorus of "Ole, Ole, Ole!" chants echoed around the venue. "I'm really happy to win today... It's incredible. I'm so happy to beat such a great champion."

Mboko started the year by tearing up the ITF circuit with five titles, including one as a qualifier and two doubles. She won an incredible 27 matches with one loss, made her WTA Tour debut in March and took Gauff to three sets in Rome in just her second event.

"I was actually really thinking about it a lot during the match," said Canadian prodigy Mboko. "I had flashbacks to when I played her in Rome a little bit. I just remember when she came out playing even better and stepped it up a bit better.

"I wanted to step my game up a little bit more and make sure I matched whatever she was producing, and I wanted to stay right there with her."

She raced through the first set in 25 minutes, breaking the American three times.

The second set was a tighter affair which went on serve for the first 11 games.

Gauff failed to convert three break points throughout the set, Mboko seizing on her sole opportunity to close out the victory.

World No 2 Gauff said: "She's very athletic. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative.

"I don't know her too well, but l have spoken to her a little bit since Rome.

"I think she has a great support system around her, and I think that's important when you're young and on tour. Hopefully we have many more battles, and I look forward to playing her again in the future."

Former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard said Mboko's rise "has been nothing short of incredible".

"Anyone who knew her in Canadian tennis would not be surprised," said the recently-retired tennis star. "She has so much power to her game. I remember practising with her when she was 14,15 years old and she was smacking forehands and bowling me off the court, so we all knew she would be really good.

"I'm so happy to see it happening at such a big event like this as well. She seems to be handling the moment really well, taking it all in her stride and using it as motivation."

After her win over Gauff, Bouchard added: "I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age. You see her on the court and she's handling it like she's done it a hundred times."

Mboko is only the second wildcard in the Open Era to defeat the top seed at the Canadian Open after Stephanie Dubois in 2006 (versus Kim Clijsters)
She is also the youngest Canadian quarter-finalist at the Canadian Open since Helen Kelesi in 1987
Mboko, who began the season at No 333 in the WTA Rankings, came into the tournament at No 85. The win over Gauff sends her to No 53 in the live rankings. One more would take her to No 24

Mboko, who came through qualifying to reach the third round at the French Open and second round at Wimbledon, will face Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the last eight after the Spaniard beat China's Lin Zhu 7-5 1-6 6-2.

Earlier, 24th-seeded Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine and ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan set up a quarter-final clash.

Kostyuk beat McCartney Kessler 5-7 6-3 6-3, and Rybakina came through against Dayana Yastremska 5-7 6-2 7-5.

On the men's side of the tournament, which is being held in Toronto, defending champion Alexei Popyrin claimed his second consecutive win over a former Top 5 player when he rallied from a set down to defeat fifth seed Holger Rune 4-6 6-2 6-3.

Alex Michelsen reached his first quarter-final of a Masters 1000 event with a 6-3 6-3 win over fellow American Learner Tien.

Michelsen, seeded 26th, will face hard-hitting 11th seed Karen Khachanov, who upset eighth seed Casper Ruud in their fourth round match 6-4 7-5.

Alex de Minaur, who triumphed at last month's Washington Open, advanced to the quarter-finals over fellow Australian Christopher O'Connell via walkover.

Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo was forced to retire early into the second set of his night match with Alexander Zverev due to an abdominal strain.

Defending champion Alexei Popyrin claimed his second consecutive win over a former Top 5 player when he rallied from a set down to defeat fifth seed Holger Rune 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto Saturday night.

Popyrin went 0/11 on break point opportunities in the first set before dropping his brand of ‘Big Man Tennis' on the Dane, converting both break points in the second set and his first of the third as he powered to the finish line behind 14 aces and 13 forehand winners.

“I started this week not high on confidence, needing to get a grasp of the mental side,” Popyrin said of defending his title and 1000 points. “But this week I kind of just let go of all the pressure.

“After the first set I was pissed [about not breaking]. But when I came back out to return again, it felt like I was in control of the match. I told myself to be aggressive on the next break point that I got, and from then on I felt quite comfortable."

The 25-year-old Australian produced a perfect blend of Serve + 1 power and consistency, making just two unforced errors from the baseline in the second set, as he extended his winning streak to nine matches in Canada. He will next play top seed Alexander Zverev.

Popyrin, who ousted former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in the third round, advanced to his first hard-court quarter-final at any level since his stunning run to the title 12 months ago in Montreal.

“I feel comfortable on these courts, where I hit my first aggressive shot and then can dictate from there… My forehand was the standout today,” Popyrin said.

Popyrin, who recently told ATPTour.com that he wanted to find consistency in his results by staying in baseline rallies longer by using his mobility, hit 30 winners to 24 unforced errors, while Rune hit 24 winners and 39 unforced errors, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Alexander Zverev entered the 2025 Australian Open final with genuine belief that this would be his breakthrough moment. Instead, he walked away from Melbourne questioning everything about his game. The German's candid admission on the Nothing Major Show reveals just how deeply Jannik Sinner's dominant victory shook his confidence and left him searching for answers across an entire season.

John Isner, one of the four hosts of Nothing Major Show, asked Zverev for his opinions on how he would assess his 2025 season so far. Isner acknowledged the German reaching the final in Australia and winning Munich (2025 BMW Open), but wanted to know how Zverev himself felt about his performances so far this year.

Zverev's response was brutally honest: “Terrible year.” He continued, “A lot of times I felt quite lost on the court this year, especially after the Australian Open final where I've had another Grand Slam final. I actually went into the match believing like ‘I'm going to win this. This is my third final. I'm going to win it,' because the other two finals I lost in five sets. I had a lot of chances.”

The weight of his previous near-misses had actually fueled his confidence heading into Melbourne. He then talked about the challenge when playing against Carlos Alcaraz: “I lost to Carlos the year before at the French Open which for me is one of the toughest challenges playing Carlos on play right now.”



However, reality hit hard once the match began. Zverev shifted back to the Australian Open final and said: “So I was going into the match, like I was feeling so confident, and then in that match I got ‘smoked.' Like, he was doing everything better than me at that moment. Like I was serving better than him, but apart from the serve, he was doing everything better than me.”

The numbers from Melbourne tell the story of complete dominance by Sinner. The Italian defeated Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, never allowing a break point while facing ten against him and saving eight of those chances. Zverev managed 12 aces but also committed 45 unforced errors, particularly from the forehand side. His forehand, which had troubled him late in his semi-final win over Novak Djokovic, broke down early again under Sinner's relentless targeting.

The aftermath proved even more challenging than the defeat itself. While Zverev performed well on clay courts, winning the 2025 BMW Open and reaching the quarter-finals of Roland Garros, where he lost to Djokovic, his struggles became evident on other surfaces. The most shocking moment came at Wimbledon, where he was knocked out in the first round despite being the third seed.

Zverev lost against Arthur Rinderknech in an intense five-set match and admitted to feeling “very alone out there at times. ” He acknowledged that he had been struggling mentally since his Australian Open final loss to Sinner and that Melbourne defeat's mental toll had extended far beyond a single match.



Seeking to rebuild his confidence, Zverev recently spent ten days at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca. Under Toni Nadal's guidance, he participated in intense training blocks designed to sharpen his aggression and mental resilience. Zverev described dinners with Rafael Nadal, during which the 22-time Grand Slam champion urged him to maintain an aggressive mindset and reminded him of his Grand Slam potential.

While Toni Nadal is “a very busy man,” Zverev remains hopeful this collaboration will deepen. He believes the lessons learned in Mallorca could be the key to finally breaking his Grand Slam drought and recovering from the psychological damage inflicted by that devastating loss to Sinner.

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

The Hungarian Grand Prix started in promising fashion for Charles Leclerc but ended in disappointment, the Monegasque having slipped backwards to P4.

Charles Leclerc has explained the problems behind his “extremely frustrating” drop-off in pace during the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque – who had started from pole position – slipping backwards to fourth on a day where he had hoped to take a victory.

The race had started off well for Leclerc, having held the lead before also managing to keep McLaren's Oscar Piastri behind him during the first round of pit stops.

However, after Lando Norris put himself ahead of both via an alternative strategy, Leclerc looked to be struggling in the latter stages of the race and was soon overtaken by Piastri for second place.

The Ferrari driver then faced a challenge from George Russell in a battle for third and, as well as losing another position to the Mercedes driver, found himself with a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during the battle.

After crossing the line in P4, Leclerc cut a downbeat figure as he discussed what had happened to cause his lack of pace later on, with the issue turning out to be different to what the 27-year-old had initially thought.

“From around Lap 40 we had a problem with the chassis, so now I've had more details about it,” said Leclerc. “In the car obviously I had no idea what was going on. I mean I had an idea, but it was a wrong idea because I thought it was something that was in our control.

“Unfortunately we had an issue on the chassis, so I don't have much to add on that. It's just extremely frustrating when you are fighting for a win and when we had the pace that we had at the beginning of the race, and we lose absolutely everything later on, it's very frustrating.”

With the race bringing the first part of the season to a close, Leclerc was quizzed on what his mindset now is as the sport heads into its traditional summer break.

“Very disappointed,” he conceded. “I don't take any positives from this weekend when we ended the weekend like that.

“When we have one opportunity in a year to win a race, we need to take it and today we didn't. Now we will analyse what are the reasons why we had this problem. I don't think it's anything that we had in our control, but we'll check.”

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

Alex Albon found himself at the bottom of the pack in Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Alex Albon believes Williams were “way too slow” in Qualifying at the Hungaroring, leaving him with an uphill battle after he bagged his worst starting position since 2022.

The 29-year-old was eliminated in Q1 and will start the Grand Prix from P20 just behind Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, whose effort was 0.142s clear of Albon as the latter suffered from uncharacteristically poor one-lap pace.

After a remarkably strong weekend last time out in Belgium that saw him claim P5 in Qualifying, the Williams driver has struggled to match the performance of other midfield teams in Hungary, failing to break into the top-10 throughout practice.

But after their first flying laps, Albon and his team mate Carlos Sainz were up in P15 and P16 before they both bolted on a fresh set of soft tyres. While the Spaniard improved to P8, Albon could only manage 17th before he was bumped down to last place by Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon and Hulkenberg.

Reflecting on what went wrong after the session, he said: “I think mainly we just didn't account for the cooler track temperatures. We got a little bit slow on the out lap – way too slow, really.

“I went into Turn 1 and the tyres were too cold and then it just spiralled. Not ideal but it can happen, and let's see. Hopefully tomorrow we can do something.

“It is tricky to drive, but it's not P20 tricky. It's been one of those weekends so far where we've just been throwing stuff at it and nothing's really been working.

“We went back to the FP1 car for Qualifying just to try to get back somewhere where I was happiest, which was in FP1. I don't know, maybe the track's moved on since then.”

Sainz similarly confirmed that they took a step back in terms of the set-up on his car, but he was ultimately able to progress to Q2 and secure P13 on the grid, which nevertheless marked his third consecutive Q2 elimination.

“I think we ended up reverting back on a lot of the set-up items we tried during the week,” he said. “We went back to a car I know and I more or less did the maximum that was available to us today with P13.

“It's been a very difficult track for the Williams so far, but we knew that coming into here and we just need to maximise whatever we have.

“I think we're going to try our best to get a point or two but realistically speaking, we don't have the pace to do so.”

	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, TOMORROW X TOGETHER collects its seventh top 10-charted effort with the No. 3 debut of The Star Chapter: TOGETHER; YoungBoy Never Broke Again lands his sweet 16th top 10 with the No. 6 bow of MASA; and Tyler Childers achieves his highest-charted album (and third top 10) with the No. 7 launch of Snipe Hunter.

	











	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 9, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Aug. 5. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Of I'm the Problem's 143,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 31, SEA units comprise 137,000 (up 2%, equaling 180.43 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a 10th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 5,000 (down 23% — it falls 15-16 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 30%).


	Cumulatively, Wallen's three No. 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 38 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That sum solely gives Wallen the fifth-most weeks at No. 1 among male artists in the chart's history, which dates to March 1956, when the chart began publishing on a regular weekly basis. He was previously tied with Harry Belafonte and Drake with 37 weeks each. Among male artists, the leaders are: Elvis Presley (67 weeks), Garth Brooks (52), Michael Jackson (51), Elton John (39), Wallen (38), Belafonte and  Drake (37 each). Among all artists, The Beatles have the most weeks at No. 1, with 132 across 19 No. 1 albums.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack returns to its peak on the Billboard 200, as it climbs 3-2 with 93,000 equivalent album units earned (up 4%) — its best week yet by units earned.


	TOMORROW X TOGETHER collects its seventh top 10-charted effort as The Star Chapter: TOGETHER debuts at No. 3. The set earned 65,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Album sales comprise 62,000 of that sum (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 3,000 (equaling 4.23 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The album's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 24 CD variants (all with collectible ephemera, some randomized, inside its packaging).

	











Tyler, The Creator's DON'T TAP THE GLASS falls 1-4 in its second week on the Billboard 200, with 59,000 equivalent album units earned (down 70%). Justin Bieber's SWAG rises 6-5 (52,000, down 28%).


	YoungBoy Never Broke Again achieves his 16th top 10-charted album on the Billboard 200, as MASA enters at No. 6. The set earned 49,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with SEA units comprising 48,000 of that sum (equaling 69.15 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 4 on Top Streaming Albums). Album sales comprise a little under 1,000 (it was only available to purchase as a standard widely available digital download) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	With a 16th top 10, YoungBoy Never Broke Again ties Jay-Z and Nas for the third-most top 10 albums among hip-hop artists. Only Future (with 18) and Drake (17) have more among hip-hop acts. (Among all artists, of all genres, The Rolling Stones have the most top 10s, with 38.)


	Tyler Childers scores his highest-charting album, and third top 10, on the Billboard 200 with the No. 7 launch of Snipe Hunter. The set earned 48,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Album sales comprise 27,000 of that sum (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 20,500 (equaling 26.14 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 20 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise about 500.


Snipe Hunter's first-week sales were aided by its availability across seven vinyl variants, along with a widely available standard CD and digital download.


	The album was preceded by the radio-promoted single “Nose on the Grindstone,” which climbs to No. 18 — a new peak — on the Adult Alternative Airplay chart.

	











	Rounding out the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200 are Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid (falling 5-8 with 47,000 equivalent album units, down 35%); JACKBOYS and Travis Scott's former No. 1 JACKBOYS 2 (4-9 with 46,000, down 41%); and Ozzy Osbourne's The Essential Ozzy Osbourne (7-10 with nearly 46,000, up 5%).

	What was meant to be Rod Stewart's in-concert tribute to Ozzy Osbourne has instead been met with criticism and ridicule after video of the tribute — featuring AI images of Osbourne and other gone-too-soon artists — emerged on social media.


	During Stewart's last handful of concerts since Osbourne's July 22 death, he has dedicated his song “Forever Young” to the Black Sabbath singer. However, what originally started as a normal tribute — with a simple image of Osbourne shown on the video screens — recently took a bizarre turn when “Forever Young” was accompanied by the AI Osbourne — in heaven with a selfie stick in hand — taking photos of himself with the likes of Freddie Mercury, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse.

A post shared by Sloane Steel (@iamsloanesteel)


	In addition to the selfies with Prince, Bob Marley, Tupac Shakur, and Whitney Houston, the perpetrator of the insensitive AI video also strangely decided to have Osbourne take photos with controversial artists like Michael Jackson and XXXtentacion.

	To add insult to the visual injury, Stewart told the Charlotte, North Carolina crowd following the “Forever Young” performance, “Very sad. A lot of those people died 'cause of drugs… I'm still here, though!,” the Charlotte Observer noted in their review of Stewart's July 29 show.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Following news of Osbourne's death, Stewart wrote on Instagram, “Bye, bye Ozzy. Sleep well, my friend. I'll see you up there — later rather than sooner.”

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…: There were a lot of moving parts at the global and international box office this weekend which was led for the studios by the sophomore frame of Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps. 


	Amid a 54% dip from opening (-52% excluding China), the second overseas session added $39.6M for a running offshore cume of $170.3M and $368.7M worldwide. While domestic and international were essentially at parity in their weekend hauls, domestic is dominating the global total at 54%. As noted last weekend, the split is usually in the other direction, but Asia is a drag here.

	One Asian major that has been depressed for some time is seeing some specific bounce. Korea has a strong local title in the mix, but is also having a love affair with Brad Pitt-starrer F1. The Apple Original Films racing pic, via Warner Bros, continues to have mega-strong holds — increasing an incredible 36% in the 6th frame in the market. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	In total, the Joseph Kosinski-directed racing pic added $17.2M from 78 offshore markets this session (a 17% dip overall overseas versus last) to lift the overseas cume to $372.3M. Global is now $545.6M which makes F1 Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, surpassing World War Z.


	We will get into more detail on the above, but here's a quick snapshot of the other major titles in play.


	New this frame, and flying the flag for comedies, Paramount's The Naked Gun debuted to $11.5M from 46 early opening markets. This is 44% above Game Night and 36% over The Heat. The launch reps 73% of the international footprint, with 15 markets still to go including France, Brazil Australia and Spain.

	











	The Top 5 launches were the UK ($2.3M), Germany ($2.3M), Mexico ($674K), Netherlands ($590K) and Austria ($430K). 


	Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2, after debuting in just three overseas markets last weekend, expanded to 58 in this session. The frame was good for $16.3M which lifts the early overseas cume to $22.3M, and with domestic's bow, the running global total is $44.5M. 


	Note that major markets still to come include Brazil, China, Italy, Germany and Australia, as well as parts of Latin America and Asia.


	Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth, meanwhile, devoured another $16.2M in the 5th overseas frame; 35% off last weekend. That takes the offshore cume to $448.4M and global to $766M.


	Warner/DC's Superman, for its part, added $11.2M from 78 offshore markets for an overseas cume of $235M and $551.2M global.

But F1 is a flop right?
Right….
sigh…

There is a real possibility that F1 ends earning more worldwide til the end of its theatrical run then Superman and Fantastic 4… Incredible holds overseas. Well done

And still all 3 movies are flopping in theaters because of their outrageous budgets and marketing…

JW clearing 815 has to make Universal very happy. With How to Train Your Dragon, two good successes for them on their summer slate.

Superman on track for about $600 still, though maybe August doldrums help a bit. Neither a success nor a disaster but still not what they wanted.

F1 keeps on keeping on. Probably doesn't catch Superman but may actually stay close with the IMAX rerelease.

And tracking about $525 for FF? Hmmm. How do you make a sequel with that without Doomsday giving everything new life.

At least World War Z was some semblance of a box office hit.

F1 with its budget and box office isn't. Sorry to those who claim its a hit bit the math isn't mathing.

	How is this for an ironic twist — as Stephen Colbert is preparing to say goodbye as the host of CBS‘ The Late Show, he also is portraying a late-night host for CBS with a guest role on the upcoming third season of the network's crime anthology Elsbeth, Deadline has confirmed. 


	Colbert is not playing himself in the episode, which filmed this week. According to Vulture, which first reported the news, he plays the host of the fictional Way Late with Scotty Bristol. Each episode of Elsbeth solves a different murder; it is unclear how Bristol is connected to that case of the week.

	Primetime series take months of lead time from conceiving an episode to its filming, Colbert's appearance is believed to stem from a handshake “deal” he made with Wendell Pierce during the Elsbeth star's appearance on The Late Show in February. 


	After Colbert professed that he had long been asking CBS to play a corpse on one of the network's crime dramas, Pierce promised to help. “I can make that happen,” he said, referring to Season 3 of Elsbeth, which had just been picked up. “I know a guy who knows a guy. We can get you on,” he added. (You can watch the video below.)


	The jokey exchange led to real discussions and Colbert's appearance on Elsbeth. The role of Bristol is believed to have been written for him. In the wake of the Late Show cancellation, the part could've been recast but everyone proceeded with the original plan. 


Elsbeth, from Robert and Michelle King and CBS Studios, is headlined by Carrie Preston reprising her role from The Good Wife. Notable guest stars over the show's first two seasons include Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick and Retta.

It's perhaps the comic book film genre's greatest conundrum: how do you crack the Fantastic Four? This weekend, despite positive word of mouth and a solid opening weekend haul, the quartet's latest — subtitled “First Steps” — tumbled 66% at the domestic box office. Undoubtedly, before Hollywood looks to craft the next adventure, they'll look back at what has worked before — and the most recent unequivocal success came from the simply titled “Fantastic Four” in 2005, which featured Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Iaon Gruffudd.

 










Now, “unequivocal,” to be fair, does not count reviews — “First Steps” has most certainly outpaced this older version in terms of critical reception. But the film grossed three times its budget and managed to produce a sequel in 2007 — “Rise of the Silver Surfer” — which also made money. Of course, after that, Marvel Studios became a thing, and something called the MCU happened. But at the center of it all was Gruffudd, originating the film role now played by man of the hour Pedro Pascal (if you don't count the notorious unreleased film from 1994). In a recent interview with Vulture, Gruffudd offered his fantastic wisdom, and what exactly it was like being in a comic book movie before the idea of a comic book universe was implemented.

“We couldn't have known what the future held for Marvel and the appetite for these films and the ability to make them as technology progresses,” Gruffudd said. “For us, we certainly felt that we were being true to the comic. The comics aren't as dark and violent as Blade and X-Men; they have a lighter, family feel. We believed we were a true representation of what was in Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's minds when they created it. And what's wonderful about the movie is it still resonates today amongst the tens of movies that are now in the Marvel Universe, and it holds up emotionally and technically.”

The tone — as Gruffudd notes — is a little less serious than many in the MCU, which embrace a certain level of grandeur that recalls the epics of Hollywood yore. But this is not to say that the idea of interconnectivity was not broached in 2005. One of the X-Men actually, nearly made a cameo in the movie — in a scene in which Reed was to turn into Wolverine (ala Hugh Jackman) to impress Sue Storm (Alba).

“I don't know why that didn't make it into the film. Paying homage to the great Hugh Jackman was quite a thrill because I absolutely love him as an actor and his Wolverine. I'm glad that it has a chance to exist somewhere. That was a reshoot, and I was in Vancouver on a soundstage and Jessica was in New York, so we weren't actually together, but we look perfectly in sync,” he explained.

 










As for why the series didn't continue, Gruffudd explains that “there was definitely that sort of momentum, and the plan was to do three movies, but these decisions are beyond my control.”

Perhaps in a potential sequel to this summer's hit, a recall to the Gruffudd era might conjure up the nostalgia comic book fans are craving. Certainly — as evidenced by Evans' brief return as Johnny Storm in “Deadpool vs. Wolverine” — the precedent exists to bring together those old 20th Century Fox Marvel projects together with their current incarnations (think “Spider-Man: No Way Home”).

“Fans are convinced that I'm going to be in a particular aspect of this universe that hasn't been written or filmed yet,” Gruffudd said. “But this idea of people showing up has been introduced, like Chris in ‘Deadpool'  or I think Mister Fantastic appeared in the guise of John Krasinski at one point. So, no, I haven't been approached to reprise Mister Fantastic. But you never know.”

The rapper-singer claims he was supposed to audition for "the second vampire" in the Michael B. Jordan-led movie.

Machine Gun Kelly reveals he turned down his audition for Ryan Coogler's Sinners for one specific reason.


	The rapper-singer made a recent appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, where he shared that he decided not to audition for the role of “the second vampire” because he would have had to say the N-word.




	“There's been plenty of movies that come out that I was like, ah, I was supposed to be in that, or I did auditions for that. Like Sinners, I was supposed to be in that,” he explained. “The vampire, they had me set up to do the audition — it's the one that's in the house, so he's the second vampire, the one that the guy comes and eats the family. In the audition, he has to say the N-word and I wouldn't do it.”

	Kelly is likely referring to the role of Bert, a KKK member who was turned into a vampire. Peter Dreimanis ultimately played the part. Sinners, which also starred Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld and Miles Caton, became a surprise box office hit. The film follows twin brothers who return to their hometown in an attempt to leave their troubled lives behind, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting back home.


	Despite Sinners not working out for Kelly, the “Cliché” artist still has “a lot of aspirations to be in movies.” While “it just hasn't panned out that way” yet, Kelly knows he's “on universal timing. It'll align. The angels will put something in the works.”


	However, he would prefer “to be in cinema while I still look young,” quipping, “I would really like to be recruited into a movie while I still got some looks.”

Donald Trump is angry and lashing out at radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God after the host spoke on Fox News about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and speculated it would cause a Republican Party “coup.”


	Trump lashed out, calling Charlamagne a “a Low IQ individual” who “has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done” in a Truth Social post very early Sunday morning.


	(In case you were wondering whether Trump is racist when slinging his “low IQ” insult, here is a list of other people he has recently called “low IQ”: Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Rep. Al Green.)


	“I think traditional conservatives are going to take the Republican Party back,” Charlamagne said in an interview with the president's daughter-in-law on her Fox News program, My View with Lara Trump. “I think there's a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren't paying attention to. I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back, I really do.

	“They know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up,” he said. “The MAGA base isn't letting this issue go, and for the first time, they know they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base.”


	Charlamagne also told Lara Trump that he would vote again for Kamala Harris if given the chance.


	“The very wonderful and talented Lara Trump, whose show is a big ratings success, put racist sleazebag Charlamagne ‘The God' (Why is he allowed to use the word ‘GOD' when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?)” Trump wrote.

	











	Trump has been in hot water with his base since the FBI and DOJ concluded in a memo last month that “no further disclosure” of the Epstein files “would be appropriate or warranted.” Trump and members of his administration had previously suggested they would release the contents of the files, including details about the billionaire sex trafficker's death by suicide in prison.

	Along with the memo, the administration released surveillance footage from outside Epstein's cell around the time of his death, but one minute was suspiciously missing.


	Since the memo's release, new details have emerged about the president's close friendship with Epstein as well as information that Trump himself is named in the files. Trump even said last week that Epstein “stole” one of his victims from Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort and spa, where she worked.


	Raising even more suspicion, the DOJ has been meeting with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and made the unprecedented move of transferring her to a minimum security facility while she serves a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Meanwhile, the Republican speaker of the house sent lawmakers home for a recess to avoid a vote on releasing the files, even though the speaker himself has called for the files to be made public. Last month, the House voted to block their release.


	Charlamagne also said that he hasn't seen significant changes for the better since Trump took office.


	“Right now people are hurting!” he said. “He campaigned on immediate change. Day one change.”

The actor and pop star recently ended their nine-year relationship.

Orlando Bloom is taking things in stride amid rumors that his ex Katy Perry has moved on with former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


	On Friday (Aug. 1), satirical news site The Onion shared a fictional article on Instagram with the headline, “Orlando Bloom Spotted at Dinner With Angela Merkel.” The post featured what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the 48-year-old English actor enjoying a candlelit dinner with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 71.


	“Just weeks after announcing his split with fiancée Katy Perry, English actor Orlando Bloom was photographed Friday dining with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,” The Onion‘s mock report read. “'Angela kept Orlando laughing all night — he couldn't keep his eyes off her!'said an insider source who spotted the pair sipping wine, slurping oysters, and splitting a decadent piece of chocolate layer cake at a Michelin-starred restaurant.”


	Bloom took the joke in good humor, responding in the comments with several clapping emojis.

	The spoof came shortly after Perry, 40, and Trudeau, 53, were spotted together on multiple occasions in late July, including dining out in Montreal and walking a dog through Mount Royal Park. Trudeau was also seen enthusiastically singing along to Perry's hit “Firework” during her Lifetimes Tour stop at Montreal's Bell Centre.




	The sightings have sparked speculation about a possible romance, especially following confirmation that Perry and Bloom have ended their relationship after nine years. The couple, who share a daughter, Daisy Dove, have pledged to remain focused on co-parenting.


	“Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting,” the pair's reps told Billboard in early July, shortly after which the exes appeared together in a photo from a family vacation with their children. “They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is — and always will be — raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.”


	Trudeau also went through a public breakup in August 2023, splitting from estranged wife Sophie Gregoire, with whom he has three kids.

	After four years, the stars of Freeform‘s The Bold Type are itching for a Scarlet Magazine reunion.


Katie Stevens, who played budding editor Jane Sloan in the Sarah Watson-created series, recently expressed her interest in reprising the role for a movie with co-stars Meghann Fahy and Aisha Dee.


	“I'm in. Me, Meghann, and Aisha, every interview we do separately, we talk about how we want to do something Bold Type-related again, to do a movie or something,” she told People. “We're all primed and ready to do it.”

	Stevens added, “So I'm just like, ‘We just need to get it out there that we want to do it and then have fans rally.' Because there's a lot of remakes of things happening and spinoffs of things, and I'm just like, ‘Let's just do a Bold Type Hulu original movie or something!'”

	











	Inspired by Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, The Bold Type ran for five seasons from 2017 to 2021, following Jane (Stevens), Kat (Aisha) and Sutton (Fahy), three work besties who juggle life, love and career while working at fictional women's magazine, Scarlet.


	Raving that her former co-stars are “my girls for life,” Stevens noted that she will “hype every single thing that they do” in their respective careers.


	“It's the most beautiful friendship and the two of them are some of the greatest loves of my lives, being my sisters for life,” explained Stevens. “And it means so much to me that we are champions of one another no matter what is going on in life.”

	











	After The Bold Type was renewed for a fifth and final season in 2021, Stevens said filming the ending was “definitely bittersweet,” knowing that it was goodbye.


	“But I think it's a privilege of having the information that you are ending…it allowed us to be intentional in real life when filming the show,” said Stevens at ATX Television Festival.

	A somewhat long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, Liam Neeson took a lightsaber to the gut.


	The Oscar nominee recently expressed dissatisfaction with his Jedi Master character Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace, noting that he was “supposed to be a Master Jedi” but got duped during a lightsaber duel.


	“I thought my death was a bit namby-pamby. I'm supposed to be a Master Jedi,” he told GQ. “My character fell for that. ‘Oh, I'm going for your face! No, I'm not, I'm going for your stomach.' ‘Oh, you got me!' Like, oh please. Hardly a Master Jedi.”


	“But still, it was great,” noted Neeson of the filming experience.

	More than 20 years later, he reprised the role for a reunion with Ewan McGregor in his Disney+ spin-off series Obi-Wan Kenobi. “I kinda liked that. It was just one line. It was nice to recreate that and be with Ewan after 18, 20 years. It was sweet,” he recalled.


	During the prequel's 25th anniversary last year, concept and storyboard artist Iain McCaig revealed that George Lucas had another “very poignant” ending in mind, that would have involved Neeson playing Obi-Wan from the jump, with McGregor as his Padawan, Qui-Gon


	“As Obi-Wan dies and Qui-Gon defeats Darth Maul and stays with his Master as he passes away, he not only takes on his Master's quest, but he takes on his name,” explained McCaig in November. “Qui-Gon becomes Obi-Wan.”


	Although the switch-up would have ended on a more shocking reveal, it would have yielded the same outcome, with McGregor's Obi-Wan going on to train Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christensen), and ultimately his son Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the original trilogy.

After weeks of hinting about a big move for their family, Hallmark star Brant Daugherty revealed on August 2, 2025, that he and his wife, Kimberly, have moved from Los Angeles to Italy with their two young sons — Wilder, 4, and Aero, 1. 

Posting from their new upper level home in a charming Italian town, Brant wrote, “La nostra casa nuova 😍” — which, translated into English, means “Welcome to our new home.” 

“We spent months packing, cleaning, prepping and moving,” he continued, “but we're finally settled into our new home and let me tell you, I love this place already. The people are lovely. The food is even better. And the violin player outside is a nice touch. Benvenuto a Italia, famiglia Daugherty.”

Brant rose to fame playing Noel Kahn on “Pretty Little Liars” and has starred in multiple Hallmark movies since 2018, including 2024's “Trivia at St. Nick's.” Kimberly, meanwhile, is an actress who's written and produced Hallmark movies like 2023's “Christmas in Bethlehem, PA” and “Joyeux Noel,” which Brant co-wrote and starred in. The two married in 2019. 

Although Brant didn't give a reason for their family's move, he did reveal two months prior that he'd obtained dual citizenship in Italy, celebrating the milestone with his wife at a Festa della Repubblica event in Beverly Hills to commemorate the day in 1946 when Italy voted to become a republic. 

“Five years ago, we started a journey to seek out dual citizenship and learn more about my Italian family and heritage,” he shared on Instagram in June. “Along the way; I visited my family in Italy for the first time, showed my kids their ancestors' country and got to meet with the Italian Consul General in Los Angeles.”

“Very grateful to my lovely wife @kimdaugherty_ for spearheading this whole thing,” he continued, “and getting us in touch with a side of my family I'd never explored. I love that we get to share this with our sons.”

The Daughertys have shared their love of Italy over the years, including sharing pics and videos from a trip there in July 2023 with their son Wilder. 

A post shared by Brant Daugherty (@brantdaugherty)

Brant teased his family's impending move on July 14, posting a time-lapse video of himself getting their Los Angeles house ready to sell. 

“Cleaning up the place for someone else to move in,” he captioned the video. “We bought this house in 2018. Since we've lived here: we got married, our kids were born, we've had three of our scripts produced (Kim has more on her own), went through a pandemic and been through the highest highs and the lowest lows… but we've done it all together.”

“It's hard to say goodbye to a beautiful chapter of your life,” Brant continued. “So many good things happened here. But what matters is that we're still together for the next exciting chapter ahead. You never know where life will take you. New adventures await, my friends.”

On July 30, he posted a series of photos from their last days in Los Angeles and wrote, “Our last week before moving. Time for a big adventure.”

In mid-July, Deadline reported that Brant's next project is the feature film “By the Roots,” a “queer feminist biopic” co-starring Ally Sheedy, Emily Robinson, and Margaret Cho. He'll also be back in the U.S. to appear with 25 other rom-com stars at Christmas Con in December.

Donald Trump‘s White House is not pursuing a campaign promise to mandate health insurance pay for in vitro fertilization (IVF), even though he pledged to do so multiple times on the 2024 campaign trail, The Washington Post reported Sunday.


	In order to mandate insurers pay for IVF treatments, it would require an act of Congress. Two sources with knowledge of internal White House discussions told the paper that the administration does not intend to ask legislators to draft a bill making IVF coverage mandatory. The paper's sources also said that forcing insurers to cover IVF is also not in the administration's plans.


	The White House's lack of action paints a stark contrast to the president's campaign promises.


	“I'm announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said on the campaign trail last August. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”

	











	“We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump told NBC in an interview that same day.  “We're going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But Trump's vague campaign pledges did not include a plan for how to achieve that goal. 


	“There were no details provided by Trump during the campaign as to how this would work, who would be eligible and how it would relate to health insurance coverage,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, told The Post.

	











	Even if the Trump administration were to force insurers to pay for IVF coverage, the costs would be passed down to consumers through higher premiums. 


	“How do you do this without burdening health insurers? That's the key question they've been wrestling with,” one of the people familiar with the discussions told The Post. “It appears for now that they're not going to go there.”


	In February, Trump signed an executive order that he claimed would expand access to IVF, acknowledging that it can cost between $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, that it may take multiple cycles to result in a pregnancy, and that only a quarter of employers and a handful of states cover it in their health insurance plans.

	The executive order requested a list of policy recommendations for “protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” But the deadline passed without such a list being made public, though it was reportedly delivered to the White House in May.


	“As exciting as the executive order was … it doesn't have any actual actions in it,” TJ Farnsworth, president of Fertility Providers Alliance and the founder of a chain of fertility clinics, told NBC News shortly after the deadline.


	For now, it looks like any actual actions to require IVF coverage are not forthcoming.

	The White House does, however, plan to redirect funds from a long-standing federal program that helps low-income women access birth control and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Instead, those funds will go to an “infertility training center” that promotes “holistic” approaches to combatting infertility, like classes teaching women about their menstrual cycles.

The Marvel superhero pic tumbled 66 percent in its sophomore outing domestically, compared to a 53 percent drop for DC's 'Superman.'


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Talk about a two-edged sword.


	Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps easily stayed atop the domestic box office chart in its second weekend with $40 million, but tumbled a worrisome 66 percent. That's more than anyone could have predicted after the event pic opening to $117.6 million last weekend amid stellar audience and critical reaction. At the same time, it isn't entirely outside the range of normal for the superhero genre. And there's still a clear runway ahead before summer ends. 




Fantastic Four had hoped to clear $200 million domestically through Sunday, but instead is projecting a 10-day domestic tally of $198.4 million, compared to cume of $236.2 million and a drop of 53 percent for DC Studos' Superman in its second weekend (to be fair,  the Man of Steel didn't have another superpic to compete with, although Jurassic Park Rebirth had only opened a week earlier). Overseas, Mister Fantastic and his family made up ground in earning another $39.6 million for an early global tally of $368.7 million globally. That includes $170.3 million internationally, compared to Superman‘s current overseas total of $235 million.

	In North America, Fantastic Four had no trouble fending off Universal/DreamWorks Animation's new family pic The Bad Guys 2 and Paramount's comedy Naked Gun, which opened in second and third place, respectively.

Bad Guys 2 started off with a better-than-expected domestic opening of $22.2 million. The sequel boasts the second-best animated launch of the year to date and came in not far behind the first film, which debuted to $23 million domestically on its way to transforming into a sleeper hit and earning more than $250 million globally (the series is adapted from Aaron Blabey's best-selling book series about a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws).


	Director Pierre Perifel and producer Damon Ross reteamed to make the sequel, which boasts both an A CinemaScore and generally strong reviews. The sequel also sees the return of original voice stars Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos and Awkwafina. Newcomers lending their vocal talent include Zazie Beetz, Richard Ayoade, Alex Borstein and Lilly Singh.


	In the sequel, the animal crew is trying their best to be good, but plans go awry when they come out of retirement to stop one more heist and encounter a new trio of masterminds known as “The Bad Girls,” who are voiced by Danielle Brooks, Maria Bakalova and Natasha Lyonne.


Paramount's acclaimed The Naked Gun revival — starring Liam Neeson opposite Pamela Anderson — also opened on the high end of expectations, with a North America launch of $17 million and $28.5 million globally.


	 As fate would have it, the $40 million comedy is the last film that the current iteration of Paramount Pictures will release before David Ellison's Skydance officially closes its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global on Aug. 7. Affable movie studio chief Brian Robbins — who has also been serving as one of the three interim CEOs of Paramount Global since sale talks began last year — intends to step down once Ellison takes control of the entertainment conglomerate and installs his executive team both in the C-suite and at Paramount Pictures, according to sources.

	











The Naked Gun revival, produced by Seth MacFarlane, stars Neeson in his first leading comedic role opposite Pamela Anderson. He plays Lt. Frank Drebin Jr., who is trying to follow in the footsteps of his father, Frank Drebin, the infamous comedic character played by Leslie Nielsen in the original films. The new pic boasts an A-CinemaScore from audiences and strong PostTrak exits.


	Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu and Danny Huston also star. The fourth film in the long-dormant franchise, directed by Akiva Schaffer from a script he wrote with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, opens 31 years after the last movie, 1994's Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, graced the big screen.


	One fun fact: Anderson is on double duty this weekend between Bad Guys 2 and Naked Gun.


Superman, now in its fourth outing, finished Sunday with a global tally of $551.2 million after earning another $13.9 million domestically and $11.2 million overseas. Last week, it became the first DC title in years to cross the $300 million mark in North America in a major win for the new leadership at DC, James Gunn — also the director of Superman — and Peter Safran (DC has struggled far more than Marvel in modern times).


	Produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin in partnership with Universal, Jurassic World Rebirth rounded out the top five in North America with $8.7 million for a domestic tally of $448.4 million and $766 million globally.

	











	The weekend's other new offering is Neon's buzzy horror-comedy Together, starring Alison Brie and Dave Franco. The indie pic came in sixth with a three-day weekend gross of $6.8 million for a five-day debut of $10.9 million.

Multiple stars of “The Voice,” including coach Reba McEntire, are mourning the death of country music icon Jeannie Sealy at age 85. Sealy, who won a Grammy for her 1966 song “Don't Touch Me,” was a legend at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, where she performed more than any other artist in history, the venue revealed on August 1, 2025. 

“It is with a heavy heart we say goodbye to a true icon to us here the Opry, Mrs. Jeannie Seely,” the Opry wrote in an online tribute to the singer. “Jeannie is the definition of a mentor and dear friend to many in the country music community.”

McEntire was among many country artists and “The Voice” stars who have paid tribute to Sealy in the days since her death. In an Instagram post on August 1, McEntire shared a photo of herself with Sealy and fellow country icon Dolly Parton, and wrote, “I've always loved this woman! She was a little spitfire, opinionated team player! Rest in peace, Jeannie”

Parton, who served as an advisor on “The Voice” in 2015 and 2016, also paid tribute to Sealy on social media, calling her one of her “dearest friends.”

Parton wrote, “I have known Jeannie Seely since we were early on in Nashville. She was one of my dearest friends. I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.”

Season 22 winner of “The Voice” Bryce Leatherwood also paid tribute in his Instagram Stories with two photos of Sealy, including one of them together, and wrote, “Rest in Peace…from the first time I met Jeannie at the Bluebird Cafe, she said ‘we have to get you to the Opry…I just love that voice.' She was one of a kind and such a sweet soul. Condolences to her family and friends.” 

Leatherwood also commented on the Opry's announcement of Sealy's passing, “She was so kind to me … so sad to hear this. RIP”

Sealy died on August 1 at Summit Medical Center near Nashville due to complications from an intestinal infection, according to Billboard. Her health had been failing since the fall of 2024, the outlet reported, including multiple back surgeries and two emergency abdominal surgeries.

Many who paid tribute to Sealy called her a trailblazer and a “fierce advocate for women artists and performers.” Her career began at age 11, appearing on a local radio station in Pennsylvania, and then performing regularly on a local weekend TV show there by age 16. 

After moving to California, per Billboard, she made her name as a songwriter, earned a record deal, and appeared with Glen Campbell on the TV show “Hollywood Jamboree.” In 1964, the Country and Western Academy — now known as the Academy of Country Music — named her “the most promising female artist.”

After moving to Nashville, Sealy was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in September 1967 and became the first woman to regularly host Opry segments, per Billboard. Her final performance was on February 22 — her 5,397th appearance on the Opry stage.

“The Naked Gun,” for most younger folk was — if anything — a movie series that ran a lot on cable during the '90s and '00s. But for Gen Xers and Boomers, it was the ultimate spoof franchise, starring the king of deadpan Leslie Nielsen. But excitement has been building across all demographics for the this year's reboot (evidenced in the film‘s youth-heavy opening weekend numbers), as ad after ad has built upon action star Liam Neeson‘s new, bumbling persona. And, in turn, audiences have revisited the original “Naked Gun” trilogy in preparation (or at least, that's how things were going down with my Letterboxd follows).

 










Neeson, however, is not to be counted among the rewatchers. In fact, the actor made a point of not revisiting the original films, which also starred Priscilla Presley (who you might just spot in the new movie) — though he did see them when they originally hit cinema screens (“They were a good giggle, he said. “Fun. School boy humor”).

“I just trusted the script,” Neeson told Variety. “And knew it would get better the more they worked on it. [Director Akiva Schaffer] was the co-writer but there was always another writer on set — a friend of Akiva's, obviously — and they would supply alternate endings to scenes. ‘Try this, try that.'”

 










As for whether or not he attempted to emulate Nielsen in his delivery, Neeson said, “No, those sort of notes I wouldn't have accepted. I've done over 100 movies, so I don't need someone to tell me how to act.”

Neeson has indeed done over 100 movies — 106 with “Naked Gun” to be exact — but he had never before done an out-and-out farce. On set, though, the “Taken” actor stuck to business as usual. “When we rehearsed stuff, we'd get rid of our personal giggles. And some of the scene require certain choreography — sight gags and stuff like that. I don't want to say it was always serious, far from it. But it was serious business, of course, shooting any movie and keeping a sense of lightness. You know, that's very important,” he explained.

Working with co-star Pamela Anderson — whom he's now reportedly dating — Neeson described as a wholly pleasant experience. “I admire her very much… No airs and graces, no big ego. She's there to do the work. She's just a lovely human being,” he said.

Neeson is Nielsen's son in the new “Naked Gun” timeline — an interesting choice considering the 72-year-old Neeson is roughly 40 years older than the son that was born to Nielsen and Presley's characters in “The Naked Gun 33 1/2: The Final Insult.” But putting aside that math, Neeson was happy to be associated with the “Airplane!” star… though he did have one condition in which he would definitely not have succeeded him. “But if the producers had said I must bleach my hair for the role, there's no way I would have done that,” Neeson shared.

	The much-hyped battle between Jelly Roll and Logan Paul finally hit the ring Saturday at WWE's SummerSlam event, where the country singer and tag team partner Randy Orton faced off against the social media provocateur and his partner Drew McIntyre. 


	The fight, which was set up over a month ago on Smackdown and was heavily promoted since then, marked Jelly Roll's first official match as a wrestler after making a handful of appearances at WWE events over the past year.


	Jelly Roll — who claimed he broke his pinky and suffered other injuries while training for the match — endured a significant amount of beating during the match; at one point, Jelly Roll was outside the ring, lying on an announcers table when Paul jumped from the top post and landed on the singer, causing the table to overturn. “The day the music died,” one of his opponents quipped.

	That aforementioned move knocked out Jelly Roll for a considerable amount of time as Orton fought against Paul and McIntyre alone. However, he recovered and made his way back to the ring “like the walking dead” in time to accept Orton's tag-in, and delivered some clotheslines and choke slams on Paul to even up the match.

	However, the match concluded when Paul dropped his signature move the “Paul from Grace” on Jelly Roll, who was then promptly pinned and defeated. The loss likely sets up WWE future involvement and an opportunity for revenge for Jelly Roll, but no plans have been announced as yet:

Matty Healy was seen comforting his mother, Denise Welch, outside a restaurant in West Hollywood photos obtained by TMZ show.

She was crying and the singer helped consoled her by giving her a hug, along with sitting on the curb with her and chatting. TMZ reports that “she dabbed her eyes with a tissue,” while they chatted

“The two seem deep in a difficult conversation … with Healy appearing animated at one point while his mom was shedding tears,” the outlet wrote, further reporting that Healy was comforting his mom over a family matter. 

Healy's mom, Denise Welch, appeared on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Thursday, July 24, and the Bravo host asked her about her son's relationship with Swift, along with her album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is rumored to include songs about Swift and Healy's relationship. 

“Obviously, on pain of death can I talk about that episode, but being her mother-in-law is a role that I am glad that I lost,” Welch said. “Not that I have anything against her at all! It was just — it was tricky.”

“She — listen, you're not allowed to say anything, and then she writes a whole album about it,” she continued. “Matty has taken it all in completely good grace… “She — listen, you're not allowed to say anything, and then she writes a whole album about it.” 

According to US Weekly, the songs that were rumored to be about her relationship with Healy are “But Daddy I Love Him,” “Down Bad,” “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” “Guilty as Sin?,' “The Tortured Poets Department,” and “Fortnight.”

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

Following her breakup with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn in April 2023, Swift had a brief relationship with Matty Healy before her love story with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce began. 

Rumors that the two had a fling date back to 2014 when Swift met Healy backstage at one of his concerts. However, Healy denied the rumors shortly after, emphasizing that they had just met and formed a friendship. 

Things started back up again in May 2023 when Healy was spotted at one of Swift's Eras Tour shows. Shortly after, the two were seen in New York City together. 

“She and Matty are madly in love,” a source told The Sun at the time. “It's super-early days, but it feels right.”

However, in June 2023, multiple outlets reported that the two broke up. 

“Taylor and Matty broke up. They are both extremely busy and realized they're not really compatible with each other,” a source told Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor's friends want what's best for her and aren't shocked that their relationship fizzled out, since she recently got out of a long-term relationship.”

Donald Trump is looking to hire 10,000 officers to help carry out his administration's widespread detention and deportation of migrants with tens of billions of dollars in funds from his “Big Beautiful Bill.” 


	Job postings show that in 25 cities from coast to coast, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is hiring deportation officers who will arrest, detain, and deport migrants, and manage migrants' cases. The listings give insight into where ICE may be ramping up operations. 


	ICE has already been carrying out broad arrests, including at workplaces and courthouses. Agents have been wearing masks and lacking identifying information as they snatch immigrants, sometimes breaking their car windows to drag them out faster. 


	“Are you ready to defend the homeland?” the job posting reads. “Launch a dynamic and rewarding career as a Deportation Officer with Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) at ICE! Join a dedicated team safeguarding U.S. borders and upholding immigration laws, playing a key role in defending our nation.”

	At a time when the U.S. job market is slowing down and prices remain high, ICE is offering $50,000 signing bonuses and $60,000 in student loan repayment with a salary of about $50,000 to $90,000. 


	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has already issued 1,000 tentative job offers, the Associated Press reported Friday. A spokesperson for DHS said many of the people offered jobs were “ICE officers who retired under President Biden because they were frustrated that they were not allowed to do their jobs.” These retired officers are being offered $88,000 to $144,000 along with a $50,000 bonus.

	











	An image of Uncle Sam, the ultimate recruitment propaganda, appears on the DHS website with the words “RETURN TO MISSION.” 


	“Your country is calling you to serve at ICE. In the wake of the Biden administration's failed immigration policies, your country needs dedicated men and women of ICE to get the worst of the worst criminals out of our country,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier this week. “This is a defining moment in our nation's history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.”

	ICE is hiring in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to lead a militarized crackdown on protests against his immigration raids. 


	Major cities where ICE is hiring include Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The agency is hiring in several large cities with large Latino populations including Dallas, Houston, Miami Beach, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego. ICE is also hiring in Baltimore, New Orleans, Newark, Saint Paul, and Salt Lake City. 


	The agency is hiring in El Paso, a city on the Texas.-Mexico border where detentions are reportedly increasing. They are also looking to hire in Detroit and Buffalo, which are on the U.S.-Canada border. 


	ICE is looking to hire in Harlingen, a Texas border city. The deportation flights taking migrants to an El Salvador torture prison and war-torn South Sudan, both in defiance of judicial orders in cases that went to the Supreme Court, took off from Harlingen.


	DHS is hiring new criminal investigators, or special agents, at salaries of $63,000 to $102,000 with a bonus $50,000. Returning criminal investigators are being offered $105,000 to $171,000 per year, plus the $50,000 bonus. The department is hiring attorneys all over, at field locations in 90 cities.

	The jobs are being funded with tens of billions of dollars included in Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” the president's first major agenda legislation. The bill also slashes taxes for the wealthy and will force millions of Americans off Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled people. 


	“The funding from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill will play a key role in fulfilling his promise to the American people to deport criminal illegal aliens,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, Politico reported.

	











	“Getting 10,000 [new employees] means basically hiring the people who walk in the door because you're trying to hit your quota,” Josiah Heyman, an anthropology professor who directs the University of Texas at El Paso's Center of Inter-American and Border Studies, told The Los Angeles Times. “Rapid, mass-hiring lends itself to mistakes and cutting corners.”

	The Trump administration is also looking at increasing their use of the military in domestic immigration enforcement, The New Republic reported Saturday. A memo from Philip Hegseth, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's younger brother, calls on military leadership to “feel — for the first time — the urgency of the homeland defense mission” and work together with ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents. 


	“The memo is alarming, because it speaks to the intent to use the military within the United States at a level not seen since Japanese internment,” Carrie Lee, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, told The New Republic. “The military is the most powerful, coercive tool our country has. We don't want the military doing law enforcement. It absolutely undermines the rule of law.”

	In the video, a man putters up and down the street carrying a pitchfork, shouting at his neighbors and at no one, punctuated by the occasional obscenity. He isn't happy that the neighbors are filming. “You guys are taping me? For what?” he asks. “I'm walking down the street! I'm rehearsing! I make movies, man! I'm rehearsing a scene.” During the four-minute, 30-second clip, later shared with local TV news stations in San Antonio, the man mentions police visits to the neighborhood, which had been frequent. He references arson. He hints at a dispute that runs way deeper than this one moment, then claims he has done nothing wrong. “I can yell. I can scream. I can pray,” he says. “Whatever I want.” Separated from the phone recording him by a spearlike black fence, he departs with his pitchfork still in hand. “Keep filming me, boy. Boy,” he says. Bleep. Then the video is over, and he is gone.


	He told no lies about who he was. Jonathan Joss had done big things in Hollywood. He was best known for voicing John Redcorn, a recurring character on the Fox animated sitcom King of the Hill, which ran from 1997 to 2009, and has a reboot scheduled for release Aug. 4 on Hulu, in which Joss is set to return. He also appeared in five episodes of the NBC hit Parks and Recreation as Chief Ken Hotate, a Native American tribal elder, as well as in films like True Grit and The Magnificent Seven. But that night, after filming had ended, another neighbor encountered him outside his San Antonio home. The man shot Joss dead. 

	











	The next day, Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, issued a statement: “We were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship,” he wrote. “Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.” And so, he argued, was the shooting. The couple had been living in hotels after a January fire burned down Joss' longtime home, and had arrived that afternoon just to check the mail. They found a dog's skull and harness “placed in clear view,” Kern de Gonzales wrote, and deduced it was one of their pets — taunting them, they believed, for the fire, which killed Joss' three pups. Before pulling the trigger that night, the neighbor, later identified as Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, also “started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us,” Kern de Gonzales alleged. Ceja Alvarez raised his rifle and aimed toward the couple. Joss pushed his husband out of the way and was hit. He later died at the scene. “He saved my life,” his husband wrote. Ceja Alvarez, according to the police report, told the first officers to arrive, “I shot him.”

	In part because the shooting took place on June 1, the first day of Pride Month, Joss' death became more than a news story. It became a cause. It embodied the worst fears of the queer community, who saw confirmation of homophobic violence growing more mainstream. But almost as quickly, a counter-narrative emerged. A man who was not killed for being gay, but for being intolerable, and according to some, even threatening. “Everyone has made a judgment based on information that contradicts every known fact,” one observer wrote on Facebook. “Before you start screaming ‘hate crime,' spend 5 minutes looking into the past 3 years of his life.” Each perspective was shaped by limited information, snippets of a life reduced to headlines. But conversations with people who knew Joss reveal a complex person whose death defies an easy explanation. Jonathan Joss was a devoted friend and partner to his husband, and he struggled with addiction and mental health. He was engaged with his fans, and prone to violent verbal outburst and erratic behavior. He was an attentive friend and a difficult neighbor. He was entrepreneurial, and an accomplished professional — but unpredictable. Chaotic.


	So much so that when Brandy Wahl-Trejo, a longtime ex-girlfriend, learned that he had been killed, she wasn't surprised it had happened. “I was surprised,” she says, “that it took this long.”

	WAHL-TREJO HAD DATED JOSS for 13 years, starting in 2006, she says, when she visited a friend who lived in Joss' neighborhood. The first time she saw him, Joss was wielding an ax, trying to chop down a neighbor's fence. Wahl-Trejo believed him when he told her the neighbor was running a chop shop in their yard. His mom lived with him, he said, and it was keeping her up at night. Wahl-Trejo was 28, using meth, and ready to believe anything. She says Joss was a regular meth user then, too.


	“I've got $5,000,” Wahl-Trejo  remembers Joss telling her that same day. “Want to go to Vegas?” They stayed at the Hard Rock Casino. They gambled and attended a marijuana convention. And when it was over, she followed him to the Viejas Reservation outside San Diego, where they stayed with some of his friends. Within a week, she says, Joss got them kicked out. “He gets loud and wants attention and starts stirring up trouble,” she says. But she also loved that he didn't judge her. That he could make her feel at ease with herself and her past. “He could make me smile when there wasn't really a lot of reasons for me to smile.”

	











	They set off for his houseboat in Marina del Rey, two hours up the coast. During the drive, Wahl-Trejo says, Joss' continued meth use sparked hallucinations and frantic yelling. She remembers pulling over at a psychiatric facility. “I don't know what's wrong with this guy,” she says she told them. “Y'all need to help him.” But Joss instantly transformed. “He sat there and put on his best act, like he was a good boy,” she says. “And they made me feel crazy.”


	She kept going on their road trip because she'd never seen California, nor the new life it promised. Joss made her feel good about herself. He made her smile. And the world he brought her into may have been volatile, but it was also novel and exciting and, eventually, downright life-affirming — even if the houseboat was disappointing, especially for a man of his credentials. “It looked like the dinghy of the boat in front of it,” she says. 


	The Jonathan Joss origin story Wahl-Trejo cobbled together, over time, goes like this: Joss grew up in San Antonio, born to parents of Comanche and White Mountain Apache descent, and worked in their restaurant starting in middle school. To make it a bit more fun, he inhabited different characters to wait on different tables, which unlocked his love of acting. He would tell her that his parents never took his professional acting ambitions seriously, which bugged him, because he wanted nothing more than to make them proud. He graduated from a local Catholic university in 1990 with a degree in theater, and by 1994, he'd appeared in Walker, Texas Ranger. It's remarkable, Wahl-Trejo admits, what he was able to achieve at a time when very few Native American actors got big opportunities. And she's not the only one who thinks so. 


	“Jonathan was one of the very few actors who up-and-coming Native people could look up to,” says Tafv Sampson, a Native actress whose father, Tim, lived for a time on Joss' houseboat. “He's kind of an icon in that way.” He was even rarer in the sense that some of his contemporaries from the 1990s, legends like Graham Greene and Wes Studi, weren't showing up in comedies, and here he was in 1997 getting cast in the latest Mike Judge animated project. “The only roles really available at that time were the stoic Indian, the warrior, the savage,” Sampson says. “And Jonathan got to be a cartoon character. That was really rare back then, to be able to play and poke fun and make Rez jokes, and sort of be the lonely voice in the room bringing that comedy in.”

	











	Mike Schur, the acclaimed co-creator of Parks and Recreation, also remembers Joss as “an actor that you never had to explain anything to.” He was always funny, and always a professional. He was first recommended to Schur by Parks and Rec co-creator Greg Daniels, who had worked with Joss on King of the Hill. Daniels had no hesitations, as far as Schur recalls, and thought he'd be a perfect fit for the role of John Redcorn. Joss once told Schur that he really liked the fact that his character on the show wore a suit, because all his past characters wore more traditional, more cliché Native costumes. “He really liked that,” Schur says. “That was meaningful to him.” Schur never had any trouble with Joss on set, and doesn't remember anyone else who did, either. After Joss died, a group text among former cast and crew flooded with only fond memories. “He was just lovely,” Schur says. “He just was a lovely part of the show.” 


	Joss' signature role as John Redcorn on King of the Hill began in Season Two, after the character's original voice actor died in a car accident. Joss would go on to perform in the Red Corn Band, an acoustic, bluesy group which released its first album in 2004. Joss loved the Redcorn character, Wahl-Trejo remembers, even though he felt self-conscious about the fact that he was a replacement actor. “He never felt like he deserved any kind of recognition for what he did, yet he wanted recognition for what he did,” she adds. “He was just so conflicted and at odds with himself.”


	That inner conflict could spill out in explosive ways. Wahl-Trejo says she got sober in 2007; Joss, as far as she knows, never did. During filming for his role as Denali, a rogue Comanche assassin in Antoine Fuqua's 2016 remake of  The Magnificent Seven, cast members were given slushies during breaks. Wahl-Trejo, who was on set with Joss, remembers him losing it when Denzel Washington got two, and he only got one. When he was told second slushies were “only for the main cast,” he “flipped out,” she says, and took off on foot down a dirt road in Louisiana, in costume, bound for nowhere. His volatile behavior was even worse at conventions, which became a major source of his income. “I cannot tell you how many comic cons we have been uninvited to because Jonathan just acts crazy,” Wahl-Trejo says. “If he would have just acted right, he would have gone so, so far. Jonathan was his own worst enemy.”

	











	Joss' self-destructive instincts, Wahl-Trejo says, were at their worst in his dealings with neighbors. “He terrorized that neighborhood,” she says. Once, when his neighbor from three doors down — Ceja Alvarez, who would later be accused of his murder — installed a fence for Joss' next-door neighbor, Joss claimed it encroached an inch and a half onto his property, Wahl-Trejo remembers. He responded, she says, by dousing the fence with red paint. And in an area where many of his neighbors were Latin American, Joss, Wahl-Trejo adds, had a habit of using racist insults. He'd call people names, threaten to get their kids taken from them. Kern de Gonzales offers a different perspective rooted in context. “If he ever said something in anger, it was in response to being verbally attacked,” he explains. “Jonathan did not have xenophobic beliefs. He believed no human was illegal. He told me that many times, and it came from a deep understanding of what it means to have your very existence questioned.” 


	Nevertheless, Wahl-Trejo argues, Joss was often to blame for the conflict. Back when they were still together, sometimes he'd go out of town for work, and she'd stay in the house without him. The difference, she remembers, was obvious. “Everybody could relax. Everybody didn't have to stay inside,” she says. “And then he would come into town, and everybody would have to stay in their houses because he would just act like an asshole.”


	Other neighbors told a nearly identical story. “They don't know what we went through,” Alejandro Ceja, a relative of the shooter, told the San Antonio Express-News. “We were afraid — all the time.” Another neighbor alleged in the same story that Joss would often run around brandishing weapons, including a machete and a tomahawk he liked to throw at telephone poles. Joss' shooter, in a June 2024 police report, claimed Joss had driven past his house waving a crossbow and hurling racial slurs. Multiple neighbors reported Joss to police for damaging their fences with his Hummer. “Everyone can try to judge me for what I have said about my neighbor,” one person wrote on Facebook, “but y'all didn't live next to him and witnessed everything he did.” Ceja Alvarez, the shooter, echoed Wahl-Trejo's recollections from 2006 in police reports: Joss would put on an act when police arrived, then resume harassment after they left. Reports documented Joss driving by Ceja Alvarez's house threateningly, once saying he was “coming for him.” 

	











	Josh Long, a local San Antonio friend who met Joss at a comic con roughly 15 years ago, remembers visits where Joss would gallop out the door when certain neighbors walked by, sometimes provoked and sometimes not. He'd yell at them to get away from his property, and from Long's car. “He'd come back all winded and mad,” Long says, “and you could see the anger in his face.” Joss, he adds, is best described as a “force of nature” — for better and worse.


	Wahl-Trejo left Joss in 2019, after which he got married to a different woman in 2020; then divorced in 2023; then married again, this time to Kern de Gonzales, a trans man, after coming out as gay. All the while, despite the difficulties, Wahl-Trejo always felt indebted to Joss. She was a girl from the south side of San Antonio, and because of him, she got out and grew into her full self — and had an awful lot of fun along the way. “I would have never been able to meet Chris Pratt or Amy Poehler or Josh Brolin. Brittany Murphy was, like, my friend. All these things would have never, ever happened if not for Jonathan,” she says. Even her sobriety, she owes in part to her time with him. To the world he opened up for her. “That's what kept me around so long,” she adds. “I felt like I owed him something in life, because I felt like he gave me my life back.” At the end, though, her purse of forgiveness had finally been emptied.


	The last time Wahl-Trejo saw Joss was a few months before the shooting, when she happened to be in his neighborhood. She drove by his house and found Joss outside, in his underwear, with an arrow in one hand and a pan in the other. “I didn't stop and talk to him,” says Wahl-Trejo. “I just kept going.”


	COURTNEY LYNN SENT JOSS A a Facebook friend request back in 2016. She didn't expect him to respond — but he did, almost right away. She'd been a fan of his work, from King of the Hill to Tulsa King, but starting then, she became a fan of his person, too. Joss was a prolific poster, livestreaming videos and sharing updates about his daily life on a near-constant basis. The messages offered any fan's dream: a window into his existence. But Joss wasn't posting for branding alone. He cherished those fan interactions. And many of his fans likewise cherished him. They never saw the side of Joss that Wahl-Trejo and his neighbors describe. 

	











	After Joss' death, hundreds of his fans flocked to Facebook to offer condolences. Some of them had known him personally, but many did not. Some lamented not being able to meet him in person. Others talked about how he still had so much to give. “I can't believe this is true,” one wrote. “I was so excited to meet you one day.” 


	Lynn was yet another voice in the chorus. Her connection to Joss, she explains, grew in 2023, when she re-joined TikTok. He followed her, and messaged her randomly with a “Hello” and a waving sticker. They chatted briefly over DMs, but never really talked until shortly before Joss' house burned down in January. He'd been trying to sell his very own “King of the Grill” spice blend — an idea hatched back in 2011 with his longtime friend and collaborator, Robert Rios. He'd sold many things on Facebook, from T-shirts to headshots to personal videos, often corresponding with buyers through his personal phone number. Lynn reached out to place an order, and Joss video-called her right away. Joss told jokes in his John Redcorn voice and was nothing but pleasant. Later, they talked more over text. “He was definitely somebody who was going to speak his mind and tell his truth, and he wasn't afraid of what other people thought,” Lynn says. “I liked that about him.”


	Joss, in general, showed up for his friends — digital and nondigital alike. Like Patrick Zachary Cortez, who remembered him in a Facebook post as a childhood friend, someone always willing to help or to call him up at random hours for “hilarious diatribes,” and for generally being “kind, giving, respectful, articulate, well-mannered and sweet.” Likewise, Rios remembers Joss as smart and welcoming. He was happy to talk to anyone, fans and friends alike. “He knew a lot. He would teach you a lot,” Rios says. “He would stand out. He would take over. Very lovable. Very gullible. And he could get by on a dollar any day of the week.”


	Long, the friend who met Joss around 2010, remembers hanging out with him last year — one of his last visits before Joss died. Long had just lost his job and was feeling down. Joss invited him over, cooked up some homemade chalupas, and joked about how they were eating “tapas” — “you know,” Long remembers Joss saying, “the Spanish word that white people call broke Mexican food.” Long chokes up at the memory. “The good times around Jon were really good,” he says. “And then the bad times were sad, watching from the outside, wondering what he was going through.” Long insists he never saw Joss so much as drink around him, but he suspected his friend was drinking or using substances, just given the emotional roller coaster he appeared to be on from one visit to the next. That, and what seemed to Long to be an accelerating waste in his face.

	











	Trey Brown, a King of the Hill superfan with a Hank Hill tattoo on his thigh, knew nothing of Joss' struggles when planning his wedding back in 2022. He happened to Google members of the show's cast, which led him to Joss' website, where he saw an advertisement for one more entrepreneurial venture: For a few hundred dollars, Joss would perform wedding ceremonies. Right then, Brown hired him. 


	The ceremony was supposed to take place at the Alamo. Rain forced the couple to relocate to their hotel room, where Joss met them dressed in tight black pants, white cowboy boots, and a scarlet stole. The couple brought along the bride's father, while Joss brought along his then-wife. Joss placed a pair of moccasins between the couple, symbolizing their journey. “He really incorporated his personal touch into the ceremony,” Brown says. “He turned it into a pretty great experience.” In return, Joss asked for his payment of several hundred dollars and a bottle of Crown Royal Vanilla. While Brown mostly remembers someone who took his role as a wedding officiant seriously, he also saw someone who was troubled. As a minister in a religion called “Dudeism,” inspired by the Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski, Brown calls himself the “Official Dude” of Texas. When he told Joss about his spiritual work, Joss “took that in a way where he's like, ‘Oh, I can talk to this guy about my problems.'” He'd call often to vent. About what, Brown will not say, citing religious confidentiality. But Joss, he remembers, said plenty. He was almost dying to be heard.


	In a tribute to his friend, Brown is planning to get a new King of the Hill tattoo — this one featuring a shirtless John Redcorn, with one word underneath: “Persevere.”


	THE MAN WHO WOULD SOON FIND find himself at the center of a national debate about hate crimes, homophobia, and what really happened that evening in Texas, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, met Jonathan Joss online, too, having admired his work in Parks and Recreation. On TikTok, he watched Joss throw knives and feed homemade tortillas to his dogs. “I thought the knife-throwing thing was the coolest thing I'd ever seen,” says Kern de Gonzales, 32. “I thought, ‘Why don't I throw knives in my house?'” Kern de Gonzales reached out to express appreciation, not expecting a response. He got one right away.


	That was Jan. 19, 2023. By February, Kern de Gonzales, who lived in South Carolina, was visiting Texas. “He was wearing a beautiful blue dress with a leather jacket and cowboy boots,” Kern de Gonzales recalls of their first meeting. “It was an absolutely iconic look.” The real spark, though, was their conversation. “We both just felt instantly safe with each other,” he explains. “Almost like we had known each other for a long, long time.” He was struck when Joss thanked him for his kindness. “It took me aback,” he admits. “But also it made me start thinking, ‘Why aren't more people nice to you?'”

	











	Kern de Gonzales didn't dare imagine, at first, that their bond would be anything more than friendship. “I didn't even know he had any sugar in the tank,” he says of Joss's orientation. But he had a suspicion, based on a few suggestive TikTok videos, which was confirmed when Joss started flirting with him. “I was elated,” he remembers, “but at the same time a little nervous.” Kern de Gonzales had to explain that not only was he gay, but trans. He worried about how Joss would react, which he finds silly in hindsight. “You know, we have two-spirit people in the indigenous community,” he remembers Joss telling him, and that was the end of it. “There was no hesitation,” Kern de Gonzales says. “I didn't feel like I had to be anything other than myself.”


	Joss, however, had struggled with defining his own orientation. “It took him a long time to figure out and just come to terms with who he was,” Kern de Gonzales says. Only recently, in the last few years, did Joss begin to embrace his true sexuality. Yet he also told his future husband about performing in drag shows many years before they'd met. They bonded over their shared love of Tina Turner songs. Joss told him he'd worked in gay bars. “He had always been around the community,” Kern de Gonzales says in his steady Southern drawl. “It just took a little bit, I think, for him to find a label and then find acceptance.” Once he did, though, he was very open about it. “Having a faithful spouse who stands by you 100% is worth more than all the money in the world,” Joss posted on May 3. “Never have to worry about where he is and he builds me up. We can handle anything together.”


	When Kern de Gonzales moved in with Joss, though, he immediately got a front-row seat to the conflict that, in the days following Joss' shooting, would be described in local and national news reports. KSAT, the local ABC affiliate, detailed 66 visits to Joss' home between September 2023 and his death, along with a more specific breakdown: 13 “disturbance neighbor” calls; 10 mental health calls; four wellness checks; and numerous conflicts with Ceja Alvarez, his shooter, in particular. In an interview with the San Antonio Express-News, one neighbor claimed he never heard homophobic insults hurled toward Joss. Long also doesn't remember hearing anything homophobic when he saw Joss fighting with his neighbors, although he admits most of the flare-ups he saw took place before Joss and Kern de Gonzales were together. Kern de Gonzales, however, describes an atmosphere of rampant harassment of all kinds, including frequent homophobia. He views Joss as a victim of neighbors who tormented him for being different and a local law enforcement apparatus that did nothing to help him. In a statement to Rolling Stone, the San Antonio Police Department's Public Information Office defended its response. “SAPD officers responded to more than 70 calls for service at Joss' address,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “Additionally, the [San Antonio Fear Free Environment] officer assigned to the neighborhood maintained regular contact with both Joss and his neighbors for over a year. The SAPD Mental Health Unit was also engaged and provided additional resources and support.” 

	











	But those interventions were hollow, Kern de Gonzales argues. All show, no substance. “Jonathan would be trying to report through the proper channels,” he says, “but a lot of it was just dismissed because it was easier for them to say, ‘Oh, you're just high. You're just hearing things.” Joss was begging to be heard, in other words — but no one was listening to what he had to say. 


	Then came the house fire, and a video that circulated in its aftermath. The video was filmed that same day in January, when local news trucks showed up to ask about the blaze. At first, Joss blamed himself. He admitted to burning mesquite wood indoors — not in a fireplace — for warmth that morning. “It was my mistake,” he said. “We checked the fire, and we thought there was no fire burning, but evidently there was.” Case closed, argue his critics: He burned down his own house. He said so right there. 


	Yet the rest of the clip was framed around his ongoing feud with his neighbors. And at one point, he did hint at threats of arson. “I've already had neighbors tell me to leave. [That] they're gonna burn my house down. Call me a fag,” he said. “All these different things.” 


	The official investigation, a spokesman for the San Antonio fire department tells Rolling Stone, has been closed. He wouldn't reveal the specific findings, but referred to the aforementioned video. While no criminal charges were filed, it marked the first in a series of bizarre headlines for Joss in the months leading up to his death. 


	THE COUPLE HAD PLANNED TO LEAVE San Antonio, Kern de Gonzales says. They just needed to pick up a check from a charity for fire victims from Joss' mailbox, which is why they were there on the evening of the shooting. They were going to use the money to buy a teardrop trailer and drive around the country. “I really try hard not to think about how close we got [to leaving],” Kern de Gonzales says. He finds some comfort in Joss' rich legacy, including a “historical Western horror” graphic novel that is set to be published posthumously next year in June, for Pride Month. But those final days do linger. 


	On May 30, two days before the shooting, the couple visited Austin, where a King of the Hill reboot panel was scheduled featuring Mike Judge, the show's co-creator and star, as well as five other major figures — including main-character voice actors, its co-creator, and the revival's showrunner. Many other prominent cast members weren't invited, but Joss felt uniquely left out. “That character, that voice, that story…they were my home, my pride, my connection to something bigger than myself,” he wrote in an April 21 Facebook post. “To not be invited felt like being shut out of a place I helped build.” 

	











	So he showed up anyway. About 37 minutes in, he commandeered an audience mic long before the scheduled Q&A had begun. He started with a tribute to Johnny Hardwick, the voice of Dale Gribble, who died of undetermined causes in 2023. But from there, his speech was difficult to follow. He pivoted to the interruption itself: “I see a mic, I use it,” he said. “I see a wrong, I make it right. I want to breathe.” He repeated his claim that his neighbors burned his house down “because I'm gay.” He quoted one of John Redcorn's most famous songs from the show, “There's a Hole in My Pocket Where My Money Should Go,” to reference his own dire financial situation. In a play-by-play account of what happened written for Variety, the panel's moderator later called it “jarring for everyone.”


	The next night, at a marijuana-themed venue called the Green Room, Joss appeared on a King of the Hill-themed podcast hosted by a pair of superfans. He explained the panel outburst stemmed from feeling disrespected on behalf of his character, who had come to define him — from his band to his spices to his fame. “When the only thing in my life — other than my husband — I got because somebody else lost their life,” he said, “I kind of owed it to myself to make an asshole out of myself.” Later, the subject turned to his ongoing neighborhood feud. To investigators refusing to “rule out” arson. And to a dark bit of sarcasm. “I would never hurt my dogs. I would never light my dogs on fire,” he said, following up with an apparent joke: “That's why I shot the little fuckers. And then I burned the house.” One host asked Joss whether he was sober. “No. No. Man, I've already lost everything. My house burned down. I ain't gonna give up drugs,” he said. “I ain't gonna give up drinkin'. They're my friends.” The other host remained silent throughout, later explaining in YouTube comments that he was “just watching and soaking it in.” His empathy for addicts, and for Joss' obvious pain, left him “at a loss for words.”


	The next day, Joss would be dead. His shooter, Ceja Alvarez, would claim self defense and deny allegations of homophobia, and his relative would tell the San Antonio Express-News that no one in the family had made homophobic comments to Joss. Ceja Alvarez's lawyer didn't respond to Rolling Stone's multiple requests for comment, but he did speak with KSAT on June 24, arguing that the shooting “has nothing to do with sexual orientation” and that “people in Texas have a right not to be a victim.” His client, he said, had a right to self-defense, and said that “other people know the real truth about the circumstances and the often dangerous behavior” of Joss.

	











	Kern de Gonzales, following his initial statement, has continued to insist the shooting was motivated by bigotry. And while San Antonio police at first rejected the hate-crime allegations, they later walked back that statement, saying it was still too soon to tell. 


	That night at the Green Room also marked Joss' final performance. With Rios backing him on guitar, he belted out “There's a Hole in My Pocket Where My Money Should Go” to several dozen people. “We couldn't leave without playing that,” says Rios. “There's a hole in my heart where he used to go.”

	Rios also has a video from that night. It shows Joss stomping, grunting, chanting, and shuffling across a stage in cowboy boots and a form-fitting white vest. Without additional context, the video is baffling. But Kern de Gonzales was there, and he saw something beautiful. When Joss was on that stage, tortured as he was, he could be at peace in performance. In what he loved. And in the company of the fans who made it possible. “Everyone was really nice to him,” Kern de Gonzales says. “That's something that he really, really needed.” 


	These final glimpses of Jonathan Joss capture what makes his story so unsettling. We crave clear heroes and villains, but Joss embodied contradiction — bringing representation to underserved communities while battling demons; creating memorable characters while struggling to understand himself. His life defies the easy narratives of the internet, challenging us to recognize excellence without excusing behavior. To see humanity without ignoring responsibility. In the space between binary judgments, complicated people leave complicated legacies. And they shouldn't be remembered by choosing sides, but by embracing the messy reality — something Joss seems to have understood instinctively as he moved through life, always stomping away to a rhythm all his own.

Some scary incidents leave a lasting mark, especially when they involve your family. Mandy Moore is speaking out after her family was involved in a frightening hit-and-run accident.  The “This Is Us” star shared the news Friday on Instagram Stories, revealing that everyone is safe, but she didn't hold back when addressing the driver who fled the scene.

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

“The woman who rear-ended my family and then drove off, we pulled over, hope your karma finds you,” Moore wrote on her (now expired) Instagram stories, as reported by Page Six. “Thankfully everyone was ok but what kind of human does that?”

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

The 41-year-old actress didn't go into further detail about the incident. However, she made it clear that the experience was both alarming and upsetting.

Just like her role as fiercely protective mom Rebecca Pearson on “This Is Us,” Mandy Moore is just as devoted to protecting her family in real life. 

Moore, who shares sons August, 4, Oscar, 2, and daughter Louise, 10 months, with husband Taylor Goldsmith, has become known for fiercely standing up for her loved ones.

In January, she clapped back at social media users who criticized her for posting a GoFundMe campaign to help her in-laws recover after losing their home in the Los Angeles wildfires. Some questioned why she wasn't covering the costs herself.

“And people questioning whether we're helping out our own family or attributing some arbitrary amount of money Google says someone has is NOT helpful or empathetic. Of course we are,” Moore wrote in an updated caption, as reported by People on 12th January, 2025.

“We just lost most of our life in a fire too. Kindly F OFF. no one is forcing you to do anything.”

Following the devastating fire that destroyed her in-laws' home, Moore also took to social media in February to express frustration after an Amazon package was delivered to the burned property. 

“Can we not have better discretion than to leave a package at a residence that no longer exists?” she wrote alongside a photo of the destroyed home with the package sitting outside, as reported by People. “This is my mother and father-in-law's home. Smh.”

Chris Meloni will return to his alma mater, Law & Order: SVU, for the upcoming 27th season of the perennially popular procedural, the actor confirmed in a recent Instagram post.


	“Hangin with friends on a Friday nite @therealmariskahargitay @dannflorek,” the Emmy-nominated actor wrote on social media alongside selfies of himself with fellow series vets Mariska Hargitay and Dann Florek.


	Deadline's sister publication TVLine first reported the news, which follows previous announcements of behind-the-scenes changes at the NBC juggernaut. In May, Deadline exclusively reported that Juliana Martinez and Octavio Pisano would not be returning to SVU as series regulars, and writer/executive producer Julie Martin and director/executive producer Norberto Barba would also be exiting the venerable drama. Additionally, Kelli Giddish is returning full-time, reprising her role as Amanda Rollins. And, viewers will get to see more of Captain Curry via Aimé Donna Kelly, who is being upped from her heavily recurring role to series regular.

	Both SVU and the mothership Dick Wolf series were renewed by the network earlier this year, with Michele Fazekas stepping in as the showrunner, the first woman to shepherd the veteran series. The two shows are having their best seasons on Peacock in total viewers in Live+35, having reached more than 44 million total viewers across linear and digital platforms this season, combined.


	Meloni's Elliot Stabler exited SVU back in Season 12 as a series regular, though he has featured a number of times since his departure, most notably during Season 24, when his character and Hargitay's Olivia Benson shared a near-kiss, driving both a ratings high and fans wild. Just earlier this week, the actor responded to a fan's demand that his character “kiss her already” with “I'm f—ing trying.”


	Both flagship Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU will return Sept. 25.

As far as I'm aware it's only for the one episode. I don't expect more than a single scene either. Cassidy and Huang are also in this episode.

So, for a single episode? The whole season? I suppose they can't share how many, but it would be nice to have a general idea.

Ioan Gruffudd, who notably portrayed Mister Fantastic/Reed Richards in 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four duology, reflected on the scrapped plans for a proposed third film that never came to be.


	In a Q&A with Vulture tied to the release of Marvel's new take on the storied comic book family, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the Welsh actor talked about feeling “incredibly proud to be part of such a beautiful franchise,” which comprised 2005's Fantastic Four and 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.


	“The mindset was that we were going to do three, and I think the second movie was equally successful as the first and equally enjoyable for the fans,” said Gruffudd, who attended the world premiere of the MCU entry, which features Pedro Pascal in the main role. “I particularly loved working with Doug Jones [as the Silver Surfer] on that movie, who's just a terrific artist and an expert in the field of movement. If you want to witness somebody bringing a character to life physically, he's just untouchable. So there was definitely that sort of momentum, and the plan was to do three movies, but these decisions are beyond my control.”

	Though both aughts superhero films had a box office upward of $300 million and similar mixed/positive reviews, Fox scrapped a potential threequel and, by 2009, announced plans to reboot the franchise, per previous reporting. That movie, released in 2015, featured Miles Teller as Reed Richards and was a critical and box office flop. 

	











	Speaking to his previous comments about having lost confidence and seeking therapy after the pace of his projects slowed down post-franchise, Gruffudd told the outlet: “As an actor, you almost grieve every part that you've played, and this was no different. This was a massive stepping stone in my career, and because this was two movies over several years, the character becomes part of you. So I think the grieving process is that you've enjoyed the character so much and you're not getting to play them again.”


	The Black Hawk Down actor also said he is “excited that the comic and franchise lives on” with Marvel's 1960s-set reimagining, though regarding any future reprisals he noted: “I'm not in the new movie. Fans are convinced that I'm going to be in a particular aspect of this universe that hasn't been written or filmed yet. But this idea of people showing up has been introduced, like Chris [Evans' Johnny Storm] in Deadpool [& Wolverine], or I think Mister Fantastic appeared in the guise of John Krasinski at one point. So, no, I haven't been approached to reprise Mister Fantastic. But you never know.”


	Since its July 25 release, First Steps accumulated just short of $200 million at the box office, facing a 66% decline in the vicinity of Captain America: Brave New World in its second weekend in theaters.

The first two films were pretty mundane, but they got most of the cast very, very right – it's a shame they couldn't deliver as well on the other aspects of the film.

his version way way better than the recent one.

That's nostalgia talking

After ‘Freakier Friday,' the actress is next set to star in the upcoming Hulu drama ‘Count My Lies.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Lindsay Lohan is opening up about her feelings of being pigeonholed by roles she's played in the past as a longstanding actress in the entertainment industry. 


	After starring in 1998's The Parent Trap when she was 12, Lohan's career skyrocketed. She went on to appear in many more beloved projects, including Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, and she is next up set to reprise her role in the former film with the 2025 followup Freakier Friday. 




	In a Saturday profile with The Times U.K., Lohan admitted that she “wanted to take a minute” to herself, which saw her shy away from leading roles from 2013 until 2022.

	“I was losing that feeling of excitement about doing a film, and I wanted to live my own life for a bit, figure out how to have a more private life, a real life,” she explained. “I wanted to wait to get that itch again.” 


	A new project Lohan is admittedly excited about is her upcoming Hulu Drama Count My Lies, where she will star and produce. Still, when reflecting on her career thus far and asked if she felt “pigeonholed,” she replied, “Yeah, I do.” 


	“I was so thrilled to work on A Prairie Home Companion, and yet even today I have to fight for stuff that is like that, which is frustrating. Because, well, you know me as this — but you also know I can do that. So let me! Give me the chance,” Lohan said. “I have to break that cycle and open doors to something else, leaving people no choice. And in due time, if Martin Scorsese reaches out, I'm not going to say no.”


	At the Los Angeles premiere of Freakier Friday, Lohan told The Hollywood Reporter that moving forward in her career, she would “​​like to take on some more serious, dramatic roles,” further noting that she felt a bit of pressure to stick to the rom-com genre. 

	











	“I love doing romantic comedy because that's where my home is and I feel like where my fans want to see me, but I'd like to take on some things that are different; maybe find something that's an action-packed film. Just really show people a different side of me,” she added.

WASHINGTON — Comedian Matt Rife says he is officially now the "legal guardian" of the allegedly haunted Annabelle doll.

The 29-year-old comedian announced on social media on Friday that he and his friend Elton Castee have purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home, along with their haunted collection. 

"If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted. You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history," Rife said. "Ed and Lorain Warren arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time, The Conjuring House, Amityville Horror, et…" 

The 29-year-old also revealed his future plans for the Occult Museum. 

"We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place," he added. 

A post shared by Matt Rife (@mattrife)

Rife said him and Castee are the "legal guardians" of the supposedly haunted collection for "at least five years." 

Castee, who is a self-proclaimed ghost hunter, teased the purchase on his social media earlier this week. 

"@mattrife & I have officially bought the world's most haunted location," Castee said on social media. "We've been working on this nearly all year & it is finally happening  I am making sure this will be the best paranormal investigation location on the planet."

Annabelle is a supposedly haunted Raggedy Ann doll which, according to rumor, became supernaturally active sometime in the 1970s. 

The Warrens, who make a living investigating paranormal phenomenon and writing about them, say they were contacted by a student nurse in 1970 about issues with the doll. 

The student was given the doll as a gift, but it quickly began acting strangely, and a psychic told her that it was inhabited by the ghost of a girl named "Annabelle." According to the legend, the student and her roommate tried to live with the doll's growing supernatural nature as it appeared and disappeared seemingly at random. 

Eventually, the doll began showing aggressive behavior, fixating on a friend of the roommates named Lou. Threatening notes were left to Lou on parchment, despite nobody in the house having any on hand, and on at least one occasion, Lou reported being attacked physically by the doll. It reportedly scratched him across the chest and tried to strangle him. 

The Warrens were called in and determined the doll had been demonically possessed. They then took the doll to house it safely in their paranormal museum.

Rumors began circulating in May that Annabelle had gone missing in the midst of a paranormal tour across the U.S. with some other items from the Warrens' collection. 

But video evidence shows the doll, which isn't supposed to be moved in order to avoid antagonizing the malevolent spirit inside, safely back at home behind glass at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. 

During July, one of the lead tour guides and paranormal educators on the Annabelle doll tour passed away suddenly after bringing the doll to Pennsylvania as part of a paranormal tour series.

      The recent pre-publication on the research on the images from the First Palomar Sky Study contains the ”earth shadow test”. The researchers analysed 106,339 transients in the northern hemisphere, and showed that transients are far less prevalent in the earths shadow. This would mean that the transients are in fact real objects, and can only be seen when lit up by the sun.
    


      In the sampled altitude of 42,164 kilometers, the expected number was 1223 but only 349 were found. The probability of this occuring by chance is less than 1 in 1 000 000 000 000 000, one in a quadrillion. It is as certain that these things are real as it is certain that the sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after that, for a billion years.
    


      If i dropped a grain of sand on the beach and you came to pick it up the next day, the likelihood of you picking the correct one is as unlikely as these objects being plate defects.
    


      Edit: It seems that Beatrice Villarroel and colleagues have found even more evidence that there are far fewer transients in the earths shadow.

In a twist that sounds straight out of a horror movie—and just as much like an elaborate prank—comedian Matt Rife has officially become the “legal guardian” of paranormal's most notorious resident: the Annabelle doll. Yep, Matt Rife, the rising standup comic with a huge Gen Z following, announced this week that he's in charge of Ed and Lorraine Warren's entire mysterious haunted artifact collection, including the doll that inspired the Conjuring and Annabelle blockbuster horror flicks.

 

 

Rife broke the news on Instagram and TikTok, gleefully letting fans know that he, together with online ghost-hunter Elton Castee, purchased the legendary Connecticut home once owned by the late Warrens—real-life paranormal investigators and the inspiration behind some of pop culture's favorite horror tales.

 

But here's the kicker: while Rife and Castee own the house and can show off the chilling Occult Museum, they don't actually own the haunted artifacts inside. Instead, they're appointed as “legal guardians and caretakers” of these items for at least the next five years. That list includes over 750 spooky objects, crowned by the world-famous Annabelle doll, still locked away in a glass case (for now). Their plan? Reopen the Warren Museum—closed since Lorraine Warren's death in 2019—for overnight ghost stays and guided tours where anyone brave enough can get chills up close and personal.

 

Annabelle isn't just any doll. Her legacy began in the 1970s, when a nursing student received her as a gift and soon reported strange—and sometimes violent—phenomena. The Warrens stepped in, determined the doll housed an evil spirit, and ever since, Annabelle has been kept under tight lock and key at the Warren Museum, glowing under an ominous red light. Her creepy reputation inspired a wave of horror movies and memeable supernatural speculation—she's the ultimate pop-culture boogeyman.

 

Rife didn't waste time hyping up what's next for Annabelle and the haunted collection. In his words, “Ed and Lorraine Warren arguably put demonology and the paranormal into the mainstream…We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place”. For Rife, who has said The Conjuring is his favorite horror series, it's a dream come true—and, judging by the giddy posts, maybe the weirdest “life flex” any stand-up comic's ever bragged about.

 

There's already buzz about whether Rife can actually keep the paranormal at bay. After all, the world's most haunted objects—and Annabelle especially—might not be the best roommates for a comic who's used to slaying crowds, not slaying ghosts.

 

The Annabelle legend got an extra jolt of drama just weeks ahead of Rife's announcement. Social media was set ablaze with rumors that the doll had gone missing during a recent Louisiana paranormal tour, prompting panic and jokes alike. The frenzy escalated after well-known doll-handler Dan Rivera died suddenly on the road. Some fans even claimed the doll “vanished” from his hotel room, fueling wild speculation that Annabelle had made another escape bid.

 

But not to worry (or maybe worry more?)—live feeds and museum staff soon shared footage of Annabelle safely in her glass box in Connecticut. The notorious doll, it seems, was never far from home despite the internet's freakout.

 

The Warren Museum, once the heart of Ed and Lorraine Warren's lifelong pursuit of the paranormal, is ground zero for haunted Americana. From cursed necklaces and vampire coffins to the infamous Annabelle, the (recently closed) museum drew horror buffs and thrill-seekers from all over the world. Lorraine Warren, who passed away in April 2019, was celebrated as a true trailblazer for ghost hunters, co-authoring books and inspiring an entire genre of movies.

 

As for Rife, stepping into the Warrens' shoes puts him at the center of modern supernatural lore. Will he bring new eyes—and maybe new believers—to the spooky world of haunted collecting? Or will Annabelle start pulling any pranks of her own? For now, one thing's literally locked in: the Annabelle doll isn't going anywhere…unless she decides to.

TikTok has removed a contentious anti-Israel video that was posted by influencer and famous beauty mogul Huda Kattan.

In a video shared with her over 11 million TikTok followers, Kattan, the creator and spokesperson for the billion-dollar company Huda Beauty, accused Israel of masterminding the September 11 terrorist attacks, World War I, World War II, and the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

Notably, both World Wars I (1914–1918) and II (1939–1945) took place prior to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

“All of the conspiracy theories coming out and a lot of evidence behind them — that Israel has been behind World War I, World War II, September 11, October 7 — they allowed all of this stuff to happen. Is this crazy?” Kattan stated on camera. “Like, I had a feeling — I was like, ‘Are they behind every world war?' Yes.”

Speaking to CNN, TikTok spokesman confirmed that they pulled Kattan's video for breaking its community rules, a spokesman confirmed to CNN.

“In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” as per TikTok community rules.

“We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.”

The video has sparked calls on social media and among Jewish communities for Sephora and other retailers to sever the association with Kattan's well-known cosmetics business, Huda cosmetics, which Forbes estimates generates about $200 million in sales annually and was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017.

Kattan has previously been the target of boycott calls over her anti-Israel remarks after Hamas October 7 attack. She has been a vocal opponent of Israel and a strong advocate for Palestinians in Gaza.

The latest TikTok video that Kattan posted sparked immediate criticism from Jewish organizations.

“Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.”

The American Jewish Committee shared her video, saying that she “is using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories.”

“This isn't ‘criticism of Israel.' It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions,” the Committee added.

Kattan appeared in Forbes's 2023 and 2024 lists of America's Richest Self-Made Women and Most Powerful Women in Business, respectively.

Stephen Hawking's chilling extraterrestrial life warnings have resurfaced amid 'intelligence trap' studies and interstellar object alarm bells being rung by esteemed Harvard researchers.

British cosmologist and former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Stephen Hawking, is one of history's greatest minds.

Before his death in 2018, the revered scientist strongly opposed the idea of contacting aliens to draw them to our planet, as he issued an eerie warning about life among the stars. 

Hawking's opinions have reentered rhetoric after an international team of researchers began studying a so-called 'intelligence trap.'

This concept suggests that successfully contacting a UFO could draw the attention of a malevolent species that destroys humanity, as per the Daily Mail.

The study comes amid Harvard University researchers who claimed a so-called giant comet named 31/ATLAS could potentially be an alien probe.

Professor Avi Loeb and other scientists alleged there are signs that the interstellar object has been artificially created, including its extremely unusual course that will make close passes by three planets: Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.

Back in 2004, Hawking issued a warning about alien life. 

“The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us,” Hawking warned. 

“The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy, and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low.”

The famed theoretical physicist said something extremely similar amid a 2010 episode of Into the Universe.

He told docuseries viewers: “If aliens ever visit us, the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.”

Despite strongly opposing the idea of actively sending messages into space, alerting potential off-world beings of our presence in the universe, Hawking was a passionate advocate for more passive intelligent life searches.

He previously supported projects like Breakthrough Listen - the astronomy project aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth.

“We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,” he warned.

31/ATLAS is expected to pass within 223 million miles of Earth later this year.

If the comet does turn out to be aliens, then ‘two possibilities' will follow. 

“First, that its intentions are entirely benign and second, they are malign," researchers said.

Of course, the comet could still just be a comet. But some conspiracy theorists are convinced it could be aliens after hearing Baba Vanga's reported prediction.

The Bulgarian mystic, who died in 1996, is alleged to have left a realm of prophecies for each year, including the idea that aliens would successfully contact the Earth during a ‘major sporting event'.

There are a handful of stellar sports outings lined up for the rest of the year, including a handful of F1 races, the Women's Rugby World Cup, and the WTA/ATP finals in Riyadh and Turin, respectively.

So, more than enough time for extraterrestrial beings to get in touch.

But like Hawking says, aliens knowing of our existence may not be a good thing.

Aug. 3 (UPI) -- Comedian Matt Rife has announced he bought the Connecticut house and occult museum that belonged to the late Ed and Lorraine Warren, whose paranormal adventures are featured in the Conjuring, Annabelle and Nun horror movies.

"I have officially purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and Occult Museum, including being the legal guardian for at least the next 5 years, of the entire haunted collection including THE ANNABELLE DOLL, with my good friend @eltoncastee!!" Rife posted on Instagram, along with a photo of him and Castee posing with the supposedly demonic doll and other photos of the Warrens at home.
"If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted. You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time.

Rife said he and Castee plan to open the house for overnight stays and the museum for tours some time in the near future.

The Conjuring Universe began in 2013 with The Conjuring and was followed by numerous sequels and spin-offs featuring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

The Conjuring: Last Rites is set for theatrical release on Sept. 5.

Ed died in 2006 and Lorraine died in 2019.

The Hollywood Reporter said the house had been open to the public until Lorraine's death, but closed afterwards due to zoning issues.

Ask any former Supernatural actor their reaction when they heard their character was being killed off, and they generally answer with a smile: “No one really dies on Supernatural.” And neither, it seems, does the show, which has managed to survive long after the final monster-hunting episode aired on November 19, 2020. The 15 seasons live on through syndication, streaming and, of course, in the hearts of millions of fans.

Indeed, the series continues to find new life from a growing fanbase. With all 327 episodes available on Netflix, a younger generation has been discovering the show. Their allegiance is apparent in the impressive numbers of fans faithfully attending Supernatural conventions across the country and abroad — including Australia, Germany, and the U.K. — where they get to meet the stars, shop for signed photographs from the cast, buy merch and, most meaningfully to many, line up for a personal photo with their favorites. Other perks have included group karaoke, mini golf with cast members, and rocking out on Saturday nights with Louden Swain, a band fronted by God (a.k.a. actor Rob Benedict) and a revolving roster of the show's former castmates.

All this fun does not come cheap. At Creation Entertainment's May 16-18, 2025, convention “The Road So Far…The Road Ahead: Celebrating 20 Years of SPN” in Secaucus, New Jersey, visited by TV Guide Magazine, fans were delighted to spend roughly $1,000 to secure a gold pass that covered all three days and admission to every event, including a special VIP Q&A with Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who played beloved brothers Sam and Dean Winchester.

Other popular genre shows like Doctor Who, Star Trek, and The Walking Dead draw crowds to conventions with attendees often paying tribute with elaborate cosplay. For Supernatural, though, it's not about imitation but about feeling part of the SPN family, as fans call themselves. “That face-to-face interaction has created more reciprocal relationships than any other fandom enjoys,” says Lynn Zubernis, a psychologist and university professor who has edited several books on the show's appeal.

The faithful form strong bonds with Sam and Dean, whose brotherly ties are never broken (except maybe when one of them is demon-possessed), as well as with the siblings' powerful angel ally Castiel (Misha Collins). “New fans discover the show and are drawn in by the intensity of those relationships, their complexity and the courage of the actors to show a great deal of emotionality and vulnerability onscreen,” says Zubernis.

As I spoke with fans from across the country at the convention, another emotional tie to the show became clear: the close friends they met through their shared love for the series. SPN convention royalty undoubtedly seems to be North Dakotan Andrea Hurtt, who has been to 93 of the gatherings. After attending several cons 10 years earlier, she closed her clothing store and began making “support pillows” modeled after the show's characters and selling the merch at the cons. “It gets very emotional here,” she explains, “and I help a lot of people with a tangible memory of meeting their heroes.” She says she's raised $250,000 for charity through the pillows.

Family legacy is also common at the cons. I met a father and his 13-year-old daughter from Connecticut who was happily going through her Supernatural goody bag. Her dad began watching the show before she was born, he said, and couldn't wait for her to be old enough so they could binge it together. It was their second time at the New Jersey convention. “It's like a little community here,” he says.

Alabama's Stephanie Gentry was another legacy fan. “Supernatural was my dad's favorite show,” she says. “When he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, we got him passes to a con, but he passed away three weeks before the event.” Despite her pain, her mom urged her to go; she did and has since kept coming back. “I feel like my dad led me to having all these new friends,” she says. “I've done 14 conventions because I love the show, the cast and all my friends here.”

Fans and actors alike would be thrilled to see a new limited series or a movie, which Ackles and Padalecki have publicly mused about, especially since Netflix will drop Supernatural in December after their five-year contract ends. Whether there are any original episodes in the future or a new bingeing life on another streamer, it's safe to say that the fans — and the dedicated cast —  will carry on.

            TikTok this week removed an inflammatory anti-Israel video posted by celebrity beauty mogul and influencer Huda Kattan.
    


            Kattan, the founder and face of the billion-dollar brand Huda Beauty, shared a video to her more than 11 million followers on TikTok, accusing Israel of orchestrating World War I, World War II, the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.
    


            World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) both occurred before the State of Israel was established in 1948.
    


            “All of the conspiracy theories coming out and a lot of evidence behind them — that Israel has been behind World War I, World War II, September 11, October 7 — they allowed all of this stuff to happen. Is this crazy?” Kattan said on camera in her since-removed TikTok post, which included other unfounded claims about Israel. “Like, I had a feeling — I was like, ‘Are they behind every world war?' Yes.”
    


            A representative for TikTok confirmed to CNN that it removed Kattan's video for violating its community guidelines.
    


            “In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” TikTok's community guidelines state. “We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.”
    


            Kattan's agency did not respond to CNN's request for comment. A manager listed on public databases as a representative for Kattan was contacted by CNN and said in an email that they no longer represent her.
    


            Kattan's video has spurred calls across social media and among Jewish groups for retailers like Sephora to cut ties with her popular beauty brand, Huda Beauty, which was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017 and brings in roughly $200 million in annual sales, according to Forbes.
    


            A representative for Sephora has not responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            This is not the first time the beauty influencer has faced calls for boycotts due to her public commentary after October 7. Kattan, whose company has over 57 million followers on Instagram, has been an outspoken critic of Israel and a staunch supporter of Palestinians in Gaza.
    


            Within a week of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023, an Israeli Instagram user threatened to boycott her products, to which Kattan replied: “I don't want blood money.” In response to that comment, a Change.org petition was launched and received over 30,000 signatures, calling on Sephora to remove Huda Beauty products from its stores.
    


            Kattan's most recent TikTok video drew swift backlash from Jewish groups.
    


            “Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.”
    


            The American Jewish Committee posted Kattan's since-removed TikTok video on social media, writing, “Huda Kattan, founder of Huda Beauty, is using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories — accusing Jews of harvesting the organs of Palestinians, causing 9/11, and running global pedophile rings. This isn't ‘criticism of Israel.' It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions.”
    


            “Retailers have a choice,” said Ari Hoffnung, managing director of the Jewish nonprofit, JLens. “They can continue to platform a brand whose founder promotes hate-fueled conspiracy theories, or they can take a stand against antisemitism.”
    


            Forbes included Kattan on their 2023 list of America's Richest Self-Made Women and on their list of Most Powerful Women in Business in 2024.

In the last few years, alien-related news and its sightings have become an everyday thing in Texas, US. However, some claims have been proven out as "false" as they were just some phenomena or weird clouds

A video has been making the rounds on the internet, claiming that a UFO was spotted over Dallas, Texas. Social media accounts on X shared videos, saying, "squid-shaped UFO" spotted over Texas.

“SQUID SHAPED UFO SPOTTED OVER DALLAS, TEXAS," DramaAlert shared the video with this caption.

People started asking Grok in the comment section, asking, "Grok, is this footage real?" Another asked, "Why are aliens only in the USA?"

One of the users joked, "It's just the interdimensional imp from Superman". Another believed it to be true, writing, "Looks real".

One user even asked, "Why is it only over the US when they're spotted?" Some people also shared funny GIFs in the comment section, making fun of the news as they claimed it was an AI-generated video.

Last month, the internet went crazy after a video of what looked to be "UFO sending down a giant beam" was shared on social media. Some people claimed that it was simply a tall electric pole, while others said that the people recording would have known if it was a pole, as the sighting happened just near their home.

In the last few years, alien-related news and its sightings have become an everyday thing in Texas, US. However, some claims have been proven out as "false" as they were just some phenomena or weird clouds.

In June, another UFO was sighted, as claimed by the netizens. “A video posted on June 9th out of Dallas, Texas, in the United States, shows a group of neighbors witnessing what appears to be a UFO sending down a giant beam of light, casting chaos and excitement around the group,” according to a viral video post.

According to some reports, Houston has had the most UFO sightings in Texas history. Since 1995, Houston has recorded around 435 UFO sightings. Moreover, apart from Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and El Paso have also spotted UFOs.

In a groundbreaking study, scientists have simulated the harsh conditions of cryovolcanic activity found on icy moons such as Europa and Enceladus. By recreating these environments in the laboratory, researchers aim to better understand how such geological processes could potentially reveal signs of ancient microbial life. This effort is not just about understanding space phenomena but also about guiding future exploratory missions that could one day uncover life beyond Earth.

Cryovolcanism is a process where water and other volatiles erupt from beneath the surface of icy moons, reshaping them much like lava does on Earth. This type of volcanic activity is significant for planetary scientists, as it could indicate the presence of subsurface oceans that might harbor life. The research team focused on replicating these processes in a controlled environment to gain insight into their dynamics.

The Large Dirty Mars Chamber, affectionately known as ‘George,' was employed to simulate the low-pressure conditions prevalent on moons like Europa and Enceladus. By observing water behavior under these conditions, the team discovered that water can simultaneously boil and freeze due to the near-zero pressure. This duality is crucial for understanding how the moons' surfaces are continually reshaped by cryovolcanic activity.

Effusive cryovolcanism, akin to lava flows on our planet, involves the gentle release of liquid water onto a moon's surface. This process has been notoriously difficult to observe directly, prompting scientists to recreate it in the laboratory. The research team's findings suggest that water, when introduced into their low-pressure chamber, begins to bubble and form vapors, leading to cooling and subsequent freezing.

The resulting ice layer, thin and fragile, is often disrupted by underlying boiling water, allowing liquid to escape through cracks. This phenomenon challenges previous studies that assumed a thick ice crust would prevent further boiling. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can better predict where to search for signs of life on icy moons.

Europa and Enceladus are among the most promising candidates in the quest for extraterrestrial life within our Solar System. Europa's vast subsurface ocean and Enceladus' explosive geysers make them prime targets for exploration. The presence of liquid water, a crucial ingredient for life as we know it, raises the possibility of finding microbial organisms.

The new research offers a framework for identifying ancient cryovolcanic activity, which could be a marker for life. By focusing on regions with active or past cryovolcanism, future missions could prioritize these areas, increasing the likelihood of detecting life. This study provides a vital tool for guiding those missions and refining the search parameters for extraterrestrial life.

The insights gained from simulating cryovolcanic activity have broad implications for our understanding of the Solar System. By knowing where and how cryovolcanism occurs, space agencies can design more targeted missions to icy moons. These missions could employ advanced instruments to analyze the composition of ejected materials and detect biological markers.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in space exploration. Combining expertise from geology, atmospheric science, and astrobiology, researchers can develop comprehensive models that enhance our understanding of extraterrestrial environments. This holistic approach is crucial as we stand on the brink of potentially discovering life beyond our planet.

As we continue to explore the mysteries of our Solar System, the question remains: How close are we to finding signs of life on these distant worlds, and what would such a discovery mean for humanity's place in the universe?

So, are we saying that boiling water on Europa might be a hot tub for aliens? 🤔

Wow, this is mind-blowing! Can't wait to see what they find. 🚀

Isn't it risky to assume life can only exist in conditions similar to Earth?

Thank you for the fascinating article! Keep up the great work, NASA. 🌌

Is the Large Dirty Mars Chamber really called ‘George'? 😂 That's hilarious!

Are there any missions planned soon to actually test these findings on Europa or Enceladus?

What if the aliens are just waiting for us to discover them? 👽

So cool! I love reading about space exploration. More articles like this, please!

What's the next step after these simulations? More lab work or actual space missions?

Is it possible for life to exist in such extreme conditions? Seems unlikely to me.

While global fascination with UFOs and alien life continues to surge, famed physicist Stephen Hawking long urged caution, arguing that humanity's eagerness to make contact with extraterrestrial civilizations might be a grave mistake.

In the years leading up to his death in 2018, Hawking repeatedly warned that any deliberate attempt to reach out to alien life, especially civilizations potentially far more advanced than ours, could endanger the future of humanity. His fear: that rather than greeting us with curiosity or benevolence, a highly intelligent alien species might see Earth as a planet ripe for exploitation.

“If aliens ever visit us,” Hawking said in a 2010 episode of Into the Universe, “the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.”

According to Hawking, it's a mistake to assume advanced civilizations would automatically be peaceful. If anything, the historical record of human behavior, especially when powerful societies encounter less developed ones, suggests conquest, colonization, or indifference to suffering are just as likely as diplomacy.

Hawking believed alien civilizations capable of interstellar travel would likely have exhausted their own planet's resources, prompting them to roam the galaxy in search of new worlds to inhabit or strip for materials. In such a scenario, Earth could be seen as a habitable target rather than a partner.

Despite being a passionate advocate for the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, Hawking drew a sharp line between listening and reaching out. While projects like Breakthrough Listen, which Hawking supported, aim to detect alien signals, other efforts such as Breakthrough Message and METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) propose actively sending messages into space to alert other civilizations to our presence.

Hawking firmly opposed these efforts. In his view, passive observation made scientific sense, but advertising our location to unknown cosmic neighbors was dangerously naive. “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,” he warned.



The warning resurfaced recently amid renewed public and political interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, the military term for UFOs).

The U.S. government has declassified multiple military encounters with unknown flying objects, and congressional hearings have drawn attention to whistleblower claims about potential non-human intelligence.

While many scientists remain skeptical of these sightings being extraterrestrial, the public imagination has reignited, and so has interest in Hawking's perspective.

Critics of active messaging argue that we have no idea what alien ethics, goals, or behaviors might be. Even if intelligent aliens were aware of Earth, announcing ourselves might trigger a reaction, good or bad, that we're not prepared to handle.

Hawking was not alone in this concern. Figures such as physicist Michio Kaku and SETI pioneer Frank Drake have expressed mixed feelings about interstellar messaging.

The late Carl Sagan, while more optimistic, also emphasized caution, noting the unpredictability of alien psychology.

Despite these warnings, some scientists argue that staying silent is impractical or even counterproductive. Earth has been leaking radio waves into space for over a century, meaning that technologically advanced civilizations could already know we exist.

From that view, deliberate messaging may make little difference.

A video has gone viral with the claim that a UFO was spotted over Dallas, Texas. DramaAlert shared the video on X, captioning it, “SQUID SHAPED UFO SPOTTED OVER DALLAS, TEXAS.”

Take a look:

In the comment section, many speculated that the footage is not real and is AI-generated. Some said it might be something else, and not a UFO. HindustanTimes.com could not independently verify the incident.

“Bro that was my drone malfunctioned,” one user joked. “Weird. They don't sell that kind of fireworks in Texas,” wrote one user, while another said, “Ai af”.

“Looks fake af,” one user said, while another wrote, “The government is trolling us”. “Since no one seems to be explaining this I will, It's called the "Jelly fish / Twilight effect" during a rocket launch,” claimed a user.

A list compiled by tracker revealed that Houston has had the most UFO sightings in Texas history. Since 1995, Houston has recorded as many as 435 UFO sightings. Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and El Paso are other Texas locations with high UFO sightings.

Stacker opened up about America's "alien obsession," and about compiling the information to find out the top ten places in each state with the highest UFO sightings. It said, "Stacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Florida using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis. For now, the U.S. government's official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America's alien obsession."

Stacker explained, “UAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it's easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they've seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.”
