                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Fox News host boosted lies that Trump lost 2020 election because of electoral fraud Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county judge who joined Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote along party lines. She hosted her own Fox show Justice with Judge Jeanine. Pirro used her time at Fox News in part to publicly support the baseless claims that Trump lost his first presidency to Joe Biden in 2020 because of voter fraud. Pirro has been serving as the interim US attorney since May, when her fellow Republican Trump nominated her to the post months into his second presidency. She was nominated after Trump withdrew the nomination of conservative activist Ed Martin, his first choice for the role. A key Republican senator, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, had said he would not support Martin's nomination. “Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position,” the president added. The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Saturday published a statement exalting Pirro as “a warrior for law and order”. At the end of his first presidency, Trump pardoned Pirro's former husband, Albert Pirro Jr, after he had been convicted in 2000 on federal charges of fraud and tax evasion. Pirro is one of a number of Trump loyalists with ties to Fox who have joined the president's administration. In June, US senator Adam Schiff accused Pirro of “blind obedience to Donald Trump is nearly unrivaled among his ardent supporters”. “For an important prosecutorial position like this one, the country has a right to demand a serious and principled public servant,” Schiff said. Despite Pirro's confirmation, the US Senate left Washington DC on Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of Trump nominees despite days of contentious, bipartisan negotiations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to an excerpt from a new biography of the disgraced Duke of York, published in the Daily Mail on Saturday, the pair had a heated argument that escalated into a physical altercation. Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.” Lownie's biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, also claims Andrew told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, would “not last more than a month”. He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017. Late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.” Prince Andrew fell from grace after a disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. The duke was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021. The book claims Harry and his brother, William, had “problematic” relationships with Andrew for years and that Andrew was also rude about William's wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales. King Charles has allowed his younger brother to stay in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park owned by the crown estate. However, last year the king ended Andrew's allowance, estimated at £1m annually, raising questions about future arrangements. According to Entitled's source, “[William] also loathes Sarah … and can't wait for the day when his father throws them both out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lando Norris made it three wins from his last four races on Sunday with a hard-fought victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix. The Australian driver started and finished in second, meaning he is now just nine points ahead of Norris in the drivers' world championship. “That was tough, we weren't really planning on the one stop at the beginning but after the first lap that was our only option to get back into things,” Norris told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. “The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat out, it's rewarding even more because of that, the perfect result today.” Charles Leclerc began in pole position courtesy of a brilliant final lap in qualifying, but endured a difficult race and has now won just one of the last 16 races in which he has started at the front of the grid. He finished in fourth after being overtaken late on by George Russell, who claimed his first podium finish since he won the Canadian Grand Prix in June. ‘It's weird but also insanely cool': McLaren's Lando Norris on the dream and dilemma fueling his F1 title ambitions But during lap 29, cracks began to show as the Monégasque driver signaled to his team that something they had discussed before the race was affecting his car. He told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward that there had been an issue with the car's chassis. Suddenly, it was Piastri who looked most likely to catch Norris, especially after lap 51 when – on fresher tires – the Australian caught Leclerc and breezed past him at the first opportunity. We've lost all competitiveness,” said Leclerc on the team radio. It's a miracle if we finish on the podium.” With just under 20 laps remaining, Piastri used his better tires to make up the 8.5-second gap on Norris, but could not quite pass him despite a thrilling attempt at an overtake on turn one with two laps to go. Today, unfortunately, we were just on the wrong side of it.” Elsewhere, Fernando Alonso finished in fifth, one place ahead of Gabriel Bortoleto, who achieved the best finish of his rookie season. Max Verstappen, who was racing for Red Bull for the 200th time and confirmed this week that he was staying with the team, finished in ninth. Lewis Hamilton's disappointing weekend did not see any improvement. A day after he called himself “useless” and suggested Ferrari should drop him, the British driver, who has eight wins on this track, finished in 12th.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From a dinosaur in the Prairies to the ‘world's largest axe' in New Brunswick, Globe readers told us which monuments are worth more than a pit stop You know, those massive roadside monuments and statues that demand your attention when you drive by, offering a precious chance to stretch your legs and snap a photo to put in the family album. With countless monuments to choose from, we asked Globe readers to share their favourite attractions everyone should see at some point, and you delivered. city, and there was only one thing they wanted to see. “He was somewhat taken aback when we asked to see the fish statue,” wrote Nicholson of the nearly five-metre wide, open-mouthed creature created by wood carvers in Kamloops. Nicholson recalled her cousin saying he had never been asked to see it before. Howard the nearly nine metre tall gnome has a storied past on Vancouver Island, and Nanaimo local Liana O'Brien tells it best: “He was built in the 1990s to advertise a racing track that eventually closed. Howard remained in his position at an Esso station at Nanoose Bay, until he grew bored and decided to go walk about. He now resides in Saanich, but local bylaws have discriminated against him saying he is 17 inches too tall, so he is only allowed to come out and stand tall and proud four weekends a year to celebrate local events. He is otherwise incarcerated in storage at a nearby farm.” A prehistoric being named Tyra, four times larger than a real T-Rex, has been guarding Canada's own slice of Jurassic Park for decades. Allan Hobden visited the first statue, which has since been replaced, on a family road trip in 1960. But Hobden, a very brave 12 year old, wasn't intimidated by the massive beast, posing with his fists raised in the air as if to fight it while his father took a picture The giant aluminum pysanka is a tough egg to crack. Nine-metres long and more than three-storeys high, the Ukrainian-style painted Easter egg pays homage to the many early Ukrainians who settled in Vegreville. The same love of science-fiction is alive elsewhere in Alberta, where the aptly named town of Vulcan has embraced its Star Trek connection with a model of a USS Enterprise ship where the main series is set. And c'mon, they have a transporter.” Lloyd Hummert and his wife, Betty, live in California, but stopped by the town in 2019 on their “see the rest” of Canada trip. Between their travels together and apart, they've boldly gone to all 10 provinces, all three territories and where no man has gone before. Debbie Ristimaki says there were “plenty of laughs and memories created” when she and her partner took their mothers, ages 96 and 80, on a road trip from Winnipeg to Banff in June, stopping to see Mac each way. Seeing the moose was also a special moment for Shirley-Anne Blackadder, whose 2023 road trip around Saskatchewan completed the Vancouverite's quest to visit every province and territory in Canada. Selkirk local Dave Wilkinson says there was heated debate in 1986 as some argued “it should be one of the first visible monuments upon entering the town” and petitioned council to move it out of Selkirk Park. “Despite ongoing tensions surrounding Trump's trade war, Selkirk continues to draw U.S. tourists, who come to fish for catfish in the Red River,” said Wilkinson. The freshwater fish recently got a fresh coat of paint. Anyone driving east past Toronto on the 401 has done a double take at this iconic landmark — a giant, smiling apple greeting you as you drive by. At that point, you must be thinking you took a wrong turn toward New York, but the real Big Apple is located in Colborne, Ont. Reader Kristen Watson said she stopped in and was surprised to find a market selling pies and even got “a completely unexpected and exciting chance to climb a twisted stairwell up inside the Big Apple.” Ontario's Highway 11 is a veritable treasure trove of roadside attractions. The town is home to the world's only habitat dedicated entirely to polar bears – there was a time where you could swim in a pool with them, separated by glass – and the adorable bear statue welcomes you in. “Overall, the journey up Highway 11 makes for a memorable road trip,” she said, adding that small towns offer interesting stops. While working as a university summer student for a team at Forestry Canada, Globe reader Tom Alves had the chance to visit towns all along Highway 11. It's huge, silver and straight out of a 1950's sci-fi movie. 's giant nickel is, as reader Stephen Podetz says, “not only big, but built to last.” He first saw it on a camping trip at five years old and said that 25 years later, it was just as impressive. Did you know Quebec has its own sea monster? You'd think Paul Bunyan dropped something when visiting the Big Axe in Nackawic, N.B. Shediac, N.B., is a go-to destination for travelling lobster lovers – boat tours take you up close and personal with freshly-caught crustaceans, but one catch is bigger than the rest. Sitting at about 10-metres long and 5-metres high, the a giant lobster roadside attraction signals to tourists what the town's all about. The town is known for its wild blueberries – it's one of the biggest producers in Canada – so don't miss your chance to take a selfie. Check your horoscope to learn how the stars align for you today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel's weekly newsletter. This past spring, when I pointed my car out of Inverness to begin a loop around Scotland's craggy northern shoreline, I was expecting trouble ahead. I approved of any initiative aimed at drawing more visitors to a neglected part of my homeland, but recasting the ramshackle roads of the North Highlands as a desirable destination seemed like a stretch. Back then, the thought of the drive evoked memories from half a century before — of me and my nauseated siblings squashed inside a rusty Ford station wagon as it rolled through mile after mile of monotonous moorland. She came up from England expecting langoustines leaping out of creels and venison from stags gralloched, or disembowelled, where they fell on a nearby bed of purple heather. More often than not, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she had to settle for deep-fried scampi and frozen peas, garnished with a smear of tartare sauce squeezed from a plastic sachet. Locals began losing patience with what happened next: Nose-to-tail motorhomes on single-track roads, grill dads scorching seafront meadows with disposable barbecues, everywhere becoming an open-air toilet. When I drove the route, primed for a visit to a tourism-ravaged landscape, what I discovered was as much a case for the defense of the much-maligned road trip as an indictment of its negative impact. Everyone seemed to heap praise on the route. The founders imagined showcasing a Scotland of sea eagles soaring above secret coves and singing sands. When they envisioned sights that would linger for a lifetime in the mind's eye, they didn't have in mind little pagodas of soiled wet wipes used to cover the toilet tracks of wild campers caught short miles from the nearest public restrooms. When Richard and Jane Alcorn moved seven years ago to Thurso, near the northeastern tip of Scotland's mainland, to open a bed and breakfast, being close to the NC500 was part of why they chose the location. That decision has been rewarded with steady growth in visitors to their cosy Aurora B&B, but Richard says he understands why some of his fellow residents have come to resent the route. It was an admirable idea and we have seen the benefit of that,” he said. “What you've seen since the second lockdown is people trying to have a freebie holiday. You can see why people get upset with camper vans parking in front of their living room windows, and then there's the abuse they get when they ask them to move on.” This boiled bag of offal is banned in the US. As did misgivings about the NC500 brand passing from royal patronage to private ownership: Since 2018, North Coast 500 Ltd has been under the control of Anders Holch Povlsen, a Danish billionaire and Scotland's biggest landowner. I was wondering about this as an old school friend and I set off on a drizzly Sunday in late April. Our first stop was Dingwall, a small town located in rich farming land to the north of Inverness that I remember from my childhood as the well-manicured home of a late aunt and uncle. A bit of overtourism might not be the worst thing that could happen here, I thought, not for the last time on our trip. For the first two-thirds of our journey, we squinted at the views through a misted-up windscreen and wipers on full swipe, failing to spot any evidence of tourists making a nuisance of themselves. Tourism can be an easy scapegoat for problems it didn't create and cannot be expected to fix, I thought as we turned into the Old School restaurant and rooms on the banks of the fjord-like Loch Inchard on the North West Sutherland coast. Like many of the establishments on the NC500, this place has been geared to turning around most of its six bedrooms almost every day. The model can make it feel like “regimented and rushed” has succeeded “rough and ready” as the go-to descriptor for Highland hospitality. “Obviously there are negative parts to it, but generally all these people get to see this most amazing part of the world that they probably wouldn't have known about otherwise,” she said. While the NC500 has been good for her seasonal business, MacLeod says it was always unrealistic to expect tourism alone to fix big issues such as the tendency of young people to leave the area for opportunities — or just the excitement — on offer elsewhere. “The majority of people who live here either work offshore in the oil industry, or on the fish farms which bring a lot of young families in,” MacLeod said. By the time we rolled into the nearby coastal village of Scourie a few hours later, it was properly warm and we were ravenous. As we walk up to Grant and Heather Mercer's Crofters Kitchen food truck there is a hum of quiet contentment from the surrounding picnic tables and the sight of Heather updating the daily-changing  specials blackboard is equally reassuring. Grant, a 33-year-old with 17 years of experience under his head chef's hat, has just taken delivery of some wild halibut from a local fisherman and, hours after it was landed, it is going straight on the menu. Why Scotland's ‘ghost' whisky distilleries are coming back to life It is just the kind of thing this veteran of Scotland's long-hours hospitality culture envisaged himself doing when he and Heather first decided to embark on this business venture. The halibut, grilled to moist, flaky perfection and served with orzo pasta in a wild garlic pesto, is one of the nicest things I've ever eaten in Scotland. As we ate, the Mercers' 15-month old son was toddling about. With his blond hair, he reminded me of my oldest boy at that age. My son's mother, the girlfriend with the aversion to scampi suppers, died suddenly 20 years ago, and I felt a stab of sadness that she was not here to enjoy the scene. It's one year since it opened and the Mercers have been basking in five-star reviews while planning the next stage of their field-to-fork adventure — using a government business grant to convert a shipping container into indoor seating to serve food all year round, bringing more tourism revenue into the local community. “As well as sourcing all the seafood locally, we produce a lot of our own vegetables and we also buy salads from other crofters, pork, and venison that's been shot on their land that I'll help them butcher,” Grant told me. “The container will allow us to open almost all year round which will be great for the locals especially in the winter when there is not much open around here. The nearest Chinese takeaway is in Ullapool, a good 45-minute drive away.” I know from my own experience of living in one of Scotland's wet and windy corners that infrastructure is not just about parking places and smooth roads. A steady stream of visitors can be the difference between a local store with barely filled shelves and one laden with unexpected choices. Heading in a counterclockwise direction, as we did, the road south of Scourie is where the route is at its most breathtaking. It was easy to understand why as we glided towards our final overnight stop on meandering corniches lined by banks of sun-drenched flowering gorse. James Bond's Aston Martin would be a good fit for the timeless elegance of these vistas but even in my slightly bashed Volvo, I had the pleasant feeling that I might be starring in a commercial for a posh watch brand. These sections of the route are endowed with such beautiful natural assets, it made me reflect on how the NC500 concept has also helped entice visitors to neighboring areas less blessed in the looks department. I also wondered why they were not inundated with tourists and the associated pressures decades ago — had they been, perhaps the infrastructure now coming under strain might already have been upgraded. The sleeper train that's a wild ride to another world “The global attention of the route has created some challenges, and we know there is a careful balance to strike between the benefits that tourism brings and ensuring communities feel comfortable and capable of welcoming visitors,” a spokesman said, highlighting the body's efforts to spread tourism over the whole year, encourage longer stays and plug infrastructural gaps exposed by increased tourist numbers. Since 2018, VisitScotland has distributed £20 million, or about $27 million, through a Scottish government fund to develop rural tourism infrastructure, including many projects around the NC500, like parking, public toilets and motorhome facilities, the spokesman said. Such efforts have yet to persuade the skeptics that the route's problems can be mitigated without a reduction in visitors. Our trip left me unpersuaded — especially given that around one in seven of the region's jobs depend on tourism. Our final hotel on the route provided an answer of sorts. It was the only one I'd been able to find in a 30-mile radius offering two single rooms for under $200 a night and my heart sank as we checked in — the hotel's public bar revealing itself as a grim haven from the brilliant sunshine, where the early evening crowd formed a depressing tableau of Scotland's public health challenges. Inspecting my closet-sized room, I clocked the polyester sheets and fraying carpet, but failed to spot that I'd be destined for a dawn wake-up thanks to the absence of proper curtains. Later on, getting ready for dinner in a nicer spot, we bumped into a former manager of the hotel and fell into good-humoured conversation about the lack of gentrification at his old place of employment. “You should see it when the fishermen are in.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Donald Trump was flying back from Scotland, he revealed how he had discussed the horrific images of starving children in Gaza with his wife, the first lady. “She thinks it's terrible,” he told The Telegraph aboard Air Force One. Melania Trump has kept a low profile during her husband's second term. Her rare appearances at the White House have sparked “Where's Melania?” headlines and questions about whether she is a part-time first lady. But her influence can be spotted in Mr Trump's policies, and she is credited by insiders for being the “quiet force” behind the president's tougher stance on Russia. The Telegraph can reveal that she was a key factor in Mr Trump's decision to launch air strikes on Syria during his first term following a chemical weapons attack by the regime of Bashar al-Assad. A former White House official said she was horrified by videos of children dying in Khan Shaykun in 2017 and impressed upon her husband the need to act. Mr Trump abandoned his campaign promises not to intervene in Syria's civil war, and launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea at a government airbase in Syria. “I think she reacts to human suffering as a mom, without a policy or political filter, and shares her gut reaction with her husband,” they said. Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University and an expert in the role of first ladies, said Mrs Trump was performing her role in a highly unconventional way, rejecting the traditional role of simply appearing beside her husband at public events. Her approach may mean she is underestimated by the media and public at times. “It may be that she does have more influence on her husband's thinking about issues than the general public might initially recognise because they seem to have this very traditional marriage in terms of gender role: He's the boss. Mrs Trump, 55, was born Melanija Knavs in the part of Yugoslavia that is now Slovenia. Mr Trump was recently separated from Marla Maples, his second wife. They married seven years later and their son, Barron, was born in 2006. She did things her own way during Mr Trumps' first term, waiting for five months to move down to Washington DC from New York so Barron could finish his school year, and broke with her husband over family separations at detention facilities at the southern border. It caused an uproar on social media as commentators pondered its meaning. “In fact, I decided to let them know that their criticism would never stop me from doing what I feel is right,” she said in her 2024 memoir, entitled Melania. She also used her book, published a month before the election, to speak up for abortion access. I have my own thoughts,” she told Fox News ahead of Mr Trump's second inauguration. “I don't always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing, and that's OK.” Mr Trump recently described his wife's influence when it came to the conflict in Ukraine, describing her sceptical take on Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, and his warm words. She was nicknamed “Agent Melania Trumpenko” and memes quickly spread showing Ukrainian iconography on her clothing. Prof Jellison added that Melania was often underestimated in public because of her heavily accented English. “It wouldn't surprise me that she does have some differing opinions, and might assert those to her husband behind closed doors and might have an influence on his thinking,” she said. The first lady's office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican senators left Washington for their August recess without passing a major Russia sanctions bill, effectively handing U.S. President Donald Trump full authority to decide whether to follow through on his threat to penalize Moscow if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine by Aug. 8. Trump warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire, the U.S. would impose tariffs on countries that continue importing Russian oil. “I think (Trump)'s going to be very careful about what he does,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D. “But I think he is clearly disappointed in Putin, and I think he is now coming around to recognizing that many of us were right.” Trump has recently expressed growing frustration with Putin's refusal to deescalate, calling Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine "disgusting." He also said on Aug. 1 that he had ordered nuclear submarines to the region in response to recent threats from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. "Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences," Trump posted on Truth Social. "I hope this will not be one of those instances." Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), co-author of the sanctions bill with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said he would consider it a win if Trump imposed even a portion of what the Senate proposed. But you ought to impose bone-crushing sanctions that will stop them from fueling Russia's war machine,” Blumenthal told the Hill. Some Republican senators said the Senate missed a key opportunity by leaving Washington without voting on the Graham-Blumenthal sanctions bill.

Work is ongoing between Ukraine and Russia as the warring parties prepare to each exchange 1,200 Prisoners of War (POWs), President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 3. The unidentified civilians "armed with bats and metal pipes, damaged a vehicle and inflicted bodily injuries on a soldier" as the officer was attending to enlistment activities, officials allege.

Charlie joined about 15 to 20 other canine wave riders in Pacifica, 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of San Francisco, on Saturday at the World Dog Surfing Championships, an annual contest that draws thousands of spectators to Pacifica State Beach. Pooches competed against similarly sized peers for a chance to appear in the finals. Additional heats featured multiple dogs surfing tandem or riding with people. Labs, terriers and spaniels in monogrammed life vests dog-paddled out into the Pacific. Judges scrutinized how long the dogs remained on their boards, how long they held their balance and whether they performed any tricks, like turning around while riding. Iza, a 5-year-old French bulldog, won the single surfer heat for medium-size dogs for the first time this year, her owner David Fasoli said. Fasoli found “pure joy” during the pandemic when he brought home a surfboard from his job at Costco and taught Iza to balance in the swimming pool. “I have a disability — I only have one hand — so a nonsporting human combined with a nonsporting dog breed, we are kind of phenomenal, defying the odds of what people think we're capable of doing,” Fasoli said after Saturday's competition. Charlie, who has his own Instagram page, entered the extra-large single surfer heat. He also rode tandem with two other dogs in what their humans called “The Dream Team.” When Jeff spots a good one, he turns the board around and tells Charlie to “get ready.” Charlie can even steer the board by leaning and surfs toward an awaiting Maria on shore. He doesn't have to be rewarded with treats for any of it. Charlie's “Dream Team” compatriot, fellow yellow lab Rosie, was in four heats. The 4-year-old's owner, Steve Drottar, said she is “stoked” after they go surfing, which they do four to five times a week back home in Santa Cruz. “It's like, hey, we actually did something today, right? We did something together as a team,” Drottar said. He can tell Rosie feels a sense of accomplishment afterward because she is extra happy, wags her tail extra hard and snuggles even more than usual.

The U.S. Office of Special Counsel has launched an investigation into former Department of Justice (DOJ) special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two separate federal criminal cases against former President Donald Trump during the Biden administration, between Trump's two presidential terms.

On Aug. 2, the Office of Special Counsel confirmed it was investigating whether Smith's conduct through his efforts to prosecute Trump constituted a form of improper political activity. The office is an independent federal agency separate from the DOJ, tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service law, such as the Hatch Act restricting political activities by federal employees. The office has no criminal enforcement power but does investigate violations and has the authority to impose fines and other sanctions.</p>

SINGAPORE (AP) — The Americans set a world relay record and piled up three gold medals Saturday in what's been an otherwise frustrating swimming world championships for them. She first won that race in the 2012 Olympics and has never lost since in a major competition. Perhaps for the first time in her career, Ledecky was given only a 50-50 shot by many to beat the 18-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, the star of these worlds with Frenchman Leon Marchand. McIntosh's best time this season was 8:05.07 — just behind Ledecky's world mark of 8:04.12 set earlier this year. After 700 meters, McIntosh of Canada was ahead by 0.14 seconds, but she faded and Ledecky won in 8:05.62 with Lani Pallister of Australia taking silver (8:05.98). McIntosh has won three individual gold medals in Singapore and was trying for five. Ledecky said she was unaware she was trailing and, when asked about it, glanced down at a race-results sheet to confirm it. “I just knew it was close the whole way. “You just never know when you dive in what everyone's tactics are going to be — or what's going to happen,” she added. Ledecky has won 23 gold medals at world championships and 30 overall. If you're counting, that 44 Olympic and world medals. McIntosh, who won three gold medals in the Paris Olympics, hates losing and she showed it afterward with her comments. They were short and right to the point. “Obviously, that's not even close to what I wanted; time-wise, place-wise, how I executed the race. “It feels great to be like myself again in the water after kind of a rocky week,” said Walsh, referring to the ” acute gastroenteritis ” that the Americans have battled in Singapore following a training camp in Thailand. Can't complain with that,” Walsh added. Paris Olympic 50-free gold medalist Cameron McEvoy of Australia repeated his title in the worlds, winning in a quick 21.14. Ben Proud of Britain was the silver medalist (21.26) and American Jack Alexy took bronze (21.46). Defending champion and world-record holder Kaylee McKeown of Australia won gold again, taking the 200-meter backstroke in 2:03.33. American Regan Smith took her fourth silver medal in Singapore (2:04.29) with bronze for American Claire Curzan (2:06.04). Maxime Grousset of France picked up his second gold, taking the 100 butterfly in 49.62, just off the world record of 49.45 by American Caeleb Dressel. Noe Ponti of Switzerland took silver (49.83) with bronze for Canadian Ilya Kharun (50.07). It was only the second world record set in these championships. It came on a night when the United States won three gold medals, by far its best performance in what had been a lackluster championships for the team. The relay team members were: Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske. The Americans how have eight gold medals, one ahead of Australia with the championships closing on Sunday. He'll try to break his own 400 IM record on Sunday, a mark of 4:02.50 set in the 2023 worlds in Fukuoka, Japan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explosions and smoke were observed today by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stemming from a nearby auxiliary facility that the plant reported was under attack. “Any attack in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant – regardless of the intended target – poses potential risks also for nuclear safety and must be avoided,” Grossi said. "Once again, I call for maximum military restraint near nuclear facilities to prevent the continued risk of a nuclear accident." Meanwhile, Russia also appears to be constructing power lines in occupied southern Ukraine, a move that could link the Zaporizhzhia plant to Russia's energy grid, the New York Times reported on May 27, citing a new Greenpeace report. Satellite imagery featured in the Greenpeace report indicates that since early February 2025, Russian forces have laid over 80 kilometers (49 miles) of high-voltage lines along the Sea of Azov coastline, connecting occupied Mariupol and Berdyansk. Experts from Greenpeace believe this construction aims to connect these new lines to a major substation near Mariupol, which could then be linked to the Zaporizhzhia plant, located approximately 225 kilometers (139 miles) away.

The Canadian rolled to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over No. 2 Gauff, who committed 22 unforced errors in the fourth-round match at IGA Stadium. Mboko became the second youngest Canadian to reach a WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 1990, behind only Bianca Andreescu. She's also only the second teenager — and first Canadian — to defeat Gauff, as well as the first player this season to not drop a single game on serve against the star American. After major support for Eugenie Bouchard early in the tournament, the buzz in Montreal shifted around Mboko as the teenage sensation took centre court — and she delivered before a sellout crowd. Gauff, meanwhile, made unforced error after unforced error, firing some shots long and many more into the net during a swift, 25-minute first set. Mboko broke again in the fifth and seventh games while holding serve. Gauff found a rhythm early in the second set and earned three breakpoint chances with the match tied 3-3, but committed an error each time as Mboko hung on to win the game. With Mboko leading 5-4, Gauff doubled-faulted twice to set up two match points for the Canadian. Gauff, this year's French Open champion, scraped by with three-set wins in Rounds 2 and 3. She struggled with her serve, striking a whopping 37 double faults in the two matches combined — adding six more on Saturday. Playing in only her seventh WTA main draw, she advanced to the quarterfinals of a 1000-level tournament for the first time, knocking off higher-ranked opponents at each step. Mboko opened with a win over 79th-ranked Kimberly Birrell, then upset 23rd seed and former Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin before snapping Marie Bouzkova's seven-match winning streak with a relentless comeback and taking down Gauff, dropping one set the whole way. It's the latest chapter in a breakthrough season for Mboko, who also played in her first two Grand Slam main draws, reaching the French Open third round and Wimbledon second round. The ninth-seeded Rybakina also rallied for a 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 win over Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, who defended three match points before losing. Kostyuk and Rybakina will play each other in the next round. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.
