The iconic shooter franchise is poised to make its return this year with a back-to-basics approach, something sorely missing from contemporary FPS titles. Add to that the disappointing response to COD: Black Ops 6 and EA has found themselves stirring the perfect concoction of demand for an AAA game launch. A couple of days ago, it revealed the relatively modest hardware requirements for the upcoming Battlefield 6 and, today, we allegedly have our first performance report to pick over. Running at 1440p, they were able to get over 300 FPS on a setup consisting of an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D CPU and an RTX 5080 GPU ‚Äî both attractive top-end components. The game is still under embargo so they couldn't say much, like whether any upscaling was used to hit those numbers, but in general ~300 FPS in a modern blockbuster title remains impressive. BATTLEFIELD 6 Average fps performance was very good, NUMBERS/SPECS BELOWüëá 330-370fps gpu310-330fps cpu6.7-8.5 PCL Latency Not allowed to show screenshots but for those asking, 9800x3d + 6400 1:1 2133 32gb + 5080 3200mhz core AND no optimized nvidia driver.August 1, 2025 Please add a sprinkle of salt to these comparison numbers, which we can't guarantee are representative of the finished game, or be certain were based on reasonably equivalent 9800X3D vs 14900K systems (all else being equal), among other potential issues. This is a good sign for 3D V-Cache CPU owners because, if Bruhskey's right, they'll be able to get the most out of their processors, ensuring minimal chances of a processor bottleneck here. These performance numbers aren't just limited to PC either, by the way, as the devs are working hard to push 60 FPS across all consoles as well. In an interview with Tech & Co., Florian Le Bihan, Principal Game Designer at Battlefield Studios, said optimization was one of the most important things to get right. Not only does every console, including the Xbox Series S, get a 60FPS mode by default, but you'll be able to cross that barrier with Performance Mode. On PC, of course, the sky (read: your hardware) is the limit, so it's great to see an AAA launch in 2025 not bogged down with unrealistic requirements. Bruhskey did not attach any screenshots or gameplay clips to support their claims (because the game is under embargo) but it is probable that the game was running natively at 1440p since there was no mention of frame-gen or DLSS anywhere in their thread. The game is set to release on October 6, 2025 with an open beta planned for August 9-10. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Christian ‚ÄòPeri Fractic' Simpson has confirmed that his much touted community-led acquisition of Commodore has been signed, sealed, and paid for. In the triumphant video short, Simpson breathlessly addressed his audience, stating that ‚ÄúWe just made history. Together, we've just signed the final contract and paid in full, ahead of schedule, to complete the acquisition of the whole Commodore Corporation BV, and all 47 original Commodore trademarks, the oldest, dating back to 1983.‚Äù Behind him, you can see familiar Commodore stalwarts like David Pleasance, Leo Nigro, and Colin Proudfoot. Actually, there is a clearer view of the Commodore 'takeover' team in a Facebook post by Commodore International Corporation (see below). In his street-filmed mini episode, Simpson continued, ‚ÄúAnd it all means that Commodore is finally in the hands of those who truly care - the community and the original employees‚Ä¶ And now the fun really begins as Commodore reboots, not just as a retro brand with next-gen ideas, but as a digital detox brand, picking up right where we left off in the 90s. This sounds positive for fans of both retro computing and new gadgetry, which plays to the strengths of home computers from a few decades past. Moreover, Simpson seemed especially pleased that funding had come through, early, so this deal was signed sealed and delivered ahead of schedule. In brief, it is a machine pulled together from various enthusiast projects, but it is welcome to see it packaged and marketed in a connected way, and priced from $299, as long as you're partial to beige ‚Äì more cosmetically adventurous models ramp up in price. Some more hints at what to expect going forward are provided by the latest updates to the official Commodore.net about page. Here, Simpson (we assume) expands on his ‚Äúdigital detox brand‚Äù idea, as well as the direction that will lead to ‚Äúretro futurism‚Äù under the Commodore banner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Controversial crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun finally got his suborbital ride into space today from Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, four years after he put in the winning $28 million bid for a seat. Five other spacefliers were alongside Sun when Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket ship rose from its launch pad at the company's Launch Site One in West Texas at 7:43 a.m. CT (5:43 a.m. PT) for a 10-minute trip. ‚ÄúI wished to go into space since I was a child, and after almost 30 years, it's come true,‚Äù Sun said on Blue Origin's webcast. ‚ÄúFor this mission I waited four years, but we finally delivered it. I really appreciate Mr. Bezos and his team to make it possible. When the 35-year-old, Chinese-born billionaire won Blue Origin's space auction in 2021, it was meant to guarantee him a spot on New Shepard's first crewed flight that summer. Instead, Sun put his reservation on hold, reportedly due to scheduling conflicts. While Sun was waiting for his flight, legal complications arose: In 2023, he became the subject of a federal investigation over alleged market manipulation and unregistered sales of crypto asset securities. But that case was put on hold in February, and a couple of months later, Sun earned a place of prominence at a crypto dinner with President Donald Trump by purchasing the biggest share of the $TRUMP meme coin. Last month, Tron Inc. became a publicly listed company on Nasdaq. ‚ÄúIt was an honor to see so many nations represented on our flight today,‚Äù Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for the New Shepard, said in an online recap of today's mission. ‚ÄúThe view of our fragile planet from space has a unifying effect on all who witness it, and I am always eager to see how our astronauts use this experience for the benefit of Earth.‚Äù The company doesn't typically reveal how much its customers are paying for their flights. Sun set up his own ‚ÄúTo the Sun‚Äù program to collect messages ‚Äî and carried more than 1,000 of those messages into space on a thumb drive. Sun's space ride isn't his only notable purchase: Last December, he made headlines when he spent $6.2 million to purchase a work of conceptual art featuring a banana that was duct-taped to a wall ‚Äî and then ate the banana. And for what it's worth, Sun isn't the only controversial crypto figure to take a trip on New Shepard. In response to emailed inquiries, a Blue Origin representative told GeekWire that the company works with a third party to accept crypto payments for spaceflights.

Gaming accessory maker Turtle Beach has announced the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, a new modular game controller under its Victrix esports brand. The latest Reloaded model now comes with a reconfigured Fightpad module with improved ergonomics, as well as updated Hall Effect thumb sticks and triggers. An officially licensed PlayStation version will also be available, offering compatibility with the PS5 and PS4 consoles alongside Windows, again. The modular aspect of the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded controller allows it to adapt to various genres and play style, including fighting games, first-person shooters, and RPGs. Users can swap between three modules and 11 interchangeable components including various thumb sticks, a selection of D-pads, and thumb stick gates that can attach to the bottom of a joystick or thumb stick limiting the directions in which the stick can move. The controller also comes with patented 5-stop hall-effect clutch triggers with a Hair-Trigger mode that allows adjustable sensitivity, which makes it suitable for FPS gamers. Additionally, there is a 6-button Fightpad module which features Kailh microswitches that are claimed to deliver tournament-level accuracy. The included USB Type-A dongle offers low-latency and a range of up to 30-feet, while the 2,000 mAh inbuilt-battery offers up to 20-hours of backup. Alternatively, players can use the included braided USB-C cable for wired operation. For customers in the US, the controller is now available for pre-order on Amazon at $209.99, and will officially start shipping on September 28.

They brought back a dead 5090 to life not too long ago, and this time it's an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, one that survived being baked in an oven. Fret not, though, as it reached the hands of a master chef. Let's walk back a bit and add some context. The owner bought this XFX Speedster 7800 XT Merc 319 from Facebook Marketplace, and it never worked, so it was sent to Northwest Repairs for assessment. Once on the bench, our host Tony opened it up and was greeted with flux residue all over the board, indicating a reflow was (poorly) attempted previously. Upon further inspection, the GPU core looked intact, but its retention frame came undone the moment it was touched. This drove down the chances of a successful repair to "0.1%," according to Tony, but since the core wasn't cracked, all hope was not lost yet. The right way to reflow a PCB is by putting in on a BGA rework station and heating momentarily while regulating temperatures. The fix, then, was simple... by expert standards. This confirms why the reflow attempt from before did not work; the VRAM likely has ripped pads underneath that need to be reballed now. A beautiful montage follows... which ends up in failure. The GPU, despite having a reballed core and memory, still doesn't boot. Our repair guy wasn't sure at this point whether he did a bad job repairing the pads, or whether the chip was simply a goner. Nonetheless, he replaced the last suspect memory chip with a new one known to work and, voil√†, the card finally posted. This repair job shows the importance of ingenuity, a core (no pun intended) human trait, mixed with our tenacity. Not everyone can afford to casually buy a new graphics card if their current one dies on them, especially if you're in a region with shoddy warranty systems or dealing through the second-hand market. Service shops like Northwest Repair help keep hardware out of landfills, ensuring there's a safe haven for parts stuck in a coma. After all, there's a certain convenience associated with tinkering with your own components, and it serves as a key constituent of this custom gaming PC hobby we're all enrolled in. Equally crucial is to not downplay the sheer craftsmanship involved in such a task. Because we're used to seeing crazy shunt mods and DIY goodies left and right, it might not stand out as special but remember that these are professionals operating at the top of their game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. At the time, physicists were still plagued by debates about basic definitions‚Äîwhat is heat? how are molecules structured?‚Äîand Hilbert hoped that the formal logic of mathematics could provide guidance. The scope of Hilbert's sixth problem was enormous. He asked ‚Äúto treat in the same manner [as geometry], by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an important part.‚Äù In particular, they use one set of equations to describe how individual molecules in a gas move, and another to describe the behavior of the gas as a whole. Was it possible, Hilbert wondered, to show that one set of equations implied the other‚Äîthat these equations were, as physicists had assumed but hadn't rigorously proved, simply different ways of modeling the same reality? For 125 years, even axiomatizing this small corner of physics seemed impossible. Mathematicians made partial progress, coming up with proofs that only worked when they considered the behavior of gases on extremely short timescales or in other contrived situations. His sixth problem challenged mathematicians to axiomatize physics. Now, three mathematicians have finally provided such a result. Their work not only represents a major advance in Hilbert's program, but also taps into questions about the irreversible nature of time. Consider a gas whose particles are very spread out. There are many ways a physicist might model it. At a microscopic level, the gas is composed of individual molecules that act like billiard balls, moving through space according to Isaac Newton's 350-year-old laws of motion. At this new ‚Äúmesoscopic‚Äù scale, your field of vision encompasses too many molecules to individually track. Called the Boltzmann equation, it describes the likely behavior of the gas's molecules, telling you how many particles you can expect to find at different locations moving at different speeds. This model of the gas lets physicists study how air moves at small scales‚Äîfor instance, how it might flow around a space shuttle. ‚ÄúWhat mathematicians do to physicists is they wake us up.‚Äù Zoom out again, and you can no longer tell that the gas is made up of individual particles. To model this macroscopic behavior‚Äîhow dense the gas is and how fast it's moving at any point in space‚Äîyou'll need yet another set of equations, called the Navier-Stokes equations. Physicists view these three different models of the gas's behavior as compatible; they're simply different lenses for understanding the same thing. But by applying his expertise to the realm of particles, he has now resolved a major open problem in mathematical physics. Boltzmann could already show that Newton's laws of motion give rise to his mesoscopic equation, so long as one crucial assumption holds true: that the particles in the gas move more or less independently of each other. That is, it must be very rare for a particular pair of molecules to collide with each other multiple times. But Boltzmann could not definitively demonstrate that this assumption was true. ‚ÄúWhat he could not do, of course, is prove theorems about this,‚Äù said Sergio Simonella of Sapienza University in Rome. After all, there are infinitely many ways a collection of particles might collide and recollide. ‚ÄúYou just get this huge explosion of possible directions that they can go,‚Äù Levermore said‚Äîmaking it a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù to actually prove that scenarios involving many recollisions are as rare as Boltzmann needed them to be. In 1975, a mathematician named Oscar Lanford managed to prove this, but only for extremely short time periods. A forthcoming paper, they wrote, would build off their latest result to investigate ‚Äúthe long-time extension of Lanford's theorem.‚Äù Other mathematicians didn't know what to make of the announcement. ‚ÄúI didn't think it was possible,‚Äù said Pierre Germain of Imperial College London. Deng and Hani didn't even usually work with particle systems; until that point, they'd mainly been studying systems made up of waves (like rays of light). Doing so would allow them to extend Lanford's result‚Äîto show that particle recollisions are rare even on longer timescales. It was an idea that Deng and Hani had already been considering. Impressed by Ma's insights on the topic, Deng invited him to help them turn their intuition into a proof. The trio hoped to focus on a much-studied scenario where mathematicians had already proved the second, meso-to-macro step in Hilbert's sixth problem. They worked with a gas whose particles are distributed randomly in an infinite amount of space; unlike the particles in the boxed gas, which keep bouncing off each other forever, these particles eventually disperse and stop colliding. ‚ÄúIn the whole-space case, there is a shortcut,‚Äù Deng said. The three mathematicians first needed to tabulate the different patterns of collisions that might occur in their gas, and how likely each of those patterns was. They could easily rule out scenarios with particularly high rates of recollisions. But that often felt like an impossible task, because many of the patterns involved huge numbers of particles and intricate, indirect interactions between them. In principle, the mathematicians would need to keep track of every one of these particles simultaneously to compute the probability estimates they needed. That's where Deng and Hani's previous work on waves gave them an important insight. In that result, they'd figured out ways to break up complicated patterns of interacting waves into simpler ones. They'd carefully crafted their technique so that, by working with only a few waves at a time, they could still get a good estimate for the likelihood of the more complicated complete wave pattern. But after a collision, particles behave very differently from waves. For instance, particles, unlike waves, bounce off each other, greatly affecting the resulting pattern of collisions and its probability of happening. Zaher Hani studies solutions to equations that arise in oceanography, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics. First, they tackled the simplest cases, in which each particle collides just a few times over a very short time span, with no recollisions. ‚ÄúThe intuition was developed gradually, starting with some unsuccessful attempts,‚Äù Deng said. They had to get a sense for how to slice up large, complicated patterns of particle collisions in a way that would simplify their calculations while keeping their estimates highly accurate. ‚ÄúThis is a process that takes months,‚Äù Hani said. ‚ÄúWe would be stuck constantly.‚Äù Nearly every day, they jumped on a Zoom meeting to talk things through. ‚ÄúMuch to the dismay of my wife, some of them happened very late at night, or very early in the morning,‚Äù Hani said. ‚ÄúI would put my daughter to sleep, and then we would have two or three hours of Zoom meetings.‚Äù They'd shown, as they'd hoped to, that in their infinite-space setting, Boltzmann's description of the gas could be derived from Newton's. The microscopic and mesoscopic scales fell under a single rigorous mathematical framework. ‚ÄúI think it's outstanding work,‚Äù said Alexandru Ionescu, a mathematician at Princeton who was also Deng's and Ma's doctoral adviser. It didn't take long for them to extend their result from the infinite-space setting to the boxed one. It also provided a rigorous mathematical resolution of an old paradox. At the microscopic scale, where particles act like billiard balls, time is reversible. But at the mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, there is no going back in time. ‚ÄúWe know very well that, going forward in time, one ages but does not rejuvenate; heat does not spontaneously pass from a cold body to a warm body; a drop of ink in a glass of water spreads, darkening the liquid, but does not spontaneously return to the small, round shape it originally had,‚Äù Simonella wrote. But Boltzmann argued that there was no paradox: Even if each particle can be modeled in a time-reversible way, almost every collision pattern ends up with a gas dispersing. The chance of, say, a gas suddenly contracting is essentially zero. Lanford had confirmed this intuition mathematically for his very short time frame. Now Deng, Hani, and Ma's result confirms it for more realistic situations. Going forward, mathematicians‚Äîwho are still poring over the details of the new proof‚Äîwant to test whether similar techniques might be useful in other, even more realistic contexts. These might include gases made up of particles of different shapes, or particles that interact in more complicated ways. Meanwhile, Falkovich said, these sorts of rigorous proofs can help physicists understand why a gas behaves a certain way at various scales, and why different models might be more or less effective in different scenarios. ‚ÄúWhat mathematicians do to physicists,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis they wake us up.‚Äù Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all reported quarterly earnings this week, and there was a common thread tying them together: a boom in AI spending and plans to increase it even more, beyond analyst expectations. Although capital expenditures above expectations often don't tend to make investors particularly happy, it had pretty much the opposite effect this week, especially for Meta and Microsoft, both of which saw a pop in their stock following the releases. Meta's ad revenue, which is a huge moneymaker for the tech giant, for the past quarter came in a couple billion dollars ahead of Wall Street expectations, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed that to the deployment of artificial intelligence in the ad system. Revenue from the company's productivity and business processes segment also exceeded expectations, and company executives shared that the business software sales were boosted partially thanks to widespread adoption of its AI product Microsoft 365 Copilot. All the news combined brings to mind one question: Is Silicon Valley's AI bet finally starting to pay off? The push has been marked by high profile strategic talent hires, and particularly the poaching of OpenAI employees tempted by multi-year deals worth millions of dollars. This week, Meta said it's expecting to shell out between $66 billion and $72 billion this year, and that it expects to spend even more next year on data centers and hiring. Microsoft, on the other hand, said that it is expecting to spend more than $100 billion next year, with much of it going toward AI. This upcoming quarter alone, the company is eyeing $30 billion in capital expenditures, again mostly for AI, in what is a record forecast for the company. Apple also posted better than expected revenue on its earnings report this week, but that was mostly attributable to iPhone sales. One of the biggest concerns when it comes to AI is regarding spending. Even though Silicon Valley is pouring in countless dollars‚Äîover $300 billion this year alone, according to numbers from the Financial Times‚Äînot everyone believes demand for AI will scale up accordingly. The technology isn't necessarily adopted widely outside of tech, science, and finance fields, and is deployed mostly by large firms. As the technology gets better, demand for AI is bound to increase, too, but by just how much is a mystery. The answer to whether or not AI demand will scale up to the level of investment is still not a definitive yes or a no, but this round of earnings gave a substantial dose of hope to the AI bulls.
