                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They signed Dean Huijsen and appointed Xabi Alonso as the new coach. Trent Alexander-Arnold also arrived from Liverpool for £10 million - more than the club initially wanted to pay. Since then, there have been only a couple of further signings. Since then, the focus has shifted to outgoings and contract extensions. A few players have left Castilla for greener pastures, with more departures rumoured, while several players have also signed new contracts. The agreement is already in place, according to a report from MARCA. He has also rejected offers from other clubs in the process. The report states that Fenerbahce tried to sign him earlier this summer, while Benfica made a recent inquiry - both approaches were turned down by the player. What makes it even better is that Brahim probably would have had a starting role at both Benfica and Fenerbahce, but he turned them down to remain a crucial squad player, as he seems to be happy with his role. Brahim still needs to work on parts of his game, such as not holding onto the ball for too long and making the right final pass. However, even during the Club World Cup, it was clear he was improving under Xabi Alonso in their short time together before the season began. There is excitement about what more he can offer over the coming years. With a season as long as the last one, it was made clear in the worst way possible that Real Madrid always need brilliant squad players like Brahim Diaz, and he will once again be crucial for the club - there is no doubt about it.

Weah, 25, joined the Serie A giants in 2023 but struggled to make a significant impact and looked to be outside of head coach Igor Tudor's plans for the upcoming season. Last week, Weah's representative, Badou Sambague, spoke out against Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, accusing the Turin club of showing “total disrespect” to his client after Comolli criticized Weah's push to join Marseille over other clubs. “The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli fired back. “And the offer hasn't arrived yet.” Now, it appears as though a deal will be done. Marseille have “verbally agreed” to loan Weah for the 2025–26 campaign in a deal which includes an obligation to buy, per Fabrizio Romano. Signing with Marseille, Weah joins demanding Italian manager Roberto de Zerbi. With the latter, Weah scored eight goals in 107 matches, helping them win a surprise Ligue 1 title in 2020–21. With Marseille, he becomes the latest North American to join the club alongside Canadian center back Derek Cornelius. He will hope for a better fate than another Canadian, Ismael Koné, who had a very public falling out with De Zerbi and is now at Sassuolo in Serie A.

Tottenham Hotspur are now trying again to sign a France international after they failed to convince him to come to N17 during the January window.

Thomas Frank has admitted that Tottenham may not be done adding to their forward line this summer, despite landing Mohammed Kudus from West Ham earlier this summer.

That might be down to the fact that Heung-min Son is edging closer to a move to Los Angeles FC.

Now, the Lilywhites have expressed an interest in a Paris Saint-Germain star just two weeks before they take on the Ligue 1 giants in the UEFA Super Cup clash.

It was revealed last month that Tottenham had been contacted about Randal Kolo Muani's availability after his permanent move to Juventus stalled.

It has now been revealed by The Times that Spurs have renewed their interest in the forward as Thomas Frank's men look to add to their attack after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White.

The outlet says that the North Londoners were keen on landing Kolo Muani in January prior to his move to Turin, and they are now trying again this summer.

According to a recent update from TBR Football, PSG are demanding €50m (£43.3m) for Kolo Muani after Luis Enrique deemed the striker surplus to requirements.

However, the same update revealed that Manchester United and Newcastle United are also interested in the Frenchman.

Earlier this summer, Chelsea were also credited with an interest in Kolo Muani, which means that a deal for the former Eintracht Frankfurt man may not be straightforward for the Lilywhites to complete.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paryaj Lakay, a sports betting and casino company based in Pétion-Ville, has supported the Haitian men's under-17 soccer team by donating 19.8 million gourdes—about $150,000—to aid their preparation for the Qatar 2025 FIFA World Cup in that category. This donation highlights betting platform funds as a new source of financing for Haiti's sports sector and renews its longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship. CAP-HAÏTIEN — Sports betting and casino company Paryaj Lakay, Haitian Creole for Home Bet, has partnered with the Haitian Football Federation (FHF) to help prepare the men's under-17 national soccer team for the 2025 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in Qatar in November. “They are our future,” the betting platform officials wrote. “There's no bigger pride than waving our flag for the world to see.” The country's sports sector, particularly soccer, has a longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship—notably the lottery industry, mostly known as bòlèt. FHF confirmed the partnership in a July 31 statement, adding that a donation feature is also active on the ParyajLakay.com site to allow public contributions. “Through this gesture, the Paryaj Lakay Foundation reaffirms its commitment to Haitian youth and launches a call for national mobilization,” the statement read. “We can't trust them [FHF],” said Varona Jean-Charles, a soccer fan from Léogâne. Jean-Charles, 28, said he still plans to contribute through Paryaj Lakay's platform—but with reservations. “If they misuse my money, karma will hit them,” he said, calling for  Haiti's Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) to audit FHF spending. “It would've been great if this money did exactly what it's supposed to do,” wrote Facebook user Vilgard Charles. The FHF has long faced allegations of embezzlement and unaccountability. In 2017, for instance, FIFA donated half a million US dollars to rehabilitate six fields damaged by Hurricane Matthew—funds that failed to yield visible results. In 2019, Haiti's senior men's national team made a historic run to the Gold Cup semifinals, yet players never received their promised bonuses. According to  AyiboPost, the federation received $200,000 from CONCACAF for that tournament. This pattern of missing funds continues to cast doubt on even well-intentioned contributions. Haiti's under-17 team is currently in Port-au-Prince with 26 players for the first phase of training. On July 29, they defeated local club Abeilles FC in a friendly match. They will travel to the south and the north this month to continue with their training and play more warm-up games. The second phase will take place in Jamaica from August 31 to September 14. The final phase will be held in Spain from September 15 through October 31 before traveling to Qatar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This time, it's the turn of England in 1966. England hadn't entered the first three tournaments because the FA were still refusing to be a part of FIFA. In their four attempts since deciding to take part, England had twice reached the quarter-finals, but had twice been eliminated at the group stage. Yet England still enjoyed great reverence across the footballing world. Even accounting for home advantage and the unfamiliarity of the opposition players with one another, it's clear England had outstanding individuals. But they needed home advantage to become the world champions. But this was a manager who had recently completed something even more unlikely than winning the World Cup with the host nation. Two years later, he won promotion to the second tier. Four years after that, he won promotion to the First Division. And then he promptly won the title at his first attempt. Sensing things couldn't get much better, he left Suffolk for the England job. Ramsey had been a no-nonsense England full-back in his playing days, including at World Cup 1950. He remained in charge of England for another eight years after this World Cup success, before being sacked when he failed to qualify for World Cup 1974. He was barely seen afterwards, aside from a brief stint in charge of Birmingham City, when he'd originally joined to serve on the board. But Ramsey really only had two major jobs in his coaching career, and he won the First Division and then won the World Cup. Ramsey was, in a sense, the first proper England manager. Until the Second World War, there had been no official position of head coach, and the squad was selected by a selection committee. This seems bizarre today, but in a world before matches were widely televised, and when all weekend matches kicked off at the same time, it was thought that keeping across the entire First Division (and beyond) was impossible. England merely had a ‘trainer' in charge of tactics. Walter Winterbottom is generally considered England's first official head coach, but he was also the FA's first director of coaching, and used to joke — maybe half-joke — that “the job had a sideline to it: manager of the England teams”. The plural reflects that he was in charge of both the main England team and the amateur equivalent, and genuinely seemed to consider this of less overall importance than his other role. Besides, he also had his squad picked by an eight-man selection committee. Ramsey, almost routinely described as ‘not an establishment figure', wasn't going to stand for any of that and was given full control of picking the England squad and starting XI. “It's a new position,” he said upon his appointment. “This sort of thing has never been done before and I think we'll have to find out what we can do. Ramsey was considered unusual for picking a full 22-man squad for every international break; in the days before substitutes, it was previously considered enough to pick a much smaller group. In the early 1980s, Brian Glanville, the most revered 20th-century English football writer in English football, wrote a World Soccer column claiming that England had generally coped fine without one, although this was partly a dig at the poor performance of Ramsey's successors, Don Revie and Ron Greenwood. Surprisingly, for a country not renowned for being overly interested in tactics, England are unique in that their World Cup-winning side had a nickname describing their tactical approach: these were ‘Ramsey's wingless wonders'. A telling sign of this approach is that England's centre-forwards can be seen taking throw-ins in the final. The idea of playing without wingers was almost unthinkable before World Cup 1966. English football's most adored players were wingers — in the previous decade, they'd fielded Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney in the same side. The eventual starting XI was difficult to describe in terms of system, but players had very clear characteristics. Nobby Stiles was a combative defensive midfielder who came under fire for his tackling during this tournament, and his presence allowed Martin Peters to roam. On the right, Alan Ball was something between a box-to-box player and a wide man, and notable for his sheer energy in the final, while Charlton very vaguely played from the left but was more of a No 10. That, for many, symbolised Ramsey — an admirer of disciplined workers rather than talented individualists. You can make a case for various players. But ultimately England's true star was Bobby Charlton, a player who won that year's Ballon d'Or and finished second in the subsequent two years. A rampaging attacking midfielder who was the all-time top goalscorer for both Manchester United and England until Wayne Rooney surpassed him in both respects (Harry Kane since surpassed Charlton and Rooney for England goals), he produced the best individual moment of England's campaign with a brilliant goal in the group stage win over Mexico, running from the halfway line, feinting to go on his left foot, before chopping onto his right and firing into the top corner from 30 yards. “He was one of the greatest players I have ever seen,” Ramsey later said. Early in my management, I knew I had to find a role suitable to Bobby's unique talents.” That was a particular compliment from a manager who hadn't appreciated the talents of other big-name attackers. Charlton, unusually considering he was England's third-most advanced player, wore No 9 in the tournament, partly a reflection of the fact that Ramsey had previously used him as a centre-forward. Charlton's best display for England came in the semi-final win over Portugal, where he lit up the game with his passing — sometimes considered a relative weakness compared to other greats in his role — and also scored both goals in a 2-1 win. West Germany manager Helmut Schon was so scared of Charlton's goalscoring threat that he instructed Franz Beckenbauer, at this point renowned as an exciting attacking midfielder, to man-mark Charlton out of the game. Broadly speaking, Beckenbauer managed that, but possibly at the expense of West Germany's own attacking threat. Overall, a really good game between two sides — Beckenbauer's role aside — focused on pushing forward and attacking. Helmut Haller put West Germany ahead after a rare mistake from Ray Wilson, before Hurst headed home unmarked from Moore's flighted free kick. Goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski was often criticised for not coming to claim this cross — and the way he stood behind his line and simply pointed at Hurst did look rather odd — but he'd previously taken a bad knock when coming for another cross and was therefore hesitant to leave his line again. Peters seemed to have won the game with a simple volley at a corner, after Hurst's effort had been blocked and looped up into the air, but then defender Wolfgang Weber scored an even scrappier goal to equalise in the penultimate minute. It bounced down onto the line and then out. The goal was given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who became referred to as “the Russian linesman” in England, although he hailed from present-day Azerbaijan. In fact, he's such a hero in the otherwise unremarkable footballing nation of Azerbaijan that the country's former national stadium was named after him. This is somewhat disingenuous; Hunt wasn't at the right angle to tell, and the ball was bouncing slightly past him anyway. England at least scored a fourth, although there was further confusion here. Referee Gottfried Dienst had put his whistle to his lips, seemingly about to blow for full time, before waving on the play. This meant some England supporters had started their pitch invasion with the play still going on, with Hurst sent in behind by a long ball. It was Moore's second assist of the final, and more significantly, Hurst's third goal — his hat-trick is analysed in more detail here. Hurst now proudly declares that he's the only hat-trick scorer in a World Cup final to finish on the winning side. England were hardly hailed as spectacular winners across the world, especially in an era when Brazil were regularly winning the tournament with wonderful football, but this was a tournament of few genuine contenders. Caution and discipline in their first four matches, when they were underwhelming but kept four clean sheets, gave way to more impressive displays in their last two matches. They were the better side in open, entertaining games against both Portugal and West Germany. The most praise was generally reserved for two first-time qualifiers: North Korea, who famously defeated Italy and then went 3-0 up against Portugal before losing 5-3. But they lost to England fair and square in the semi. The majority of matches were considered somewhat drab and overly aggressive at a time when a more defensive approach to football seemed to be on the rise. The 1966 success is sometimes retrospectively framed as ‘the worst thing that could have happened to English football', as it convinced them to knuckle down and focus on hard running over talent. That always seems overly contrary, and besides, that wasn't Ramsey's fault — unlike Winterbottom, he wasn't the FA's director of coaching, too. His task was to win the World Cup, and he did.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The absence of Christian Pulisic and other key American stars drew sharp criticism from pundits, former players, and fans alike. But now, a respected USMNT legend has come to the defense of Pulisic and his fellow absentees, backing their decision to rest and blasting their critics with a harsh nine-word claim that has reignited the national debate. Despite this, the absence of Pulisic, along with other key players like Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, and Timothy Weah, sparked fierce criticism—most notably from Landon Donovan, who suggested some players lacked the commitment to represent their country. During Fox Sports' broadcast of the UEFA Nations League final on June 8, Donovan appeared to criticize Pulisic—without naming him directly—by drawing a comparison to Cristiano Ronaldo. “This is what it means to represent your country. If you don't want to take that opportunity seriously and responsibly, then don't come in,” Donovan said. Pulisic responded days later during an appearance on CBS Sports' Call It What You Want. “To question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line,” he said. “My body started talking to me… I thought about what would be best for me leading into next year and the World Cup.” Now, former USMNT captain Marcelo Balboa has joined the conversation—and he's not holding back. Speaking on the Call It What You Want podcast, Balboa defended Pulisic and criticized the growing negativity aimed at American stars. “We all want to see soccer grow. We want this team to do well,” Balboa said. And then came his boldest statement, a nine-word critique that captured attention across the U.S. soccer community: “There's a fine line between being negative and being an idiot.” Balboa acknowledged that scrutiny is part of the job, especially with the national team under a global spotlight, but emphasized that constructive criticism must not devolve into personal attacks. “We wanted this kind of pressure as athletes… But I've got their back and always will.” While Mexico celebrates another historic milestone, questions loom around one of the region's other traditional powerhouses — particularly Christian Pulisic and the USMNT, who find themselves in unfamiliar territory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six-time world player of the year Marta came off the bench to score twice, including an equalizer in stoppage time, as Brazil came from behind three times before winning the penalty shootout 5-4 against Colombia on Saturday to secure their ninth Copa América Femenina title. Leicy Santos scored in the 115th to bring Colombia back level at 4-4 as the match went to a penalty shootout. Goalkeeper Lorena Da Silva then saved two penalty kicks in the shootout to clinch Brazil's fifth title in a row at the continental championships, and beat Colombia for the fourth time in the past five finals. Marta, who has played in six World Cups and six Olympics, has 122 goals in 206 games with Brazil. Gutierres scored her sixth goal of the tournament to finish as the top scorer alongside Paraguay's Claudia Martinez. The Colombians also had an own goal by Brazil defender Tarciane in the 69th as it took the lead three times before being pegged back in an extraordinary final. Their best finish at the World Cup was runner-up in 2007, and they have reached the Olympic final three times. Saturday's match at Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado in Ecuador was a rematch of the 2022 final that was played in Colombia and that Brazil won, 1-0. Want great stories delivered right to your inbox?
