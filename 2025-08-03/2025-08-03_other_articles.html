                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 29-year-old comedian announced on social media on Friday that he and his friend Elton Castee have purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home, along with their haunted collection. You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history," Rife said. "We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place," he added. Rife said him and Castee are the "legal guardians" of the supposedly haunted collection for "at least five years." Castee, who is a self-proclaimed ghost hunter, teased the purchase on his social media earlier this week. "@mattrife & I have officially bought the world's most haunted location," Castee said on social media. "We've been working on this nearly all year & it is finally happening  I am making sure this will be the best paranormal investigation location on the planet." Annabelle is a supposedly haunted Raggedy Ann doll which, according to rumor, became supernaturally active sometime in the 1970s. The Warrens, who make a living investigating paranormal phenomenon and writing about them, say they were contacted by a student nurse in 1970 about issues with the doll. The student was given the doll as a gift, but it quickly began acting strangely, and a psychic told her that it was inhabited by the ghost of a girl named "Annabelle." Threatening notes were left to Lou on parchment, despite nobody in the house having any on hand, and on at least one occasion, Lou reported being attacked physically by the doll. They then took the doll to house it safely in their paranormal museum. But video evidence shows the doll, which isn't supposed to be moved in order to avoid antagonizing the malevolent spirit inside, safely back at home behind glass at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. During July, one of the lead tour guides and paranormal educators on the Annabelle doll tour passed away suddenly after bringing the doll to Pennsylvania as part of a paranormal tour series.</p>

      The recent pre-publication on the research on the images from the First Palomar Sky Study contains the ”earth shadow test”. The researchers analysed 106,339 transients in the northern hemisphere, and showed that transients are far less prevalent in the earths shadow. This would mean that the transients are in fact real objects, and can only be seen when lit up by the sun.
    


      In the sampled altitude of 42,164 kilometers, the expected number was 1223 but only 349 were found. The probability of this occuring by chance is less than 1 in 1 000 000 000 000 000, one in a quadrillion. It is as certain that these things are real as it is certain that the sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after that, for a billion years.
    


      If i dropped a grain of sand on the beach and you came to pick it up the next day, the likelihood of you picking the correct one is as unlikely as these objects being plate defects.
    


      Edit: It seems that Beatrice Villarroel and colleagues have found even more evidence that there are far fewer transients in the earths shadow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a twist that sounds straight out of a horror movie—and just as much like an elaborate prank—comedian Matt Rife has officially become the “legal guardian” of paranormal's most notorious resident: the Annabelle doll. Yep, Matt Rife, the rising standup comic with a huge Gen Z following, announced this week that he's in charge of Ed and Lorraine Warren's entire mysterious haunted artifact collection, including the doll that inspired the Conjuring and Annabelle blockbuster horror flicks. Rife broke the news on Instagram and TikTok, gleefully letting fans know that he, together with online ghost-hunter Elton Castee, purchased the legendary Connecticut home once owned by the late Warrens—real-life paranormal investigators and the inspiration behind some of pop culture's favorite horror tales. Instead, they're appointed as “legal guardians and caretakers” of these items for at least the next five years. That list includes over 750 spooky objects, crowned by the world-famous Annabelle doll, still locked away in a glass case (for now). Reopen the Warren Museum—closed since Lorraine Warren's death in 2019—for overnight ghost stays and guided tours where anyone brave enough can get chills up close and personal. Her legacy began in the 1970s, when a nursing student received her as a gift and soon reported strange—and sometimes violent—phenomena. The Warrens stepped in, determined the doll housed an evil spirit, and ever since, Annabelle has been kept under tight lock and key at the Warren Museum, glowing under an ominous red light. Her creepy reputation inspired a wave of horror movies and memeable supernatural speculation—she's the ultimate pop-culture boogeyman. Rife didn't waste time hyping up what's next for Annabelle and the haunted collection. In his words, “Ed and Lorraine Warren arguably put demonology and the paranormal into the mainstream…We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place”. For Rife, who has said The Conjuring is his favorite horror series, it's a dream come true—and, judging by the giddy posts, maybe the weirdest “life flex” any stand-up comic's ever bragged about. There's already buzz about whether Rife can actually keep the paranormal at bay. After all, the world's most haunted objects—and Annabelle especially—might not be the best roommates for a comic who's used to slaying crowds, not slaying ghosts. Social media was set ablaze with rumors that the doll had gone missing during a recent Louisiana paranormal tour, prompting panic and jokes alike. Some fans even claimed the doll “vanished” from his hotel room, fueling wild speculation that Annabelle had made another escape bid. Lorraine Warren, who passed away in April 2019, was celebrated as a true trailblazer for ghost hunters, co-authoring books and inspiring an entire genre of movies. Or will Annabelle start pulling any pranks of her own? For now, one thing's literally locked in: the Annabelle doll isn't going anywhere…unless she decides to.

Red Eye has been on my movie list for quite a long time. I have been waiting for the day to finally get the chance to watch this film, and it finally came on a random Sunday evening, while I was wondering what the hell I wanted to watch on Netflix. Dario Argento is one of my horror favorite directors. He has made so many films I have come to love, he is the reason why I became obsessed with Giallo murder mysteries!

Smith claps back at Michelle Obama's ‘offensive' ESPN remarks, gives her sharp lesson on reality TV, voting “In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” as per TikTok community rules. “We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.” The video has sparked calls on social media and among Jewish communities for Sephora and other retailers to sever the association with Kattan's well-known cosmetics business, Huda cosmetics, which Forbes estimates generates about $200 million in sales annually and was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017. Kattan has previously been the target of boycott calls over her anti-Israel remarks after Hamas October 7 attack. The latest TikTok video that Kattan posted sparked immediate criticism from Jewish organizations. “Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.” It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions,” the Committee added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephen Hawking's chilling extraterrestrial life warnings have resurfaced amid 'intelligence trap' studies and interstellar object alarm bells being rung by esteemed Harvard researchers. Hawking's opinions have reentered rhetoric after an international team of researchers began studying a so-called 'intelligence trap.' This concept suggests that successfully contacting a UFO could draw the attention of a malevolent species that destroys humanity, as per the Daily Mail. The study comes amid Harvard University researchers who claimed a so-called giant comet named 31/ATLAS could potentially be an alien probe. Professor Avi Loeb and other scientists alleged there are signs that the interstellar object has been artificially created, including its extremely unusual course that will make close passes by three planets: Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. “The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us,” Hawking warned. He told docuseries viewers: “If aliens ever visit us, the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.” Despite strongly opposing the idea of actively sending messages into space, alerting potential off-world beings of our presence in the universe, Hawking was a passionate advocate for more passive intelligent life searches. He previously supported projects like Breakthrough Listen - the astronomy project aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth. 31/ATLAS is expected to pass within 223 million miles of Earth later this year. If the comet does turn out to be aliens, then ‘two possibilities' will follow. But some conspiracy theorists are convinced it could be aliens after hearing Baba Vanga's reported prediction. So, more than enough time for extraterrestrial beings to get in touch. But like Hawking says, aliens knowing of our existence may not be a good thing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ask any former Supernatural actor their reaction when they heard their character was being killed off, and they generally answer with a smile: “No one really dies on Supernatural.” And neither, it seems, does the show, which has managed to survive long after the final monster-hunting episode aired on November 19, 2020. Indeed, the series continues to find new life from a growing fanbase. With all 327 episodes available on Netflix, a younger generation has been discovering the show. Other perks have included group karaoke, mini golf with cast members, and rocking out on Saturday nights with Louden Swain, a band fronted by God (a.k.a. actor Rob Benedict) and a revolving roster of the show's former castmates. Fans Jennifer Gaylord (left) and Anna Knierim now run the vendor table for Ackles' band, Radio Company, at Supernatural conventions (Holly Diane White) At Creation Entertainment's May 16-18, 2025, convention “The Road So Far…The Road Ahead: Celebrating 20 Years of SPN” in Secaucus, New Jersey, visited by TV Guide Magazine, fans were delighted to spend roughly $1,000 to secure a gold pass that covered all three days and admission to every event, including a special VIP Q&A with Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who played beloved brothers Sam and Dean Winchester. Other popular genre shows like Doctor Who, Star Trek, and The Walking Dead draw crowds to conventions with attendees often paying tribute with elaborate cosplay. “That face-to-face interaction has created more reciprocal relationships than any other fandom enjoys,” says Lynn Zubernis, a psychologist and university professor who has edited several books on the show's appeal. Collins, Padalecki, Ackles, and Alexander Calvert with a happy fan (Holly Diane White) The faithful form strong bonds with Sam and Dean, whose brotherly ties are never broken (except maybe when one of them is demon-possessed), as well as with the siblings' powerful angel ally Castiel (Misha Collins). I met a father and his 13-year-old daughter from Connecticut who was happily going through her Supernatural goody bag. Her dad began watching the show before she was born, he said, and couldn't wait for her to be old enough so they could binge it together. It was their second time at the New Jersey convention. Rianna Melton (center), who owns Charlie's (Felicia Day) car, a yellowAMC Gremlin (Holly Diane White) “When he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, we got him passes to a con, but he passed away three weeks before the event.” Despite her pain, her mom urged her to go; she did and has since kept coming back. “I feel like my dad led me to having all these new friends,” she says. Fans and actors alike would be thrilled to see a new limited series or a movie, which Ackles and Padalecki have publicly mused about, especially since Netflix will drop Supernatural in December after their five-year contract ends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok this week removed an inflammatory anti-Israel video posted by celebrity beauty mogul and influencer Huda Kattan. Kattan, the founder and face of the billion-dollar brand Huda Beauty, shared a video to her more than 11 million followers on TikTok, accusing Israel of orchestrating World War I, World War II, the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7. “All of the conspiracy theories coming out and a lot of evidence behind them — that Israel has been behind World War I, World War II, September 11, October 7 — they allowed all of this stuff to happen. Is this crazy?” Kattan said on camera in her since-removed TikTok post, which included other unfounded claims about Israel. “In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” TikTok's community guidelines state. “We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.” Kattan's agency did not respond to CNN's request for comment. A manager listed on public databases as a representative for Kattan was contacted by CNN and said in an email that they no longer represent her. Kattan's video has spurred calls across social media and among Jewish groups for retailers like Sephora to cut ties with her popular beauty brand, Huda Beauty, which was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017 and brings in roughly $200 million in annual sales, according to Forbes. This is not the first time the beauty influencer has faced calls for boycotts due to her public commentary after October 7. Kattan, whose company has over 57 million followers on Instagram, has been an outspoken critic of Israel and a staunch supporter of Palestinians in Gaza. Within a week of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023, an Israeli Instagram user threatened to boycott her products, to which Kattan replied: “I don't want blood money.” In response to that comment, a Change.org petition was launched and received over 30,000 signatures, calling on Sephora to remove Huda Beauty products from its stores. Kattan's most recent TikTok video drew swift backlash from Jewish groups. “Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.” The American Jewish Committee posted Kattan's since-removed TikTok video on social media, writing, “Huda Kattan, founder of Huda Beauty, is using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories — accusing Jews of harvesting the organs of Palestinians, causing 9/11, and running global pedophile rings. “Retailers have a choice,” said Ari Hoffnung, managing director of the Jewish nonprofit, JLens. “They can continue to platform a brand whose founder promotes hate-fueled conspiracy theories, or they can take a stand against antisemitism.” Forbes included Kattan on their 2023 list of America's Richest Self-Made Women and on their list of Most Powerful Women in Business in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Social media accounts on X shared videos, saying, "squid-shaped UFO" spotted over Texas. “SQUID SHAPED UFO SPOTTED OVER DALLAS, TEXAS," DramaAlert shared the video with this caption. Another asked, "Why are aliens only in the USA?" Another believed it to be true, writing, "Looks real". One user even asked, "Why is it only over the US when they're spotted?" Some people also shared funny GIFs in the comment section, making fun of the news as they claimed it was an AI-generated video. Last month, the internet went crazy after a video of what looked to be "UFO sending down a giant beam" was shared on social media. Some people claimed that it was simply a tall electric pole, while others said that the people recording would have known if it was a pole, as the sighting happened just near their home. In June, another UFO was sighted, as claimed by the netizens. According to some reports, Houston has had the most UFO sightings in Texas history. Moreover, apart from Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and El Paso have also spotted UFOs.</p>

Signing up is free, and your data will never be shared. In a groundbreaking study, scientists have simulated the harsh conditions of cryovolcanic activity found on icy moons such as Europa and Enceladus. By recreating these environments in the laboratory, researchers aim to better understand how such geological processes could potentially reveal signs of ancient microbial life. This effort is not just about understanding space phenomena but also about guiding future exploratory missions that could one day uncover life beyond Earth. Cryovolcanism is a process where water and other volatiles erupt from beneath the surface of icy moons, reshaping them much like lava does on Earth. This type of volcanic activity is significant for planetary scientists, as it could indicate the presence of subsurface oceans that might harbor life. The research team focused on replicating these processes in a controlled environment to gain insight into their dynamics. The Large Dirty Mars Chamber, affectionately known as ‘George,' was employed to simulate the low-pressure conditions prevalent on moons like Europa and Enceladus. This duality is crucial for understanding how the moons' surfaces are continually reshaped by cryovolcanic activity. “Nature Already Solved This” as Scientists Use Plant-Based Design to Reinvent Plastic and Fuel Fierce Clash Over Eco Hype Versus Real-World Impact Effusive cryovolcanism, akin to lava flows on our planet, involves the gentle release of liquid water onto a moon's surface. The research team's findings suggest that water, when introduced into their low-pressure chamber, begins to bubble and form vapors, leading to cooling and subsequent freezing. The resulting ice layer, thin and fragile, is often disrupted by underlying boiling water, allowing liquid to escape through cracks. This phenomenon challenges previous studies that assumed a thick ice crust would prevent further boiling. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can better predict where to search for signs of life on icy moons. China Stuns the World With a “Terrifying New Weapon” That Launches Missiles at Mach 7 Using Cutting-Edge Electromagnetic Railgun Technology Europa's vast subsurface ocean and Enceladus' explosive geysers make them prime targets for exploration. By focusing on regions with active or past cryovolcanism, future missions could prioritize these areas, increasing the likelihood of detecting life. By knowing where and how cryovolcanism occurs, space agencies can design more targeted missions to icy moons. These missions could employ advanced instruments to analyze the composition of ejected materials and detect biological markers. Combining expertise from geology, atmospheric science, and astrobiology, researchers can develop comprehensive models that enhance our understanding of extraterrestrial environments. This holistic approach is crucial as we stand on the brink of potentially discovering life beyond our planet. As we continue to explore the mysteries of our Solar System, the question remains: How close are we to finding signs of life on these distant worlds, and what would such a discovery mean for humanity's place in the universe?

With a focus on people-powered change, his stories spotlight the intersection of activism, policy, and green technology. So, are we saying that boiling water on Europa might be a hot tub for aliens? Are there any missions planned soon to actually test these findings on Europa or Enceladus? What if the aliens are just waiting for us to discover them?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While global fascination with UFOs and alien life continues to surge, famed physicist Stephen Hawking long urged caution, arguing that humanity's eagerness to make contact with extraterrestrial civilizations might be a grave mistake. His fear: that rather than greeting us with curiosity or benevolence, a highly intelligent alien species might see Earth as a planet ripe for exploitation. If anything, the historical record of human behavior, especially when powerful societies encounter less developed ones, suggests conquest, colonization, or indifference to suffering are just as likely as diplomacy. 175648:  Donald Trump dementia fears erupt as mysterious lump spotted in his pants Hawking believed alien civilizations capable of interstellar travel would likely have exhausted their own planet's resources, prompting them to roam the galaxy in search of new worlds to inhabit or strip for materials. Despite being a passionate advocate for the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, Hawking drew a sharp line between listening and reaching out. While projects like Breakthrough Listen, which Hawking supported, aim to detect alien signals, other efforts such as Breakthrough Message and METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) propose actively sending messages into space to alert other civilizations to our presence. In his view, passive observation made scientific sense, but advertising our location to unknown cosmic neighbors was dangerously naive. The U.S. government has declassified multiple military encounters with unknown flying objects, and congressional hearings have drawn attention to whistleblower claims about potential non-human intelligence. Critics of active messaging argue that we have no idea what alien ethics, goals, or behaviors might be. Even if intelligent aliens were aware of Earth, announcing ourselves might trigger a reaction, good or bad, that we're not prepared to handle. Figures such as physicist Michio Kaku and SETI pioneer Frank Drake have expressed mixed feelings about interstellar messaging. Despite these warnings, some scientists argue that staying silent is impractical or even counterproductive. Earth has been leaking radio waves into space for over a century, meaning that technologically advanced civilizations could already know we exist.</p>
