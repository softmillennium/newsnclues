                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In response, researchers have been developing biodegradable versions of traditional plastics, or "bioplastics." Enter researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, who have solved both problems with inspiration from the humble leaf. Long before plastic, humans wrapped their food in leaves, which easily biodegrade due to an underlying structure of cellulose-rich cell walls. In a study published in Green Chemistry earlier this year, Yuan and colleagues used a variation of their leaf-inspired cellulose nanofiber structure to improve the strength and biodegradability of polyhydroxybutrate (PHB), a starch-derived plastic; they further refined their technique for polylactic acid (PLA), as detailed in a new paper just published in Nature Communications. The plastic packaging market is a $23.5 billion industry dominated by polyethylene and polypropylene, polymers made from petroleum that break down into harmful microplastics. The researchers' optimized bioplastic, called Layered, Ecological, Advanced and multi-Functional Film (LEAFF), turned PLA into a packaging material that is biodegradable at room temperature. Additionally, the structure allows for other critical properties, such as low air or water permeability, helping keep food stable, and a surface that is printable. This improves bioplastics' affordability since it saves manufacturers from printing separate labels for packaging. "On top of all of this, the LEAFF's underlying cellulose structure gives it a higher tensile strength than even petrochemical plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene," explained Puneet Dhatt, a PhD student in Yuan's lab and first author on the article. "This unique biomimicking design allows us to address the limitations of bioplastic usage and overcome that technical barrier and allow for broader bioplastic utilization," Yuan said. Competitors from Asian and European research institutions also are working to develop similar technology. The "feedstock" Yuan is referring to are chemicals such as lactic acid, acetate or fatty acids like oleate, products of corn or starch fermentation by microbes that serve as bioplastic factories. Pseudomonas putida, for instance is a microbial strain widely used in the fermentation industry, including to produce a variety of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), including PHB. McKelvey Engineering researchers have designed ways to convert various wastes, including carbon dioxide, lignin and food waste, into bioplastics using strains such as P. putida. With improved bioplastic design, Yuan's research further fills in that loop, with a version of PHB and PLA that could be produced much more efficiently and degrade safely into the environment. "If we can ramp up our bioplastic supply chain, it would create jobs and new markets," he said. The study "Biomimetic layered, ecological, advanced, multi-functional film for sustainable packaging" was supported by NSF EEC 2330245, NSF MCB 2229160, and U.S. Department of Energy BETO (Bioenergy Technologies Office) Projects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combining mitochondrial transplantation with cisplatin not only enhanced immune cell infiltration but also reversed tumor metabolism and improved the drug's effectiveness. This innovative approach transforms mitochondria from mere energy suppliers into active allies in cancer therapy, showing potential to reshape how we treat aggressive lung tumors. Moreover, chemotherapy damages immune cells and reduces their presence in the tumor microenvironment, limiting long-term control. Adding to this challenge, tumors can hijack immune cell mitochondria through nanotube-like structures, further dampening immunity. Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for some, but many patients still fail to respond. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for strategies that restore immune power and metabolic balance during chemotherapy. Researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine and Nantong University published a study in Cancer Biology & Medicine that introduces a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. They investigated whether direct mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. Their findings mark a significant step toward integrative treatments that energize both cells and immunity. The researchers isolated functional mitochondria from human cardiomyocytes -- cells known for their high energy output -- and transplanted them into NSCLC tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Alone, mitochondrial transplantation did not harm cancer cells, but when combined with cisplatin, it significantly amplified tumor suppression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a striking shift in tumor metabolism: downregulation of glycolysis and hypoxia genes, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways -- reversing the Warburg effect. This work demonstrates that mitochondria can serve as metabolic and immunologic reinforcements, transforming the tumor landscape into one more susceptible to immune attack and chemotherapy. "This research introduces a powerful dual-action strategy," said Dr. Liuliu Yuan, lead investigator of the study. At the same time, tumor cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. This could be a promising avenue for patients who don't respond well to conventional treatment." In patients with advanced NSCLC, mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs while minimizing immune suppression.
