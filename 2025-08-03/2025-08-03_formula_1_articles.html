                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race The Hungarian Grand Prix started in promising fashion for Charles Leclerc but ended in disappointment, the Monegasque having slipped backwards to P4. Charles Leclerc has explained the problems behind his “extremely frustrating” drop-off in pace during the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque – who had started from pole position – slipping backwards to fourth on a day where he had hoped to take a victory. However, after Lando Norris put himself ahead of both via an alternative strategy, Leclerc looked to be struggling in the latter stages of the race and was soon overtaken by Piastri for second place. The Ferrari driver then faced a challenge from George Russell in a battle for third and, as well as losing another position to the Mercedes driver, found himself with a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during the battle. After crossing the line in P4, Leclerc cut a downbeat figure as he discussed what had happened to cause his lack of pace later on, with the issue turning out to be different to what the 27-year-old had initially thought. “From around Lap 40 we had a problem with the chassis, so now I've had more details about it,” said Leclerc. “In the car obviously I had no idea what was going on. It's just extremely frustrating when you are fighting for a win and when we had the pace that we had at the beginning of the race, and we lose absolutely everything later on, it's very frustrating.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary Alex Albon believes Williams were “way too slow” in Qualifying at the Hungaroring, leaving him with an uphill battle after he bagged his worst starting position since 2022. After a remarkably strong weekend last time out in Belgium that saw him claim P5 in Qualifying, the Williams driver has struggled to match the performance of other midfield teams in Hungary, failing to break into the top-10 throughout practice. But after their first flying laps, Albon and his team mate Carlos Sainz were up in P15 and P16 before they both bolted on a fresh set of soft tyres. While the Spaniard improved to P8, Albon could only manage 17th before he was bumped down to last place by Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon and Hulkenberg. Reflecting on what went wrong after the session, he said: “I think mainly we just didn't account for the cooler track temperatures. Not ideal but it can happen, and let's see. I don't know, maybe the track's moved on since then.” Sainz similarly confirmed that they took a step back in terms of the set-up on his car, but he was ultimately able to progress to Q2 and secure P13 on the grid, which nevertheless marked his third consecutive Q2 elimination. “I think we ended up reverting back on a lot of the set-up items we tried during the week,” he said. “We went back to a car I know and I more or less did the maximum that was available to us today with P13.</p>
