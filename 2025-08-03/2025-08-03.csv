            This past spring, when I pointed my car out of Inverness to begin a loop around Scotland's craggy northern shoreline, I was expecting trouble ahead. A decade ago, when the North Highland Initiative — a development charity set up under then-Prince Charles — renamed the circuit the North Coast 500 and started promoting the drive to tourists, I had been unconvinced it would work. I approved of any initiative aimed at drawing more visitors to a neglected part of my homeland, but recasting the ramshackle roads of the North Highlands as a desirable destination seemed like a stretch.
    


            Back then, the thought of the drive evoked memories from half a century before — of me and my nauseated siblings squashed inside a rusty Ford station wagon as it rolled through mile after mile of monotonous moorland. Also dampening my enthusiasm were recollections of the food endured in my 20s when introducing my girlfriend of the time to the region. She came up from England expecting langoustines leaping out of creels and venison from stags gralloched, or disembowelled, where they fell on a nearby bed of purple heather. More often than not, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she had to settle for deep-fried scampi and frozen peas, garnished with a smear of tartare sauce squeezed from a plastic sachet.
    


            Yet the idea of making these overfamiliar highways and hostelries the theater for epic road trips worked. As a promotional move, the North Coast 500 was a masterstroke — too much of one, by most accounts. Thanks to the alchemy of marketing and social media, the 516-mile (830-kilometer) circuit, which starts and finishes in Inverness, became an irresistible, Instagram-friendly pilgrimage for people around the world, overwhelming the ability of the aging and underpopulated region, and its roads, to handle the pilgrims.
    


            Locals began losing patience with what happened next: Nose-to-tail motorhomes on single-track roads, grill dads scorching seafront meadows with disposable barbecues, everywhere becoming an open-air toilet. A decade after its launch, the NC500 is now seen as a textbook case of overtourism. At the end of last year, Fodor's Travel added the NC500 to its 2025 “No List” of destinations it recommends avoiding, on the grounds that the route's popularity had made it a threat to the natural environment and a “nuisance” to roadside communities.
    


            But has it all been bad? When I drove the route, primed for a visit to a tourism-ravaged landscape, what I discovered was as much a case for the defense of the much-maligned road trip as an indictment of its negative impact.
    


            No tarmac was melted in the making of the digital phenomenon of the NC500. The roads are hardly any better under their new name than they were in the decades before the North Highland Initiative came up with the idea of marketing them as a destination, or a challenge, in themselves.
    


            Even so, the rechristened route captured the imagination of travel writers and visitor numbers soon began to rise. Everyone seemed to heap praise on the route. No one mentioned the annoying swarms of tiny biting midges that plague Scotland's west coast in the summer.
    


            As the positive publicity snowballed through the years, I began to find myself lured by thoughts of revisiting places with names as romantically resonant as Durness, Ullapool and Applecross. The Covid pandemic intervened before I had the opportunity to live out that daydream and by the time Britain had emerged from lockdowns, the image of the NC500 had changed.
    


            The founders imagined showcasing a Scotland of sea eagles soaring above secret coves and singing sands. When they envisioned sights that would linger for a lifetime in the mind's eye, they didn't have in mind little pagodas of soiled wet wipes used to cover the toilet tracks of wild campers caught short miles from the nearest public restrooms.
    


            When Richard and Jane Alcorn moved seven years ago to Thurso, near the northeastern tip of Scotland's mainland, to open a bed and breakfast, being close to the NC500 was part of why they chose the location. That decision has been rewarded with steady growth in visitors to their cosy Aurora B&B, but Richard says he understands why some of his fellow residents have come to resent the route.
    


            “Initially the idea was for people to come in their cars, stay in local accommodation, buy from local restaurants and use local facilities. It was an admirable idea and we have seen the benefit of that,” he said. “What you've seen since the second lockdown is people trying to have a freebie holiday. More and more caravans and camper vans, people parking up in lay-bys and trying to do it on the cheap. You can see why people get upset with camper vans parking in front of their living room windows, and then there's the abuse they get when they ask them to move on.”
    


This boiled bag of offal is banned in the US. In Scotland it's a fine-dining treat



            Thousands of people signed up to Facebook pages dedicated to chronicling such bad behavior. A backlash gathered momentum. As did misgivings about the NC500 brand passing from royal patronage to private ownership: Since 2018, North Coast 500 Ltd has been under the control of Anders Holch Povlsen, a Danish billionaire and Scotland's biggest landowner.
    


            I was wondering about this as an old school friend and I set off on a drizzly Sunday in late April. Our first stop was Dingwall, a small town located in rich farming land to the north of Inverness that I remember from my childhood as the well-manicured home of a late aunt and uncle.
    


            Lunch options were sparse and, on the High Street, the boarded-up shell of the semi-derelict Commercial Bar was an eyesore reminder that the town has known better times since it was founded as a Royal Burgh authorized by the Scottish Crown precisely 999 years ago. A bit of overtourism might not be the worst thing that could happen here, I thought, not for the last time on our trip.
    


            For the first two-thirds of our journey, we squinted at the views through a misted-up windscreen and wipers on full swipe, failing to spot any evidence of tourists making a nuisance of themselves. There were plenty of camper vans on the roads, but it appeared to be too early in the season for the traffic jams and blocked ambulances the Facebook sites had primed me to expect. Over four days, the only time we got stuck behind a slow-moving vehicle, the culprit was the clearly lost driver of a superstore home-delivery van.
    


            Tourism can be an easy scapegoat for problems it didn't create and cannot be expected to fix, I thought as we turned into the Old School restaurant and rooms on the banks of the fjord-like Loch Inchard on the North West Sutherland coast. Like many of the establishments on the NC500, this place has been geared to turning around most of its six bedrooms almost every day. Guests are encouraged to check in between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., eat dinner between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m., breakfast by 9 the following morning and be gone by 10 a.m.
    


            The model can make it feel like “regimented and rushed” has succeeded “rough and ready” as the go-to descriptor for Highland hospitality. But any fears I had were dispelled by a few glasses of red wine and a stew of locally shot venison of the kind my girlfriend and I could only dream of back in the day.
    


            In the morning, the Old School's owner, Lisa MacLeod, shared her thoughts on the impact of the NC500, starting with an aspect of tourism that sometimes gets forgotten in the costs/benefits debate — the pleasure it has brought to those who might never have visited without it, and the sense of pride and satisfaction that offers to hosts.
    


            “Obviously there are negative parts to it, but generally all these people get to see this most amazing part of the world that they probably wouldn't have known about otherwise,” she said.
    


            While the NC500 has been good for her seasonal business, MacLeod says it was always unrealistic to expect tourism alone to fix big issues such as the tendency of young people to leave the area for opportunities — or just the excitement — on offer elsewhere. “The majority of people who live here either work offshore in the oil industry, or on the fish farms which bring a lot of young families in,” MacLeod said. “The hotels and the B&Bs are not really what makes the money.”
    


            After a traditional Scottish fried breakfast, we set off to spot puffins, skuas and razorbills on Handa Island, where the sun appeared for the first time on our trip, splitting the clouds to light up the wildlife reserve's lovely bays in azure hues more usually associated with the Caribbean.
    


            By the time we rolled into the nearby coastal village of Scourie a few hours later, it was properly warm and we were ravenous. Which was well timed because here, at the bottom of one of the steep slender smallholdings, known as crofts, that run down to the bay is the kind of all-day Scottish dining venue I'd been fantasising about for decades.
    


            As we walk up to Grant and Heather Mercer's Crofters Kitchen food truck there is a hum of quiet contentment from the surrounding picnic tables and the sight of Heather updating the daily-changing  specials blackboard is equally reassuring. Grant, a 33-year-old with 17 years of experience under his head chef's hat, has just taken delivery of some wild halibut from a local fisherman and, hours after it was landed, it is going straight on the menu.
    


Why Scotland's ‘ghost' whisky distilleries are coming back to life



            It is just the kind of thing this veteran of Scotland's long-hours hospitality culture envisaged himself doing when he and Heather first decided to embark on this business venture. Their goal was to spend more time together as a family, while taking advantage of the demand generated by the NC500's success to serve up the kind of locally sourced, seasonal fare that remains the exception rather than the rule in these parts.
    


            The halibut, grilled to moist, flaky perfection and served with orzo pasta in a wild garlic pesto, is one of the nicest things I've ever eaten in Scotland. How long I'd waited for this! As we ate, the Mercers' 15-month old son was toddling about. With his blond hair, he reminded me of my oldest boy at that age. My son's mother, the girlfriend with the aversion to scampi suppers, died suddenly 20 years ago, and I felt a stab of sadness that she was not here to enjoy the scene.
    


            Like the NC500, the Crofter's Kitchen was celebrating an anniversary. It's one year since it opened and the Mercers have been basking in five-star reviews while planning the next stage of their field-to-fork adventure — using a government business grant to convert a shipping container into indoor seating to serve food all year round, bringing more tourism revenue into the local community.
    


            “As well as sourcing all the seafood locally, we produce a lot of our own vegetables and we also buy salads from other crofters, pork, and venison that's been shot on their land that I'll help them butcher,” Grant told me.
    


            “The container will allow us to open almost all year round which will be great for the locals especially in the winter when there is not much open around here. The nearest Chinese takeaway is in Ullapool, a good 45-minute drive away.”
    


            I know from my own experience of living in one of Scotland's wet and windy corners that infrastructure is not just about parking places and smooth roads. A steady stream of visitors can be the difference between a local store with barely filled shelves and one laden with unexpected choices. As Grant Mercer points out, every halibut delivered by hand to the Crofter's Kitchen is a fish that is not being loaded onto a truck for export — an economic pivot that balances the impact of the NC500's tourists against the environmental costs of the region's participation in a globalized fishing industry.
    


            Heading in a counterclockwise direction, as we did, the road south of Scourie is where the route is at its most breathtaking.
    


            Long before anyone had thought of the NC500 concept, the mountains of Assynt and the Applecross peninsula were a favoured destination for clubs of classic car owners. It was easy to understand why as we glided towards our final overnight stop on meandering corniches lined by banks of sun-drenched flowering gorse. James Bond's Aston Martin would be a good fit for the timeless elegance of these vistas but even in my slightly bashed Volvo, I had the pleasant feeling that I might be starring in a commercial for a posh watch brand.
    


            These sections of the route are endowed with such beautiful natural assets, it made me reflect on how the NC500 concept has also helped entice visitors to neighboring areas less blessed in the looks department. I also wondered why they were not inundated with tourists and the associated pressures decades ago — had they been, perhaps the infrastructure now coming under strain might already have been upgraded.
    


            Precise data on the economic impact of the NC500 is hard to pin down and often contested, but most analysts agree that the route has helped boost visitor numbers in the broader Highland region (up from 5.1 million in 2012 to 8.4 million in 2023, according to the local council), while tourist spending has grown less quickly (from £1.38 billion to £1.68 billion in the same period.).
    


            VisitScotland, the national tourism body, says the NC500 has undeniably raised the region's international profile and drawn in extra visitors to the benefit of the local economy.
    


The sleeper train that's a wild ride to another world



            “The global attention of the route has created some challenges, and we know there is a careful balance to strike between the benefits that tourism brings and ensuring communities feel comfortable and capable of welcoming visitors,” a spokesman said, highlighting the body's efforts to spread tourism over the whole year, encourage longer stays and plug infrastructural gaps exposed by increased tourist numbers.
    


            Since 2018, VisitScotland has distributed £20 million, or about $27 million, through a Scottish government fund to develop rural tourism infrastructure, including many projects around the NC500, like parking, public toilets and motorhome facilities, the spokesman said.
    


            Such efforts have yet to persuade the skeptics that the route's problems can be mitigated without a reduction in visitors. According to the travel experts at Fodor's, the impact of NC500-led overtourism is now so severe it is “steadily changing the region's culture,” while a recent article in the New York Times was headlined: “Should You Drive Scotland's ‘Ultimate Road Trip?' Locals Say Maybe Not.”
    


            Our trip left me unpersuaded — especially given that around one in seven of the region's jobs depend on tourism. Even if it were true that the culture of the Highlands is being re-sculpted by the invisible hand of tourism, would that necessarily be a bad thing?
    


            Our final hotel on the route provided an answer of sorts. It was the only one I'd been able to find in a 30-mile radius offering two single rooms for under $200 a night and my heart sank as we checked in — the hotel's public bar revealing itself as a grim haven from the brilliant sunshine, where the early evening crowd formed a depressing tableau of Scotland's public health challenges.
    


            Inspecting my closet-sized room, I clocked the polyester sheets and fraying carpet, but failed to spot that I'd be destined for a dawn wake-up thanks to the absence of proper curtains.
    


            Later on, getting ready for dinner in a nicer spot, we bumped into a former manager of the hotel and fell into good-humoured conversation about the lack of gentrification at his old place of employment.
    


            “It's a bit of a rough old place,” I said.
    


            “Mmm,” he replied. “You should see it when the fishermen are in.”

            Hours after President Donald Trump told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “go to hell” in a Saturday post on social media, the Senate headed into recess without reaching a deal over confirming Trump's nominees.
    


            Senate Republican leader John Thune, Schumer and the White House had been engaged in a round of intense talks to end the standoff so senators could return to their home states, sources briefed on the conversations told CNN.
    


            Schumer had requested federal funds be released and that Trump agree not to push another legislative package that would slash federal funding, sources told CNN.
    


            But, on social media, Trump called Schumer's demands “egregious and unprecedented,” a sign that talks had collapsed.
    


            Trump had wanted the Senate to confirm his nominees even if that meant skipping the August recess, but his post showed he wasn't interested in agreeing to Democrats' terms.
    


            “Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL! Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS,” he wrote.
    


            On the Senate floor Saturday night, Thune asked for unanimous consent for the chamber to vote on a handful of nominations and then break for a month.
    


            Democrats had been slow-walking Trump's lower-level nominees, forcing Thune to keep the Senate in session this weekend to confirm them. In the minority, Democrats have the power to force Thune to jump over time-consuming hurdles before the chamber can vote.
    


            Schumer made several demands to agree to let a batch of nominations be quickly confirmed by the Senate, according to the sources. The demands included the unfreezing of federal funds for an array of programs, including the National Institutes of Health and foreign aid.
    


            The New York Democrat also wanted Trump to agree that he won't attempt to push through another package to slash federal funding known as “rescissions” — after a $9 billion package to codify some cuts was approved earlier this summer.
    


            Schumer said in a news conference Saturday night that Democrats were “serious” about finding a “reasonable path” to allow bipartisan consideration of Trump's nominations, but that the president wouldn't agree to the terms.
    


            “In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating. Is this the ‘Art of the Deal'?” Schumer said, pointing to a poster printed with Trump's social media post.
    


            Schumer declined to get into details of the negotiations with the White House and Thune but said that both sides were “getting close on a whole lot of issues, and Donald Trump just pulled the rug out from under people.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and to Thune for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Orban points to main hurdle in ending Ukraine conflict","https://www.rt.com/news/622424-orban-nato-russia-ukraine-conflict/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 11:45:00 GMT","

The Ukraine conflict will only be resolved when both the West and Kiev accept that Ukraine cannot be a NATO member, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said. Budapest has consistently called for diplomacy and the immediate cessation of hostilities.

Hungary has opposed Ukraine's bid to join NATO, arguing that such a move risks dragging Europe into a full-scale war with Russia. Since the conflict escalated in February 2022, Hungarian authorities have refused to send weapons to Kiev and continue to advocate a negotiated solution.

“Peace will come when Europeans and Ukrainians alike accept the fact that Russia will never allow NATO to establish a presence on its western border in Ukraine,” Orban said Saturday at a youth festival in Esztergom.

The Kremlin has repeatedly stated that Ukraine's pursuit of NATO membership poses a direct threat to Russian national security and was a primary cause of the conflict's escalation. According to Moscow, NATO's expansion toward Russian borders is a red line, making Ukraine's bid unacceptable.

Earlier this year, NATO members agreed on a plan to raise their defense budgets to 5% of GDP, citing the need to deter adversaries, primarily Russia, as the key reason for the move.

A broader push among European NATO states to increase military spending has drawn sharp criticism from Russian officials.

In June, the EU redirected approximately €335 billion ($390 billion) in Covid relief funds toward military uses. The previous month, Brussels introduced a €150 billion debt and loan instrument to support member states' armed forces and defense industries. Russia has condemned the steps, accusing both NATO and the EU of “rabid militarization.”

Orban also stated that a “Russian threat” to Europe is unrealistic and does not exist, and should not shape EU policies. He warned that such an approach would result in faulty and incomplete decision making.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Why Russia and the US are bound to cooperate beyond Earth","https://www.rt.com/news/622430-us-and-russia-space/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 12:40:00 GMT","

By Dmitry Strugovets, a specialist in the field of astronautics

The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, has made a rare visit to the United States – his first official trip since assuming the top job at Russia's space agency. The occasion? To attend the launch of Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov aboard a SpaceX spacecraft and to meet with his counterpart, acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy.

Whether or not he meets Elon Musk remains to be seen. But this trip is significant far beyond the question of private handshakes.

This was, first and foremost, a political and diplomatic visit – the kind that's planned months in advance and requires high-level approval. That it's taking place now, in the midst of a direct confrontation between Moscow and Washington over Ukraine, speaks volumes. It marks the first in-person meeting between the heads of Roscosmos and NASA since 2018, when Dmitry Rogozin hosted Jim Bridenstine at Baikonur.

Rogozin's own planned return visit to the US was blocked in late 2018, despite his openness to meeting Musk. His inclusion on Western sanctions lists made it politically toxic for Washington to host him. Subsequent Roscosmos chief Yury Borisov never even got the opportunity for face-to-face talks – the Biden administration declined, citing political optics during the Ukraine conflict. Communications were limited to a few phone calls. But with the return of Donald Trump to the White House and a reshuffled US space leadership, conditions for engagement have shifted.

It hardly matters that the American side was represented by an acting official – Sean Duffy, appointed just two weeks ago – or that NASA has seen more leadership turnover than Roscosmos in recent years. Duffy doesn't make key decisions. He speaks for the White House. The symbolism lies in the fact that a meeting is happening at all, after years of virtual silence under the Biden administration.

The timing is not accidental. The meeting coincided with the anniversary of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission, when the US and USSR docked their spacecrafts in orbit at the height of the Cold War. Back then, both sides had nuclear weapons aimed at each other's capitals. And yet, they still shook hands in space. If they could do it then, the logic goes, they can do it now.

The second reason for the visit – the flight of a Russian cosmonaut on an American spacecraft – sends an equally pointed message: despite geopolitical conflict, collaboration remains possible. NASA's reliance on Musk's rockets has only grown, especially after Boeing's Starliner program stumbled again. The next Starliner launch is planned as a cargo-only mission; crewed flights are on hold. Caution prevails.

In this context, the Roscosmos visit functions as a subtle form of diplomacy: why fight down here when we could build together up there? The International Space Station (ISS) remains the last major joint venture between Russia and the US. Beyond it, nothing binds the two powers in peaceful cooperation.

While technical matters were on the agenda, diplomacy took precedence. Still, two important points emerged from the talks. First, Sergey Krikalev – Russia's special presidential envoy for space – hinted that both sides have preliminarily agreed to extend ISS operations until 2030. Previously, the Russian government had only committed to supporting its segment of the station until 2028, anticipating that the first module of its next-generation Russian Orbital Station (ROS) would be launched by then. The US, meanwhile, has committed to operating its segment until 2030, with the possibility of continuing through 2032.

Krikalev's statement carries weight. As a presidential envoy, he can speak with more flexibility than Bakanov, who is still bound by formal government directives. Nevertheless, the implication is clear: the door is open to extending joint operations well beyond 2028.

Second, Bakanov stated that the two sides also discussed future space cooperation – including potential collaboration on the Russian orbital station and on deeper space missions. If negotiations go well, we could see the ISS extended through 2035, with Russia possibly participating in – or helping shape – a successor project: an ISS-2. For Trump, a renewed global space station could be cast as a diplomatic victory, potentially traded for Western concessions on Ukraine.

If that happens, Russia's role in ISS-2, especially in partnership with BRICS countries, would elevate the project into a truly multipolar enterprise. A space station that is not just international, but universal.

And then there is the Mars question – Musk's long-standing obsession and a second pillar of any future space agenda. A meeting between Bakanov and Musk, if it happens, would be behind closed doors and entirely unofficial. Just like when Vladimir Popovkin, a former Russian space chief, secretly met with Musk years ago.

Bakanov's goal, it seems, is to demonstrate that Russia's aerospace sector has something to offer – that it is not a relic, but a relevant partner in humanity's next leap. If Russia does not participate in the Mars project, it risks being left behind.

But what could attract Musk's attention? In reality, Russia has two trump cards: its nuclear-powered space tug technology and its deep, unmatched experience in space medicine. If harnessed wisely, these assets could give Moscow a seat at the Mars table – whether as partner or competitor. 

In sum, the Roscosmos visit to the US is about far more than a launch or a handshake. It's a signal – deliberate and strategic – that Russia still sees space as a domain for cooperation, not conflict. And that in the great void above us, there may yet be room for common ground.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Nobody reads UN reports","https://www.rt.com/news/622419-nobody-reads-un-reports/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:43:00 GMT","

Most of the 1,000+ reports produced each year by the United Nations are barely read, according to the organization's own study into how to make its work more “impactful and coherent.” The revelation comes as the UN marks its 80th anniversary amid a deepening identity crisis.

In March, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched the UN80 Taskforce – a reform initiative aimed at reviewing how the Secretariat implements thousands of mandates and at reducing administrative overload.

According to a report released Thursday, the Secretariat published 1,100 reports last year – a 20% increase since 1990 – and supported 27,000 meetings involving 240 entities.

“The sheer number of meetings and reports is pushing the system – and all of us – to the breaking point,” Guterres said during a briefing on Friday.

Many of these reports are not widely read. The top 5% of reports are downloaded more than 5,500 times, while one in five reports receives fewer than 1,000 downloads. And downloading doesn't necessarily mean reading.

It remains unclear how many people downloaded the latest report about reports, but a UN tweet about the efficiency reform effort, despite featuring an engaging video clip, had gathered fewer than 5,000 views at the time of writing.

Secretary-General @antonioguterres' remarks to the Informal Meeting of the General Assembly Plenary on the UN80 Initiative: 👇👇https://t.co/bvHfvMCyCMpic.twitter.com/GbkkAR2JpS

Founded in the aftermath of World War II by the Soviet Union, United States, UK, France, and China, the organization was created to prevent wars and promote cooperation; it initially had 51 members.

Now with 193 member states, the UN faces what many experts have described as a credibility crisis. Guterres has pushed back, insisting that “our values have never been more relevant.”

Russian President Vladimir Putin stated during a meeting with Guterres at a BRICS summit last year that the UN should reform to keep pace with global changes and provide greater representation for developing nations.

India has also been among the most fervent advocates for reforming global governance institutions, with Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar comparing the UN to “an old company” that is not keeping up with the market but still “occupying space.”

New biography of the Duke of York claims ‘punches were thrown' after heated argument became physical

Prince Harry has denied he gave Prince Andrew “a bloody nose” during a fight at a family gathering in 2013.

According to an excerpt from a new biography of the disgraced Duke of York, published in the Daily Mail on Saturday, the pair had a heated argument that escalated into a physical altercation. “Punches were thrown over something Andrew said behind Harry's back”, the author Andrew Lownie claimed.

The alleged fight began when “Harry told [his uncle] he was a coward not to say it to his face. Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”

Lownie's biography, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, also claims Andrew told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, would “not last more than a month”.

He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017.

Late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said: “I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.”

The duke and duchess have sent a legal letter to the Daily Mail over the publication of what their spokesperson described as “gross inaccuracies, damaging and defamatory remarks”.

The Guardian has approached Buckingham Palace and representatives for the Duke of York for comment.

Prince Andrew fell from grace after a disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019 about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the late American financier and convicted sex offender. The duke was stripped of his royal and military titles in 2021.

The book claims Harry and his brother, William, had “problematic” relationships with Andrew for years and that Andrew was also rude about William's wife, Catherine, the Princess of Wales.

King Charles has allowed his younger brother to stay in the Royal Lodge, a 30-room mansion in Windsor Great Park owned by the crown estate. However, last year the king ended Andrew's allowance, estimated at £1m annually, raising questions about future arrangements.

The source quoted in Lownie's biography claims the Prince of Wales is keen to “evict” the duke and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, who lives with Andrew though the couple divorced in 1996.

According to Entitled's source, “[William] also loathes Sarah … and can't wait for the day when his father throws them both out. If Charles doesn't, I guarantee you the first thing William does when he becomes king is to get them evicted.”

Harry broke ties with his family citing the “toxicity” of royal life and alleged racism towards his wife, moving with his young family to Canada and then the US in 2020. In 2022 he published a memoir, Spare, in which he detailed strains in his relationships with his father and brother.

Earlier this year he told the BBC he had forgiven his family and would “love a reconciliation”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Witnesses hear blast shaking city shortly after midnight on Sunday; Ukraine strikes in Russia kill three people, officials say. What we know on day 1,257

See all our Russia-Ukraine war coverage

Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday, the military administration of the Ukrainian capital said on the Telegram messaging app. Reuters' witnesses heard a loud blast shaking the city soon after midnight. The reported attack comes days after Russia's worst airstrike of the year on Kyiv, which killed at least 31 people, including five children, and wounded more than 150.

Ukraine on Saturday said it hit military targets and a gas pipeline in drone attacks in Russia, where local authorities said three people were killed and two others wounded. Ukraine's SBU security service said the strikes, carried out on Friday night by long-distance drones, hit a military airfield in the south-western town of Primorsko-Akhtarsk. They caused a fire in an areas where Iranian-built Shahed drones – relied on by Russia to attack Ukraine – were stored, the SBU said.

The SBU said the strikes also hit a company in Russia's southern Penza region, which it said “works for the Russian military-industrial complex”, making military digital networks, aviation devices, armoured vehicles and ships. The governor for Russia's Penza region, Oleg Melnichenko, said on Telegram that one woman had been killed and two other people were wounded in that attack.

Russia's defence ministry said its air-defence systems had destroyed 112 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory – 34 over the Rostov region – in a nearly nine-hour period, from Friday night to Saturday morning. An elderly man was killed inside a house that caught fire due to falling drone debris in the Samara region, governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev posted on Telegram. In the Rostov region, a guard at an industrial facility was killed after a drone attack and a fire in one of the site's buildings, acting Rostov governor Yuri Sliusar said. “The military repelled a massive air attack during the night,” destroying drones over seven districts, Sliusar posted on Telegram.

More than 120 firefighters were trying to extinguish a blaze at an oil depot in the Russian city of Sochi that was sparked by a Ukrainian drone attack, a regional governor said early on Sunday. In the Krasnodar region where Sochi is located, a fuel tank with a capacity of 2,000 cubic metres was on fire, Russia's RIA news agency reported. Rosaviatsia, Russia's civil aviation authority, said on Telegram that flights were halted at Sochi's airport to ensure air safety.

Both sides deny targeting civilians in their strike in the war that Russia launched with a full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv says that its attacks inside Russia are aimed at destroying infrastructure key to Moscow's war efforts and are in response to Russia's relentless strikes on Ukraine.

Indian oil refineries will continue to buy oil from Russia, officials have said, before threatened US sanctions next week against Moscow's trading partners over the war in Ukraine. Media reports on Friday had suggested India, a big energy importer, would stop buying cheap Russian oil. Trump later told reporters that such a move would be “a good step” if true. “I understand that India is no longer going to be buying oil from Russia,” he said. “That's what I heard. I don't know if that's right or not. That is a good step. We will see what happens.”

Ukrainian authorities said on Saturday that they had arrested several politicians in connection with a “large-scale corruption scheme” in the defence sector, shortly after an uproar over the independence of anti-graft bodies. A law passed in late July stripped the National Anti-Corruption Agency (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAP) of their independence and placed them under the supervision of the prosecutor general, himself appointed by the head of state. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday backtracked and restored the bodies' independence after an outcry from the country's allies and the first anti-government street demonstrations since Russia's invasion.

The NABU on Saturday said it and the SAP had exposed “a scheme for the systematic misappropriation of budget funds allocated by local authorities for the needs of the defence forces, as well as the receipt and provision of unlawful benefits on an especially large scale”. It said the scheme involved inflating prices for electronic warfare and drone equipment, and then funnelling off 30% of the contract amounts. The suspects include a member of parliament, heads of district and city administrations, members of the National Guard, and executives at defence companies. The NABU said it has made four arrests so far but did not identify those detained.

Zelensky said in a statement: “I am grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work … It is important that anti-corruption institutions operate independently, and the law passed on Thursday guarantees them all the tools necessary for a real fight against corruption.”

A fire that broke out near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after Ukrainian shelling has been brought under control, the Russian-installed administration of the plant in Ukraine said on Saturday. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia plant in the first weeks of Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Both sides have accused each other of firing or taking other actions that could trigger a nuclear accident. The plant's administration said on Telegram that a civilian had been killed in the shelling, but that no plant employees or members of the emergency services had been injured. The station, Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, is not operating but still requires power to keep its nuclear fuel cool.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Itamar Ben-Gvir attended holy site in breach of ‘status quo' arrangements with Muslim authorities

Saudi Arabia has joined condemnations of far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to al-Aqsa mosque today.

The minister of national security travelled to the holy site and prayed there with a reported group of 1,250 people. Police were pictured alongside Ben-Gvir.

Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation and Jews can visit but may not pray there.

“The foreign ministry expresses the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's condemnation in the strongest terms of the repeated provocative practices by officials of the Israeli occupation authorities against al-Aqsa mosque,” a statement on X read.

“The Kingdom affirms that such practices fuel the conflict in the region.”

Here is a recap of today's events

Israel's far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited and prayed at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site on Sunday, triggering fears that the provocative move could further escalate tensions. The visit to al-Asqa mosque came as hospitals in Gaza reported that 27 more Palestinians seeking food aid were killed by Israeli fire.

During his visit, Ben-Gvir renewed calls for Israel to “declare sovereignty over Gaza” and to “encourage voluntary migration”.

Ben-Gvir's visit was swiftly condemned as an incitement by Palestinian leaders as well as Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Sufyan Qudah, spokesperson for the foreign ministry in neighbouring Jordan, which serves as the custodian of the al-Aqsa mosque, condemned what he called “provocative incursions by the extremist minister” and implored Israel to prevent escalation.

The Palestinian ministry of health reported that 119 people were killed in the past 24 hours amid ongoing Israeli strikes, including 15 bodies recovered from beneath rubble. The ministry said the total death toll since the start of the war on 7 October 2023 has now reached 60,839, with 149,588 people injured.

The health ministry also reported that six adults have died as a result of famine and severe malnutrition within the past 24 hours. According to the ministry, this brings the total number of deaths attributed to hunger related causes in Gaza to 175, including 93 children.

The humanitarian organisation Palestine Red Crescent Society reported that one of its staff members was killed and three others wounded in an Israeli attack on its Khan Younis headquarters in southern Gaza early this morning.

Thousands of Palestinians protested in the occupied West Bank's major cities, rallying against the war in Gaza and in support of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

Fresh clashes broke out in Syria, straining a fragile ceasefire and calling into question the ability of the transitional government to exert its authority across the whole country.

French president Emmanuel Macron has condemned Hamas' “inhumanity without bounds” after the group released videos showing two visibly emaciated Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Israel's far-right National Security Minister conducting a Jewish prayer on the Al-Aqsa compound in east Jerusalem drew condemnation from the Palestinian Authority, which called it a “dangerous escalation”, as well as Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

Itamar Ben Gvir publicly carried out the highly contentious move - that violates a long-held understanding at the site - on Sunday.

In a statement filmed at the compound, Ben Gvir said that Israel should respond to the “horror videos” of two Israeli hostages released by Palestinian militant groups this week by “extending Israeli sovereignty over the entire Gaza Strip” the same way it imposed it on the Temple Mount.

Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in 1967, in a move not recognised by much of the international community.

Ben Gvir's action was described by the Israeli left-wing newspaper Haaretz as a “provocation”.

Renewed sectarian clashes in southern Syria's Druze-majority Sweida province killed at least four people on Sunday, a war monitor said, as Damascus accused local groups of violating last month's ceasefire.

The province witnessed deadly clashes between Druze fighters and Sunni Bedouins in July that drew the intervention of government forces and tribal fighters who came to support the Bedouins.

Syrian state-run news agency SANA accused Druze groups loyal to influential spiritual leader Hikmat al-Hijri of breaching the ceasefire by attacking government troops in Tal Hadid, killing one security forces officer and injuring others.

In a statement, the Syrian interior ministry accused local groups of “launching treacherous attacks against internal security forces in several locations and striking some villages with rockets and mortars, resulting in the killing and wounding of a number of security personnel”.

They came in full force in the pouring rain, armed with umbrellas and ponchos and waterproof prams. One man even carried a surfboard. This is Sydney, after all.

At least 100,000 people marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge on Sunday as part of a growing global call for a ceasefire in Gaza. It was double the estimated turnout, described by New South Wales police as the largest protest to descend on the city in memory.

The massive column of rain-soaked marchers snaked their way across the entire 1.2km length of the bridge. Police temporarily ordered a halt over fears of a crowd crush because of the “huge number of people taking part”.

On Saturday, after the NSW supreme court had ruled in favour of the march proceeding, the Palestine Action Group had crystal ball gazed and said Sunday's bridge crossing would be an “immense march for humanity”.

Pro-Palestine protesters crossed the Harbour Bridge on a wet and wintry Sydney day, armed with umbrellas and ponchos and waterproof prams. One man even carried a surfboard. This is Sydney, after all. Read the full piece here:

Protesters gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to demand an end to the war in Gaza and the return of all hostages still held in the territory.

The rallies took place after Hamas released video footage of the hostage Evyatar David who was in an emaciated state.

COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, has said that four tankers of UN fuel had entered Gaza to help in operations of hospitals, bakeries, public kitchens and other essential services.

Israel blames Hamas for the suffering in Gaza but, in response to a rising international uproar, it announced steps last week to let more aid reach the population, including pausing fighting for part of the day in some areas, approving air drops and announcing protected routes for aid convoys.

UN agencies say airdrops are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and open up access to the territory to prevent starvation among its 2.2 million people, most of whom are displaced amidst vast swathes of rubble.

COGAT said that during the past week over 23,000 tons of humanitarian aid in 1,200 trucks had entered Gaza but that hundreds of the trucks had yet to be driven to aid distribution hubs by UN and other international organisations.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he spoke with the International Red Cross's regional head, Julien Lerisson, and requested his involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages held in Gaza.

French president Emmanuel Macron has condemned Hamas' “inhumanity without bounds” after the group released videos showing two visibly emaciated Israeli hostages held in Gaza.

Hamas and its Islamic Jihad ally have released clips showing captives Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David, who were kidnapped during the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.

“An abject cruelty, an unlimited inhumanity: this is what Hamas embodies,” Macron posted on X.

“France's absolute priority and imperative is the immediate release of all hostages,” he added.

Macron, who has said France will recognise a Palestinian state in September, promised to work “tirelessly” to “promptly restore the ceasefire, and to enable the massive delivery of humanitarian aid, still blocked at Gaza's borders”.

He also argued that Hamas must have no part ruling Gaza once the war ends.

“We demand the total demilitarisation of Hamas, its complete exclusion from any form of governance, and recognition of Israel by the state of Palestine.” he said.

‘We don't take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians': Athens mayor rebukes Israeli ambassador

The mayor of Athens, Haris Doukas, has sharply criticised Israel's ambassador to Greece following claims that the city authorities were failing to tackle antisemitic graffiti.

In an interview published on Sunday by the Greek newspaper Kathimerini, ambassador Noam Katz said Israeli tourists felt “uncomfortable” in the capital and accused Athens of inaction against “organised minorities” responsible for antisemitic vandalism.

Doukas responded on X: “We have proved our strong opposition to violence and racism, and we do not take lessons in democracy from those who kill civilians.”

He went on to call the ambassador's focus on graffiti “revolting” at a time when “an unprecedented genocide is taking place in Gaza.”

Family of Israeli hostage held in Gaza accuses Hamas of starving him

The family of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza said that Hamas is starving him after the release of a video in which he appeared emaciated and weak.

The footage, released on Saturday, shows Evyatar David speaking in what appeared to be a Hamas tunnel in Gaza. In scenes that have caused outrage and dismay in Israel, he is shown digging what he says could be his own grave. In comments made under duress, he urges the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire.

The family of David released a statement responding to the video, accusing Hamas of starving David for propaganda.

“We are forced to witness our dear son and brother Evyatar being deliberately and cynically starved in Hamas's tunnels in Gaza – a living skeleton buried alive. Our son has only a few days left to live in his current condition,” the family said.

They called for humanitarian aid that enters Gaza to be allowed to reach David and urged the US and Israeli governments to do everything possible to secure his release.

Read the full story here:

The Palestinian ministry of health has reported on Telegram that 119 people were killed in the past 24 hours amid ongoing Israeli strikes, including 15 bodies recovered from beneath rubble.

Hospitals across Gaza recorded 866 injuries in the same period, with emergency crews reportedly unable to reach many victims still trapped in debris or lying in the streets.

The ministry says the total death toll since the start of the war on 7 October 2023 has now reached 60,839, with 149,588 people injured.

Between 18 March and today, the ministry has documented 9,350 deaths and 37,547 injuries.

Among those killed in the last 24 hours, 65 were reportedly attempting to access humanitarian aid, raising the total number of such deaths to 1,487, with more than 10,578 wounded in similar circumstances.

New outbreaks of violence overnight into Sunday rocked Syria at two flashpoints, straining a fragile ceasefire and calling into question the ability of the transitional government to exert its authority across the whole country.
  In the north, government-affiliated fighters confronted Kurdish-led forces who control much of the region, while in the southern province of Sweida, they clashed with Druze armed groups.
  The outbreaks come at a time when Syria's interim authorities are trying to maintain a tense ceasefire in Sweida province after clashes with Druze factions last month, and to implement an agreement with the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that would reintegrate large swaths of northeastern Syria with the rest of the country.

Thousands of Palestinians protested in the occupied West Bank's major cities on Saturday, rallying against the war in Gaza and in support of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.

One of the largest marches took place in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority located just north of Jerusalem, with hundreds gathering at the main square, waving Palestinian flags.

Many protesters carried photos of Palestinians killed or imprisoned by Israel, as well as photos depicting the hunger crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip, where UN-backed experts have warned that a “famine is unfolding”.

“My son is in [Israel's] Megido prison and he suffers from many things, such as the lack of medicine the lack of food,” Rula Ghanem, a Palestinian academic and writer who took part in the march, told AFP.

She said that her son had lost 10 kilograms and suffered from scabies in jail.

Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that “Israel's policy of maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed and will not change”.

The comments follow outrage that far-right national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir led a large group to the Al-Aqsa mosque, also revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, to pray, in defiance of a long-standing convention.

Jordan, which acts as the site's custodian, condemned the minister's latest visit there as “an unacceptable provocation”.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society has shared this footage after it said that one of its staff members was killed and three others wounded in an Israeli attack on its Khan Younis headquarters in southern Gaza early this morning.

Israeli newspapers have dedicated their front pages on Sunday to the plight of the hostages following the release of videos showing Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David.

Maariv decried “hell in Gaza” and Yedioth Ahronoth showed a “malnourished, emaciated and desperate” David.

Right-wing daily Israel Hayom said that Hamas's “cruelty knows no bounds”, while left-leaning Haaretz declared that “Netanyahu is in no rush” to rescue the captives.

Saudi Arabia has joined condemnations of far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben-Gvir's visit to al-Aqsa mosque today.

The minister of national security travelled to the holy site and prayed there with a reported group of 1,250 people. Police were pictured alongside Ben-Gvir.

Charlie the 10-year-old yellow lab likes surfing so much, he will grab his surfboard and run toward the water. His humans sometimes have to hide his board if they want to chat with friends on the beach.

Charlie joined about 15 to 20 other canine wave riders in Pacifica, 14 miles (22 kilometers) south of San Francisco, on Saturday at the World Dog Surfing Championships, an annual contest that draws thousands of spectators to Pacifica State Beach.

Pooches competed against similarly sized peers for a chance to appear in the finals. Additional heats featured multiple dogs surfing tandem or riding with people.

Labs, terriers and spaniels in monogrammed life vests dog-paddled out into the Pacific. Once out on the waves, their owners helped them hop on colorful boards and hang ten as the crowd cheered from the beach.

Judges scrutinized how long the dogs remained on their boards, how long they held their balance and whether they performed any tricks, like turning around while riding.

Iza, a 5-year-old French bulldog, won the single surfer heat for medium-size dogs for the first time this year, her owner David Fasoli said.

Fasoli found “pure joy” during the pandemic when he brought home a surfboard from his job at Costco and taught Iza to balance in the swimming pool. The two soon started swimming in the ocean and learning to ride waves as passersby at the beach watched in awe. Now, their competitions are all about defying expectations.

“I have a disability — I only have one hand — so a nonsporting human combined with a nonsporting dog breed, we are kind of phenomenal, defying the odds of what people think we're capable of doing,” Fasoli said after Saturday's competition.

Charlie, who has his own Instagram page, entered the extra-large single surfer heat. He also rode tandem with two other dogs in what their humans called “The Dream Team.”

“He loves the crowd,” owner Maria Nieboer said.

Charlie and Nieboer's husband, Jeff Nieboer, prepare for waves together. When Jeff spots a good one, he turns the board around and tells Charlie to “get ready.”

He pushes the board forward, and Charlie scrunches down and rides the wave as long as he can. Charlie can even steer the board by leaning and surfs toward an awaiting Maria on shore.

He doesn't have to be rewarded with treats for any of it.

“Charlie does what Charlie wants to do once we're in the water,” Jeff said.

Contest winners received medals and bragging rights.

Charlie's “Dream Team” compatriot, fellow yellow lab Rosie, was in four heats. The 4-year-old's owner, Steve Drottar, said she is “stoked” after they go surfing, which they do four to five times a week back home in Santa Cruz.

“It's like, hey, we actually did something today, right? We did something together as a team,” Drottar said. “And the fact that you can do something as a team with your dog creates a different bond than you have when you just take your dog for a walk.”

He can tell Rosie feels a sense of accomplishment afterward because she is extra happy, wags her tail extra hard and snuggles even more than usual.

“It's like we go home on the couch and it feels like she's saying, ‘Thank you,' ” Drottar said.

SINGAPORE (AP) — The Americans set a world relay record and piled up three gold medals Saturday in what's been an otherwise frustrating swimming world championships for them.

And at the heart of the turnaround on the next-to-last day of the worlds in Singapore was none other than 28-year-old Katie Ledecky, the most decorated female swimmer in history.

Despite the world record in the mixed freestyle 4×100 relay — 3 minutes, 18.48 seconds — the story was Ledecky remaining unbeaten in the 800 freestyle.

She first won that race in the 2012 Olympics and has never lost since in a major competition.

Perhaps for the first time in her career, Ledecky was given only a 50-50 shot by many to beat the 18-year-old Canadian Summer McIntosh, the star of these worlds with Frenchman Leon Marchand.

McIntosh's best time this season was 8:05.07 — just behind Ledecky's world mark of 8:04.12 set earlier this year.

After 700 meters, McIntosh of Canada was ahead by 0.14 seconds, but she faded and Ledecky won in 8:05.62 with Lani Pallister of Australia taking silver (8:05.98). McIntosh (8:07.29) settled for bronze.

McIntosh has won three individual gold medals in Singapore and was trying for five. She will come up short, though she will be the favorite in Sunday's 400 individual medley.

Ledecky said she was unaware she was trailing and, when asked about it, glanced down at a race-results sheet to confirm it.

“I didn't know,” she said. “I just knew it was close the whole way. There were times where I thought I was just going to break away. I was just happy I was up there.

“You just never know when you dive in what everyone's tactics are going to be — or what's going to happen,” she added. “It was fun to just to be in that kind of a race. Just try to make small moves just here and there.”

Ledecky has won 23 gold medals at world championships and 30 overall. Add to that nine Olympic gold medals and 14 Olympics medals overall. If you're counting, that 44 Olympic and world medals.

McIntosh, who won three gold medals in the Paris Olympics, hates losing and she showed it afterward with her comments. They were short and right to the point.

“Obviously, that's not even close to what I wanted; time-wise, place-wise, how I executed the race. Nothing,” she said.

Gretchen Walsh of the United States won the 50 butterfly in 24.83 seconds for her second individual gold of the worlds. Earlier in the worlds she won the 100 fly. Alexandria Perkins of Australia claimed silver (25.31) with bronze for Roos Vanotterdijk of Belgium (25.43).

“It feels great to be like myself again in the water after kind of a rocky week,” said Walsh, referring to the ” acute gastroenteritis ” that the Americans have battled in Singapore following a training camp in Thailand.

“Two-time world champion. Can't complain with that,” Walsh added.

Paris Olympic 50-free gold medalist Cameron McEvoy of Australia repeated his title in the worlds, winning in a quick 21.14. Ben Proud of Britain was the silver medalist (21.26) and American Jack Alexy took bronze (21.46).

Defending champion and world-record holder Kaylee McKeown of Australia won gold again, taking the 200-meter backstroke in 2:03.33. American Regan Smith took her fourth silver medal in Singapore (2:04.29) with bronze for American Claire Curzan (2:06.04).

Maxime Grousset of France picked up his second gold, taking the 100 butterfly in 49.62, just off the world record of 49.45 by American Caeleb Dressel. Noe Ponti of Switzerland took silver (49.83) with bronze for Canadian Ilya Kharun (50.07). Grousset also won the 50 fly.

It was only the second world record set in these championships. It came on a night when the United States won three gold medals, by far its best performance in what had been a lackluster championships for the team.

The relay team members were: Alexy, Patrick Sammon, Kate Douglass and Torri Huske.

The Americans how have eight gold medals, one ahead of Australia with the championships closing on Sunday. The Americans have 26 overall and Australia has 17 overall.

The only other record set in the meet came earlier in the week with Marchand shattering the 200 IM record (1:52.69). He'll try to break his own 400 IM record on Sunday, a mark of 4:02.50 set in the 2023 worlds in Fukuoka, Japan.

Republican senators left Washington for their August recess without passing a major Russia sanctions bill, effectively handing U.S. President Donald Trump full authority to decide whether to follow through on his threat to penalize Moscow if it doesn't halt its war against Ukraine by Aug. 8.

Trump warned that if Russian President Vladimir Putin fails to agree to a ceasefire, the U.S. would impose tariffs on countries that continue importing Russian oil. As a preview, he announced 25% tariffs on India — a far cry from the 500% rate outlined in the Graham-Blumenthal bill that has yet to reach a Senate vote.

“I think (Trump)'s going to be very careful about what he does,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), told the Hill. “But I think he is clearly disappointed in Putin, and I think he is now coming around to recognizing that many of us were right.”

Trump has recently expressed growing frustration with Putin's refusal to deescalate, calling Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine ""disgusting."" He also said on Aug. 1 that he had ordered nuclear submarines to the region in response to recent threats from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. ""Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""I hope this will not be one of those instances.""

Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), co-author of the sanctions bill with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), said he would consider it a win if Trump imposed even a portion of what the Senate proposed. “We propose in our bill 500 percent. If it's 250 percent, I could live with it. Even if it's 100 percent, possibly. But you ought to impose bone-crushing sanctions that will stop them from fueling Russia's war machine,” Blumenthal told the Hill.

Some Republican senators said the Senate missed a key opportunity by leaving Washington without voting on the Graham-Blumenthal sanctions bill. Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, the second-ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. should continue ramping up pressure on Russia and ensure Ukraine remains well-armed.

Head of North America desk

Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. She is based in Edmonton, Alberta. Olena has a master's degree in publishing and editing from the Institute of Journalism in Taras Shevchenko National University in Kyiv. Olena was a 2016 Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow who worked for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette for six months. The program is administered by the University of Missouri School of Journalism in Columbia.

Work is ongoing between Ukraine and Russia as the warring parties prepare to each exchange 1,200 Prisoners of War (POWs), President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 3.

Key anti-corruption agencies restored after controversial vote, as well as Trump shortens deadline for Russia peace deal.

The unidentified civilians ""armed with bats and metal pipes, damaged a vehicle and inflicted bodily injuries on a soldier"" as the officer was attending to enlistment activities, officials allege. In response to the incident, a serviceman fired a non-lethal weapon at the civilians, allegedly in self-defense.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Aug. 3 announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Anatoliy Kryvonozhko, who has been serving as the Air Force's acting head since the end of last August. 

Russia has been attacking a key bridge in Kherson Oblast since late on Aug. 2, local officials reported.

A Russian missile strike hit the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv overnight on Aug. 3, injuring seven and damaging homes and civilian infrastructure, according to Ukrainian officials.

Oleksii Kuznetsov, a member of parliament who belongs to Zelensky's Servant of the People party, allegedly accepted kickbacks for inflating military contracts. He has been dismissed from his parliamentary faction pending the outcome of the case.   

The number includes 920 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

A drone strike resulted in a major fire early on Aug. 3 at an oil depot in Russia's resort city of Sochi, setting ablaze a 2,000-cubic-meter fuel tank, local authorities said.

Republican senators left Washington for their August recess without passing a major Russia sanctions bill, effectively handing Donald Trump full authority to decide whether to follow through on his threat to penalize Moscow. 

The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe and one of the ten largest globally, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) conducted a joint operation with local partisans to blow up a minibus in occupied Melitopol, killing all five soldiers of the Russian-backed Akhmat unit on board. 

Russian forces are ""looking for vulnerabilities in our defense, and conducting active combat operations in several directions simultaneously,"" Commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported. 

Kyiv has submitted an updated version of the Ukraine Plan for the European Commission's consideration, following the EU's decision to cut the next tranche of the Ukraine Facility due to incomplete reforms. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Victoria Mboko receives against Coco Gauff during a match at the National Bank Open in Montreal on Saturday.Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images

Victoria Mboko's stellar run at the National Bank Open hit a new level Saturday.

The Canadian rolled to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over No. 1 seed Coco Gauff of the United States, winning the women's singles match in just 62 minutes to advance to the quarterfinals at the WTA 1000 tournament.

Mboko, a rising star who has climbed from a No. 333 ranking to 85th in the world this year, saved all four breakpoints against the world No. 2 Gauff, who committed 22 unforced errors in the fourth-round match at IGA Stadium.

The 18-year-old from Toronto, who entered the tournament as a wild card, is the last Canadian standing in the singles draw, both in Montreal and at the 96-man Masters 1000 event in Toronto.

Mboko became the second youngest Canadian to reach a WTA 1000 quarterfinal since 1990, behind only Bianca Andreescu.

She's also only the second teenager — and first Canadian — to defeat Gauff, as well as the first player this season to not drop a single game on serve against the star American.

After major support for Eugenie Bouchard early in the tournament, the buzz in Montreal shifted around Mboko as the teenage sensation took centre court — and she delivered before a sellout crowd.

“Your support was incredible,” Mboko told the crowd in French after a chorus of “Olé, Olé, Olé!” chants echoed around the venue.

“I'm really happy to win today.”

Mboko looked ready to meet the moment early, flashing the powerful groundstrokes and blistering serve that have made a mark on the pro tour this season.

Gauff, meanwhile, made unforced error after unforced error, firing some shots long and many more into the net during a swift, 25-minute first set.

The 21-year-old double-faulted on the third point of the match, leading to an early break for the Canadian, who rattled off seven straight points into the next game.

Mboko broke again in the fifth and seventh games while holding serve. In the seventh game, Gauff doubled-faulted and sent two shots into the net in succession to lose the set.

Gauff found a rhythm early in the second set and earned three breakpoint chances with the match tied 3-3, but committed an error each time as Mboko hung on to win the game.

With Mboko leading 5-4, Gauff doubled-faulted twice to set up two match points for the Canadian.

Gauff, this year's French Open champion, scraped by with three-set wins in Rounds 2 and 3. She struggled with her serve, striking a whopping 37 double faults in the two matches combined — adding six more on Saturday.

Mboko and Gauff met once before in May, when the Canadian won the first set but dropped the next two on clay at the Italian Open.

Mboko will play the winner of Saturday's late match between Zhu Lin of China and Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

Playing in only her seventh WTA main draw, she advanced to the quarterfinals of a 1000-level tournament for the first time, knocking off higher-ranked opponents at each step.

Mboko opened with a win over 79th-ranked Kimberly Birrell, then upset 23rd seed and former Grand Slam champion Sofia Kenin before snapping Marie Bouzkova's seven-match winning streak with a relentless comeback and taking down Gauff, dropping one set the whole way.

It's the latest chapter in a breakthrough season for Mboko, who also played in her first two Grand Slam main draws, reaching the French Open third round and Wimbledon second round.

Her impressive record in all competitions this season improved to 50-9, including 24-8 against players ranked above her.

In Saturday's day session, Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine and Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan advanced to the quarterfinals.

Kostyuk, the 24th seed, recovered from a first-set loss to defeat McCartney Kessler of the United States 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round.

The ninth-seeded Rybakina also rallied for a 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 win over Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine, who defended three match points before losing. Kostyuk and Rybakina will play each other in the next round.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","The biggest and quirkiest roadside attractions to see on your next Canadian road trip, according to readers","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/travel/article-readers-best-canadian-roadside-attractions/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

From a dinosaur in the Prairies to the ‘world's largest axe' in New Brunswick, Globe readers told us which monuments are worth more than a pit stop

Road-trip season is in full swing, reminding many Canadian travellers it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

But let's face it: When you're driving down a long stretch of highway for hours at a time, sometimes the journey can get a tad monotonous.

That's where Big Things come in. You know, those massive roadside monuments and statues that demand your attention when you drive by, offering a precious chance to stretch your legs and snap a photo to put in the family album. A flying saucer, a gargantuan gnome or even a giant blueberry could pop up quickly on the horizon.

With countless monuments to choose from, we asked Globe readers to share their favourite attractions everyone should see at some point, and you delivered. Some are quirky, some are colossal and all 100-per-cent Canadian.

From coast to coast, here are 16 attractions to make the trip worth your while.

Sue Nicholson and her husband were getting the grand tour of Kamloops from a cousin while visiting the interior B.C. city, and there was only one thing they wanted to see. “He was somewhat taken aback when we asked to see the fish statue,” wrote Nicholson of the nearly five-metre wide, open-mouthed creature created by wood carvers in Kamloops. Nicholson recalled her cousin saying he had never been asked to see it before. “We thought it was a salmon, but it's actually a local strain of rainbow trout.”

Howard the nearly nine metre tall gnome has a storied past on Vancouver Island, and Nanaimo local Liana O'Brien tells it best: “He was built in the 1990s to advertise a racing track that eventually closed. Howard remained in his position at an Esso station at Nanoose Bay, until he grew bored and decided to go walk about. He now resides in Saanich, but local bylaws have discriminated against him saying he is 17 inches too tall, so he is only allowed to come out and stand tall and proud four weekends a year to celebrate local events. He is otherwise incarcerated in storage at a nearby farm.”

.

A prehistoric being named Tyra, four times larger than a real T-Rex, has been guarding Canada's own slice of Jurassic Park for decades. Allan Hobden visited the first statue, which has since been replaced, on a family road trip in 1960. “As a kid I was amazed at how big it was,” he wrote. But Hobden, a very brave 12 year old, wasn't intimidated by the massive beast, posing with his fists raised in the air as if to fight it while his father took a picture

The giant aluminum pysanka is a tough egg to crack. Nine-metres long and more than three-storeys high, the Ukrainian-style painted Easter egg pays homage to the many early Ukrainians who settled in Vegreville. And it was a popular submission, with readers from as far as Quebec praising its brightly coloured shell. Matt Funk in Kelowna, B.C., remembered seeing it featured on the alien sci-fi show The X Files, when a snow globe containing a miniature of the egg – a popular souvenir from the town – was used to reveal a password to a secret file.

The same love of science-fiction is alive elsewhere in Alberta, where the aptly named town of Vulcan has embraced its Star Trek connection with a model of a USS Enterprise ship where the main series is set. Chris Jones in Toronto says it's his pick because “it's the weirdest one I can think of! And c'mon, they have a transporter.” Lloyd Hummert and his wife, Betty, live in California, but stopped by the town in 2019 on their “see the rest” of Canada trip. Between their travels together and apart, they've boldly gone to all 10 provinces, all three territories and where no man has gone before.

Mac the Moose is a jaw-dropping 10-metres tall and weighs a whopping 10,000 kilograms, and he provides a jolly welcome for drivers passing east and west on the Trans-Canada Highway. Debbie Ristimaki says there were “plenty of laughs and memories created” when she and her partner took their mothers, ages 96 and 80, on a road trip from Winnipeg to Banff in June, stopping to see Mac each way. Seeing the moose was also a special moment for Shirley-Anne Blackadder, whose 2023 road trip around Saskatchewan completed the Vancouverite's quest to visit every province and territory in Canada.

Chuck the Channel Catfish stirred up controversy when he was erected to attract American fisherman across the border to the “Catfish Capital of Canada,” and now he's still helping reel them in. Selkirk local Dave Wilkinson says there was heated debate in 1986 as some argued “it should be one of the first visible monuments upon entering the town” and petitioned council to move it out of Selkirk Park. “Despite ongoing tensions surrounding Trump's trade war, Selkirk continues to draw U.S. tourists, who come to fish for catfish in the Red River,” said Wilkinson. The freshwater fish recently got a fresh coat of paint.

Anyone driving east past Toronto on the 401 has done a double take at this iconic landmark — a giant, smiling apple greeting you as you drive by. At that point, you must be thinking you took a wrong turn toward New York, but the real Big Apple is located in Colborne, Ont. Reader Kristen Watson said she stopped in and was surprised to find a market selling pies and even got “a completely unexpected and exciting chance to climb a twisted stairwell up inside the Big Apple.”

Ontario's Highway 11 is a veritable treasure trove of roadside attractions. Kallie Berens highlights Chimo the Polar Bear, located right outside the downtown core of Cochrane in northeastern Ontario. The town is home to the world's only habitat dedicated entirely to polar bears – there was a time where you could swim in a pool with them, separated by glass – and the adorable bear statue welcomes you in. “Overall, the journey up Highway 11 makes for a memorable road trip,” she said, adding that small towns offer interesting stops. “I would recommend travelling up that way to anyone looking for a rich historical adventure with a wilderness twist.”

While working as a university summer student for a team at Forestry Canada, Globe reader Tom Alves had the chance to visit towns all along Highway 11. One standout from the journeys is the flying saucer at the edge of Moonbeam, Ont. It's huge, silver and straight out of a 1950's sci-fi movie. “It's just so unique and kitschy, I absolutely love it,” Mr. Alves said.

Sudbury, Ont.'s giant nickel is, as reader Stephen Podetz says, “not only big, but built to last.” He first saw it on a camping trip at five years old and said that 25 years later, it was just as impressive. Sudbury is known for its nickel production and is still a major source of the mineral in Canada. “ I think of it as the granddaddy of all big things,” he said.

Did you know Quebec has its own sea monster? Locals named the elusive creature, rumoured to reside in the depths of Lake Memphremagog, Memphré. And while visitors might not be so lucky as to catch a sighting of the real thing, reader Sue Nicholson highlighted the city of Magog's topiary statue of the creature, made of greenery and jutting out of a pond.

You'd think Paul Bunyan dropped something when visiting the Big Axe in Nackawic, N.B. Kevin Kitchen travelled to its home by the St. John River and “it did not disappoint.” Rising almost 15 metres into the sky, the axe was commissioned in the early nineties to celebrate the region's forestry industry.

Shediac, N.B., is a go-to destination for travelling lobster lovers – boat tours take you up close and personal with freshly-caught crustaceans, but one catch is bigger than the rest. Sitting at about 10-metres long and 5-metres high, the a giant lobster roadside attraction signals to tourists what the town's all about. As reader Diana Colleran says, “It's a beaut!”

Reader Meg Hughes recommends taking a trip to Oxford, N.S., to catch a glimpse of the town's giant smiling blueberry. The town is known for its wild blueberries – it's one of the biggest producers in Canada – so don't miss your chance to take a selfie.

Potato fans travel near and far to catch a glimpse of the giant spud in front of the Canadian Potato Museum in O'Leary, PEI, built to inform travellers on the history of potato farmers in the region.

National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to claim full sovereignty over Gaza. Meanwhile, thousands in Sydney, including Julian Assange, took part in a pro-Palestinian march. DW has the latest.



During a visit to a disputed holy site in east Jerusalem, Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called on Israel to ""fully occupy"" the entire Gaza Strip. The far-right lawmaker was joined by Jewish settlers and was seen praying at Temple Mount, a move deemed highly inflammatory as Jews are not allowed to pray there.

Ben-Gvir has deep ties to the settler movement and resides in a radical settlement near Hebron, which is considered illegal under international law.

Meanwhile, a pro-Palestinian march in Sydney, Australia, attended by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, drew an estimated 25,000 people and closed the city's famous Harbour Bridge.

Following along for news, analysis and updates on Gaza, Israel, and the Middle East on August 2 and August 3.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed ""profound shock"" over videos showing two emaciated hostages in Gaza.

 A statement from Netanyahu's office said he had spoken with the families of hostages Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David and ""expressed profound shock over the materials distributed by the terror organizations.""

Netanyahu told the families that ""efforts to return all our hostages are ongoing,"" the statement added.

Palestinian militant groupHamas and its ally Islamic Jihad released three videos this week. In the videos, it showed two hostages Hamas has held in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which triggered the war.

In one scene in the staged footage, David appeared to be digging what he said was his own grave.

Israeli newspapers dedicated their Sunday front pages to the plight of the hostages, with one decrying ""hell in Gaza"" and another showing a ""malnourished, emaciated and desperate"" David.

The videos make references to the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where UN-mandated experts have warned that a famine is unfolding.

Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called for his country to ""occupy the entire Gaza Strip and declare full sovereignty.""

Ben-Gvir, a settler from the occupied West Bank, commented during a visit to Jerusalem's flashpoint Temple Mount, adding that Palestinians should be ""encouraged to emigrate voluntarily.""

His remarks are likely to fuel further claims that Israel is pursuing a policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" in Gaza, charges the Israeli government denies. The lawmaker said the footage was being used by the Palestinian side to exert pressure on Israel.

Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif, is home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, making it the third-holiest site in Islam. For Jews, it is the location of the destroyed biblical temples.

Ben-Gvir said he prayed at the site, despite a long-standing arrangement that non-Muslims are not allowed to do so.

He has visited the site in the past, calling for Jewish prayer to be allowed there, prompting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to issue statements saying that this was not Israel's policy.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators braved rainy weather to march across the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of the Palestinian people on Sunday. 

Protesters called for peace and aid deliveries in the war-torn Gaza Strip, where UN-mandated experts have warned a man-made ""famine is unfolding."" Nearly two years into the war in Gaza, several governments and humanitarian organizations, along with the public across the world, have condemned the widespread starvation. 

The organizers of Sunday's rally dubbed it the ""March for Humanity."" Wikileaks founder Julian Assange was one of the demonstrators.

Some attending the march carried pots and pans as symbols of hunger, often seen in images coming out of Gaza. The protesters also waved Palestinian flags and chanted, ""We are all Palestinians.""

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said he supports a two-state solution and that Israel's denial of aid and killing of civilians ""cannot be defended or ignored.""

Good morning and welcome to our weekend blog, which covers Gaza, Israel and all updates on the Middle East. 

On Saturday, the German government mounted pressure on Israel, saying the amount of aid entering Gaza remains ""very insufficient"" despite limited improvement. The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, delivered 9.6 tons of aid into Gaza, according to the DPA news agency.

Meanwhile, a chilling video surfaced from Gaza, leading to widespread anger. Hamas released a propaganda video of an Israeli hostage in Gaza, Evyatar David, who has been held captive since October 7, 2023. In one portion of the video, a frail-looking David is being forced to dig a hole, which he says will be his grave.

This Sunday morning, we will continue to track news from the region. Stay tuned.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) humanitarian organization said Israeli forces attacked its headquarters in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.

The PRCS said the attack killed one staff member and injured three others. The PRCS posted a video of what it said was the Israeli attack on social media platform X, with the footage showing fire and an explosion inside a building.  

The Israeli military has yet to comment.

Turkey has begun delivering Azerbaijani natural gas to Syria. 

The Turkey-Syria Natural Gas Pipeline, which goes through the southern Turkish border region of Kilis, was inaugurated in an event on Saturday, with Turkish, Azerbaijani, Syrian and Qatari officials in attendance. 

Taking part in the Kilis inauguration ceremony, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar called the opening of the pipeline a ""historic moment."" Bayraktar said that ""in the initial phase, up to two billion cubic meters of natural gas per year could be exported to Syria.""  

Bayraktar said gas deliveries will first be sent to Aleppo in northern Syria, and will later be extended to the city of Homs in the central part of the country.    

Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir, who was at the launch event, hailed the gas pipeline as a ""strategic step"" that boosts energy security and will ""positively impact the economy and living conditions.""

Syria's Sunni Islamist-led interim government has close ties with Turkey, with Turkish investments playing a key role in rebuilding the country after the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar Assad. Turkey opposed Assad's rule and backed rebels fighting against him during the Syrian civil war, which ignited in 2011.  

The family of Evyatar David, an Israeli held hostage in Gaza, saw him for the first time after Hamas released a video of him, looking very frail.

The propaganda video has led to widespread anger, with families of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas calling on the Israeli government to secure their release.

In one section of the video, Evyatar David is shown being forced to dig a hole in the ground that he says will be his grave.

David was kidnapped at the Nova Music Festival on October 7, 2023, during the terrorist attack by Hamas in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.

His family said in a statement that ""Hamas is using our son as a live experiment in a vile hunger campaign. The deliberate starvation of our son as part of a propaganda campaign is one of the most horrifying acts the world has seen.""

The video is juxtaposed with pictures of starving Palestinian children.

In a UN statement on Tuesday, UN-backed food security experts said that ""the worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in Gaza,"" with UN World Food Programme director of emergencies Ross Smith saying the situation was ""unlike anything we have seen in this century.""

Germany's Bundeswehr armed forces delivered about 9.6 tons of aid into Gaza on Saturday, according to the DPA news agency.

An A400M military transport aircraft dropped 22 pallets of humanitarian aid containing food and medical supplies into Gaza, the report said.

The Israeli military said countries like France, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates delivered about 90 pallets of aid into Gaza on Saturday.

A United Nations-affiliated organization that tracks food security worldwide issued a dire warning earlier this week about the hunger crisis in the Gaza Strip.

It confirmed that, based on data up to July 25, a ""worse-case"" famine scenario, was unfolding across Gaza.

Israeli authorities control the only three border crossings at the Strip and cut off all supplies to Gaza at the beginning of March.

Israeli authorities then reopened some aid centers in May, but with restrictions they said were designed to stop goods from being stolen by Hamas militants.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the US, Germany, the EU and others.

Malnutrition-related deaths spiked in Gaza in July, according to the World Health Organization.

Airdrops have been sharply criticized by some humanitarian groups as expensive, inefficient and dangerous.

US envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday visited Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and vowed to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza.

""We will get your children home and hold Hamas responsible for any bad acts on their part,"" Witkoff told families of Israeli hostages who had gathered at the square to stage a protest to call upon the Israeli government to secure a deal to release their loved ones from captivity.

Witkoff was cited as saying so, according to a statement by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. He added ""We will do what's right for the Gazan people.""

Protesters had gathered at the square after videos of Israeli hostages held in Gaza were released by militant groups, sparking anger and outrage.

One video of an Israeli hostage was released by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad on Thursday. A second video was released by Hamas on Friday (see posts above). It is unclear when those videos were filmed.

Witkoff on Friday also visited an aid distribution site in southern Gaza run by theUS-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The foundation has been widely criticized for failing to improve conditions in the besieged enclave.

The amount of aid entering Gaza remains ""very insufficient"" despite limited improvement, the German government said on Saturday, after ministers discussed ways to heighten pressure on Israel.

Germany ""notes limited initial progress in the delivery of humanitarian aid to the population of the Gaza Strip, which, however, remains very insufficient to alleviate the emergency situation,"" government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in a statement. ""Israel remains obligated to ensure the full delivery of aid,"" Kornelius added.

German ministers had gathered on Saturday, following German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul's trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories on Thursday and Friday.

Wadephul had called upon Israeli authorities to ensure safe access for UN agencies to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, saying the current restrictions were worsening the crisis.

""The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza must end now,"" Wadephul had said, stressing that aid distribution through the UN had long worked effectively and needed to resume without obstacles.

Russia's emergency officials have warned that small tsunami waves could hit three districts of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

Russian officials warned that a tsunami wave of up to 19 centimeters (7.5 inches) could affect a section of the Kamchatka coast following a strong tremor on Sunday morning.

""As a result of the earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a tsunami wave no more than 19 centimeters high may reach the Aleutian municipal district, no more than 15 centimeters high may reach the Ust-Kamchatsky municipal district, and no more than 3 centimeters high may reach the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky urban district,"" a report by Kamchatka Tsunami Warning and Monitoring Center said.

""The expected wave heights are low, but you must still move away from the shore,"" Russia's Ministry for Emergency Services said on the Telegram messaging app.

The United States Geological Survey said the earthquake was at a magnitude of 7.0, while German Research Center for Geosciences labeled the tremor a 6.8.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning System, which also gauged the quake at 7.0, said there was no tsunami warning for the island of Hawaii after the quake.

This is the second earthquake reported from near Russia within a week. On July 30, a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake hit the region, followed by several strong aftershocks.

Another tremor followed with the Krasheninnikov volcano in Kamchatka erupting overnight, for the first time in 600 years.

Russia's state news agency cited the head of the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, Olga Girina, as saying the eruption may have been connected to the earthquake on Wednesday that triggered tsunami warningsas far as French Polynesia and Chile.

Authorities said a week-long operation led to the arrests. Thousands of abandoned mines have become hotspots for illegal activity in South Africa.

Nearly 1,000 undocumented migrants working illegally at a gold mine in northeastern South Africa have been arrested, police said on Friday.

Public broadcaster SABC reported that police had launched an operation titled Operation Vala Umgodi at the Sheba Gold Mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga province.

SABC cited a police spokesperson as saying those arrested were working underground at the mine, close to the borders of Eswatini and Mozambique.

The spokesperson said they would be charged with breaking immigration laws and possibly for illegal mining.

A police statement posted to Facebook said some of those arrested were likely ""underage.""

The operation to round up the miners took nearly a week, AFP news agency reported, citing an unnamed police spokesperson. The police said more arrests could follow.

Mine owner Barberton Mines welcomed the arrests, saying ""illegal mining will not be tolerated.""

Sheba was founded in the 1880s and is one of South Africa's oldest and richest gold mines.

It played a key role in the country's early gold rush, attracting prospectors and shaping the region's mining legacy.

Today, the mine remains operational, but faces high costs and a massive issue with gold theft, prompting the owner to restructure operations to stay viable.

South Africa has around 6,000 abandoned mines, many of which have become hotspots for illegal activity.

Illegal miners in South Africa are known as ""zama-zamas"" (""take a chance"" in the Zulu language), who work in abandoned or operational mines using basic tools and methods.

Many come from neighboring countries; the rest are made up of unemployed South Africans who turned to illegal mining after the decline of the formal mining sector.

A police operation to root out illegal miners took place in 2024 when police surrounded the abandoned gold mine near Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg. The police had cut off supplies to force illegal miners to surrender.

The standoff lasted months and, in January, police raided the mine, leading to the discovery that dozens of miners had died.

Sydney Sweeney registered as a Republican the day after Donald Trump's criminal conviction.

The White Lotus actress, who has provoked anger from Left-wing critics and social media commentators in a recent advert for American Eagle jeans, registered with the party in June last year, public records show.

Two weeks earlier, Mr Trump became the first president to be criminally convicted for what prosecutors said was a scheme to cover up an affair with an adult film star.

A woman matching Sweeney's age, address and place of birth registered as a Republican on June 14 last year in Monroe County, Florida, according to state records.

Her party affiliation is still active. Sweeney, 27, has been largely silent on her political views in public, but has recently been feted by Right-wing figures for an American Eagle jeans advert, which has been described as “Maga-friendly” by critics.

The camera zooms in on the actress's breasts and bottom during the advert, which ends with the slogan: “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.”

Some critics on the Left have called it a sexist attempt to appeal to Mr Trump's “Maga” base, while others – noting the pun on “jeans” and “genes” – claimed it promotes eugenics and “Nazi propaganda”.

“It seemed clear to me that they [American Eagle] were aligning themselves with a white nationalist, Maga-friendly identity,” Shalini Shankar, an anthropology professor at Northwestern University, told CNN.

JD Vance, the vice-president, said the Left's “crazy” reaction to the advert showed they had failed to learn from Mr Trump's electoral victory last year.

“Did you learn nothing from the November 2024 election?” he asked on Friday. “I actually thought that one of the lessons they might take is we're going to be less crazy. The lesson they have apparently taken is ‘we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful'. Great strategy.”

“Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women,” said Ted Cruz, the Republican senator for Texas, this week.

“I'm sure that will poll well.”

Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, called the criticisms “cancel culture run amok” and hit out at the “warped, moronic and dense liberal thinking”.

Two years ago, Sweeney faced backlash from fans when she hosted a birthday “hoe-down” for her mother's birthday where guests were pictured wearing red Maga-style caps with the words: “Make Sixty Great Again.”

The Euphoria star called the event an “innocent celebration” and said it had been “turned into an absurd political statement, which was not the intention”. “Please stop making assumptions,” she added.

Last year, Mr Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels, a porn star with whom he was alleged to have had an affair shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006.

The then-presidential candidate declared himself the victim of a “rigged” justice system trying to stop his campaign to become president, prompting a groundswell of support from Republicans.

His campaign said it raised a record-breaking $53m (£40m) in the hours after the verdict, around a third of which came from donors who had never previously given money to the party. Mr Trump was handed an unconditional discharge 10 days before he took office in January.

The largely symbolic move meant he avoided any fines or jail time.

The Republicans have enjoyed limited celebrity backing under Mr Trump, while the Democrats made celebrity endorsements one of the linchpins of Kamala Harris's campaign last year.

A representative for Sweeney has been approached for comment.

			Revealed: First lady was key factor in US president's decision to launch air strikes on Syria during first term

As Donald Trump was flying back from Scotland, he revealed how he had discussed the horrific images of starving children in Gaza with his wife, the first lady.

“She thinks it's terrible,” he told The Telegraph aboard Air Force One.

“She sees the same pictures that you see and we all see. Everybody, unless they are pretty cold-hearted or worse than that, nuts … there's nothing you can say other than it's terrible when you see the kids.”

Melania Trump has kept a low profile during her husband's second term. Her rare appearances at the White House have sparked “Where's Melania?” headlines and questions about whether she is a part-time first lady.

But her influence can be spotted in Mr Trump's policies, and she is credited by insiders for being the “quiet force” behind the president's tougher stance on Russia.

For Melania, it is not a new role.

The Telegraph can reveal that she was a key factor in Mr Trump's decision to launch air strikes on Syria during his first term following a chemical weapons attack by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

A former White House official said she was horrified by videos of children dying in Khan Shaykun in 2017 and impressed upon her husband the need to act.

Mr Trump abandoned his campaign promises not to intervene in Syria's civil war, and launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles from the Mediterranean Sea at a government airbase in Syria.

It was the first time that the US acknowledged striking Assad targets.

The former official said Mrs Trump was highly influential in the decision.

“I think she reacts to human suffering as a mom, without a policy or political filter, and shares her gut reaction with her husband,” they said.

Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University and an expert in the role of first ladies, said Mrs Trump was performing her role in a highly unconventional way, rejecting the traditional role of simply appearing beside her husband at public events.

Her approach may mean she is underestimated by the media and public at times.

“It may be that she does have more influence on her husband's thinking about issues than the general public might initially recognise because they seem to have this very traditional marriage in terms of gender role: He's the boss. She's the helpmate,” she said.

“But I think there has to be more to her than that, in that she has gone her own way a number of times.”

Mrs Trump, 55, was born Melanija Knavs in the part of Yugoslavia that is now Slovenia.

She launched her career as a fashion model at the age of 16, and met her future husband in 1998, when she was 28. Mr Trump was recently separated from Marla Maples, his second wife.

They married seven years later and their son, Barron, was born in 2006.

She was an unconventional first lady from the start, being only the second foreign-born woman to hold the position (after England-born Louisa Adams) and the first to have once appeared naked on the front cover of a magazine.

She did things her own way during Mr Trumps' first term, waiting for five months to move down to Washington DC from New York so Barron could finish his school year, and broke with her husband over family separations at detention facilities at the southern border.

She made headlines in 2018 with a jacket she wore during a visit to see migrant children separated from their families. “I really don't care,” read a statement on the back, “do u?”

It caused an uproar on social media as commentators pondered its meaning.

Mrs Trump later said it was a message to reporters who used anonymous sources to undermine her.

“In fact, I decided to let them know that their criticism would never stop me from doing what I feel is right,” she said in her 2024 memoir, entitled Melania.

She also used her book, published a month before the election, to speak up for abortion access. It marked a clear break with much of the Republican Party and her husband, who had taken a more conservative stance.

“Some people, they see me as just the wife of the president, but I'm standing on my own two feet, independent. I have my own thoughts,” she told Fox News ahead of Mr Trump's second inauguration.

“I don't always agree [with] what my husband is saying or doing, and that's OK.”

Mr Trump recently described his wife's influence when it came to the conflict in Ukraine, describing her sceptical take on Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, and his warm words.

“I go home, I tell the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation,'” Mr Trump said. “She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.'”

That turned her into an immediate heroine in Ukraine.

She was nicknamed “Agent Melania Trumpenko” and memes quickly spread showing Ukrainian iconography on her clothing.

Prof Jellison added that Melania was often underestimated in public because of her heavily accented English.

“It wouldn't surprise me that she does have some differing opinions, and might assert those to her husband behind closed doors and might have an influence on his thinking,” she said.

The first lady's office did not respond to a request for comment.

For her part, Mrs Trump told GQ in 2016 that she had plenty of opinions and shared them with her husband.

“Nobody knows and nobody will ever know,” she said about the advice she gives him... “Because that's between me and my husband.”

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            It seems too early, but it's not. Just as Democrats are plotting how to win the next presidential election, Republican candidates are too.
    


            But while Democrats will try to outdo themselves in their opposition to President Donald Trump, Republicans will have to navigate a party that Trump has rebuilt around his own political instincts.
    


            I talked to CNN's Eric Bradner about which Republicans are likely to run for president in 2028 and how they will balance making their own name with paying homage to their current leader, who likes to joke about not leaving office no matter what the Constitution says.
    


            Our conversation, conducted by phone and edited for length, is below.
    


WOLF: Will Trump try to run for a third term despite what's in the Constitution? Because it's something that he's teased, right?
    


BRADNER: There is no constitutional path for him to seek a third term. But that doesn't mean ambitious Republicans who want to be a successor can flout Trump. They can't be seen as at odds with him. They're trying to stand out in their own ways, but they can't be seen as going against Trump and suggesting that he is ineligible for a third term, even though the Constitution makes that crystal clear to be problematic.
    


WOLF: He likes to joke about running, but has also said he will not run. So let's assume, for the moment, that he doesn't try to do something that would violate the Constitution. How do potential Republican candidates plot a campaign for voters while still staying in his good graces?
    


BRADNER: You have to do it carefully. Part of it is, while Trump is still so popular with the Republican base, demonstrating that you are supportive of his agenda. That can look different depending on whether you are the vice president, in the Senate, in a governor's office.
    


            So far, we're seeing ambitious Republicans traveling to some of the early voting primary states and using their speeches to highlight their support for Trump's agenda and looking for ways to cast themselves as the successor to that agenda.
    


            It's made much more difficult by the fact that Vice President JD Vance is obviously positioned as Trump's understudy. But they're looking for ways to show that they are, at least in some ways, ideologically aligned with Trump and are taking substantive actions to support his agenda, while sort of pitching some of their own accomplishments and their own differences in terms of approach. But it's clear that most Republicans that are already hitting the 2028 travel circuit are looking for ways to align themselves.
    


WOLF: The Democrats are trying to change the early primary map and de-emphasize Iowa and maybe even New Hampshire. Is the Republican calendar going to be what it has been in recent decades where we go: Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada. Or is that going to change?
    


BRADNER: It won't be official for a while, but Republicans appear to be on track to keep the same calendar. I talked to Jeff Kaufmann, the longtime Iowa Republican Party chairman, recently, and he said he had already made his case to the White House to keep Iowa's caucuses first, and said they were very receptive. Republicans didn't have the kind of disaster that Democrats had in Iowa in 2020 and have shown no real inclination to shake up their primary…
    


WOLF: But Republicans did have a disaster in 2012 — just ask Rick Santorum.
    


BRADNER: They did. But 2012 at this point will have been 16 years ago, and they have passed on opportunities to change the calendar since then, and there doesn't seem to be any momentum to do so now.
    


WOLF: Who are the Republicans who are flirting with a campaign at the moment and are actively in those states?
    


BRADNER: Even within the last couple of months, we've seen a number of Republicans visiting the early states. Look at Iowa alone. This month, Glenn Youngkin, the Virginia governor, visited Iowa to headline the state Republican Party's annual Clinton dinner.
    


            Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders was there for an event hosted by The Family Leader, a conservative Christian group led by Bob Vander Plaats, a well-known activist there. Recently, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was in Iowa, where he got a little bit of a chilly reception at times because he was making the case for changes to Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill.” And Florida Sen. Rick Scott was there also touting his support for further reductions in spending that the bill included.
    


            He also got a bit of a frosty reception from some of the attendees at the fundraiser that I talked to afterward who really wanted to hear more support for Trump's agenda from him and less about their defenses.
    


WOLF: The most obvious heir to Trump would be Vance. What is the thinking among Republicans? Do they believe the nomination is his to lose, or will he really have to work for it?
    


BRADNER: He clearly starts in the pole position. But I was a little surprised during a recent visit to Iowa how frequently the name of Secretary of State Marco Rubio came up, often in the same breath as JD Vance. Both of them, despite their own very public criticism of Trump in the past, now seem to be viewed as team players; as closely aligned with Trump and with his current administration, obviously, as leading members of it.
    


            There's interest in Rubio in part because he has run for president before, unlike Vance. A lot of people in the early voting states remember Rubio visiting them in 2016, when he finished third in Iowa in what were pretty competitive caucuses. So a lot of these early-state Republican voters have met Rubio before. They've already formed opinions of him.
    


            They like Vance, but they don't know him yet. They haven't had a chance to go through the usual process with him. He obviously starts with an advantage as Trump's legacy, but based on the conversations I've had, it doesn't appear to be a lock. I think a lot of Republican voters are going to want to at least meet and hear from a broader range of candidates.
    


WOLF: That 2016 Iowa race you mentioned, Rubio came in third. Trump came in second. The winner was Sen. Ted Cruz. Is he going to run again? And would he do better this time?
    


BRADNER: He certainly has never stopped acting like someone who wants to be president, right? He has obviously remained in the public eye and has been supportive of Trump, including in that contentious interview with Tucker Carlson, for which Cruz faced a bit of online backlash.
    


            He's built a fundraising network. He is someone who has clearly already been a runner-up in that 2016 primary, and probably would enter 2028 with vast name recognition. So he has a number of potential things going for him if he, if he does want to run.
    


WOLF: The party has changed around Trump, who doesn't really have a political ideology so much as political instincts. Now Republican candidates will have to adjust to Trump's populism. Will a person like Sen. Josh Hawley, who sounds very populist, do better than a more traditional Republican like, say, Youngkin?
    


BRADNER: It certainly seems like that lane could be open, although I would say as of right now, Vance probably starts in the pole position there. He has populist instincts that he displayed for quite some time before he became Trump's vice president. You're right about Trump having political instincts that these potential candidates are going to have to react to and adjust to on the fly.
    


            Being nimble in interviews and messaging is always important, but it's going to be especially important in a landscape where Trump is the dominant figure in the party. While he won't be on the ballot, he is very likely to have interest in steering things.
    


WOLF: How do you group the potential field? There are senators, there are governors, there are people in the administration.
    


BRADNER: I think that's the right starting point. People in the administration, which you can kind of divide into two groups, right? Vance and Rubio are by far the best known and are the ones that I have heard from Republican voters about the most clearly.
    


            There are some other folks, like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and potentially others who are former governors, are Trump allies and have their own ambitions, but don't carry the sorts of advantages that Vance and Rubio have.
    


            Then there's a group of governors, and to me, this is potentially the most interesting group, because they have their own agendas outside of Washington and are less tied to whatever's going on in the White House or on Capitol Hill on any given day.
    


            Youngkin, the Virginia governor, ran an impressive campaign in 2021, and because Virginia does not allow governors to run for second terms, he is just a few months away from leaving office, which means he will be a popular Republican elected in a Democratic-leaning state who now is out of a job and has all day to campaign.
    


            A couple other Republican governors who are in that basket would include Sanders, who obviously is forever aligned with Trump due to her time as his White House press secretary, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who is chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which gets him a way to build connections with donors all over the country.
    


            Kemp is among the Republicans who have had the biggest differences with Trump on the list of prospective 2028 candidates because he didn't support Trump's claims that Georgia was stolen from him in 2020. But the two of them seem to have played nice in more recent years and Kemp is conservative. He does have his own record in Georgia that he can talk about.
    


            Then finally there are the senators. Tim Scott is one who ran for president in 2024 and did appear to end that race with a closer relationship with Trump than when he started it, which was a really tricky thing to (do).
    


            The problem Scott faces is one that Trump laid out in 2024, which is that he's a better salesman for Trump and his agenda than he is for himself. There are other senators, Rand Paul (Kentucky), Rick Scott (Florida), Josh Hawley (Missouri), Tom Cotton (Arkansas), who I think everyone will be keeping an eye on. But it's going to take some lucky breaks for them to make a ton of headway in a potentially crowded field, especially when they'll be having to spend so much of their time participating in and reacting to what's happening in Washington. They don't have the kind of freedom that governors have at this stage.
    


WOLF: There are also two governors that are closely aligned with Trump's policies in Texas and Florida, which are the two biggest red states in terms of electoral votes. What about Ron DeSantis (Florida) and Greg Abbott (Texas)?
    


BRADNER: Both are clearly aligning themselves with Trump's most popular policies, which is strict immigration enforcement, border security and ramping up deportations. For DeSantis, building “Alligator Alcatraz” was a clear example of political maneuvering to be seen publicly as having Trump's back. Both of them are absolutely on the 2028 landscape, and DeSantis, in particular, appears to have smoothed over the tensions that remain from his 2024 run. DeSantis is one to watch because he has already built a fundraising network. He has already traveled the early states and made those inroads, so launching a presidential campaign, perhaps earlier and perhaps without some of the mistakes that hampered his 2024 effort, would certainly be possible.
    


WOLF: What about someone from Trump's new coalition? Robert F. Kennedy ran as a Democrat and an Independent in 2024; why not a Republican in 2028?
    


BRADNER: If Kennedy runs in 2028, it'll be a fascinating test of how durable parts of Trump's winning 2024 coalition are once Trump is off the ballot.
    


            How big is the so-called MAHA movement that was merged into Trump's MAGA movement? Does party loyalty still matter at all in Republican primaries and caucuses? Or are figures who weren't even Republicans — like Kennedy and potentially former Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's director of national intelligence, who grabbed headlines recently with wild accusations that former President Barack Obama committed treason — received with open arms? Have cultural issues like abortion, where they've long staked out positions at odds with the GOP base, lost some sway?
    


WOLF: Vance would run from within the administration. Rubio would have to leave the administration. Extricating yourself from Trump's orbit without drawing his ire would be kind of an incredible feat. What would be the timeline to do something like that? When should we start to expect to see would-be presidential candidates leave the Trump administration?
    


BRADNER: The traditional answer would be shortly after the midterms, but it also depends on, obviously, the point you raised about Trump and a third term, and whether that sort of freezes the start of the 2028 primary and stops candidates from campaigning openly. It depends on what Vance does. I think people who are in the administration will have to react to the speed at which the field appears to be developing. I can tell you that in the early states, party leaders, activists, donors, party faithful are already eager to hear from these 2028 prospects and I doubt there will be much room to wait long past the midterms.
    


             So potentially late 2026, early 2027 is when anybody in the administration that wants to run for president would probably need to be in motion.
    


WOLF: A lot of what happens will depend on how popular Trump remains with Republicans and how successful his second term is. Is there a lane for a Nikki Haley or somebody who has been critical of Trump, or should we assume that everybody who tries to run will just be swearing fealty to him?
    


BRADNER: Only time will tell. Right now, none of these major Republican figures are publicly distancing themselves from Trump, but if Republicans are shellacked in the midterms, if they lose the House or — much, much longer shot — if they lose the Senate, that could change the landscape significantly.
    


            Primary voters want to win, and they're loyal to Trump, but if his popularity nosedives; if the party performs poorly in the midterms; if his tariffs wind up damaging the economy; if the roiling controversy over his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files continues — all these sorts of things could wind up becoming political time bombs that could change the landscape and lead Republicans, even if they aren't publicly criticizing Trump, to do more to show their differences and to pitch themselves as their own person.

            A driver was killed and a passenger in his car injured after hitting a moose near the entrance to Alaska's Denali National Park and Preserve.
    


            The vehicle's collision with the moose occurred around 1 a.m. Friday, just south of the entrance to the Denali Park Road near Mile 235 of the George Parks Highway, also referred to as the Parks Highway, the park said in a statement.
    


            The 24-year-old male driver, who was from Bulgaria, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 24-year-old female passenger, who is from North Macedonia, was taken to a Fairbanks hospital.
    


            The National Park Service is investigating the incident and working with the Bulgarian Embassy to notify the driver's family.
    


            “The collision serves as a sobering reminder of the hazards of wildlife along Alaska's roadways,” the park said. “Moose, caribou, and other large animals are often active at dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours, and can be difficult to see.”
    


            The park urged drivers to slow down in dark conditions and use high-beam headlights.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Thomas Engels is the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration at the US Department of Health and Human Services.



            Organ donation can be a profound last gift of life. I think about the future my grandson will inherit, especially when it comes to something as urgent and deeply personal as organ donation or transplant. If he or someone he loves needs an organ transplant, I want him to know the system is safe, fair and worthy of his trust.
    


            Sadly, our US Department of Health and Human Services investigation of the organ transplant system has revealed everyone's worst nightmare: a systemic disregard for the sanctity of life. We found numerous cases of medical providers starting the organ donation process on living patients. In response, we have threatened to shut down a large organ procurement organization unless it implements our corrective action requirements. We have also imposed strict reporting protocols for the organ transplant system and required that families and hospitals receive clear, complete information about the donation process.
    


            How did the organ transplant system fail to protect some of our most vulnerable Americans? It operated behind closed doors for decades, dominated by a single private contractor. Too many patients waited for answers that never came, and families whose loved ones' organs were pursued while still alive were left with nowhere to turn when such atrocities occurred. Only a sick system prioritizes profit over patients.
    


            That ended thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
    


            At the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), we are undertaking a sweeping overhaul of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the entity legally responsible for managing the organ waitlist and allocation nationwide. Our reforms are rooted in two fundamental truths: Patient safety is not optional, and every life is sacred.
    


            For far too long, patients, hospital staff or grieving families were forced to report serious safety concerns and misconduct to the very contractor managing the system. This left families unheard, frustrated or even silenced. That era is over.
    


            Now, under our new reforms, those concerns can come directly to the regulator HRSA. We brought federal oversight into the heart of the process, making it clear there will be no compromise on safety and accountability.
    


            We've also proposed new data requirements for organ procurement organizations (OPOs), requiring full documentation of every step in the donation process, from contact with hospitals to interactions with donor families. These reforms aren't just about performance tracking. They're about restoring safety and dignity to a system that lost sight of both.
    


            And when horrifying failures come to light, like the shocking case in Kentucky in which organ procurement was nearly performed on a patient who showed signs of life, we act immediately. For the first time, HRSA issued a corrective action plan to an OPO, and we will not hesitate to do it again. No American should ever have to wonder whether their life will be treated with reverence at the hospital.
    


A man was wheeled into surgery to harvest his organs. Weeks later, he left the hospital alive



            The systemic failures weren't just operational — they were structural. For nearly 40 years, OPTN was governed by a single private entity: the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). We ended a monopoly that suppressed innovation, enabled conflicts of interest and delayed reform.
    


            HRSA conducted a historic national election to establish an independent OPTN Board of Directors. This new board includes transplant surgeons, living donors, organ recipients and advocates, bringing a range of expertise and experience to the forefront of reform.
    


            We are also modernizing the transplant system by expanding the pool of best-in-class vendors to expand the capacity and performance of the system. With bipartisan support, HRSA now has the authority to directly collect OPTN registration fees from transplant hospitals, helping sustain long-term reforms and reduce reliance on any single contractor.
    


            Our work is informed by conversations with transplant surgeons, patients, donor families, advocates and hospital staff. These voices have made one thing abundantly clear: Change cannot wait.
    


            Secretary Kennedy has demanded accountability across HHS, and President Trump has shown unwavering commitment to ending complacency in systems that cost lives. The old system operated behind closed doors. We opened them up.
    


            We are building a system that is ethical, transparent and centered on the sacred sanctity of life. There is more work to do, but we are making progress quickly, just like the rest of the Trump administration. We will not rest until every registered organ donor, patient and family have confidence in our nation's transplant system. Because that's what Americans deserve and what every life demands.

            European countries hoping to mirror Italy's controversial practice of sending some asylum seekers rescued at sea to overseas deportation centers have been dealt a setback by Europe's top court.
    


            On Friday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that while Italy could still utilize the centers it runs in the Albanian cities of Shengiin and Gjader, who can be sent there must be more closely examined to ensure that asylum seekers aren't being sent back to dangerous situations in their home countries.
    


            The court said that a country of origin can only be considered “safe” after it has been “subject to effective judicial review,” and that a country must be demonstrably safe for all its population, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.
    


            The ECJ ruling will almost certainly impact new EU asylum regulations, which are set to take effect next June and are designed to allow member states to create their own “safe” country lists to expedite and outsource the asylum process.
    


            The EU's own list, meant to be a guide, includes Bangladesh, Columbia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia, despite human rights campaigners warning that those countries aren't safe for all who live there.
    


            “The proposed EU list of ‘safe countries of origin' deems certain countries, from which 20% or fewer applicants are granted international protection in the EU, to be safe,” Amnesty International said in a July statement. “However, the fact that up to 20% of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all,” it added.
    


            The ECJ ruling – which was based on two Bangladeshi asylum seekers who were detained in Albania but argued returning to Bangladesh was unsafe – comes as several European countries have expressed interest in developing their own deportation schemes like the Italian-Albanian partnership.
    


            While that partnership, a multi-million-euro investment of detention centers and “return hubs” in a non-EU country, has been viewed by some countries as a potential blueprint for success, a recent study by the University of Bari found that the Italian scheme has, so far, cost the country more than €74.2 million (approximately $86 million).
    


            The study called the scheme “the most costly, inhumane, and useless instrument in the history of Italian migration policies.”
    


            Still, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and then European Council president Charles Michel lauded Italy's 2023 landmark agreement, and in May 2024, the EU established a set of reforms designed to streamline Europe's approach to managing migration and asylum, particularly around migrants from so-called “safe” countries.
    


            Calling it “fair but firm,” the pact lays out wide-ranging reforms designed to ease the burden on countries that have historically taken the most asylum-seekers among the EU's 27 member states.
    


            Whether this ECJ ruling will dissuade the development of the detentions hubs remains to be seen.
    


            Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the court's decision as short sighted, saying that it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and protect national borders.”
    


            “This is a development that should concern everyone – including the political forces rejoicing today over the ruling – because it further reduces the already limited scope for governments and parliaments to regulate and administer migration,” she said.
    


            Meanwhile, in Italy's detention centers in Albania, the lives of nearly a dozen people from countries deemed safe, including Egypt and Bangladesh, hang in the balance.

NTSB says aviation is safe as information comes out on Army chopper fatal midair crash with plane

Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. 

The biggest revelations: The helicopter's altimeter gauge was broken, and controllers warned the FAA years earlier about the dangers that helicopters presented.

At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. 

“Are you kidding me? Sixty-seven people are dead! How do you explain that? Our bureaucratic process?” she said. “Fix it. Do better.”

Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area.

Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying:

The helicopter was flying at 278 feet (85 meters) — well above the 200-foot (61-meter) ceiling on that route — when it collided with the airliner. But investigators said the pilots might not have realized that because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.

The NTSB subsequently found similar discrepancies in the altimeters of three other helicopters from the same unit.

An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions.

Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off.

But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling.

Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB's final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash.

“I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. 

Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan.

“The fact that we have less than 500-foot separation is a concern for me,” said Scott Rosengren, chief engineer in the office that manages the Army's utility helicopters.

Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan's secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights.

Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)



Frank McIntosh, the head of the FAA's air traffic control organization, said he thinks controllers at Reagan “were really dependent upon the use of visual separation” to keep traffic moving through the busy airspace. The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation.

On the night of the crash, a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. Testimony at the hearing raised serious questions about how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.

The controller acknowledged in an interview that the plane's pilots were never warned when the helicopter was on a collision path, but controllers did not think telling the plane would have made a difference at that point. The plane was descending to land and tried to pull up at the last second after getting a warning in the cockpit, but it was too late.

An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. These events have been trending in the wrong direction and increasing year over year.”

Separately, a different group at the airport discussed moving the helicopter route, but those discussions did not go anywhere. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns.

The NTSB has also said the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan in the three years before the collision, 

NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said “every sign was there that there was a safety risk and the tower was telling you that.” But after the accident, the FAA transferred managers out of the airport instead of acknowledging that they had been warned.

“What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.'”

Kamala Harris and Stephen Colbert discuss what they claim is a ""broken"" political system on ""The Late Show.""

Former Vice President Kamala Harris is back in the national spotlight with her forthcoming book about her short-lived 2024 White House campaign, and she is generating a buzz about whether she'll try again in 2028.

While politicos are keenly watching Harris for her next moves, she's also being eyed by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., who is investigating whether top Biden administration officials covered up evidence of a mental decline in former President Joe Biden.

Comer all but guaranteed his committee would be contacting Harris during an appearance on ""The Ingraham Angle"" last week. He joined Fox News Channel just after Harris announced she would not be running for governor of California, as some have speculated, and will instead embark on a listening tour to hear from Americans and try to boost fellow Democrats across the country. 

""I think that that's another great thing about Kamala Harris not running for governor – she's gonna have more time to come before the House Oversight Committee and testify about Joe Biden's cognitive decline,"" Comer said. ""So I think that the odds of Kamala Harris getting a subpoena are very high.""

COMER DISMISSES BIDEN DOCTOR'S BID FOR PAUSE IN COVER-UP PROBE: 'THROWING OUT EVERY EXCUSE'

During a recent appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Harris distanced herself from any immediate electoral ambitions. She emphasized she wanted to hear from all voters, however, not necessarily ruling out a future presidential run.

""I believe, and I always believed, that as fragile as our democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most fundamental principles. And I think right now that, they're not as strong as they need to be,"" Harris said.

""And I just don't want to for now, I don't want to go back in the system. I want to, I want to travel the country. I want to listen to people. I want to talk with people. And I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote.""

RON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE

Jonathan Turley, a Fox News contributor and professor at George Washington University Law School, told Fox News Digital the optics of a congressional subpoena would be less than ideal for a potential 2028 candidate.

""This is a tough question for Harris, who clearly has aspirations to run again,"" Turley said when asked if he would advise Harris to appear. ""The committee can compel her to appear. However, the optics of forcing a subpoena are not exactly optimal for someone who wants to run again for this office.""

He added, however, that Harris would be a ""natural"" target for Comer's probe.

""Harris held a unique spot within the inner circle of the White House,"" Turley said.

But both he and former House Oversight Committee ChairTrey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News Channel host, were doubtful that bringing Harris in would yield much new information.

""Is it worth investigating? Absolutely. Is it worth getting her take on it? Yeah. Is she going to cooperate? No,"" Gowdy told Fox News Digital. 

The former South Carolina congressman, who also served as a federal prosecutor, predicted that Harris' lawyers would seek to bury any potential appearance in a quagmire of legal proceedings stemming from executive and/or presidential privilege claims.

""That privilege has been invoked by both parties repeatedly during congressional investigations,"" Gowdy said.

""Leaving the names out of it, just for the sake of an analogy, I can't think of an advisor that would be closer to a president than his or her vice president. So, by the time you're litigating the issue of whether or not you can compel a vice president to talk about conversations that he or she had with a chief of staff, with a spouse, with the president, with the president's physician – you'll be as old as I am by the time that's litigated.""

Turley said House investigators would have to be armed with ""specific"" questions to avoid someone like Harris being able to answer with ""a matter of opinion.""

Gowdy agreed Harris was a ""legitimate"" witness to bring in and that the issue of Biden's autopen use, particularly for pardons, ""warrants further scrutiny.""

He warned, however, that a potent subpoena comes with consequences for noncompliance.

""Prosecutors can send cops and have [people] brought in. Congress can't do that. Judges can send the marshals or the sheriff's deputies out to bring a witness in if the witness is recalcitrant. Congress can't do that,"" Gowdy said. ""So your power is only as good as what you can do to enforce it.""

A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on Comer's subpoena threat when reached by Fox News Digital.

Spokespeople for Harris and House Oversight Committee Democrats did not return requests for comment.

Fred Fleitz says Trump could break up the alliance between Russian President Putin and Chinese President Xi.

President Donald Trump said on the campaign trail he wanted to ""un-unite"" the alliance between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.

But the immensely complex geopolitical dynamic has prompted questions about whether Trump can pull a ""reverse Kissinger"" and prompt a modern-day version of the Sino-Soviet split.

""I think there's many ways this alliance could be fractured,"" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president's first term, told Fox News Digital.

TRUMP ISSUES FIRM 10-DAY DEADLINE TO PUTIN TO END WAR

Fleitz pointed to the recent talks between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm and said that pushing China to stop purchasing Russian oil or face tariffs was one route that could be effective in trying to drive a wedge. 

But Chinese officials have doubled down in their support for Moscow, and in a July meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wany Yi and EU diplomatic chief Kaja Kallas, Fox News Digital confirmed that the Chinese official made clear it is not in China's interest to see Russia lose the war.

The Chinese embassy did not respond to Fox News Digital's questions regarding what Beijing would consider a ""loss"" for Russia or why it is in China's interest to see Russia win in its illegal invasion of Ukraine.

But reports have suggested that China fears Russia losing the war or, at minimum, a cessation of hostilities would free up the U.S. and its allies to focus more heavily on China. 

Fleitz argued the core strategy in breaking up the Putin-Xi alliance, which the two have publicly vowed is rock solid, should not focus on attempting to push China away from Russia. 

""The Russians and Chinese do not like each other,"" Fleitz argued, pointing to a 2023 move by China's Ministry of Natural Resources when it called for historical Chinese names to be included next to the current Russian names on maps depicting its eastern border areas. ""The Chinese actually have changed their maps in the Far East to add Chinese names to Russian cities because someday, I think, China is giving the message they're going to take back Russian territories in the Far East. 

""We need to make this point to Putin. He has a far better future for Russia, reintegrating into the West and Europe as a state in good standing rather than falling into the arms of the Chinese, who do not have the best interests of Russia at heart,"" Fleitz, who serves as vice chair of the America First Policy Institute's Center for American Security, said.

EU DEFENSE CHIEF WARNS OF 'MOST DANGEROUS MOMENT' – COORDINATED RUSSIAN-CHINESE AGGRESSION BY 2027

The theory that cozying up to Putin could be the ticket in breaking up his alliance with Xi has been dubbed the ""reverse Kissinger"" in a nod to Henry Kissinger who, starting in 1972 alongside President Richard Nixon, improved relations with China in a move to further isolate the USSR.

Trump, to some extent, has already tried this approach, as witnessed by his insistence that diplomacy was the best way forward with Putin, his initial reproach of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as ""ungrateful"" and his apparent understanding of why Putin invaded Ukraine when it came to supposed threats posed by NATO. 

Putin's war aims have thus far been undeterred and China, which for years took a publicly neutral position when it came to the war in Ukraine, has increasingly voiced its support of Russia despite Western pressure. 

But Fleitz argued this strategy will take time.

""It's going to be hard,"" he said. ""But, first of all, our policy with Russia started off in a bad situation for Trump.

""There was no dialog between Putin and Biden after Russia invaded Ukraine,"" Fleitz added, noting that despite surface-level commentary, strife between Russia and China is brewing.

Reports in June leaked by the Russian intelligence agency known as the FSB apparently showed that Moscow has dubbed Beijing ""the enemy"" and is aware of its efforts to gain access to top military technologies by recruiting Russian spies, often disillusioned Russian scientists.

While reporting has suggested that Russia views China as a strategic partner to counter the West, Beijing is known for playing the long game, and Moscow's dependence on the Chinese Communist Party as one of its few allies could prove a future vulnerability for it. 

""There are press articles coming out lately about how China is spying on Russia and taking advantage of this relationship to advance Chinese security,"" Fleitz said. ""We need to make this point to the Russians at every opportunity — the Chinese are not your friend. 

""You need to make a deal with Donald Trump.""

'Outnumbered' discusses President Donald Trump's Supreme Court victory allowing him to massively reduce the size of the Department of Education. 

Three years after leaving a sleepy Seattle suburb to run the school district in Fairfax County, Va., outside the nation's capital, Michelle Reid earns more money than the U.S. president and gets a car allowance. Now she wants a taxpayer-funded personal bodyguard.

In new job posting No. 25212BR on BrassRing, an online recruitment platform, the Fairfax County public schools superintendent is advertising for an ""Executive Protection Agent,"" based at the school district's C-suite headquarters on Gatehouse Road in Falls Church, Va. The deadline for applicants is Aug. 5.

The new job would earn between $84,552 to $143,880, according to the FCPS pay scale for a ""Unified Scale-Schedule B/Grade 006"" job, paying far more than the starting salary of about $58,000 that a new teacher gets in the school district.

""The Executive Protection Agent is responsible for ensuring the personal safety, security and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences,"" the job description reads.

The new position comes at a time when public school officials, like Reid, are facing heightened accountability in the post-COVID era over curriculum, contracts, budgets and ""diversity, equity and inclusion"" policies. In 2021, the Biden administration targeted parents for charges of alleged ""domestic terrorism"" for raising concerns at school board meetings, but new email records have revealed the allegations were overblown and politicized.

Since taking over on July 1, 2022, Reid has come under fire for allegedly covering up scandals over improprieties in football recruiting, the withholding of National Merit awards from students and, most recently, defying Department of Education orders regarding Title IX protections for girls in sports and schools. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights just announced that Fairfax County Public Schools and four other northern Virginia school districts, including Loudoun County Public Schools, violated TItle IX protections by discriminating against students on the basis of sex.

Last November, the all-Democratic school board voted unanimously to renew Reid's four-year contract and increased her annual salary to $424,146 from $380,000, more than the salary of New York City's education chancellor. Board members also gave her a $12,000 annual car allowance. In contrast, the U.S. president earns $400,000 annually.

Over her tenure, Reid has been notoriously suspect of leaks, which occurred this week with frustrated school district personnel anonymously raising the alarm bell over the new bodyguard position. The job description notes three times that applicants must demonstrate ""discretion,"" noting in one mention that applicants ""must demonstrate a high level of discretion and maintain strict confidentiality in all aspects of the role.""

The hiring of a personal bodyguard for a school superintendent is unusual, say experts. The 12th-largest school district in the U.S., Fairfax County Public Schools includes 180,714 students in 223 schools, according to the U.S. Education Department's National Center for Education Services. 

Meanwhile, the third-largest school district in the country, Chicago Public Schools, is about double the size as Fairfax County Public Schools, serving 322,809 students in 643 schools, according to the latest data, and its superintendent, also called its chief executive officer, doesn't have a personal bodyguard. 

School district spokeswoman Mary Ann Ferguson said, ""Chicago Public Schools does not employ a personal bodyguard position for our superintendent/CEO.""

Talk of the new job has angered local parents and school district staffers.

""Queen Reid demands all the luxuries suitable to her station. It's all 'equity for thee, but not for me,'"" said Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, a local mother who has challenged Reid on numerous district policies.

""They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent,"" and that ""is not a normal or customary position."" - Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services

Unlike a teacher, the new bodyguard job doesn't require a bachelor's degree, but rather any ""combination of education and experience equivalent to a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, security management, or a related field.""

In the ad, Reid stipulates the job demands ""exceptional flexibility,"" with an ""unpredictable"" schedule, ""driven by the superintendent's daily activities and security needs.""

The ad notes: ""Must be available for irregular hours, including early mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays, travel, and extended on-call duty.""

The job requires ""knowledge of protective intelligence, behavioral analysis, and threat mitigation strategies,"" not to mention ""skill in surveillance detection, open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, and incident reporting.""

Reid has a few other requirements that frame the job as a clear bodyguard detail: ""Ability to remain calm and make sound decisions under pressure, especially in sensitive or high-risk situations."" 

Reid seeks an applicant with ""experience in threat assessment and protective intelligence, a ""focus on conducting investigations and executive protection"" and ""completion of executive protection training.""

Steven Brasley, media outreach specialist in the district's Office of Communications, insisted nothing was out of the ordinary.

""Fairfax County Public Schools has long provided a security presence for the superintendent at public‑facing events, as part of the broader safety framework implemented by the Office of Safety and Security,"" Brasley said.

The Office of Human Resources, led by William Solomon, and Chief of Safety and Security Brian Lambert, recently ""collaborated"" on a ""new Executive Protection Agent position description,"" Brasley added.

Brasley said the role ""formalizes responsibility for executive protection — including personal security for the superintendent during various activities — while also supporting a wider array of responsibilities within the Office of Safety and Security that support the entire school division.""

The school district's official explanation didn't include any reference to specific threats Reid faces.

Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, based in Cleveland, Ohio, said, ""They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent,"" and that ""is not a normal or customary position.""

He noted, ""The job description is one of the shortest I have ever seen for any school security department job,"" adding the job boils down to a ""one-liner,"" looking for ""executive protection"" at work, public events, travel and ""private residences.""

Trump said, ""It does not reference other duties which one would expect if, indeed, the job extends to other tasks. There is not even the typical ‘and other duties as assigned' on the posted job description, which could encompass other tasks beyond the executive protection of the superintendent.""

Brasley said the new job ""is designed to bolster FCPS's work,"" ""identifying, assessing and mitigating risks of targeted violence against students, staff and schools.""

There is no mention of ""students, staff and schools"" in the job description.

Brasley said that protection of the superintendent is ""a component"" of the role,"" but the role ""participates in larger security and investigative initiatives across the district, such as the ongoing implementation of a new emergency response system and weapons screening.""

There is also no mention of a ""new emergency response system or weapons screening"" in the job posting.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the Senate's progress on confirming President Donald Trump's nominees after the delay of August recess.

Hours of tense negotiations to strike a deal on President Donald Trump's nominees blew up Saturday night, and now lawmakers are headed home.

Senate Republicans and Democrats were quick to point the finger at one another for the deal's demise, but it was ultimately Trump who nuked the talks.

In a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of ""demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees.""

""This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,"" Trump said. ""Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!""

""Do not accept the offer,"" he continued. ""Go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!""

DEMS DIG IN, TRUMP DEMANDS ALL: NOMINEE FIGHT BOILS OVER IN SENATE AS GOP LOOKS FOR A DEAL

Instead of finding a pathway to vote on as many as 60 of the president's nominees, all of which moved through committee with bipartisan support, lawmakers rapid-fire voted on seven before leaving Washington until September.

But Schumer treated Trump's move as a victory for Senate Democrats. He countered that it was the president who gave up on negotiations while he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., worked to find a bipartisan solution, ""provided the White House and Senate Republicans met our demands.""

""He took his ball, he went home, leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering what the hell happened,"" Schumer said, standing next to a poster-sized version of the president's post. 

""Trump's all-caps Tweet said it all,"" he continued. ""In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating.""

But prior to the president's edict, both sides of the aisle believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough to both meet Trump's desire to see his nominees confirmed and leave Washington.

Thune said that there were ""lots of offers"" made between him and Schumer over the course of negotiations.

""There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end,"" he said.

Senate Democrats wanted the White House to unfreeze billions in National Institute of Health and foreign aid funding, in addition to a future agreement that no more clawback packages would come from the White House.

In exchange, they would greenlight several of Trump's non-controversial nominees.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., accused Schumer of going ""too far"" by upping the price tag on his demands.

""We've had three different deals since last night,"" he said. ""And every time it's been, every time it's ‘I want more,'"" Mullin said of Schumer's demands.

He said that Republicans weren't caught off guard by Trump's call to halt talks, and noted that the White House had been heavily involved in negotiations.

""You get to a realization that there was, it was never about making a deal,"" he continued. ""They want to go out and say the President's being unrealistic, and because he can't answer to his base to make a deal like we have in every other president in history.""

Now, Republicans won't pursue recess appointments, but Mullin noted that moving ahead with a rule change to the confirmation process when lawmakers return in September was going to happen in response.

""The asks evolved on both sides quite a bit over time,"" Thune said. ""But in the end, we never got to a place where we had both sides agree to lock it in.""

Senate Democrats, on the other hand, countered that their offer never changed, and that Republicans kept increasing the number of nominees they wanted across the line, and attempted to include more controversial, partisan picks.

Schumer wouldn't reveal the details of his demands, but charged that any changes to Senate rules would be a ""huge mistake,"" and urged Trump to work with Senate Democrats moving forward, particularly as Congress hurtles toward yet another deadline to fund the government in September. 

""They should stop listening to him,"" Schumer said. ""If they want to do what's good for the American people, they shouldn't be in blind obeisance to Donald Trump.""

The Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro as the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia after lawmakers failed to reach a deal to fast-track the rest of President Donald Trump‘s nominees.

On Saturday night, the upper chamber voted 50-45 to confirm Pirro as the top prosecutor in Washington, D.C., a role she was serving in an interim capacity as she awaited Senate confirmation.

The vote marks an end to a whirlwind confirmation process for Pirro — a former Fox News host and district attorney in Westchester County, New York — that saw two votes just to advance her nomination to the floor after one was deemed invalid after Democrats staged a walkout over another nominee.

Her nomination was also held up as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Democrats delayed the confirmation proceedings for Trump's nominees, claiming they deserved more scrutiny.

Senators remained in Washington over the weekend in an attempt to strike a deal that would have quickly confirmed the rest of Trump's nominees, but progress stalled on Saturday and they opted to head home for a delayed August recess.

Pirro's nomination, along with a few others, were voted on Saturday evening as senators departed the capital.

Trump, while fuming at Schumer over his blockade, seemingly greenlit the senators' departure from Washington for the month in a slew of Truth Social posts earlier Saturday.

“Go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump posted.

They will not return again from recess until early September, when they will reportedly look to implement more aggressive rule changes to get the civilian nominees confirmed.

Despite her legal background and her vocal support of Trump, Pirro was not the president's first choice for the next U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Timberlake Lyme disease diagnosis highlights growing public health threat","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/3488955/justin-timberlake-lyme-disease-diagnosis-public-health-threat/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Pop singer Justin Timberlake announced that he has been struggling with Lyme disease, bringing attention to a growing public health threat. 

Timberlake, 44, said in an Instagram post Thursday that he was “shocked for sure” by his diagnosis after he had been “battling some health issues” and feeling unwell during his Forget Tomorrow World Tour.

The singer said confirming the diagnosis at least helped him “understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.”

Lyme disease, spread by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common type of tick-borne illness worldwide. U.S. cases have rapidly increased in recent years, mostly in the New England and mid-Atlantic states.

Symptoms usually start within 3 to 30 days of a tick bite, with a rash developing in about 80% of patients. Other early symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes, making it difficult to distinguish from other illnesses.

However, without rapid antibiotic treatment, symptoms can rapidly progress to muscle weakness and paralysis, irregular heartbeats, arthritis and joint pain, and in rare cases, brain swelling or encephalitis.

Awareness of the rising prevalence of Lyme disease has been growing over the past several years, but the number of cases has been steadily increasing in the United States since the 1990s.

In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just shy of 16,500 cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. By 2023, cases had shot up to nearly 89,500 nationwide.

The CDC classifies states along the Eastern Seaboard, from Maine to Virginia, as high-incidence areas. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota are also higher-risk states.

In 2023, more than 22,000 individual cases of Lyme disease were identified in New York, followed by more than 16,600 in Pennsylvania and nearly 10,000 in Massachusetts.

Seniors over age 60 are at the highest risk of contracting Lyme disease, followed by children between the ages of 5 and 14.

But it's not just a U.S. problem; cases are rising across Europe as well. A 2019 study estimated that over 1,000,000 people worldwide are affected by Lyme disease each year, with roughly a quarter of cases occurring in Europe.

While greater awareness of the disease among doctors and the general public has contributed somewhat to the rising number of Lyme disease cases, climate change also plays a significant role because it has created conducive conditions for a rising tick population.

A 2024 report from the Environmental Protection Agency found that rising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere have given ticks more habitats and improved breeding conditions.

“Warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitats and are, therefore, one of the multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease,” the EPA said.

Richard Marconi, a tick-borne disease researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, told the Washington Examiner that the tick population has been rising for several decades in North America and Europe because winters are getting milder.

“Specifically, if we're not having truly hard-freeze winters with multiple days of a very hard freeze, the tick population manages to survive pretty well. And as a result, in the spring, when the adult ticks lay eggs, those eggs are able to hatch,” Marconi said.

Marconi said climate change has resulted in trees producing more acorns and nuts, which mice and other small rodents feed on. When there are more rodents, ticks have more hosts, also called reservoirs, to infect and continue spreading the bacteria.

Marconi, who has been studying Lyme disease since the early 1990s, has been on the front lines of developing a human vaccine for the disease. His laboratory and research led to a veterinary vaccine for Lyme disease used to protect dogs called Vanguard CR Lyme.

There is no currently approved vaccine to treat humans with Lyme disease in the U.S., but Pfizer is in the midst of stage 3 clinical trials, the last stage before a drug can come to market.

The Pfizer product is a four-dose vaccine: three shots in the first year and then a fourth 14 months after the original dose.

The VCU team is working on a competing vaccine that will provide effective immunity without as many booster shots. However, development has been challenging because of the unique microbiology of the Lyme disease-causing bacteria.

Marconi predicted that Pfizer's Lyme disease vaccine will likely be on the market by 2027, but he said he's concerned that the vaccine skepticism of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others in the Trump administration could delay vaccine development.

“Vaccines are the most cost-effective way to deal with infectious diseases,” said Marconi, adding, “It's really a really unfortunate situation that there is this anti-vaccination movement occurring both in the government as well as in the public.”

Timberlake wrote in his Instagram announcement that we need “to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.” 

The pop singer had to make several cancellations or postponements during his tour, each time citing injury or illness. Timberlake postponed a show in New Jersey by one week and canceled two performances in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Columbus, Ohio.

Hosts of other celebrities disclosed Lyme disease diagnoses in recent years, including Ben Stiller, Shania Twain, Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, and Amy Schumer.

Marconi said celebrities bringing attention to the disease is good, but the most important thing is to be informed about whether you live in a high-risk area.

“Until vaccination is firmly in place, it's really important for people to be aware of the risks that are around them,” he said.

Once you know if you live in a high-risk area, you can take several steps to prevent tick bites and take action quickly if they occur.

Experts recommend so-called “tick checks,” which involve thoroughly examining your body after spending time outside.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) mocked President Donald Trump after he held up most of the president's remaining nominees for at least another month.

Senators remained in Washington, D.C., over the weekend as Republicans looked to confirm the rest of Trump's civilian nominees. Democrats sought to delay the confirmations, with Schumer asking for funding withheld from the White House in exchange for the fast-tracking of the nominations. After Trump signaled that was a nonstarter and accused Schumer of “political extortion,” senators departed the capital for their August recess without a deal and with only a few more nominees confirmed.

Now, Schumer is seemingly taking a victory lap after blocking the nominees' confirmation and stoking Trump's ire, reposting Trump's Truth Social post that deplored his tactics with the caption “The Art of the Deal,” referencing the president's 1987 book of the same name.

In a separate post, Schumer laid out his justification for blocking the nominees, who he claimed were “historically unqualified.”

“Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. But Senate Democrats wouldn't let him,” the top Senate Democrat said.

Senate Republicans sought to counter that claim on Saturday, with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) arguing the nominees were “noncontroversial” and accusing the Democrats of playing “partisan games.” Others posted a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term, which they said is “unprecedented.”

That statistic is set to remain unchanged until at least early September, when the Senate is back in session. Republican senators will reportedly eye rules changes then to cut down the time needed to confirm Trump's picks.

Senate Republicans managed to push through a few more nominees before departing, most notably Jeanine Pirro as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.

But Schumer is celebrating his resistance against Trump, taunting the president by saying he “threw in the towel, sent Republicans home and was unable to do the basic art of negotiating.”

TRUMP ACCUSES SCHUMER OF ‘POLITICAL EXTORTION' AMID NOMINATIONS BLOCKADE

“He caved and got nothing,” Schumer added.

Schumer's resistance follows him previously caving on a separate battle with Republicans back in March over a potential government shutdown. After he helped advance a House-passed stopgap measure to fund the government, Schumer faced intense backlash from within his own party, leading to primary threats and calls for new leadership.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump directed his ire at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Saturday as Democrats continue to delay the confirmation of the president's remaining civilian nominees.

Senators have remained in Washington, D.C., over the weekend in order to confirm the rest of Trump's nominees, foregoing part of an August recess to get them over the line. As progress has reportedly not been made on a deal to fast-track the nominations, Trump, who is in New Jersey for the rest of the day, took to Truth Social to call out Schumer for an “egregious and unprecedented” demand that the White House release funding in exchange for the swift confirmations, going so far as to accuse him of “political extortion.”

“Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country. This demand is egregious and unprecedented, and would be embarrassing to the Republican Party if it were accepted. It is political extortion, by any other name,” Trump posted.

The president urged Senate Republicans to reject any deal that involves releasing that funding, telling Schumer to “GO TO HELL!”

“Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” Trump added.

Trump's post follows frustration from Senate Republicans over Schumer's blockade, which they have called “unprecedented” and a “national embarrassment.”

Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Katie Britt (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and others all took to X to blast Schumer's tactics, with some sharing a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term.

The rule: Only mention the good parts of American history.

Don't worry. Although content that INAPPROPRIATELY DISPARAGES AMERICANS PAST OR LIVING or that includes MATTERS UNRELATED TO THE BEAUTY, ABUNDANCE, AND GRANDEUR OF THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE has been targeted for removal at national-park sites, the caliber of park tours has not suffered! Here is a glimpse of the kind of information you can look forward to receiving at each of these historic sites.

Stonewall National Monument: One of the best places to admire the abundant natural beauty of New York City. The taxis, yellow. The skyscrapers, high! The luminous walk signs, with their flashing white gentleman composed of tiny stars, majestic! Here a community rose up in response to a police raid and sparked a revolution. We cannot say which community, but we hope there weren't any LGBTQ people present. It seems unlikely; they did not exist before 1967, which was one of many things that made America Great at that time, and which we are trying our best to replicate today. We've been removing the movement's patrons from the Stonewall website one letter at a time and seeing whether anyone notices.

Manzanar National Historic Site: This well-preserved internment-camp site from World War II is a chilling, gut-wrenching reminder of the stunning natural beauty of our flawless nation!

Mount Rushmore National Memorial: This incomplete statue of some presidents will be a wonderful place to contemplate America's beauty soon, when it is beautified even further by the addition of the best president yet! We don't need to say anything more about this site. Nice, uncontroversial place for some sculptures of white men, we're pretty sure!

Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site: The National Guard liked this high school so much that it decided to sit in on classes here for a time in the 1960s. For some reason, only nine of the students who went here are singled out as heroes, but we think, actually, every student is a hero.

Redwood National and State Parks: These beautiful, large trees are big enough to fend for themselves, and the implication that action is needed on our part to protect them is, frankly, insulting. Trees eat carbon dioxide, you know!!!

Adams National Historic Park: President John Adams presided over the passage of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798! A great thing. Good legacy.

Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail: Some really scenic sights along here. Great place to hear birds. John Lewis marched across a bridge on this route, and some police marched out to meet him. Fun!

Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site: This site was set aside to commemorate a bunch of people who have been removed from Air Force training materials, so we are unsure what they did. As soon as these people are added back to the training materials, we can tell you! Just keep in mind that if it appears that any of the people who participated in United States history weren't white, that is DEI.

Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park: This woman is famous for some reason, but we can't say for sure what that is. Maybe the rare natural splendor of the surroundings of her home. Sometimes she led fellow Americans on long treks on foot, presumably to admire the breathtaking beauty of the environment up close. She did this many times. She must have loved nature!

Gettysburg National Military Park: It appears that lots of brave men fought and died here, but for what reason, we can't exactly say. Not for us to take sides! We'll refer you to President Donald Trump's thoughts: “Gettysburg, what an unbelievable battle that was. It was so much and so interesting and so vicious and horrible and so beautiful in so many different ways; it represented such a big portion of the success of this country. Gettysburg, wow. I go to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to look and to watch. And, uh, the statement of Robert E. Lee, who's no longer in favor, did you ever notice that? No longer in favor. ‘Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill.' They were fighting uphill. He said, ‘Wow, that was a big mistake.' He lost his great general. And they were fighting. ‘Never fight uphill, me boys!' But it was too late.”

This is what happened here, and we hope you have no further questions.

Women's Rights National Historic Park (Seneca Falls): Here a bunch of women got together and asked for something they did not really need! Most important: There's a waterfall nearby.

Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park: Here was born a president who did something that was important to do, and especially at that time. One of the lesser presidents, he came to guide the nation through the Civil War, which was fought over nothing. The Seinfeld of wars.

Trail of Tears National Historic Trail: This scenic route takes you through nine states, starting in Georgia and continuing to Oklahoma! Along this path, you can see a lot of foliage. A fun trail to walk voluntarily.

Reconstruction Era National Historic Park: Things have always been good in this country. Look—a bird. Wow! Check out all the waterfowl around here!

Boston National Historic Park (Freedom Trail): To describe the historic significance of this site would require us to disparage King George III of England. Which we are loath to do! There's no shame in being a king.

President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home: Did you know that Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson were the only two presidents ever to be impeached? Fun fact! 

Statue of Liberty: For years, people have made a big deal about how good she looks as you approach, but imagine how nice she'd look if you were leaving. Please disregard the poem; we are trying to remove it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The American Revolution was won by dramatic deeds, but also by decidedly undramatic efforts.

In August 1775, nothing particularly dramatic was happening among the roughly 14,000 soldiers of the Continental Army besieging the British army in Boston. Indeed, nothing particularly dramatic happened for the next six months. And then, in March 1776, the British suddenly evacuated Boston. Which is why the months of apparent calm deserve a close look.

The semiquincentennial of American independence has begun: The anniversaries of the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill are behind us; the reenactment of Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys' storming Fort Ticonderoga was a smashing success. Other big moments await, culminating, no doubt, in a big party on July 4, 2026. One hopes and expects that there will be plenty of hoopla, because that is the American way.

But 250 years ago today, the real and unspectacular work of American independence was under way. The Continental Army, created in June of 1775, had warily welcomed its new leader, George Washington, without much fuss. A slaveholding Virginia gentleman and loosely religious Anglican was going to lead an army that was mainly made up of New Englanders—including both psalm-singing, Bible-quoting descendants of the Puritans and dissenting freethinkers. For his part, Washington was appalled at what he saw: militia units that elected their own officers and called them by their first names, free Black men carrying weapons, money-grubbing Yankees (as opposed to land-grubbing Virginia gentry), and general squalor. “They are an exceeding dirty and nasty people,” he told his cousin Lund Washington.

Lindsay Chervinsky: The ‘dirty and nasty people' who became Americans

What happened that summer outside Boston was of monumental importance. If this was to be an American army and not just an assembly of colonial militias, then Washington would have to be the first American general, and not just a provincial. He would have to create a system out of chaos, and hold together a force against a dangerous enemy. Although slightly outnumbered and bottled up in Boston, which connected to the mainland by only the narrowest of peninsulas, the British army was tough, cohesive, professional, and eager to avenge its unexpected defeats and Pyrrhic victories.

Washington did the work in many ways—by organizing the army in divisions and brigades, inspecting the troops, regularizing discipline, hammering home the importance of digging latrines, and quarantining soldiers who had smallpox. It helped that he looked the part of a military leader: tall, well turned out, graceful, and the best horseman in the colonies, by most accounts. No less important, he was able to transcend his aversion to those strange New Englanders.

Two men utterly unlike his social set in Virginia quickly became his most trusted subordinates: Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island, a Quaker with a talent for organization, and a tubby Boston bookstore owner, Henry Knox, who became the chief of artillery. The former was eventually made quartermaster of the army and then commander of the southern army, where he displayed a flair for field command. The latter brought 59 heavy-artillery pieces from Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga to the army outside of Boston in the dead of winter, before developing the artillery arm into the equal of its British opponent.

Washington quickly realized that his most talented military leader was a third New Englander, the Connecticut merchant Benedict Arnold, who, until he committed treason, was the best field commander on either side of the conflict. In the autumn of 1775, Washington sent him off on a daring march through the Maine wilderness that very nearly wrested Quebec from British control.

The commander in chief needed a headquarters guard—what we today call a personal security detail—and so in March 1776, the army created a unit known as the life guard. Washington selected men from each army unit, which meant that the life guard's personnel skewed in favor of New Englanders; as its first commander, he chose a Massachusetts man, Caleb Gibbs, who lasted until 1780. He chose southerners, too, for crucial positions, and not all of them gentlemen—Daniel Morgan of Virginia, for example, was a roughneck leader of riflemen who formed an elite corps. The point was clear: This was an American army, and talented men, no matter their background, could win their leader's trust and rise up the ranks.

Washington remains in some ways the most remote of America's national heroes; he is more distant from us than Abraham Lincoln because of his greater austerity and reserve. He mastered his volcanic temper, prudently handled both his subordinates and his superiors, and knew the value of dignity and a certain distance in exercising command. He was brave but not particularly gifted as a tactical leader, and he was prone to devising overly aggressive and complicated plans, but these did not matter as much as the larger leadership qualities that he had brought with him to Boston. Small wonder that many years later, men who were his intellectual superiors—Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams—worked for him. His story shows why character and good judgment are far more important in a leader than mere intelligence.

Despite wonderful writing about Washington in recent books, including Ron Chernow's 2010 biography and the first two volumes of Rick Atkinson's trilogy on the history of the Revolution, Americans do not value him as we once did. The fault lies across the political spectrum. For some (think of the 1619 Project), the fundamental sin of slavery overwhelms every aspect of biography. Washington controlled several hundred enslaved people on his Mount Vernon estate; he often treated them badly, and as of 1775, he felt no shame about that.

Being a plantation owner was part of his identity, but not all of it, and more important: Like some of the other Founders, he became uneasy about reconciling the ideals of the Revolution with the practice of holding men and women as chattel—which is why he manumitted all of his slaves in his will.

At a deeper level, this view of American history cannot help but crush patriotic pride in what remains, in retrospect, an astounding achievement. The Revolution culminated not in despotism but in a new political order based on liberty and self-government, built on ideals that, described with exceptional eloquence by another slaveholder, Jefferson, eventually blew up the evil institution on which their way of life rested.

George Packer: A view of American history that leads to one conclusion

A different form of relentless present-mindedness afflicts the current administration, which seeks to purge national parks and museums of references to the darker sides of American history, beginning with slavery but also including the slaughter and dispossession of American Indians, and various forms of discrimination and persecution thereafter. In everything from signage to artwork, the Trump administration reaches for pabulum and kitsch, a false and unidimensional depiction of the American past.

As for academic historians, although some exemplary ones are at work—including Gordon Wood and David Hackett Fischer—the contemporary trend is to shun great individuals in favor of subaltern history. There is not much place for a commanding general in a pantheon composed of people overlooked by previous generations.

That summer and fall in Cambridge and the other towns surrounding Boston, George Washington's work made a difference. It reminds us that American independence was won by dramatic deeds, to be sure, but also by mastering—slowly and painfully—the undramatic things, such as insisting on rank insignia and saluting, managing gunpowder production, and digging latrines properly. It reminds us that there is such a thing as individual greatness, and that it can make all the difference. And particularly in an age of self-righteous scorn, we would do well to recall how Washington's lifelong struggles with himself—his prejudices, his emotions, his upbringing and background—contributed to final victory. We can still profit by the example.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The US decimated foreign aid budgets. These nations are doubling theirs.

If the world has had enough of helping others, then somebody forgot to tell Spain.

Yes, Spain. The same country that, a little more than a decade ago, desperately accepted billions in bailout money from its European neighbors to keep its economy afloat. That Spain is now doing something almost unthinkable. It's ramping up aid spending just as the United States notoriously retreats. And in the process, Spain is trying to remind the world why we give back in the first place.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) — the world's largest humanitarian aid donor by far, whose work in recent years saved upward of a million lives per year — was officially dismantled earlier this month. Its scattered remains were subsumed by the State Department and its empty headquarters given to the FBI. But America isn't the only one putting itself first these days. The UK, France, Belgium, and Germany all slashed their development budgets this year thanks to a wave of right-wing populism painting foreign aid as an unnecessary expense against the national interest.

The crisis is steep. The pot of money going to global development is set to shrink by 17 percent, or $35 billion, in 2025, on top of a $21 billion drop the year before, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That's a $56 billion funding vacuum where global aid for mosquito nets, vaccine research, and food assistance used to be. And the declines are likely to become even steeper in the years ahead, as cuts in the US take full effect.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

But while President Donald Trump was gutting USAID, Spain made moves to rebuild its aid agency and committed to more than doubling its aid budget by 2030. Nor is it alone: Ireland, South Korea, and Italy also all made recent pledges to boost their foreign aid budgets.

It's far from enough to fill the foreign aid gap, however. And while the pain will fall primarily on impoverished recipient countries, foreign aid doesn't just help the countries that receive it. It helps everyone.

Diseases and conflict don't recognize legal borders and aid helps keep these deadly problems at bay. Every $100 million spent on preventing tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria helps prevent about 2.2 million new infections total. And global cuts are already expected to exacerbate the spread of diseases; former USAID officials anticipate cuts from the US alone could cause 28,000 new cases of infectious diseases like Ebola and Marburg each year. “Even if you're in this isolationist mindset, you can't actually isolate yourself from the rest of the world,” said Rachael Calleja, a research fellow at the Center for Global Development.

The fact that some countries have managed to fight the impulse to isolate — convincing their citizens that problems abroad are interconnected with our problems at home — could help reshape the future of aid for the better. Their decisions point to the possibility of a new future for foreign aid that could be more collaborative and less paternalistic than before.

Aid has long been dominated by a small club of wealthy nations — chief among them the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom — that give the most, and in doing so, set the tone for how to help the rest of the world. Too often these well-intentioned solutions perpetuated the same exploitative power dynamics that made poor countries poor and one-time colonial powers like Spain and Italy rich in the first place. Western aid often comes with strings attached, like forcing Mali to privatize its cotton industry or requiring that funds be spent on consultants and supplies from the donor country — even though such policies have been shown to make aid less effective and much more expensive.

Ready or not, the old club's grip on global influence is now breaking down.

”Nobody who works in development sat around saying, ‘The system is great. We're awesome. Let's just spend more money to do more of the same,'” said Dean Karlan, who was, until recently, the chief economist at USAID. “There is a blank slate. Let's put in place a better system.”

Spain, Ireland, Italy, and South Korea are all increasing aid — but most have a lot of room for growth.

The United Nations set a lofty goal in the 1970s for wealthy countries to give away 0.7 percent of their gross national income (GNI) as development assistance. Half a century later, almost none do.

That includes this year's overachievers. Ireland spent 0.57 percent of its GNI — $2.47 billion — on development aid last year. Spain spent 0.25 percent or $4.35 billion, and Italy, 0.28 percent or $6.67 billion. South Korea spent 0.21 percent or $3.94 billion.

It's not a lot, especially compared to the $63.3 billion the US spent in 2024, although that only added up to 0.22 percent of its GNI. But these countries are moving forward at a time when everyone else seems to be moving backward. According to the global development consultancy SEEK Development's donor tracker, the US is now projected to spend just 0.13 percent of its GNI on overseas aid this year.

There is a growing recognition that someone has to fill the gaps left by the US, but everybody balks at the price tag, Arturo Angulo Urarte, a Madrid-based development expert, said in Spanish. “It's like, ‘Yes, but gosh, and how much does that mean? Oh, it means money? Well, then no.'”

Spain's aid increase, however, has been a long time coming. Spanish activists launched a kind of Occupy Wall Street in favor of overseas aid back in the 1990s. A group of global development workers and grassroots activists staged hunger strikes and protest encampments, chaining themselves to government buildings to demand that Spain give at least 0.7 percent of its GNI to aid. At the time, Spain was giving around 0.24 percent of its GNI to aid, but the protests helped propel the country to double its commitment to a high of nearly 0.5 percent in 2008.

Then the 2008 economic turmoil left Spain once again with a wisp of an foreign aid budget. By the time its economy crawled closer to pre-crisis levels in 2015, its development spending had cratered to 0.12 percent of GNI.

But the idea of Spain becoming a bigger player in global development never really left the public consciousness, remaining broadly popular even during the country's worst financial straits. In 2023 the country passed a law promising to rebuild its aid agency and bump up spending to 0.7 percent of GNI by 2030 — effectively tripling its current rate.

Spain has since increased its aid budget to about 0.25 percent of its GNI, or $4.4 billion last year — roughly $490 million more than it spent the year prior at 0.24 percent of its GNI — and says it will continue to give more in the year ahead. That's more money for climate resilience projects in Morocco and Algeria, LGBTQ rights in Paraguay, and HPV vaccine campaigns across Latin America and the Caribbean.

The dismantling of USAID has destroyed longstanding and hard-won infrastructure for implementing aid programs, especially in critical areas like HIV prevention. There's little that anyone can do to bring that infrastructure back, but countries like Spain, Ireland, or South Korea have been able to uplift and increase funding to the initiatives most affected by the cuts, like Gavi, the international vaccine alliance, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Ireland also aims to increase its aid spending to 0.7 percent of GNI by 2030. It inched closer to that goal this year by boosting its development budget by about $40 million to $925 million. “We wouldn't expect Ireland to be able to fill the USAID gap in any shape or form,” Jane-Ann McKenna, who heads Dóchas, an umbrella group for Irish development organizations, said. “But that's where our positioning and our voice becomes more important.”

That said, foreign aid has always been about more than just charity. It's a geopolitical tool that countries have used for decades to win friends and influence people.

It's no coincidence that, according to a 2006 study, US aid increased about 59 percent to nations when they temporarily joined the UN Security Council. The birth of PEPFAR — the HIV/AIDS program that saves around a million lives per year, which makes it perhaps America's most effective ever form of foreign aid — helped boost public opinion of the US across sub-Saharan Africa. Much of Italy's recent aid budget has gone to its $6 billion Mattei Plan in Africa, which aims to collaboratively influence the continent's energy development and migration flows, but which some critics contend recreates old colonial patterns by relying too heavily on European priorities — not local expertise — to decide where the money ought to go and how its vision should take shape.

But if you take countries like Ireland and Spain at their word, their approach to foreign aid is not just about soft power anymore. These countries also have something in common that can differentiate them from other larger donors: recent histories of underdevelopment. Some of the newcomers might have been aid recipients rather than donors just a few decades ago.

South Korea received billions in foreign aid in the decades after the Korean War, which helped it grow to the point where it became the first former recipient to join OECD's forum for major aid providers in 2010. Spain's wealthier neighbors offered the country major financial support when it began integrating with Europe in the 1980s in the aftermath of the Franco dictatorship.

That dynamic can make it easier, Calleja says, to empathize with others who need aid today. (Though let's not forget that Spain once colonized much of Latin America and the Caribbean — places that now receive the bulk of Spanish foreign aid — and therefore laid the groundwork for many patterns of exploitation and inequality there that its aid now seeks to resolve.)

Ireland was never a colonizer, but was once colonized itself by Britain. That legacy, McKenna said, means that many Irish people are passionate about human rights abroad and highly supportive of overseas aid.

“We have the history of the famine and we've had conflict on the island and we've had to engage in a whole peace process ourselves,” McKenna explained. “That's there in the background of all of our psyches.”

As these smaller players like to say, it's about “solidarity.” Spain's own development agency's four-year plan mentions the word solidarity 84 times. It explicitly calls for a move away from the old model, where wealthy nations dictated terms to grateful recipients, and toward a more equitable and collaborative model built on shared priorities and mutual respect.

Of course, not everybody is buying it.

Henry Morales is an economist and director of the Movimiento Tzuk Kim-Pop, a Guatemalan human rights group. He let out a little laugh when I asked him about Spain's solidarity plan. After all, he's seen foreign funders renege on their promises before.

He's seen European powers pledge numerous times to do more to promote climate resilience in low-income countries before watching them give up when the politics become too difficult. Spain's plan for development stresses that it aims to approach its funding priorities — like combating climate change and promoting gender equality — from a place of consistency and genuine partnership, the kind that can't be abandoned on a whim when a new government takes power.

Whether Spain's plan represents a form of global reparations or just colonialism with better PR remains to be seen, he said, but regardless, the old top-down model is clearly cracking.

Countries who receive aid now want “a voice and a vote, so that the decisions are no longer made by a private club of the big donors, the big traditional financiers,” he said. “But by debates and global agreements that are much more transparent and much more democratic.”

Fifty countries in the Global South now have their own agencies to exchange ideas, technical advice, and reciprocal funds for solving poverty, fighting climate change, and improving education.

Ensuring that recipients have a big say in how aid gets around is not only good for building a better, more democratic system — it can also make it much more efficient. According to Vox's previous reporting in 2022, aid programs tend to work better when people from the countries they're targeting play a big role in directing how and where the money's used. Morales thinks that kind of collaboration is the real future of aid, which he prefers to see not as charity but as “simply the fair distribution of wealth.”

He's not the only one who thinks so. The director-general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, called foreign aid “a thing of the past” at a meeting with African leaders in February.

For his part, Karlan, the former USAID economist, doesn't think USAID will ever come back as the acronym or institution it once was, and although that's mostly a very bad thing, he sees a flicker of opportunity.

Still, he isn't sure if he believes that a real change to the aid paradigm is afoot. “Solidarity strikes me as a little bit of a softer way of saying soft power,” he mused, even if countries like Spain or Ireland aren't necessarily “looking for flyover rights for the military.”

What he is sure of is that the US is moving in a very different direction. If Spain's soft power is softening, then the United States' is calcifying into something more toxic, more transactional, and — as Karlan likes to add — less efficient than before.

“Imagine a marriage in which you never did something considerate for your partner just because you cared about them,” he said. Instead, everything is a negotiation. “That isn't a healthy relationship. What we're risking is losing these long-term relationships, those long-term friendships.”

By the time the US is ready to reopen the door on them, it may find a world that has already moved on.

You might soon have a new favorite Vine video — or see an old favorite return to the timeline — thanks to Elon Musk's new AI-powered text-to-video generator, Grok Imagine.

""Grok Imagine is AI Vine!"" Musk wrote in an X post on Saturday, touting the latest feature from his chatbot, Grok.

Grok Imagine — now in beta — allows users to type out images or scenes they'd like to see the AI bot animate into video. It then generates clips with sound to the user's specifications.

Before TikTok — and long before Grok — there was Vine. The beloved short-form video service, which allowed users to create and upload 6-second videos, was owned by then-Twitter shortly after its 2012 founding until its shuttering in 2017. It was the source of many early viral videos and the subject of numerous compilations of ""the best Vines of all time.""

While Grok Imagine offers a new AI spin on short-form clips, Musk also appears to be eyeing a comeback for Vine itself.

""Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want,"" Musk added in his Saturday post.

It's unclear whether restoring the Vine archive would allow users to access their old accounts or if it would be a temporary measure allowing access to old files from the service.

Musk and representatives for X did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

For now, access to Grok Imagine is being slowly rolled out to subscribers of the chatbot's $30-monthly premium tier, SuperGrok, though any user of X can sign up to be added to the waitlist.

Target is continuing to invest in its tech workforce as it tries to recapture the success it saw a few years ago.

EVP and operating chief Michael Fiddelke told investors in May that harnessing tech and AI would be critical to his work in the company's newly formed office that aims to accelerate its growth plan.

The Bullseye retailer has long brought a tech-savviness to its business that has set it apart from most other retailers: it first launched its e-commerce website in 1999, and its early engagement with mobile pickup and delivery services gave Target a massive lift during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the company employs a large tech team behind its increasingly complex business of physical stores, e-commerce business, retail media, and more.

And it pays well, salary data suggests.

Company filings with the US Department of Labor show Target sought to hire around 94 workers through the US H-1B visa program in the first half of this reporting year, largely in software development, information systems, and data science.

That number is up substantially from about 49 for the same period the years before, but roughly in line with the 98 records from two years ago.

By comparison, big-box rival Walmart has about four times as many US employees and requested visas for 1,750 workers.

Companies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers.

Business Insider analyzed how much money companies from Apple to Walmart are paying for tech jobs and other roles. Explore salary data from America's biggest employers.

Target has about 440,000 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees. Its starting wage for US hourly workers is $15 to $24. A Target spokesperson told Business Insider the company also offers retirement fund matching and a range of other benefits such as employee discounts.

The vast majority of the 10,777 jobs listed on Target's careers website at the time of this writing were for positions in the company's fleet of 1,978 stores. Within the 230 corporate openings, 139 were for the company's offices in India, and the rest were based in the US headquarters in Minnesota. The job listings included salary ranges.

Here's a deeper look at some of the roles Target disclosed for tech workers:

Senior Engineer: $103,605 to $184,700

Lead Engineer: $136,926 to $240,200

Principal Engineer: $122,741 to $353,000

Senior Data Scientist: $122,637 to $184,700

Lead Data Analyst: $139,298 to $200,200

Lead Data Scientist: $128,000 to $273,500

Principal Data Scientist: $211,536 to $347,600

Director Engineering: $206,398 to $289,700

Director Tech: $206,398 to $289,700

Principal Technical Program Manager: $251,576 to $311,900

Artificial intelligence can lead to surprises in all sorts of places where a bill once would have been considered settled. 

The use of AI by Hertz (and European car rental company Sixt) to scan for damage on cars, which is then charged to the customer, is a new application of the technology that is creeping into consumer life unnoticed. But it won't be the last unexpected adjustment to the travel experience courtesy of AI.

Experts say consumers should expect to see businesses across the service industry deploying similar technology in the future, if they aren't already.

""As businesses seek to automate loss prevention and operational efficiency, we're witnessing the emergence of what I call 'algorithmic auditing' – the systematic deployment of AI to identify, classify, and monetize previously overlooked inefficiencies or losses,"" said Shannon McKeen, professor of the practice and executive director for the Center for Analytics Impact at Wake Forest University School of Business. The Hertz program, recently reported on by the New York Times, is the beginning of what McKeen describes as a broader transformation, and new fault line, in the service economy. 

""The implementation of these systems reveals a fundamental tension between operational efficiency and customer satisfaction and equity,"" McKeen said. The question isn't simply whether AI can detect a scratch on a rental car bumper. ""It's whether businesses should charge customers for every microscopic imperfection that algorithms can identify but human judgment might reasonably overlook as normal wear and tear,"" he said.

McKeen says the dialogue between service agent and customer over costs will increasingly include a new term: ""the machine says.""

Hotels are working their way through these changes, according to Jordan Hollander, cofounder of Hoteltechreport.com, a research platform that helps hotels find new digital and AI products to improve efficiency.

""I've been seeing more hotels experiment with AI across operations, but not quite in the same way Hertz is using it for automated damage detection and billing. That said, we're not far off,"" Hollander said.

Some hotels, for instance, are already using AI-powered sensors to monitor air quality and trigger fines for smoking or vaping in rooms. But Hollander warns that sometimes the sensors trigger false positives.

""Like someone using a hairdryer or aerosol spray — and guests get hit with $500 charges without ever lighting up. It's not hard to imagine how that could go south quickly,"" Hollander said.

But unlike the car rental example, most hotels haven't automated the billing step yet.

""They're using AI more to flag potential issues — like a room that smells off, linens that don't meet standards, or maintenance problems — and then looping in a human for the final call,"" Hollander said. For now, the AI is acting more like a very observant assistant than a judge and jury.

""But it's clear that hotels are heading in the same direction,"" he said. ""Between computer vision that can detect damage or wear in a room, and AI that analyzes guest behavior or room conditions in real time, the tech is already there."" 

In a hospitality industry where trust is everything, there are reasons for hotels to move with caution. To date, many hotel operators are using AI to improve things like housekeeping efficiency, energy usage, and guest messaging — but they're being cautious about when and how it impacts the guest directly in a way that can be perceived to hurt the experience.  

""There's a risk of backlash if hotels start billing guests based solely on what an algorithm says. The moment a guest gets a charge and can't get a straight answer about why or how it was verified, you're in dangerous territory,"" Hollander said. ""If guests feel like they're being watched or nickel-and-dimed by a machine, it undermines the relationship completely,"" he added. 

Recent experience in the hotel industry provides at least one cautionary tale, according to Hollander, referring to a custom-modified Alexa for hotels. ""Years ago, the hot thing was voice devices, and that never really took off for this reason,"" he said.

A Hertz spokeswoman told CNBC that AI brings uniformity and consistency to the checkout process.

""For years, vehicle damage inspections have caused confusion and frustration. The process was manual, subjective, and inconsistent, and that isn't good enough for our customers or our business,"" she said.

She added that with digital vehicle inspections, Hertz is introducing ""much-needed precision, objectivity, and transparency to the process – giving our customers greater confidence that they won't be charged for damage that didn't occur during their rental, and a more efficient resolution process when damage does occur.""

Of the 500,000 rentals scanned so far, more than 97% showed no billable damage, according to Hertz, and damage incidents are declining at scanner-equipped locations.  

The Hertz spokeswoman acknowledged that the new system is still a work in progress.

""We know change of this scale takes time, and we're listening, learning, and improving every day. As we said from the start, our goal through this initiative is to enhance the safety, quality, and reliability of our fleet and to create a more consistent rental experience for our customers."" 

AI excels at pattern recognition, but where it may fall short is with the nuanced decision-making that has historically characterized good customer service, according to McKeen.

""What makes these systems particularly problematic is the erosion of contextual judgment,"" McKeen said. Traditionally, business relationships relied on human discretion to navigate gray areas like ""when does a scuffed tire represent normal use versus chargeable damage? When does a hearty portion in a restaurant satisfy a hungry customer versus being wasteful?""

Other companies will be watching Hertz closely to see how the AI experiment works out, he said, and then jump right in on the profit opportunity if it is determined that use of the technology won't drive customers away.

The use of AI for cost recouping isn't widespread yet because companies have not figured out the balance between customer trust and implementing AI, and the benefit, so far, doesn't outweigh the potential loss in loyalty, said Chuck Reynolds, managing director at L.E.K Consulting and a member of the firm's digital practice.

The key for companies to implement these cost recouping tools is transparency. ""While the opportunity for AI is huge, organizations need to be thoughtful about embedding it as a copilot, not police or enforcer,"" Reynolds said. Sustomers will accept AI as part of the experience, he added, if companies are fair, visible, and design the AI experience with empathy. 

""AI has to have customer-centricity built into its core,"" Reynolds said, and companies have to keep a role for humans in the process to oversee and override the AI if necessary. ""Organizations that do so without thinking through the entire process will have challenges with internal adoption and customer adoption,"" Reynolds said.

Customers should expect to see more of the technology Hertz is deploying in different settings, according to David Rivera, professor of hospitality and tourism at Flagler College. In addition to hotels, the future could include restaurants using AI to itemize plates to ensure accurate billing. But Rivera says all of this is being done with the goal of operational efficiency rather than to punish the customer. Use of AI in hospitality is evolving from passive data collection to active use of real-time decision-making tools, Rivera said, and that includes things like monitoring your rental car or how much you are raiding the mini-bar in your hotel room.

""The common thread is increased operational efficiency, enhanced guest satisfaction, and automation of traditionally manual tasks, with a layer of accountability and transparency for both guest and provider,"" Rivera said.

Not everyone is on board with that view, however.

""This trend is absolute overkill with AI solution capabilities,"" said Daniel Keller, CEO of cloud infrastructure company Influx Technologies, which provides data collection and data analysis tools. ""This particular use of AI doesn't increase efficiency; it scrutinizes customers of small-margin service businesses looking to suck extra money out of guest experiences.""

If you're looking for a city that offers a robust job market and promising income growth, don't overlook mid-sized metro areas like Nashville or Omaha.

Both are in the top 10 U.S. cities for earnings and employment, according to a new report from Checkr, an HR technology company.

Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Checkr ranked the 100 largest U.S. cities based on employment opportunity and earning potential.

Checkr calculated the employment opportunity score for each city based on unemployment rate, labor force growth, labor force size and percentage of jobs open. To calculate the earning potential score, they analyzed each city's real per capita personal income, 10-year income growth and the percentage of households earning more than $200,000.

Sam Radbil, research and content strategist at Checkr, says that mid-sized cities were ""the big winners"" based on their study, challenging the ""standard big city domination"" of jobs and wages.

""The geography of opportunity is shifting,"" he says. ""If you're earning a good wage in a mid-sized city like Madison or Des Moines or Raleigh, your money might go further — even if you're earning less.""

Based on Checkr's data, these are the top 10 U.S. cities for job opportunities and earning potential.

Raleigh is part of North Carolina's ""Research Triangle,"" a tech and science hub that encompasses North Carolina State University, Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

""The Research Triangle opens up a ton of opportunities in health care and education, so it's always going to be popular for jobs there,"" Radbil says.

Job growth has been ""huge"" in both Nashville and Austin, Radbil says.

Beyond the city's country music fame, Nashville is now known for its strong health-care, education and logistics sectors.

Due to the influx of tech companies, Austin offers plenty of high-paying jobs, according to Radbil. However, the city's growing cost of living can quickly eat into those salaries.

""The quality of life is great, but it's super expensive to live and to rent and to buy a home,"" he says.

Salt Lake City has been steadily growing in both ""popularity and population,"" Radbil says.

The city has gained traction as a hub for tech and finance, resulting in a thriving job market.

""When it comes to Portland, Maine, affordability is huge,"" Radbil says. The city is becoming popular with remote workers, who enjoy its relatively low rent and housing costs.

Wages and job opportunities are both steadily increasing in Denver, and despite rising housing costs, Radbil says it's still not a ""terribly expensive place"" to live.

According to Radbil, Omaha has seen an influx of businesses moving to the city, which boosted its job market and wages. Still, the city remains ""very, very affordable"" in terms of living costs, he says.

Charlotte's labor force has grown by upwards of 10% in the last 5 years, Radbil says.

""There's a lot of financial business in Charlotte, which continues to draw people to that area as well,"" he says.

Charleston boasts a growing job market in the finance, health-care and tech industries.

It also offers promising pay: according to Radbil, the percentage of people making over $200,000 in Charleston is on the rise.

Indianapolis may not be as glamorous as a coastal city, but it offers a stable job market and reasonable cost of living, Radbil says.

""The Midwest provides a good business climate and good earning potential,"" he says.

Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry has been the highest-paid NBA player for the past eight years. Next season, he's set to earn his biggest salary yet: $59.6 million, according to ESPN.

Curry also earns an estimated $100 million annually from endorsement deals with various companies, Forbes reports, including from his partnership with Under Armour, where he is president of the Curry Brand.

But when Curry was recently asked to confirm his current net worth during an episode of the 360 With Speedy podcast with host Speedy Morman, the 37-year-old point guard said he doesn't actually know, and doesn't care to find out.

""[Net worth] is not something I really worry about too much. I have somebody that takes care of that for me,"" Curry said.

Instead, ""the idea of what I have going on is about creating a portfolio of stuff that is aspirational in terms of wealth,"" Curry said. ""You want to have something you look back on and are proud of, knowing we've been blessed with so many opportunities and so many resources and so many relationships."" 

Curry's focus on financial goals beyond his net worth is a ""breath of fresh air,"" says Ben Smith, a certified financial planner and founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Too many people feel pressured to fixate on building the highest net worth possible, Smith says, and it's refreshing that Curry prioritizes ""pursuing what he's great at"" and making investments he's proud of along the way. That strategy will serve him better long-term because it will keep ""the engine"" of his financial health going for longer.

Curry's position is undeniably unique. As a high-earning athlete, he can afford to delegate his money management to professionals without worrying about his financial foundation eroding anytime soon.

Still, you don't need to earn millions to benefit from setting financial goals that don't revolve around your net worth, Smith says. In fact, obsessing over that number may hold you back from achieving financial milestones that might feel more rewarding, like finally taking a long-awaited family vacation or paying off your car loan early, he adds.

Here's what really deserves your attention if you want to feel in control of your money, and, better yet, learn how to manage it well, according to financial pros.

While net worth can be ""a useful barometer"" for understanding your finances, cash flow is a much more powerful indicator of your overall financial health, Smith says.

Rather than constantly poring over your assets and liabilities, focus on what you can track day-to-day: how much you're earning, how much you're spending on fixed expenses and discretionary purchases and what's left over. That basic awareness of what's coming in and going out will enable you to form a financial plan that's more action-oriented than just trying to accumulate wealth, Smith says.

Once you've got a handle on your cash flow, you can start targeting tangible personal goals, like building an emergency fund or paying off student loans, he says. Everyone should aim to make financial decisions that bring them pride, he says, and those measurable accomplishments are usually easier to celebrate than hitting a net worth goal.

Those who focus too much on their overall wealth often feel like they never have enough, Joy Slabaugh, a certified financial planner, licensed therapist and founder of Wealth Alignment Institute, previously told CNBC Make It.

No matter how large a client's net worth actually is, the desired amount is nearly always the same, she says: ""a little more than what they actually have.""

Instead of focusing on net worth alone, Slabaugh encourages her clients to reflect on how their financial decisions align with their personal values and long-term vision.

""[Net worth is] just one metric — and often a misleading one. I've seen clients fixated on their net worth while completely disconnected from their financial reality,"" Slabaugh said. ""Tracking net worth without tracking values or lifestyle intentions is like watching your pulse without knowing if your heart is healthy.""

Once you start using your money intentionally, covering essential expenses, savings, investments and even some joy, you've already won half the battle, she said. The rest is about making sure your money supports a life you actually want to live, and you aren't merely striving toward a financial mark that you will only increase with time.

In this article

This earnings season, a number of companies are demonstrating their resilience by delivering solid performance despite macro challenges and tariff uncertainties.

With their in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick stocks that can navigate short-term pressures with solid execution and focus on delivering attractive returns.  

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Database management software company MongoDB (MDB) is this week's first pick. In June, the company delivered solid results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026.

Recently, BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman initiated coverage of MongoDB stock with a buy rating and a price target of $280. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on MDB stock with a price forecast of $263.

Bachman said that, according to Gartner, the database market is among the largest software markets at over $100 billion in annual spend, and MongoDB is a leader in the non-relational database segment. Notably, this segment accounts for about 25% of the overall market and is growing by about 20% year over year.

The 5-star analyst noted that feedback from Value Added Resellers (VARs) and users indicates that developers have a very positive view of MongoDB, a platform that is well-suited for customers with multi-cloud deployments. Bachman believes that MongoDB can be one of the generative artificial intelligence (AI) database winners.

""We think MDB is currently focused on improving its vector search capabilities to help win new workloads, including through M&A,"" noted the analyst. Also, Bachman expects MongoDB's cloud-based database offering, Atlas, to sustain low- to mid-20% growth through fiscal 2027. He expects MongoDB to deliver mid- to high-teens growth in fiscal 2027, while gradually enhancing profitability.

Bachman ranks No. 531 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.3%. See MongoDB Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

We move to ServiceNow (NOW), an AI-powered platform for business transformation. The company posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook, backed by increasing AI adoption.

Reacting to the Q2 print, TD Cowen analyst Derrick Wood reaffirmed a buy rating on ServiceNow stock and raised the price forecast to $1,200 from $1,150. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on NOW stock with a price target of $1,129.

Wood noted the impressive 21.5% growth (at constant currency) in ServiceNow's current remaining performing obligations, delivering a 200 basis-point beat. The top-rated analyst explained that this strong growth was driven by early renewals and AI strength in the enterprise business, which offset tougher federal spending conditions.

The analyst also highlighted that the company's generative AI suite, NOW Assist, delivered better-than-expected net new annual contract value, driven by higher deal volumes and increased deal sizes.

""We continue to view NOW as the best positioned SaaS [software as a service] vendor to monetize GenAI, and we expect momentum to keep building in 2H,"" said Wood. Overall, the analyst is very encouraged by the robust key performance indicators, with ServiceNow's new AI and data products and strength in the enterprise business offsetting headwinds resulting from tightening federal spending.

Wood ranks No. 352 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.3%. See ServiceNow Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, let's look at cloud-native and AI-powered data security company Varonis Systems (VRNS). On July 29, the company reported solid results for the second quarter of 2025, driven by continued momentum in its business.

Impressed by the performance, Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari raised his price target for VRNS stock to $63 from $58 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on VRNS stock with a price target of $54.

Kothari highlighted that Varonis delivered a ""clean beat/raise"" across key metrics like annual recurring revenue (ARR), subscription revenue and free cash flow. The 5-star analyst added that Q2 conversion ARR was better-than-expected and aligned with strong checks and his preview.

Additionally, the analyst noted that the company again raised its full-year ARR guidance, which reflects improving upsell and net-new business opportunities. ""GenAI, Copilot integrations, and MDDR [Managed Data Detection and Response] tailwinds are driving growing customer appetite for the full platform,""  said Kothari.

The analyst pointed out that SaaS ARR represented about 69% of overall Q2 ARR, up from 61% in the first quarter, with the company on track to complete its SaaS transition by the end of 2025. He added that Varonis now expects to exit 2025 with an 82% SaaS ARR mix compared to its previous estimate of 80%, backed by solid, broad-based demand from both new and existing customers.

Kothari ranks No. 85 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 73% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.7%. See Varonis Systems Statistics on TipRanks.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

A fresh theory from cryptocurrency analyst Seán Murray has reignited speculation about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious figure behind Bitcoin's creation. In a recent analysis, Murray suggests that Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and Block (formerly Square), may be the individual who developed Bitcoin's original codebase [1]. The hypothesis draws attention to technical and circumstantial links between Dorsey and the cryptocurrency's early development.

Murray highlights that Dorsey has used C++ since the mid-1990s — the same programming language in which Bitcoin's initial code was written. This technical alignment, combined with Dorsey's involvement in the cypherpunk community and his early exposure to cryptography, adds weight to the theory. Additionally, Dorsey was active online in the 1990s, sharing content on cryptography and maintaining connections with early Bitcoin figures like Hal Finney and Adam Back [1].

The timing of Dorsey's activities also appears to align with key milestones in Bitcoin's early life. For example, Murray notes that Satoshi's forum registration on November 19 coincides with Dorsey's birthday. Similarly, the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney occurred on January 11, which is reportedly Dorsey's mother's birthday. These seemingly minor details, when taken together, contribute to the argument that Dorsey may have been behind Bitcoin's creation [1].

Further evidence includes a 2009 IP trace placing Satoshi in California, where Dorsey was also based. An early Bitcoin wallet address, starting with “1JaK,” is also seen as a potential nod to a nickname associated with Dorsey. Block's 2024 SEC filing, which mentions the company following “Satoshi Nakamoto's blueprint,” is interpreted by Murray as a subtle acknowledgment of Dorsey's possible role in Bitcoin's development [1].

While Dorsey has never publicly claimed to be Satoshi, Murray argues that his silence, timing, and consistent advocacy for decentralization and digital sovereignty support the theory. Unlike other high-profile candidates, who have either denied or been discredited, this theory continues to attract attention, particularly given Dorsey's long-standing support for the principles central to Bitcoin's design [1].

The implications of such a revelation could be significant for the cryptocurrency community and the broader financial landscape. If verified, it could reshape the narrative around Bitcoin's origins and add a new dimension to the understanding of its development. However, until definitive proof emerges, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of the most enduring mysteries in modern finance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin dip making ‘perfect bottom,' says analyst: Will BTC rally to $148K?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dip-making-perfect-bottom-says-analyst-will-btc-rally-to-148k","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 15:49:07 GMT","

 BTC price is retesting a key support that previously triggered a 25% rally, potentially signaling a repeat move toward new all-time highs for Bitcoin. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's 50-day EMA bounce aligns with a bullish pattern targeting $148,000.

Old whale's 80,000 BTC selloff marks third profit wave, often a prelude to a recovery.

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by 7.50% three weeks after establishing its record high at around $123,250. But analysts say this may be the final shakeout before a breakout toward $150,000.

On Sunday, Bitcoin retook its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) as support after briefly dipping below it a day prior. 

The 50-day EMA has served as a reliable support level for initiating fresh rallies. In June, for instance, a brief drop below this wave support preceded a sharp 25% rebound.

Now, BTC appears to be repeating the same setup, and analyst BitBull says that the cryptocurrency may undergo a June-like in the coming days. 

He argues that even a drop into the $110,000–$112,000 range would establish a “perfect bottom” for Bitcoin, potentially setting the stage for the next leg higher.

The 50-day EMA support further aligns with the neckline of Bitcoin's prevailing inverted head-and-shoulders (IH&S) pattern.

After breaking above this neckline, BTC has pulled back to retest it—a typical post-breakout move—and bounced, reinforcing the validity of the bullish reversal setup.

The successful neckline retest now signals that Bitcoin may be entering the continuation phase of its breakout, with the IH&S pattern targeting a move toward $148,250.

That is near the widely anticipated $150,000 BTC upside target for 2025, which many analysts expect to happen around October.

Onchain data further indicates that Bitcoin's ongoing price dip may lead to another major breakout. 

Bitcoin has seen three major waves of profit-taking by whales during the 2023–2025 bull market, according to CryptoQuant data. 

The first followed the March 2024 launch of US spot ETFs. The second came after BTC broke $100K post-Trump election in late 2024. The third occurred in July 2025 after a breakout over $120,000 triggered an 80,000 BTC selloff by an old whale.

Each wave of profit-taking preceded a period of price consolidation or moderate correction, lasting between two to four months, wrote CryptoQuant analysts in a report published Friday.

“These cooling phases have historically set the stage for renewed accumulation and a subsequent breakout to new all-time highs,” they say, adding:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Arthur Hayes Sells $13 Million In Ethereum, PEPE and Ethena","https://bitcoinist.com/arthur-hayes-sells-13-million-ethereum-pepe-ethena/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:30:11 GMT","

BitMEX co-founder and key crypto figure Arthur Hayes has recently offloaded $13 million in Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and Ethena (ENA). While this market sell-off may be linked to a broader crypto market decline, Hayes has shared other insights backing this cautious market move.

In an X post on August 2, analytics company LookonChain reports that Arthur Hayes sold an estimated $13 million in crypto assets amidst a broader market correction. Notably, the offload consisted of 2,373 ETH valued at $8.32 million, 7.76 million ENA ($4.62 million), and 38.86 billion PEPE ($414,600), all sold within six hours.

Over the past 24 hours, Ethereum and PEPE prices have fallen by 2.70% and 3.03% in line triggered by Bitcoin's fall below $113,000. Meanwhile, ENA is down by 10.98% following an initial standout performance between July 30-31, during which the DeFi token rose by 24%.

In explaining the rationale behind his firesale transactions, Arthur Hayes postulates that the global economy is heading toward a period of intensified macroeconomic pressure. He bases this theory on a convergence of factors, including the delayed financial impact of US tariffs now showing in Q3 and signs of labor market weakness as indicated in the release of recent non-farm payroll data.

Furthermore, Hayes also states that no major world economy is creating credit fast enough to boost nominal GDP growth. Therefore, there is the potential that the global system is vulnerable to deflationary pressure and a potential market repricing. Against this backdrop, Arthur Hayes anticipates a capital rotation away from volatile assets such as cryptocurrencies, which influenced his recent market offload.

In terms of price forecast, the BitMEX co-founder is expecting Bitcoin (BTC) to test $100,000 and Ethereum to return to the $3,000 level. If this prediction proves true, further widespread price corrections should be largely expected.

At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap stands at $3.62 trillion following general negative performance across major assets. Bitcoin, premier cryptocurrency and market leader, trades at $113,015, slipping 0.59% in the past 24 hours and down 4.31% over the week. In addition, Ethereum sees a sharper weekly decline of 9.43%, and is now priced at $3,414.

Meanwhile, the Altseason Index has dropped to 33, signaling fading momentum for alternative tokens. Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) has risen to 61.7%, reflecting capital consolidation around BTC as altcoins lag. Overall, the market shows signs of cautious trading, with Bitcoin holding ground better than altcoins amid despite bullish sentiments remaining intact according to community data.

Ethereum price today: Ethereum (ETH) is retesting a crucial support zone near $3,400, raising questions over the sustainability of its current market structure.

While short-term volatility has unsettled investors, analysts suggest Ethereum remains positioned for a potential bullish rebound.

Ethereum briefly dipped below $3,450 on August 3, 2025, marking a 5.04% daily decline. The pullback mirrors a wider market correction affecting top digital assets, including Bitcoin. As of the latest data from the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) by Brave New Coin, ETH is trading just above $3,400, holding on to a pivotal support level that previously triggered a 10% drop in July.

Despite the decline, Ethereum's broader market structure remains intact. The asset continues to trade above the SuperTrend support at $3,368, indicating the underlying bullish trend is still in play.

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Technical analyst IncomeSharks explained that Ethereum is “back to the line that saw a 10% drop last time,” noting that a move down to $3,400 still fits within a bullish framework. This suggests that the recent pullback might be a healthy retest rather than a trend reversal.

Meanwhile, market observer Cas Abbé pointed out that Ethereum just experienced its biggest long liquidation event in over three years. He considers this a constructive development, arguing that it has eliminated excessive leverage and flushed out panic sellers. According to him, such a reset often attracts institutional buyers and paves the way for a more sustainable rally.

Ethereum's price action has formed a higher high and higher low pattern since early 2025, reaffirming its medium-term uptrend. As long as ETH can hold the $3,400–$3,368 level, the next target to the upside remains the psychological $4,000 level.

To corroborate the bull case, over a million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past two weeks, according to on-chain analyst Ali. A reduction in exchange balances is typically a sign that investors are moving assets to long-term storage, a vote of confidence in Ethereum's long-term value.

In addition, Ethereum has also reclaimed its decentralized finance supremacy. Ethereum is presently the leading blockchain by decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in the 24-hour and 30-day time frames, according to analyst AkaBull. He noted that some months back, alternate networks had briefly displaced Ethereum in volume and revenue, but Ethereum has now reclaimed its supremacy. He also remarked that “Ethereum is really back” as the network achieves new highs in daily transaction volume and other key metrics.

The recent drop in Ethereum is only a part of the broader risk-off movement in the crypto market. Rising macroeconomic uncertainty has led investors to reduce exposure to risky assets. Market capitalization of ETH is now at around $415 billion, and 24-hour trade volume stands above $18 billion.

While there's been no confirmation of the sell-off by Ethereum leadership, fundamentals in the ecosystem remain upbeat. Core metrics like validator rewards, staking activity, and Layer 2 volume all continue to buck challenges.

With the $3,400 support still in place thus far and fundamental technicals displaying stability, Ethereum could now attempt to bounce back. Market observers caution, though, that a confirmed close below the $3,368 SuperTrend support would transfer bear momentum.

Historically, these Ethereum pullbacks have been accompanied by strong recovery rallies. If accumulation continues and sentiment turns positive, Ethereum can retest the $3,800–$4,000 zone in the coming weeks.

Ethereum's recent price correction may appear sharp, but its market foundation remains firm. Technical patterns, on-chain data, and ecosystem activity suggest Ethereum is preparing for its next major move. As traders await confirmation of direction, the $3,400 zone stands as a critical level in determining whether the bulls can retake control.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant wave of liquidations over the past 24 hours, with a total of $360 million worth of leveraged positions being forced to close [1]. The majority of these liquidations—$279 million—came from long positions, highlighting a broad sell-off as traders were unable to withstand downward price movements and were forced out of leveraged bets [1]. This data aligns with broader indicators of market distress, as traders faced margin calls amid heightened volatility and deteriorating sentiment.

Multiple sources have reported similar figures, with Coinglass recording $679 million in total liquidations during the same period, of which $554 million came from long positions [2]. Another report noted a total of $615 million in liquidations across the market, reinforcing the scale and severity of the selloff [3]. The most heavily impacted assets were Bitcoin and Ethereum, with $228 million and $262 million in liquidations respectively [4]. These figures underscore the significant leverage present in the market and the concentrated risk exposure among traders in the leading digital assets.

The dominance of long position liquidations signals a strong bearish bias in the market, with traders struggling to maintain their positions as prices continued to fall. This suggests a growing inability among leveraged traders—both retail and institutional—to manage risk effectively in the face of downward pressure. The event highlights the fragile nature of leveraged trading in times of market stress and raises concerns about the broader stability of the ecosystem.

Market participants are now closely monitoring whether this wave of liquidations will stabilize or evolve into a deeper correction. As traders digest the recent losses, the market is at a critical juncture. The high volume of liquidations serves as a key barometer for investor behavior and market health, offering insight into the resilience—or fragility—of leveraged positions in times of uncertainty. Whether this marks a temporary correction or the start of a more prolonged bearish phase remains to be seen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum's Institutional Surge: Impacts on Market Liquidity and Fintech Startups","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/ethereum-institutional-accumulation-impact-fintech-startups","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 10:24:53 GMT","

It looks like institutional investors are really getting into Ethereum these days. I mean, we're talking about a serious uptick in institutional accumulation, with corporations owning around 1% of the total ETH supply and projections hitting 10% by year's end. This isn't just some passing phase; it's a full-blown market shift towards decentralized finance and enterprise blockchain applications.

With all this institutional capital flowing into Ethereum, market liquidity is getting a major boost. This is great for crypto banking and all that, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows for smaller fintech startups. Sure, they might find some collaboration opportunities, but they're also up against intensified competition and regulatory scrutiny. In short, it's a dog's breakfast out there.

And then there's the whole staking thing. It's good for stabilizing prices but bad for smaller startups that need liquid ETH for their daily operations. The shrunk supply could make it even tougher for these startups to get their hands on ETH when they need it.

Asian fintech startups are caught between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, institutional capital can be a sweet deal. On the other, it's like a double-edged sword of increased competition and regulatory headaches. The market is getting crowded, and standing out is becoming a Herculean task.

Let's not forget the compliance nightmare. More institutional money means more regulatory oversight. Startups have to build strong compliance frameworks, which takes time and money. Messing this up can lead to nasty penalties, complicating things even further.

As for what's next, the recent whale activity in Ethereum is a mixed bag. Some analysts think the drop in whale and institutional activity means a correction is coming. Others think the big players are still accumulating because they believe in Ethereum's long-term future. Who knows?

For small fintech startups, keeping an eye on these trends is key. They'll need to adapt their strategies to avoid getting swallowed whole. This could mean diving into smart contract payroll and crypto payroll integration to streamline operations and attract more customers.

So there you have it. The surge of institutional investment into Ethereum is shaking up market liquidity while throwing small fintech startups for a loop. They've got to be quick on their feet to navigate this new reality, but who knows what the future holds?

The Bitcoin market has been showing signs of increasing selling pressure, with its recent price action hinting at an even deeper distribution phase unfolding beneath the surface. 

Wyckoff Pattern Reveals Imminent Breakdown

In an August 2 post on the social media platform X, crypto analyst Joao Wedson explained how the Bitcoin price may be at risk of a downturn over the coming months. The analyst based his conclusion on the Wyckoff Distribution model, a technical analysis framework that describes how smart money sells off assets at the top of a market cycle.

Wedson highlighted in the post that a 13-phase schematic is unfolding in real-time, which signals that the institutional investors (known as “smart money”) are preparing to exit the market, even as the retail traders remain hopeful.

The analyst started his breakdown with the Preliminary Supply (PSY) phase, where there are subtle signs of institutional sales, and a Buying Climax, where price hits a peak due to exhausted demand. This phase is then followed by an Automatic Reaction (AR), a sharp drop in Bitcoin's price, defining the bottom of the distribution range.

The fourth and fifth phases are Secondary Tests (ST), where price retests the highs of the distribution range, but with weaker momentum and volume. As the pattern matures, the price enters Phase B with sideways movement, confusing retail participants as the institutions quietly offload their coins.

The most irrefutable signs appear in phases C and D, where there is first a Sign of Weakness (SOW), often characterized by a strong breakdown with volume; this is a major signal of demand fading. Then, there is a Last Point of Supply (LPSY), a weak rally towards the upside, which typically creates good setups for shorts. 

Finally, still within phases C and D, a break of ICE leads to a deeper fall, after which a second LPSY trap follows to seal the distribution. 

Is The Altcoin Rally Underway?

Going further, Wedson pointed out that the market makers are rotating into altcoins. According to the analyst, altcoins are already exiting their accumulation zones and are being positioned for structural markups, reflecting increasing interest in the altcoin market.

In contrast, Bitcoin has entered a weekly distribution phase, which may reflect as a weak or modest performance in the near term. Wedson added that, by the end of 2025, there will be a full rotation from BTC to altcoins, and then finally to fiat.

As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $113,439, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours.

 TradFi giants made 345 blockchain investments between 2020–2024, with G-SIBs leading 100+ deals across tokenization, custody and payments. 

Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Japan's SBI Group have emerged as the most active players in traditional finance backing blockchain startups, according to a new report by Ripple in partnership with CB Insights and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technologies.

Between 2020 and 2024, global banks participated in 345 investments in blockchain companies, most of them in early-stage funding rounds, per the report. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs led the pack with 18 deals each, while JP Morgan and Mitsubishi UFJ followed closely with 15 investments.

Mega-rounds, deals worth $100 million or more, were a key focus. Banks contributed to 33 such rounds during the four-year window, pouring capital into firms focused on trading infrastructure, tokenization, custody, and payment solutions.

Notable examples include CloudWalk in Brazil, which raised over $750 million across two rounds backed by Banco Itaú and others. Likewise, Solaris in Germany secured over $100 million from SBI Group and later became a majority acquisition target.

Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), a group of financial institutions with such significant economic weight that their failure could trigger global financial instability, accounted for 106 deals, including 14 mega-rounds valued at over $100 million each.

US and Japanese institutions led in deal volume, but Singapore, France, and the UK were also active. In total, over $100 billion was poured into blockchain startups between 2020 and 2024 across more than 10,000 deals globally.

Ripple's survey of over 1,800 global finance leaders also found that 90% believe blockchain and digital assets will have a “significant or massive” impact on the industry within three years.

The momentum is also supported by regulatory developments, including the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in the US and Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) in the EU, both of which provide a clearer framework for digital asset operations.

Backing the investment trend is soaring demand for real-world blockchain applications. According to a Citi report, stablecoin volumes hit $650–$700 billion per month in Q1 2025, and more banks are launching their own stablecoins to offer programmable money without exposure to volatility.

Looking ahead, tokenization is expected to be a defining trend. Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimate that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","New Crypto Pact: Pakistan And Kyrgyzstan Double Down On Blockchain","https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-pact-pakistan-and-kyrgyzstan-double-down-on-blockchain/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 02:00:53 GMT","

Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have taken another step toward closer ties in crypto and blockchain. According to reports, the two countries held a high-level virtual meeting this month.

Bilal Bin Saqib, Pakistan's Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain, spoke with Farkhat Aminov, Director of Kyrgyzstan's National Investment Agency. They agreed to share know-how on digital finance, build joint rules for virtual assets, and push blockchain projects together.

Reports have disclosed that Pakistan wants a formal deal. The country has proposed a Memorandum of Understanding to cement cooperation in the crypto sector.

Pakistan formed its Pakistan Crypto Council after appointing Bin Saqib as special adviser to Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb. Bin Saqib now serves as CEO of the Council, while Aurangzeb acts as its chairman.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed off on Pakistan's Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. That law sets up an independent regulator for cryptocurrencies and virtual assets.

Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor praised Pakistan's steps. He called it a sign that the country knows how to handle this new market.

Reports have also highlighted plans for joint work on blockchain research. Both sides want to run training sessions, share studies, and test new finance tools.

They talked about regulatory checklists, digital wallets, and how to protect investors. They agreed to meet again soon to iron out details and draft the MoU.

Bilateral trade is already on the agenda. According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, officials aim to boost annual trade volume to $100 million.

In the fifth session of their Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, both sides signed several economic and technical cooperation protocols. They want more exports, fresh imports, and revived joint business councils. They will hold trade fairs, B2B meetings, and business forums to spur deals.

Reports say the two governments plan to improve regional routes. They will work on postal services, air links, rail lines, and cargo roads. Both sides see better transport as key to linking landlocked Kyrgyzstan with Pakistan's ports.

Based on reports, the next move is the formal MoU on crypto cooperation. Once signed, it will bind both governments to a shared rulebook. They hope that a clear law will attract global investors and protect local users.

The Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, will guide that process. It spells out licensing rules, audit needs, and penalties for fraud.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Migration to Base: A New Age for Aavegotchi and NFT Gaming","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/aavegotchi-migration-base-nft-gaming","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:54:24 GMT","

So Aavegotchi has officially made the jump over to Base. This move signifies a new beginning in the space of NFT gaming. It's not just any migration; this is one that offers improved scalability and a better user experience. What's interesting is that it gives players real ownership of their assets while also changing how decentralized governance operates through innovative DAOs. Let's unpack this a bit.

The choice to migrate to Base came down to its solid technical foundation. This foundation supports Aavegotchi's evolution from something that felt gamified and NFT-like to a fully-fledged on-chain protocol. Base can handle a lot of transactions for not too much money, making it a great place for gaming applications that need fast interactions and asset management.

One of the standout features of Base is the new app that improves user onboarding. This tool not only makes getting into Aavegotchi easier but also encourages users to self-custody their assets. For a platform like this, reducing barriers is vital. It means easier access for newcomers while keeping existing users engaged.

By moving to Base, Aavegotchi is now in harmony with Ethereum's core values. It didn't have to create a brand new token. This makes it easier for users to engage with the decentralized governance structure, as they can directly participate through DAOs. The absence of a new token also cuts down on complexity, allowing players to focus on the game and the assets they own.

The culture of Base is all about experimentation and composability. It's a match made in heaven for Aavegotchi. This cultural fit is crucial for innovation in the ecosystem and can help the platform tap into the crypto-native business tools that enhance user experiences.

Now that the migration is done, Aavegotchi assets like NFTs, wearables, and game items have been mirrored to Base. Most users will see their assets appear in their Base wallets automatically. So, the transition is generally smooth. For those keen on details, Polygon tokens will stay visible as non-transferable ERC-721 references. Future phases will involve migrating REALM Parcels and in-game items as well.

DAO governance is also set for a shift. Voting will now be limited to GHST holders on Base. It's a strong reminder of how community engagement is key in decentralized platforms. Plus, introducing stablecoin payments might just make transactions easier, which is always a plus.

This migration might change the game for NFT projects. Base has faster transaction speeds and a growing ecosystem, which makes it a serious competitor to Polygon. Considering that more projects are eyeing Base, the NFT and gaming sectors will likely see some dynamic shifts. We could even see a rise in decentralized payroll solutions.

For other NFT projects, Base now presents a real alternative to more established layer-2 solutions. This might speed up Base's adoption and take a bite out of Polygon's market share. The result? New opportunities for innovation within the decentralized ecosystem.

Aavegotchi's migration to Base is more than a simple shift; it's a transformative moment for NFT gaming and decentralized governance. By utilizing Base's infrastructure and user-friendly tools, Aavegotchi is not just looking to improve player experiences but also to redefine what competitiveness looks like in this space. As blockchain gaming continues to gain momentum, Aavegotchi may just set the stage for other projects to follow suit.

NFT sales saw a notable decline last week, as demand for high-profile collections like CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins weakened amid a broader downturn in the crypto market. Data from CryptoSlam reveals that total NFT sales dropped by 10% over the past seven days, reaching $155 million. This decline occurred despite a 20% increase in the number of NFT buyers, sellers, and transactions, indicating a weakening in the average sale price or volume per transaction [1].

CryptoPunks, one of the most iconic NFT collections, experienced a sharp 42% drop in sales to $20.2 million. The decline marked a significant slowdown after a 450% surge in sales over the past month. Despite the recent dip, the collection has generated cumulative sales of over $3.16 billion, maintaining its position as the third-highest selling NFT collection of all time, behind Axie Infinity and Bored Ape Yacht Club [1].

Similarly, Pudgy Penguins saw a 43% decline in sales to $4.6 million, coinciding with a broader bearish trend in the PENGU token, which had dropped 32% from its peak. This decline highlights the interdependence between NFT sales and the performance of associated tokens [1].

Not all collections followed the downward trend. Courtyard NFTs saw a 35% increase in sales to $11.27 million, while Bored Ape Yacht Club sales rose by 10% to $6.26 million. DMarket also reported a 77% surge in sales to $4.84 million, with other collections like Guild of Guardian Heroes, SpinNFTBox, and Sorare contributing to the week's mixed performance [1].

Ethereum-based NFTs continued to outperform other blockchains, with sales rising by 68% to $296 million. Bitcoin and Solana-based NFTs also saw gains, with sales increasing by 42% and 10% to $77 million and $10 million, respectively. In contrast, Polygon-based NFTs underperformed, with sales declining by 59%, largely due to a 25% drop in Courtyard NFT sales [1].

The fluctuation in NFT sales is closely tied to the broader performance of the crypto market. Historically, NFT activity tends to surge during bullish phases of major cryptocurrencies. For instance, in July, Bitcoin's record highs drove most altcoins upward, which in turn fueled a surge in NFT sales. Analysts suggest that the current bearish sentiment in the crypto market is likely to continue affecting NFT sales in the near term [1].

The Bank of Botswana has announced the initiation of an exploratory feasibility study to evaluate the potential launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) [1]. This preliminary assessment comes as part of the country's broader effort to integrate emerging financial technologies into its monetary framework, aligning with a global trend of central banks exploring digital currency options. At this stage, no final decisions have been made regarding implementation [1].

The proposed CBDC could enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of Botswana's financial system by providing a secure, transparent, and potentially more accessible means of transaction. Particularly in rural areas where traditional banking infrastructure is limited, a digital currency could expand financial inclusion and streamline economic activity. Additionally, it may improve the effectiveness of monetary policy and facilitate smoother cross-border trade operations [1].

The feasibility study will involve a detailed analysis of technical, legal, and economic considerations. This includes evaluating the necessary infrastructure, developing a regulatory framework, and understanding the potential impact on existing financial institutions and consumers. Cybersecurity will also be a key focus area, as the bank aims to implement robust safeguards to protect user data and assets [1].

While Botswana is not alone in exploring CBDCs, its approach emphasizes a measured and tailored implementation that reflects local conditions and technological readiness. The bank has indicated it will seek input from financial institutions, technology partners, and the public to ensure that any future digital currency initiative aligns with the country's economic priorities and societal needs [1].

The initiative reflects Botswana's commitment to modernizing its financial ecosystem and staying engaged with international developments in digital finance. As the study progresses, the central bank aims to address potential challenges and opportunities, ensuring that the project remains aligned with both global best practices and local economic realities [1].

ByCharles Lloyd Bovaird II,

 Senior Contributor. 

Solana's SOL and Ripple's XRP are very popular digital tokens. Both of these tokens have drawn the interest of investors around the world, and they have managed to become some of the most valuable digital assets by total market capitalization.

Investors might consider putting their money into one, or both, of these cryptocurrencies, so this guide can help provide them with information they need to make well-informed decisions.

SOL is the native digital asset of Solana, a high-performance blockchain platform that developers can use to create apps. The platform is capable of handling impressive amounts of transactions, so interested parties can build all kinds of software programs on it. Solana has a unique proof-of-stake (POS) consensus mechanism that uses an innovation called proof-of-history (POH), which helps enable significant transaction volume.

Another major draw of Solana is its low transaction fees. At the time of this writing, Solana's median fee per transaction was $0.00064, which was far lower than Ethereum's median fee of roughly $0.51.

XRP is the native digital asset of a blockchain called the XRP ledger, which can settle transactions in a time frame of three to five seconds. XRP can function as a bridge currency, meaning that it can be used to exchange one fiat currency for another without relying on a centralized intermediary like a financial institution or bank. Ripple has generated significant visibility over the years, and its digital asset, XRP, has repeatedly ranked as one of the most valuable digital currencies by total market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap.

One major draw of XRP is its low transaction fees; the token can settle transactions for $0.0002 each.

Solana uses a POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH, in which the system provides each individual block with a timestamp. This unique innovation has provided the Solana network with high bandwidth and very low transaction costs. The platform processes thousands of transactions per second.

Ripple relies on a blockchain called the XRP Ledger, which records all transactions involving XRP. The ledger has its own unique consensus mechanism called the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, which is capable of approving transactions even if some participants do not act appropriately.

Solana can process thousands of transactions per second, due to its unique POS consensus mechanism that relies on POH. At the time of this writing, the network was processing roughly 3,750 transactions per second, according to the Solana homepage. Ripple, on the other hand, can process 1,500 transactions per second.

Both Solana and Ripple use smart contracts, although they are used for different purposes. Solana is a platform for decentralized applications or dApps, and its smart contracts are called “programs.” Users can harness these contracts by executing transactions that contain instructions telling them what to do.

Ripple smart contracts are different in that they allow participants to make transactions without a centralized intermediary. Ripple smart contracts work by holding funds in conditionally held escrows. Once the needed conditions are met, the escrows release the relevant funds.

There is more than one way of measuring a digital asset's adoption, with one of those being transaction volume. As mentioned, the Solana network can process roughly 3,750 transactions per second. Figures for XRP transactions on the Ripple network came with a monthly cadence, and the network processed more than 10 billion XRP transactions every month between July 2024 and July 2027, according to XRPSCAN figures from The Block.

If one wants to evaluate SOL and XRP as speculative assets, they can look at the total market capitalization of these digital currencies. At the time of this writing, XRP was the third-largest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. Solana's SOL was the sixth-largest by this particular measure.

The XRP token has gone from being worth $0.01 in late 2013 to roughly $3.21 at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. This represents an increase of roughly 32,000%. There are many predictions involving the XRP cryptocurrency. One such prediction, which appeared on the Binance website, indicated that the digital token would be worth close to $4 by 2030. The page displaying this prediction stated that the exact figures contained were formulated based on the input of verified Binance users and third parties.

The SOL token has also displayed some very impressive returns over the years, going from roughly $0.66 in April 2020 to approximately $187.00 at the time of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap. This represented a gain of more than 28,000%. Some analysts have predicted that under certain conditions, the SOL token could surpass $1,000 by 2030, according to a Benzinga article. More specifically, this price forecast is based on Solana's ability to scale successfully while avoiding security issues. However, other market observers are less bullish, voicing their concerns about Solana's repeated network failures and competition from rival platforms like Ethereum.

The regulatory environment is still far from mature, and this creates uncertainty for both SOL and XRP. In July 2025, the crypto community lauded the approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), the first piece of federal legislation specifically written for cryptocurrencies. However, policymakers have a long way to go, as U.S. lawmakers were considering both the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act at the time of this writing.

As of now, the extent to which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have jurisdiction over digital currencies has not been clarified. More specifically, the CFTC has asserted that it has jurisdiction over virtual currencies under the Commodity Exchange Act, a claim that has been upheld in federal court.

However, the SEC has previously taken action against those involved with certain digital currencies. The CLARITY Act is meant to shed some light on exactly where the jurisdiction of these two government agencies lies.

In 2023, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase and Binance.US, in which it claimed that SOL was an unregistered security, according to CoinDesk. The Solana Foundation, a nonprofit whose website describes it as being “dedicated to the decentralization, adoption, and security of the Solana ecosystem,” disagreed with this assertion, claiming that SOL is not a security.

The regulatory status of XRP is complicated. In 2023, a federal judge ruled that Ripple's sales of XRP to institutions did in fact represent sales of unregistered securities. However, the same judge decided that Ripple's sales of XRP through exchanges did not represent sales of securities. At the time, the judge fined Ripple $125 million, according to CoinDesk.

While Ripple had previously stated that it planned to appeal, CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated in June 2025 that “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they've previously said.”

This should leave the current ruling, along with the $125 million fine, in place.

XRP is meant to provide liquidity for those looking to send money from one place to another. A good use case for these is remittances, where an individual might send money to their relatives overseas. By using XRP, a user can make a cross-border payment that will settle quite quickly. The XRP token can also be used as a bridge currency, making it so that parties can make a transaction using two different fiat currencies without going through a centralized intermediary like a financial institution.

The XRP token is also used to pay for transactions that take place on the XRP ledger.

SOL has many use cases. For starters, it is the native digital asset of the Solana network, and as a result, users harness it to pay the network's transaction fees. Some of these rewards then go to validators.

Another use case of SOL is staking. Users can stake their SOL in order to contribute to the security of the network and also earn rewards by doing so.

Past that, holders of SOL can use the token to vote on potential network upgrades.

Both SOL and XRP have experienced some very impressive upside during their lifetimes. Past that, analysts have made some very bullish predictions about how much the two digital tokens could appreciate. As stated earlier in this article, one prediction contained on the Binance website indicated that XRP could be worth over $4 by 2030. A separate panel of experts, whose input was featured in a Benzinga article, stated that XRP could reach $5.81 this year.

Analysts have also supplied bullish predictions for SOL, with market observers stating in a Binance article that it could surpass $180 this year and $230 by 2030.

Investors should keep in mind that both XRP and SOL are speculative assets. They are not like stocks, which represent ownership rights in companies that generate revenue and earnings. They also don't make regular interest payments like many bonds. In other words, interested parties cannot perform fundamental analysis on XRP and SOL the same way they would analyze shares of stock (or bonds).

Nobody knows what the future will hold. However, investors may want to keep in mind that SOL is the native digital asset of the Solana blockchain, which has benefited from significant activity over the years. In 2024, more than 80% of decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions took place on the Solana network, according to a Helius report. Further, during the first five months of this year, close to $900 billion' worth of DEX trading volume took place on this network.

Ripple, on the other hand, has been relevant for over a decade. Ripple first came into existence in 2012, and its native token has therefore been around longer than Solana's SOL, as Solana first became available to the public in 2020. Ripple's XRP also benefits from a robust community, which has some very enthusiastic supporters. The engagement this token receives on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) is a testament to how much support it has.

Bottom Line

Investors considering XRP and SOL need to remember that while these two have both generated significant visibility and some very compelling gains over the years, they are both speculative assets that do not produce income, revenue or earnings.

Risk is inherent to investment, and it is difficult to reliably predict how these digital assets will perform in the future. At the same time, investors should remember that if the entire crypto space continues to draw investment and rise in value, SOL and XRP could both continue to appreciate.

Which Has A Higher ChanceOof Mass Adoption, SOL or XRP?

Nobody knows for certain what the future will hold. However, if the future mirrors what has happened in the past, Solana's SOL has a better chance of obtaining mass adoption, considering how much traction it has generated during its relatively brief lifespan. 

Is SOLOor XRP Better For Short-term Trading? 

Short-term cryptocurrency trading is highly risky and subject to market manipulation, and it would be difficult to name one of these digital assets as better for this particular purpose. Any investors who are considering such activity should perform thorough due diligence. 

What Are The Biggest Risks For Investing In SOL? 

SOL is a purely speculative asset, and its price is driven by factors like hype and sentiment. Many have described Solana as an “Ethereum killer,” and its native token SOL could potentially fall in value if competitor platforms rise in popularity. 

What Are The Biggest Risks For investing In XRP? 

XRP is a purely speculative asset, and its price fluctuations are driven by hope and sentiment. The XRP token has generated significant visibility as the native token of the XRP Ledger, and if one or more competitors take the market position of this blockchain, it could cause the XRP token to lose favor and fall in value. 

Is It A Good Idea To Hold Both SOL and XRP?

While diversification, or not putting all your eggs in one basket, is always a good idea, there are many ways to establish a diverse portfolio of digital assets without owning both SOL and XRP. There are thousands of digital assets available, and if investors are considering any of them, they can benefit from conducting thorough due diligence.

Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency is currently trading around $2.87 at press time after earlier losses. While the major digital asset is under pressure right now, analysis shows that its spot price is expected to appreciate strongly in the coming months. The $5 price target is expected to come into play near the end of the 2025 bull market. Still, Ripple's flagship digital currency is also likely to run into problems above it, as the liquidity map shows a black hole above the key resistance level.

According to popular cryptocurrency analyst Steph, XRP may start to face significant short-selling activity above $5. He tweeted “#XRP LIQUIDITY MAP SHOWS A BLACK HOLE ABOVE $5. BREAKOUT COULD GET VIOLENT” and posted this liquidity graph on X (formerly Twitter) in support of his argument:

The graph clearly shows a drastic drop in liquidity for the major digital asset once it overcomes the long-term price target of $5. This clearly correlates to the black hole concept in asset liquidity and could spell significant trouble for the digital currency if it isn't addressed on time. 

A liquidity black hole is a dreaded market phenomenon in which liquidity dries up suddenly, causing short sellers and spot traders to engage in a constant loop of selling, causing violent price swings and affecting the stability of the asset. 

This is very similar in practice to the concept of a bank run, in which depositors rush to financial institutions and make large withdrawals, resulting in an immediate liquidity crunch. It is a situation that a major cryptocurrency like XRP needs to avoid at all costs, or traders will pay a significant price.

Ripple, the parent company of the XRP project, may be able to improve liquidity as it still controls a large portion of the cryptocurrency's supply as part of its centralized infrastructure. However, any such liquidity management exercise will be made complex because of its escrow system.

In 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion of its XRP holdings into a cryptographically secured escrow. This system is designed to release a maximum of 1 billion XRP each month and not more. That is around $5 billion worth of XRP that it can use to manage liquidity on a monthly basis. 

It remains to be seen whether this control over market liquidity will be able to save XRP through a soft landing tactic so that it can perform at an optimum level near the culmination of the 2025 bull market.

ByGene Marks,

 Contributor. 

Here are five things in tech that happened this week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?

PayPal has launched a new feature called “Pay with Crypto”, allowing U.S. merchants to accept payments in over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. For the first year, merchants pay a promotional fee of $0.99 per transaction, then 1.5 percent thereafter. Customers pay with crypto via wallets like Coinbase or MetaMask. PayPal converts the crypto into its stablecoin PYUSD, then into U.S. dollars for the merchant This move follows the launch of PayPal World – a global partnership connecting major digital wallets. PayPal president and CEO Alex Chriss said, “These innovations don't just simplify payments – they drive merchant growth, expand consumer choice, and reduce costs.” (Source: Bitcoin Magazine)

Can we agree that cryptocurrency is becoming a real currency? It's been around now for years and has grown not only in popularity but stability. The President has his own meme coin for goodness sake! Where is this heading? For me, it's obvious. More consumers will be using crypto in the not-too-distant future for their daily transactions in lieu of options in order to avoid fees. And more merchants will encourage the use for this reason. PayPal, a respected brand in the financial services space, is jumping ahead of this. It's a big step forward.

HubSpot has officially launched its first CRM connector for Anthropic's Claude, bringing real-time customer context into the AI assistant to supercharge business workflows. Teams can ask questions in plain language about their CRM data and Claude can generate tailored answers/summaries based on each team's unique context in HubSpot. For example, marketing teams can ask Claude to locate a contact who opened an email campaign but didn't click through. Sales teams can request a summary of active deals by name and amount. Visualizations like charts and graphs can be generated for further analysis. Users only see CRM data they're authorized to access. The CRM connector is available to all HubSpot customers with a paid Claude subscription. (Source: MarTech Cube)

Make no mistake: this is a reporting tool. And that's a good thing. Enabling users to do more natural language queries of their data and get quick, intelligent responses has long been an unreachable goal for many CRM administrators. For now at least, nothing is being done with this data other than displaying it on demand for users. I'm hoping as integrations like these evolve, more agentic AI options will appear.

Business Technology News #3 – Amazon pulls out of Google Shopping ads.

Amazon has made a dramatic global retreat from Google Shopping ad auctions, ending its participation across 20 international domains. This sudden move is shaking up the digital advertising landscape. In just days, Amazon went from appearing in 30 percent of Shopping auctions to zero – affecting millions of impressions. Experts call the shift “colossal,” likening it to Amazon's pandemic-era ad pullback. Many of speculated on what's behind this decision suggesting Amazon is shifting toward its own ecosystem, or this was a strategic pause after Prime Day. It remains to be seen if this is temporary or a long-term strategy shift, but Amazon's disappearance is reshaping ad dynamics – giving competitors a rare chance to shine. (Source: Search Engine Land)

I'm not so surprised. Amazon is an e-commerce search giant on its own. Does it really need Google? When I search for products I usually go right to Amazon. And even if I find a product on Google I see if Amazon carries it. I imagine many consumers do the same. I'm betting Amazon looked at the ROI – given this kind of behavior – and determined it best to cut their participating with Google. I wouldn't be too concerned if I was an Amazon merchant.

President Trump's newly unveiled AI Action Plan aims to supercharge U.S. innovation by cutting red tape and accelerating AI development – but it's not just for Big Tech. Small businesses could see major ripple effects. Deregulation means more AI tools hitting the market – voice assistants, automated lead follow-ups, and social media content generators could become more accessible to small firms. With fewer barriers, mom-and-pop shops might afford AI tools that were once reserved for enterprise giants. However fewer rules mean more risks and small businesses must vet tools carefully for security, reliability, and ethics. Trump's action plan is a significant opportunity for startups who offer AI solutions like chatbots and marketing automation. To stay ahead, small businesses should train their teams of basic AI literacy and AI tools that are tailored to their industry. (Source: Times Square Chronicles)

One other thing: until this legislation appeared many states were taking it upon themselves to regulate the use of AI and my expectation is that activity will also decline. On the one hand, various rules from all over place would create more complications for businesses using AI. On the other hand, AI is scary. But – being in the space myself – I never felt confident that government regulation would do much to stop its growth so I'm in agreement that we might as well lean into it.

Anthropic gave its AI model – Claude (nicknamed “Claudius”) – full control of a real-world vending business and the results were both fascinating and hilariously chaotic. A small shop was set up with a with a fridge, baskets, and an iPad for checkout. Instructed to operate as a business owner, Claudius handled inventory, pricing, customer service, and supplier negotiations. Human staff acted as physical proxies, restocking based on Claudius' instructions. The results were mixed. There were inventory missteps and a discount disaster where Claudius gave 25 percent off to Anthropic employees – nearly all its customers. Claudius also hallucinated a fictitious employee. On the positive side, the AI was able to find niche suppliers quickly, it created a “custom concierge” service and resisted unethical requests. Anthropic's takeaway: Despite losing money, the experiment showed AI's potential in business roles – with major caveats. Anthropic believes AI middle managers could be viable with better tools and safeguards. (Source: AI News)

This is like letting a high school kid running a business. They're going to make stupid mistakes. But that high school kid – like its AI counterpart – will ultimately get older and more experienced. And when that happens they're better suited to do many of the tasks they couldn't do before. It's inevitable.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Cryptocurrency integration in online betting platforms is streamlining the withdrawal process, enabling users to access their winnings instantly without the delays associated with traditional banking systems. Spartans, a crypto-focused betting site, is at the forefront of this shift, offering users the ability to withdraw funds in real-time by leveraging blockchain technology. Unlike conventional platforms such as Bet365 or BetMGM, which often require identity verification, bank confirmations, and processing times, Spartans eliminates these steps, allowing bettors to transfer their crypto directly to supported wallets without the need for documentation or third-party approvals [1].

The platform supports major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA), with users able to link their wallets—such as Trust Wallet, MetaMask, or Coinbase Wallet—to facilitate fast, seamless transactions [1]. Spartans also provides clear guidelines for users, including the visibility of minimum withdrawal limits and transaction fees for each token, ensuring transparency and minimizing confusion during the cashout process [1].

Users are advised to confirm their eligibility to withdraw before initiating the process, particularly if they are using bonuses that require meeting playthrough requirements. Once these conditions are fulfilled, the platform enables near-instant transfers, with users able to track their transactions using blockchain IDs provided after submission [1]. The entire process, from withdrawal request to receipt in the wallet, can take only a few minutes for stablecoins like USDT, while other tokens may require a few confirmations [1].

This innovation is particularly appealing to bettors who value speed and autonomy in their financial transactions. By removing intermediaries and bypassing bank processing times, crypto-powered betting platforms like Spartans are redefining user expectations and driving broader adoption of digital assets in the online gambling sector [1]. As more platforms explore similar models, the betting industry is likely to see continued improvements in transaction efficiency and user trust [1].

The rise of instant crypto cashouts is also influencing regulatory conversations, as authorities seek to address concerns related to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and user education. While the technology offers significant advantages in terms of speed and transparency, it also presents challenges that require careful oversight. Nonetheless, the trend reflects the growing role of blockchain in financial services, particularly in sectors where rapid access to funds is essential [1].

Delivering real-time insights and analysis on emerging financial trends and market movements.

In the ever-shifting landscape of disruptive innovation, Cathie Wood's latest moves have sparked a critical debate: Is the reallocation of capital from crypto-centric assets to AI-driven infrastructure a fleeting correction or the dawn of a new investment paradigm? With the U.S. economy navigating a “rolling recession” and geopolitical trade tensions simmering, the contrast between crypto's macroeconomic resilience and AI's productivity-driven potential has never been more stark.  

The Post-Pause Market: Uncertainty as a CatalystThe “post-pause” environment refers to the temporary suspension of Trump-era tariff escalations, which briefly stabilized global supply chains and triggered a short-lived rebound in crypto markets. Bitcoin, for instance, surged to $119,000 in early 2025 amid reduced trade tensions, only to face renewed volatility as policy uncertainty persisted. Meanwhile, AI infrastructure—semiconductors, cloud computing, and cybersecurity—has continued to attract capital, even as macroeconomic headwinds persist.  

ARK Invest's recent trades underscore this divergence. In July 2025, the firm sold $2.4 million worth of Block Inc. (SQ) shares, a Bitcoin-linked stock, while simultaneously acquiring 3,351 shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for $601,538. This shift reflects a strategic pivot toward AI hardware, particularly as AMD's Instinct MI350 and MI355X chips challenge Nvidia's dominance. Analysts now project AMD could generate $10 billion in AI GPU revenue by year-end, with its chips offering up to 40% more tokens per dollar than Nvidia's B200.  

 

Crypto's Role in a De-Dollarizing WorldWhile Wood's ETFs have trimmed Bitcoin exposure, her firm has not abandoned crypto entirely. In April 2025, Ark Invest's flagship fund, ARKK, purchased 128,093 shares of Coinbase Global (COIN) for $22.6 million, betting on the exchange's potential to benefit from institutional adoption. Wood's base case for Bitcoin remains ambitious—$700,000 by 2030—highlighting her belief in its role as a hedge against currency devaluation and a store of value in a de-dollarizing world.  

However, the crypto sector faces unique challenges. The U.S. dollar's dominance is under pressure, with emerging markets diversifying reserves into gold and stablecoins pegged to alternative currencies. This trend could accelerate if Trump's 160-page crypto roadmap introduces clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and DeFi. For now, though, crypto remains a volatile asset class, with Bitcoin's 0.90 correlation to equities suggesting it's increasingly viewed as a macroeconomic barometer rather than a speculative play.  

 

AI as the Engine of Productivity-Led GrowthWood's focus on AI infrastructure is rooted in her conviction that innovation will drive the next economic recovery. The U.S. is emerging from a three-year “stealth recession” fueled by high interest rates and sluggish money velocity, but she argues that AI and automation will unlock productivity gains. For example, generative AI has already cut government processing times from days to minutes, a trend she expects to spread across industries.  

The ARK Disruptive Innovation portfolio, now trading at a 13.3% valuation premium to the S&P 500 (down from 278% in 2021), is positioned in “deep value territory.” This suggests that innovation stocks are undervalued relative to traditional benchmarks, creating an opportunity for long-term investors. Wood's recent purchases of AMD and Nvidia—adding $12.2 million in Nvidia shares—signal her belief in the semiconductor sector's ability to power the next wave of AI-driven growth.  

 

Sustainability of the Shift: A Balancing ActIs this shift from crypto to AI sustainable? The answer lies in the interplay between macroeconomic forces and technological progress. While crypto offers a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability, AI provides a foundation for productivity-led growth. Wood's strategy appears to balance both: reducing exposure to Bitcoin-heavy stocks while investing in crypto infrastructure (e.g., Coinbase, Bitmine Immersion) and AI semiconductors.  

For long-term investors, this duality presents a compelling case. AI infrastructure is essential for scaling innovation, but crypto's role as a digital gold standard ensures it remains a strategic asset. The key is diversification—allocating capital to high-potential AI startups while maintaining a crypto position to hedge against macroeconomic risks.  

Investment Takeaways1. AI Infrastructure: Prioritize companies with competitive advantages in AI hardware (e.g., AMD, Nvidia) and cybersecurity (e.g., CrowdStrike, Palantir).2. Crypto Exposure: Maintain a diversified crypto portfolio with a focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum-related infrastructure (e.g., Coinbase, Bitmine Immersion).3. Policy Watch: Monitor regulatory developments in AI and crypto, as policy clarity could catalyze sector-wide growth.  

In the post-pause market, the line between speculative hype and sustainable innovation is blurring. Cathie Wood's strategic reallocation of capital—from Bitcoin-linked stocks to AI semiconductors—reflects a broader shift toward technologies that can withstand economic turbulence while driving productivity. For investors, the challenge is to navigate this duality: leveraging AI's growth potential while hedging against macroeconomic uncertainties with crypto. The winners will be those who recognize that the future of tech-driven growth lies in both.

Your AI policy sleuth, connecting dots between economic decisions and your portfolio's pulse—with a side of snark.

 

In today's fragmented markets, the divergence between technology and crypto stocks has never been more pronounced. While AI infrastructure plays like Celestica Inc. (CLS) are accelerating growth through robust demand and operational leverage, crypto exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) are grappling with maturing market dynamics and valuation pressures. This contrast highlights a critical investment thesis: prioritizing high-growth, fundamentals-driven tech stocks over speculative crypto platforms in an environment where macroeconomic stability and innovation cycles are reshaping capital flows.  

Celestica's Q2 2025 results underscore the power of aligning with structural trends. The company reported $2.89 billion in revenue, a 21% year-over-year increase, driven by its Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS) segment, which grew 28% to $2.07 billion. Hardware Platform Solutions within CCS surged 82% to $1.2 billion, reflecting surging demand for data center infrastructure and AI hardware. Adjusted operating margins hit a record 7.4%, up from 6.3% in Q2 2024, while non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 (54% YoY growth) exceeded guidance by a wide margin.  

These results were not a one-off. Celestica raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to $11.55 billion (up from $10.85 billion) and adjusted EPS to $5.50 (from $5.00), signaling confidence in sustained demand. Share repurchases of $40 million in Q2 further reinforced its commitment to shareholder value. The company's ability to scale margins while expanding into high-growth niches—such as AI-driven cloud solutions—positions it as a bellwether for the broader tech sector.  

 

In stark contrast, Coinbase's Q2 2025 earnings highlighted the fragility of crypto's speculative underpinnings. Despite a $1.43 billion net income driven by a $1.5 billion gain from Circle and crypto investments, the company missed revenue expectations, reporting $1.5 billion (vs. $1.59 billion forecast). Transaction revenue fell 2.1% YoY to $764 million, while retail trading volume—despite a 16% YoY increase—landed below estimates at $43 billion.  

The stock's 15% post-earnings sell-off erased $14.3 billion in market cap, reducing 2025 gains to 40% from a peak of 50%. Analysts like Morningstar labeled the stock “significantly overvalued,” citing declining trading volumes and operational costs outpacing revenue growth. While Coinbase's stablecoin and subscription services showed promise, its core trading business—a bellwether for crypto's broader appeal—remains vulnerable to macroeconomic shifts and regulatory uncertainty.  

 

The divergence between these two stocks reflects broader macroeconomic forces. AI infrastructure is now a defensive-growth hybrid, with demand anchored by enterprise adoption and cloud expansion. Celestica's performance mirrors that of peers like NVIDIA and AMD, whose revenue cycles are tied to the insatiable demand for computing power.  

Meanwhile, crypto platforms face a dual challenge: maturing markets and regulatory ambiguity. While Coinbase benefits from stablecoin adoption and tokenized assets, its reliance on speculative trading volumes exposes it to volatility. Rising interest rates and a shift in Washington's focus to tariffs (rather than crypto-friendly policies) further cloud the outlook.  

For investors, the lesson is clear: favor companies with durable cash flows and clear growth levers over those dependent on speculative tailwinds. Celestica's disciplined capital allocation, margin expansion, and alignment with AI's long-term trajectory make it a compelling play. Its raised guidance and active share buybacks also signal management's confidence in its intrinsic value.  

Coinbase, while innovative, remains a high-risk bet. Its earnings beat was a one-time event (investment gains), not a reflection of sustainable growth. The company's ability to diversify into tokenized assets and derivatives could unlock value, but execution risks and regulatory headwinds cannot be ignored.  

 

As markets grapple with a post-pandemic landscape and the AI revolution, investors must distinguish between transient trends and enduring value. Celestica's outperformance against Coinbase's earnings miss is not an anomaly—it reflects the growing divide between tech stocks with tangible, demand-driven growth and crypto platforms still seeking a sustainable business model.  

For those seeking to capitalize on the next phase of innovation, the path forward is clear: allocate capital to AI infrastructure plays with robust fundamentals, and approach crypto exchanges with a critical eye, reserving exposure for those with defensible moats and diversified revenue streams. In a world where macro risks persist and innovation cycles accelerate, discipline and clarity of vision will separate the winners from the casualties.""""

XRP fell nearly 9% in 24 hours, driven by institutional selling, with volumes more than doubling the daily average.

The asset found short-term support at $2.75, but recovery efforts stalled below key resistance at $2.84.

Global trade tensions and macroeconomic shifts contributed to the broader sell-off, affecting risk markets.

XRP plunged nearly 9% in the 24-hour session ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), falling from $3.02 to as low as $2.75 before staging a mild recovery to $2.82. The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated.

The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off.

Dogecoin fell 4% in 24 hours, dropping from $0.20 to $0.19 amid increased trading activity and global economic concerns.

Trading volumes surged significantly, indicating strong selling pressure and high-conviction exits from the market.

DOGE faced resistance at $0.202–$0.203, while support formed around $0.188–$0.190, suggesting potential for continued volatility.

Dogecoin fell 4% in the 24-hour period ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), slipping from $0.20 to as low as $0.19 amid sharp spikes in trading activity and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. The move came as risk sentiment deteriorated globally, triggering institutional outflows across volatile crypto assets, particularly meme coins.

DOGE's decline came amid renewed global trade tensions following the expiration of a reciprocal tariff framework, which has left 92 countries facing elevated trade barriers. The Federal Reserve held rates steady this week, opting to monitor trade data, which has reduced market odds of a September rate cut and weighed heavily on high-beta assets.

 TradFi giants made 345 blockchain investments between 2020–2024, with G-SIBs leading 100+ deals across tokenization, custody and payments. 

Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Japan's SBI Group have emerged as the most active players in traditional finance backing blockchain startups, according to a new report by Ripple in partnership with CB Insights and the UK Centre for Blockchain Technologies.

Between 2020 and 2024, global banks participated in 345 investments in blockchain companies, most of them in early-stage funding rounds, per the report. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs led the pack with 18 deals each, while JP Morgan and Mitsubishi UFJ followed closely with 15 investments.

Mega-rounds, deals worth $100 million or more, were a key focus. Banks contributed to 33 such rounds during the four-year window, pouring capital into firms focused on trading infrastructure, tokenization, custody, and payment solutions.

Notable examples include CloudWalk in Brazil, which raised over $750 million across two rounds backed by Banco Itaú and others. Likewise, Solaris in Germany secured over $100 million from SBI Group and later became a majority acquisition target.

Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), a group of financial institutions with such significant economic weight that their failure could trigger global financial instability, accounted for 106 deals, including 14 mega-rounds valued at over $100 million each.

US and Japanese institutions led in deal volume, but Singapore, France, and the UK were also active. In total, over $100 billion was poured into blockchain startups between 2020 and 2024 across more than 10,000 deals globally.

Ripple's survey of over 1,800 global finance leaders also found that 90% believe blockchain and digital assets will have a “significant or massive” impact on the industry within three years.

The momentum is also supported by regulatory developments, including the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in the US and Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) in the EU, both of which provide a clearer framework for digital asset operations.

Backing the investment trend is soaring demand for real-world blockchain applications. According to a Citi report, stablecoin volumes hit $650–$700 billion per month in Q1 2025, and more banks are launching their own stablecoins to offer programmable money without exposure to volatility.

Looking ahead, tokenization is expected to be a defining trend. Boston Consulting Group and Ripple estimate that tokenized real-world assets could exceed $18 trillion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate of 53%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bearish Arthur Hayes says Bitcoin could retrace to $100K on macro headwinds","https://cointelegraph.com/news/arthur-hayes-says-bitcoin-may-fall-amid-macro-concerns","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 05:24:02 GMT","

 Bitcoin and Ether could fall back toward the $100,000 and $3,000 level amid concerns of more tariffs, a sluggish credit market and slowed job creation, Arthur Hayes argues. 

Maelstrom Fund chief investment officer Arthur Hayes has warned that mounting macroeconomic pressures could drag Bitcoin back down to the $100,000 level — and he's already taken crypto profits in anticipation.

Hayes linked the recent crypto pullback to renewed tariff fears sparked by the disappointing Non-Farm Payrolls report, which showed just 73,000 new jobs added in the US in July — a sign of economic fragility.

Hayes also pointed to sluggish credit growth in major economies stunting nominal gross domestic product growth in warning that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) could fall further toward the $100,000 and $3,000 levels.

His comments on Saturday came in response to an X post from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, which highlighted that Hayes recently offloaded $8.32 million worth of ETH, $4.62 million of Ethena (ENA) and $414,700 of the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin.

The Hayes' wallet that carried out the recent selloffs now holds $28.3 million worth of tokens, with $22.95 million parked in the USDC (USDC) stablecoin, according to Arkham Intelligence data.

Hayes' comments echo wider fears that macro headwinds could stall crypto's momentum. Tight credit, renewed tariffs and a softening job market may pressure risk-on assets, testing investor conviction and potentially triggering a correction.

Bitcoin has fallen over 7.7% from the $123,000 all-time high it set on July 14, while Ether is down 12.5% since eclipsing the $3,900 barrier on July 28, CoinGecko data shows.

A Bitcoin price drop to $100,000 would mark an 18.7% correction.

However, many industry analysts think Bitcoin is past the days of major double-digit pullbacks.

Among them is Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that since BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF filing in June 2023, Bitcoin has experienced “much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns.”

This strange microscopic structure may whisper ancient evolutionary secrets.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

We're not sure if it's exciting or not that scientists just discovered new ‘lifeforms' inside of our bodies. Tiny bits of RNA, smaller than a virus, colonize bacteria inside our mouths and guts and have the power to transfer information that can be read by a cell.

Dubbed ‘wildly weird' by the team of Stanford scientists writing about the find in Nature, the discovery now has a name: obelisks. And we ... don't really know their end goal. 

“It's insane,” said Mark Peifer, a cell and developmental biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, according to Science. “The more we look, the more crazy things we see.” 

Named obelisks because of their rod-shaped structures, they are even smaller than viruses, but they can still transmit instructions to cells. What they're saying, however, we just don't know. 

The microscopic entities, according to an explanation written in The Conversation by University of Bath microbial evolution professor Ed Feil, are “circular bits of genetic material that contain one or two genes and self-organize into a rod-like shape.” 

They are, potentially, itsy-bitsy ‘lifeforms.' The preprint paper from Stanford calls them “viroid-like”—a viroid is one step down from a virus. While a virus needs a host to allow it to replicate, that hasn't slowed them down. We've lost count of just how many viruses this world has to offer because they are so plentiful. 

But a viroid is even more simplistic—a scrap of genetic RNA that cannot make proteins, but can regroup, and has been known to plague flowering plants. 

“The newly discovered biological entity falls somewhere between viruses and viroids,” Feil wrote. He added that, like viroids, the obelisks have a circular, single-stranded RNA genome and no protein coat. But, like viruses, their genomes contain genes that are predicted to code for proteins. 

And it isn't like the Stanford researchers found just one of these things—they located nearly 30,000 distinct types of obelisk. That's just for starters. They were located in every demographic corner of the world, and were typically found in the mouth (but also in the gut). 

Now the task becomes sussing out if these obelisks are friend or foe. Scientists want to learn about the host cells that they needs to replicate, how bacteria and fungi play roles in their function, and what their true purpose really is.

While chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of lung cancer treatment, it often weakens the immune system it relies on for long-term control. Now, researchers have found a way to turn this weakness into strength -- by transplanting healthy mitochondria into the tumor environment. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combining mitochondrial transplantation with cisplatin not only enhanced immune cell infiltration but also reversed tumor metabolism and improved the drug's effectiveness. This innovative approach transforms mitochondria from mere energy suppliers into active allies in cancer therapy, showing potential to reshape how we treat aggressive lung tumors.

Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, yet its effectiveness is hampered by toxic side effects and emerging resistance. Moreover, chemotherapy damages immune cells and reduces their presence in the tumor microenvironment, limiting long-term control. Adding to this challenge, tumors can hijack immune cell mitochondria through nanotube-like structures, further dampening immunity. Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for some, but many patients still fail to respond. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for strategies that restore immune power and metabolic balance during chemotherapy.

Researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine and Nantong University published a study in Cancer Biology & Medicine that introduces a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. They investigated whether direct mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. By combining functional mitochondria with cisplatin, the team aimed to not only improve tumor response but also restore immune vigor inside the tumor microenvironment. Their findings mark a significant step toward integrative treatments that energize both cells and immunity.

The researchers isolated functional mitochondria from human cardiomyocytes -- cells known for their high energy output -- and transplanted them into NSCLC tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Alone, mitochondrial transplantation did not harm cancer cells, but when combined with cisplatin, it significantly amplified tumor suppression. This synergy reduced the IC50 of cisplatin from 12.93 μM to 6.7 μM, indicating greater drug sensitivity. Tumors in mice shrank more dramatically with the combination therapy than with chemotherapy alone, and immune infiltration markedly increased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a striking shift in tumor metabolism: downregulation of glycolysis and hypoxia genes, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways -- reversing the Warburg effect. Markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, P53) and stemness (HIF-1α, CD44, CD133) were suppressed. Importantly, mitochondrial transplantation also restored mitochondrial activity in immune cells, enhancing the function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The treatment caused no additional toxicity and preserved body weight and organ integrity. This work demonstrates that mitochondria can serve as metabolic and immunologic reinforcements, transforming the tumor landscape into one more susceptible to immune attack and chemotherapy.

""This research introduces a powerful dual-action strategy,"" said Dr. Liuliu Yuan, lead investigator of the study. ""By replenishing immune cells with functional mitochondria, we are not just enhancing their energy -- but restoring their ability to fight. At the same time, tumor cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. It's like rearming the immune system while disarming the tumor. This could be a promising avenue for patients who don't respond well to conventional treatment.""

This discovery lays the groundwork for a new therapeutic paradigm -- one that leverages the mitochondria's unique biology to augment cancer treatment. In patients with advanced NSCLC, mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs while minimizing immune suppression. Beyond lung cancer, this approach may extend to other tumors where immune dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming are barriers to treatment success. With further refinement and clinical trials, mitochondrial transfer could evolve into a versatile platform for combination therapies, helping clinicians push past the current limits of cancer care and into a new era of bioenergetic and immune restoration.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists unveil bioplastic that degrades at room temperature, and outperforms petroplastics","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803011823.htm","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 08:29:45 GMT","

Society has long struggled with petroleum-derived plastic pollution, and awareness of microplastics' detrimental effects on food and water supplies adds further pressure.

In response, researchers have been developing biodegradable versions of traditional plastics, or ""bioplastics."" However, current bioplastics face challenges as well: Current versions are not as strong as petrochemical-based plastics and they only degrade through a high-temperature composting system.

Enter researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, who have solved both problems with inspiration from the humble leaf. Long before plastic, humans wrapped their food in leaves, which easily biodegrade due to an underlying structure of cellulose-rich cell walls. WashU's chemical engineers decided to introduce cellulose nanofibers to the design of bioplastics.

""We created this multilayer structure where cellulose is in the middle and the bioplastics are on two sides,"" said Joshua Yuan, the Lucy and Stanley Lopata Professor and chair of energy, environmental and chemical engineering at the McKelvey School of Engineering. Yuan is also director for the National Science Foundation-funded Carbon Utilization Redesign for Biomanufacturing (CURB) Engineering Research Center. ""In this way, we created a material that is very strong and that offers multifunctionality,"" he added.

The technology emerged from working with two of the highest production bioplastics today. In a study published in Green Chemistry earlier this year, Yuan and colleagues used a variation of their leaf-inspired cellulose nanofiber structure to improve the strength and biodegradability of polyhydroxybutrate (PHB), a starch-derived plastic; they further refined their technique for polylactic acid (PLA), as detailed in a new paper just published in Nature Communications.

The plastic packaging market is a $23.5 billion industry dominated by polyethylene and polypropylene, polymers made from petroleum that break down into harmful microplastics. The researchers' optimized bioplastic, called Layered, Ecological, Advanced and multi-Functional Film (LEAFF), turned PLA into a packaging material that is biodegradable at room temperature. Additionally, the structure allows for other critical properties, such as low air or water permeability, helping keep food stable, and a surface that is printable. This improves bioplastics' affordability since it saves manufacturers from printing separate labels for packaging.

""On top of all of this, the LEAFF's underlying cellulose structure gives it a higher tensile strength than even petrochemical plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene,"" explained Puneet Dhatt, a PhD student in Yuan's lab and first author on the article.

The innovation was in adding that cellulosic structure that WashU's engineers replicated, cellulose fibrils embedded within the bioplastics.

""This unique biomimicking design allows us to address the limitations of bioplastic usage and overcome that technical barrier and allow for broader bioplastic utilization,"" Yuan said.

Circular economy ready

The United States is uniquely positioned to dominate the bioplastics market and establish a ""circular economy"" wherein waste products are reused, fed back into systems instead of left to pollute the air and water or sit in landfills.

Yuan hopes this technology can scale up soon and seeks commercial and philanthropic partners to help bring these improved processes to industry. Competitors from Asian and European research institutions also are working to develop similar technology. But U.S. industries have an advantage due to the country's vast agriculture system -- and WashU is near the center of the nation's agrichemical industry.

""The U.S. is particularly strong in agriculture,"" Yuan said. ""We can provide the feedstock for bioplastic production at a lower price compared to other parts of the world.""

The ""feedstock"" Yuan is referring to are chemicals such as lactic acid, acetate or fatty acids like oleate, products of corn or starch fermentation by microbes that serve as bioplastic factories.

Pseudomonas putida, for instance is a microbial strain widely used in the fermentation industry, including to produce a variety of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), including PHB.

McKelvey Engineering researchers have designed ways to convert various wastes, including carbon dioxide, lignin and food waste, into bioplastics using strains such as P. putida. With improved bioplastic design, Yuan's research further fills in that loop, with a version of PHB and PLA that could be produced much more efficiently and degrade safely into the environment.

""The United States has a waste problem, and circular reuse could go a long way to turning that waste into useful materials,"" Yuan said. ""If we can ramp up our bioplastic supply chain, it would create jobs and new markets,"" he said.

The study ""Biomimetic layered, ecological, advanced, multi-functional film for sustainable packaging"" was supported by NSF EEC 2330245, NSF MCB 2229160, and U.S. Department of Energy BETO (Bioenergy Technologies Office) Projects.

The study ""Integrated design of multifunctional reinforced bioplastics (MReB) to synergistically enhance strength, degradability, and functionality"" was supported by NSF MCB 2229160, and U.S. Department of Energy BETO (Bioenergy Technologies Office) projects including EE 0007104, DE EE 0008250, and others.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers detect life's building blocks around a young star","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250802022935.htm","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 03:53:32 GMT","

Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), a team of astronomers led by Abubakar Fadul from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) has discovered complex organic molecules - including the first tentative detection of ethylene glycol and glycolonitrile - in the protoplanetary disc of the outbursting protostar V883 Orionis. These compounds are considered precursors to the building blocks of life. Comparing different cosmic environments reveals that the abundance and complexity of such molecules increase from star-forming regions to fully evolved planetary systems. This suggests that the seeds of life are assembled in space and are widespread. The findings were published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters today.

Astronomers have discovered complex organic molecules (COMs) in various locations associated with planet and star formation before. COMs are molecules with more than five atoms, at least one of which is carbon. Many of them are considered building blocks of life, such as amino acids and nucleic acids or their precursors. The discovery of 17 COMs in the protoplanetary disc of V883 Orionis, including ethylene glycol and glycolonitrile, provides a long-sought puzzle piece in the evolution of such molecules between the stages preceding and following the formation of stars and their planet-forming discs. Glycolonitrile is a precursor of the amino acids glycine and alanine, as well as the nucleobase adenine.

The assembly of prebiotic molecules begins in interstellar space

""Our finding points to a straight line of chemical enrichment and increasing complexity between interstellar clouds and fully evolved planetary systems,"" said Abubakar Fadul, MPIA

The transition from a cold protostar to a young star surrounded by a disc of dust and gas is accompanied by a violent phase of shocked gas, intense radiation and rapid gas ejection.

Such energetic processes might destroy most of the complex chemistry assembled during the previous stages. Therefore, scientists had laid out a so-called 'reset' scenario, in which most of the chemical compounds required to evolve into life would have to be reproduced in circumstellar discs while forming comets, asteroids, and planets.

""Now it appears the opposite is true,"" MPIA scientist and co-author Kamber Schwarz points out. ""Our results suggest that protoplanetary discs inherit complex molecules from earlier stages, and the formation of complex molecules can continue during the protoplanetary disc stage."" Indeed, the period between the energetic protostellar phase and the establishment of a protoplanetary disk would, on its own, be too short for COMs to form in detectable amounts.

As a result, the conditions that predefine biological processes may be widespread rather than being restricted to individual planetary systems.

Astronomers have found the simplest organic molecules, such as methanol, in dense regions of dust and gas that predate the formation of stars. Under favourable conditions, they may even contain complex compounds comprising ethylene glycol, one of the species now discovered in V883 Orionis. ""We recently found ethylene glycol could form by UV irradiation of ethanolamine, a molecule that was recently discovered in space,"" adds Tushar Suhasaria, a co-author and the head of MPIA's Origins of Life Lab. ""This finding supports the idea that ethylene glycol could form in those environments but also in later stages of molecular evolution, where UV irradiation is dominant.""

More evolved agents crucial to biology, such as amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases that make up DNA and RNA, are present in asteroids, meteorites, and comets within the Solar System.

Buried in ice - resurfaced by stars

The chemical reactions that synthesize those COMs occur under cold conditions, preferably on icy dust grains that later coagulate to form larger objects. Hidden in those mixtures of rock, dust, and ice, they usually remain undetected. Accessing those molecules is only possible either by digging for them with space probes or by external heating, which evaporates the ice.

In the Solar System, the Sun heats comets, resulting in impressive tails of gas and dust, or comas, essentially gaseous envelopes that surround the cometary nuclei. This way, spectroscopy - the rainbow-like dissection of light - may pick up the emissions of freed molecules. Those spectral fingerprints help astronomers to identify the molecules previously buried in ice.

A similar heating process is occurring in the V883 Orionis system. The central star is still growing by accumulating gas from the surrounding disc until it eventually ignites the fusion fire in its core. During those growth periods, the infalling gas heats up and produces intense outbursts of radiation. ""These outbursts are strong enough to heat the surrounding disc as far as otherwise icy environments, releasing the chemicals we have detected,"" explains Fadul.

""Complex molecules, including ethylene glycol and glycolonitrile, radiate at radio frequencies. ALMA is perfectly suited to detect those signals,"" says Schwarz. The MPIA astronomers were awarded access to this radio interferometer through the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which operates it in the Chilean Atacama Desert at an altitude of 5,000 metres. ALMA enabled the astronomers to pinpoint the V883 Orionis system and search for faint spectral signatures, which ultimately led to the detections.

Further challenges ahead

""While this result is exciting, we still haven't disentangled all the signatures we found in our spectra,"" says Schwarz. ""Higher resolution data will confirm the detections of ethylene glycol and glycolonitril and maybe even reveal more complex chemicals we simply haven't identified yet.""

""Perhaps we also need to look at other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to find even more evolved molecules,"" Fadul points out. ""Who knows what else we might discover?""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Weight loss drug Ozempic could protect the brain from stroke","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250803011814.htm","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 07:25:45 GMT","

Three studies presented recently at the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery's (SNIS) 22nd Annual Meeting discussed whether using GLP-1 inhibitors could lessen the impacts of stroke and related brain injuries or reduce the risk of stroke altogether. These medications, which lower blood sugar and often cause weight loss, are commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes and obesity and include drugs like semaglutide (Ozempic).

In the first study, ""The Impact of Semaglutide (Ozempic) on Mortality and Survival in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Nationwide and Institutional Retrospective Analysis,"" researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison used patient data from both the university's medical center and a global health collaborative to see whether patients on Ozempic who experienced strokes had better outcomes than patients not taking Ozempic. The global dataset included 2,021,704 patients who had experienced stroke, 43,338 of whom were also on Ozempic, and the University of Wisconsin dataset included 13,510 people who had experienced stroke, 190 of whom used Ozempic. Death from stroke was lower for Ozempic users across both cohorts. In the global dataset, 5.26% of Ozempic users initially died from their strokes compared to 21.61% of non-users, and Ozempic users also had a 77.5% chance of surviving their strokes long term compared to 30.95% of non-Ozempic users. The university cohort showed similar results, with 5.26% of Ozempic users dying from stroke versus 26.57% of patients not using Ozempic.

In the second study, also from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ""Association between Ozempic Use and Stroke Risk: A Nationwide Emergency Department Analysis,"" researchers examined a large nationwide sample of emergency department records for people who experienced stroke and people who were likely using Ozempic. They found associations between potential Ozempic users and significantly reduced odds of stroke. The research team suggests taking this research further to evaluate data directly from pharmacies to be even more precise about the relationship between Ozempic and stroke prevention.

The third study, ""Impact Of GLP-1 Agonists on Stroke, SAH, and ICH: A Propensity-matched Multi-institutional Cohort Study,"" was presented by researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. They investigated whether GLP-1 inhibitors could improve patient outcomes after brain hemorrhages (both spontaneous bleeds and those due to brain aneurysm rupture) and stroke. The team reviewed patient records from 6 months and 12 months after each brain hemorrhage and 1 year and 2 years after each stroke, finding that GLP-1 inhibitor use was connected to a reduced risk of cognitive side effects, seizures, future brain hemorrhage and death after brain hemorrhage and stroke.

According to Ahmed Elbayomy, MD, a research fellow and data scientist in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and primary author of two of these studies, these results are very promising. ""More research is certainly needed, but seeing the potential protection offered by these medications is a fascinating finding.""

""This research could introduce a new perspective to the discussion of preventing and mitigating the devastating effects of stroke and related brain injuries,"" added Matias Costa, MD, from the Neurosurgery Department at the University of Texas Medical Branch and author of the third study.

Climate interventions are accelerating in our oceans - but without responsible governance, they could do more harm than good, according to new research.

Coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss are no longer distant threats - they are unfolding now, with profound consequences for marine ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.

In response, scientists, governments, and industries are racing to develop and deploy a suite of interventions to help the ocean respond to climate change.

The new study, published on July 31 in Science, reviewed the array of novel interventions that are being used in urgent response to the scale and intensity of the climate crisis and the dramatic changes in our oceans.

These include efforts to make the ocean less acidic to absorb more carbon dioxide, breeding climate-resilient corals that can survive warmer waters, farming seaweed to capture carbon, and restoring mangroves to protect coastlines and naturally store carbon.

Lead author, University of Melbourne Professor Tiffany Morrison said while these interventions offer hope, they also carry significant risks.

""Without robust governance, we risk repeating past mistakes - implementing solutions that are ineffective, inequitable, or even harmful,"" Professor Morrison said.

""The pace of innovation is outstripping our ability to regulate, monitor, and evaluate these interventions responsibly.

""Private and nonprofit funding is accelerating the ambition. In 2020 alone, philanthropists had allocated $160 million to oceanic climate action, with another US$250 million announced at COP28 in 2023 for a new global Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance.""

The researchers say to navigate these challenges, we must embrace the concept of responsible marine transformation - a governance approach that prioritises sustainability, equity, and adaptability.

""This means weighing risks against benefits, resolving ethical liabilities, improving social co-benefits, and aligning adaptation interventions with broader climate mitigation goals,"" Professor Morrison said.

""It is vital we conduct rigorous, comparative studies to assess the climate benefits and risks of interventions, including their scalability and long-term viability.""

Co-author, University of Exteter Professor Neil Adger said communities must be engaged.

""This means collaborating with Indigenous peoples and local stakeholders from the outset, ensuring their knowledge, values, and rights shape intervention design and implementation,"" Professor Adger said.

""If interventions are proven viable, we must also develop and apply bioethical protocols that address not just animal welfare, but broader ecological and societal implications of upscaled deployment.""

This research was funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the US Society for Nature and People Partnership. Collaborators included James Cook University, the University of Michigan, the University of Exeter, the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, the University of Tasmania, and the Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Studies.

Professor Morrison was recently awarded an Australian Laureate Fellowship from the ARC to improve global marine futures.

A frog croaks from a walking trail. A hiker snaps a photo and uploads it to iNaturalist. That single act -- one person, one amphibian and one click -- feeds into a growing global dataset that scientists now use to map shifting species ranges, detect invasive threats and even discover new species.

An international study led by researchers at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) shows how iNaturalist, the global technology platform through which everyday people share wildlife photos via a website and an app, is doing far more than connecting users with nature. It's rapidly becoming a cornerstone of scientific research.

""The scientific use of iNaturalist has grown tenfold in five years, closely tracking the platform's data growth,"" said Brittany Mason, lead author and data management analyst at the UF/IFAS Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center (FLREC). ""This suggests that increasing observations, especially in less-documented geographic areas and lesser-studied species groups, can further expand its research applications.""

""Until now, the scientific value of iNaturalist has been recognized in isolated case studies, like how a user rediscovered a century-lost Vietnamese snail, how the data are used to provide high-resolution maps of plants or how iNaturalist is becoming critical for early detection of invasive species,"" said Corey Callaghan, senior author of the study, and an assistant professor of global ecology at FLREC.

Those examples remained somewhat isolated until now.

""This study is the first to systematically assess the full scope of how iNaturalist data are being used in research,"" said Mason.

To do this, the research team assessed how technology is being used and which geographic areas and scientific questions the data are being used for. The findings

emphasize how platforms like iNaturalist allow anybody armed with a smart phone to gather data and help scientists.

""Millions of people are now directly shaping how we understand and conserve biodiversity,"" said Callaghan. The study reveals several trends in shaping and enhancing the future of biodiversity science.

First, the dominant use of iNaturalist in species distribution modeling and range mapping points to the platform's utility in tracking how organisms are spread across the planet. Second, the use of images uploaded to iNaturalist is on the rise in scientific research, providing new insights into species behavior, coloration and habitat preferences. Third, the exponential rise in scholarly articles using iNaturalist data suggests that as participation grows -- particularly in underrepresented regions and among lesser-studied species groups -- so, too, will its impact on science.

Launched in 2008, the platform is a non-profit organization and allows users to upload photographs or audio recordings of plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms, along with data on time and place.

A community of contributors vet observations, and those verified as ""Research Grade"" are shared with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, an international database working as a clearinghouse for all biodiversity records.

The study shows that everyday people contributing their observations through iNaturalist are making meaningful contributions to scientific knowledge. ""Millions of people are helping scientists track biodiversity in ways that would be impossible through traditional scientific fieldwork alone."" said Carrie Seltzer, the iNaturalist head of engagement, who was not associated with the study.

Those meaningful contributions come from 128 countries and 638 groups of species, illustrating the truly global impact on biodiversity research. Research topics range from conservation planning and habitat modeling to education, machine learning and species discovery. Authors also noted the platform is also being used by conservation agencies like the International Union for Conservation of Nature to assess the status of threatened species and track the spread of invasive organisms.

""By contributing observations and identifications, everyday citizens become key players in tackling one of the planet's most pressing challenges: biodiversity loss,"" said Callaghan. ""Now, an important frontier remains to really understand how iNaturalist data can be strategically paired with other biodiversity data to continue to inform biodiversity and conservation work in the future.""

The study, published in BioScience, involved researchers from 15 institutions across the United States, Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany and South Korea. Contributing institutions include the University of Florida, UNSW Sydney, Meise Botanic Garden, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, the University of Münster and Changwon National University, among others.

Most stars in the Universe exist in binary or multiple star systems, where the presence of close-in companion stars in such systems can adversely influence the formation and orbital stability of planets around one of the stars. An international team of astrophysicists led by Professor Man Hoi LEE from the Department of Earth Sciences and the Department of Physics at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and Mr Ho Wan Cheng, an MPhil student in his team, has confirmed the existence of a planet in an unprecedented retrograde orbit (moving in the opposite direction to the binary's orbit) in the nu Octantis (nu Octantis) binary star system and revealed the role of binary star evolution in the origin of this planet. The findings have been published in the journal Nature.

nu Octantis is a tight binary star system comprising a primary subgiant star, nu Oct A, with about 1.6 times the mass of the Sun, and a secondary star, nu Oct B, with about half the mass of the Sun. The two stars orbit each other with a period of 1,050 days.An additional periodic signal in the radial velocity observations (measurements of how a star moves towards or away from us) of this system was first reported by Dr David Ramm, a co-author of this new paper, during his PhD studies at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, in 2004. This signal was consistent with the presence of a Jovian planet of about twice the mass of Jupiter orbiting around the primary star, nu Oct A, with a period of about 400 days. However, the existence of this planet has been controversial because its orbit would be so wide that it could only remain stable if it were retrograde and moved in the opposite direction to the orbit of the binary. There were no observational precedents for such a planet and strong theoretical grounds against its formation.To settle the debate, the research team obtained new high-precision radial velocity observations using the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s HARPS spectrograph, which confirmed the existence of the planet signal. “We performed an analysis of the new and archival radial velocity data spanning 18 years and found stable fits that require the planetary orbit to be retrograde and nearly in the same plane as the binary orbit,” said Mr Ho Wan Cheng, the first author of the paper.Another key focus of the new study was the determination of the nature of the secondary star nu Oct B. The mass of nu Oct B suggests that it could be either a low-mass main-sequence star or a white dwarf. All stars spend most of their lives on the main sequence, generating energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium in their core. After a star has exhausted its nuclear fuel, its core collapses into a stellar remnant, which would be a white dwarf if the star's initial mass is less than several times that of the Sun. A white dwarf has a mass comparable to that of the Sun packed in an Earth-sized volume.To identify which type of star nu Oct B is, the research team used the adaptive optics imaging instrument SPHERE at ESO's Very Large Telescope to observe the system. The fact that nu Oct B was not detected in these observations indicated that it must be a very faint white dwarf. This suggests that the binary system has evolved significantly since its formation, as nu Oct B has already ejected most of its mass and entered the final stage of its stellar evolution.The research team looked into the possible primordial configurations of the binary — that is, the initial masses of the two stars and the initial orbit of the binary. “We found that the system is about 2.9 billion years old and that nu Oct B was initially about 2.4 times the mass of the Sun and evolved to a white dwarf about 2 billion years ago,” said Cheng. “Our analysis showed that the planet could not have formed around nu Oct A at the same time as the stars.”The discovery that nu Oct B is a white dwarf opens new possibilities for how the retrograde planet may have originated. “When nu Oct B evolved into a white dwarf about 2 billion years ago, the planet could have formed in a retrograde disc of material around nu Oct A accreted from the mass ejected by nu Oct B, or it could be captured from a prograde orbit around the binary into a retrograde orbit around nu Oct A,” explained Professor Man Hoi LEE.“We might be witnessing the first compelling case of a second-generation planet; either captured, or formed from material expelled by nu Oct B, which lost more than 75% of its primordial mass to become a white dwarf,” added Dr Trifon TRIFONOV of Zentrum für Astronomie der Universität Heidelberg in Germany and Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski in Bulgaria and a co-author of the paper.“The key to this exciting discovery was the use of several complementary methods to characterise the system in its entirety,” said PD Dr Sabine REFFERT of Zentrum für Astronomie der Universität Heidelberg and another co-author of the paper.As astronomers continue to search for planets in different environments, this study highlights that planets in tight binary systems with evolved stellar components could offer unique insights into the formation and evolution of planets.This research uses two facilities operated by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), namely the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph at the ESO La Silla 3.6-metre telescope and the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet Research (SPHERE) instrument at the Very Large Telescope.

The Nintendo Switch 2 is fantastic—already a contender for the biggest gaming hardware launch of 2025. I'm still playing it daily—monkeying around in Donkey Kong Bananza, enjoying tearing up its destructible game worlds, whether I'm playing on the big screen or tucked up in bed with handheld mode.

Unfortunately, just two months on from release, my console's drive is already full. Since my copy of Bananza is digital, I've had to start juggling game installs to experience the great ape's latest adventure. I'm probably an outlier in having maxed out capacity already, but storage anxiety is an issue that's likely to worsen for many users over the Switch 2's lifespan, and there don't appear to be any easy fixes on the horizon.

At a glance, the Switch 2's storage situation looks rosy. The console itself comes with 256 GB, which is eight times more than the original Switch's paltry 32 GB and four times the 64 GB of the Switch OLED. System software on Switch 2 is impressively small, using a smidge over 6 GB, leaving owners with a generous-sounding ~249 GB. The problem is that 249 GB ain't what it used to be, and the Switch 2 demands you use far more of that storage than the original Switch did.

The latest generation of performance, such as 4K HDR output, is necessary as Nintendo competes against both home console rivals Sony and Microsoft, and the growing number of handheld gaming PCs aiming for the Switch's portable gaming crown. However, improvements mean bigger installs for Switch 2 native games, eating up more and more of that precious space.

While Nintendo has mastered getting big results from small game sizes—open-world racer Mario Kart World is 24 GB digitally, while Donkey Kong Bananza clocks in at a mere 8.7 GB—other developers aren't as trim. JRPG Bravely Default HD, a remaster of a Nintendo 3DS game, eats up 11 GB (albeit likely down to its significant original mini games that use the Switch 2's mouse mode controls), while co-op adventure Split Fiction demands a staggering 69.2 GB—over a quarter of the internal storage for that one game alone.

If you think that sounds like an incentive to embrace physical media instead, saving space for digital-only games … well, you'd be right. Unfortunately, on Switch 2, that's not the option it once was.

The issue is exacerbated by Nintendo's introduction of GameKey Cards for some physical games. These don't have games installed on them, merely a bearer token that allows users to download a game digitally while requiring the cartridge to be inserted to play it. Although at the time of writing, Nintendo itself hasn't released any of its first-party games in the GameKey Card format, almost every third-party game released for the Switch 2 has opted for GKCs (Cyberpunk 2077 is a notable exception; the entire game is on the cartridge).

I maintain that GameKey Cards are a significant improvement for collectors over the original Switch's code-in-a-box releases. GKCs can be traded in or sold, since access to the game is tied to the cartridge rather than a user account, and they don't leave collectors with an empty, useless case after a single-use download code has been redeemed. But the format's inescapable drawback is that it demands yet more of the Switch 2's already over-stretched storage.

Switch 2 cartridges that can house game data are limited to 64 GB, further compounding the issue. Even if publisher EA wanted to release Split Fiction on a cartridge—its ""physical"" release is code-in-a-box, not even a GKC—the mammoth install size couldn't fit on the cards available. Larger cards could help here, but given the bespoke design, they may prove prohibitively expensive to produce.

Plus, if third parties aren't using current 64-GB cards—chonkers such as Hitman: World of Assassination (61 GB), Street Fighter 6 (48.2 GB), and Yakuza 0: Director's Cut (45.3 GB) could all fit, but instead are released as GKCs—is there any point in doubling the size and cost? As it stands, players have no alternative but to bid adieu to even more storage if any of those games take their fancy.

One of the best things about the Switch 2 is its near-universal backward compatibility. Here, physical games have an edge, as Switch 1 carts have the actual game data, while digitally owned Switch 1 titles claim more virtual real estate alongside ballooning Switch 2 titles.

Physical Switch 1 cartridges aren't immune to data bloat on the Switch 2, though. While many Switch 1 games see a performance boost running on Switch 2, benefiting from faster load times and improved frame rates, Nintendo is releasing upgrade packs for key titles—think of them as optional downloadable remasters. If you want The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to look its absolute best on Switch 2, that pack demands 9.7 GB of space, even if you have your original physical copy of the game. The fully digital release leaps from around 14 to 24 GB with the upgrade, or roughly 10 percent of the Switch 2's storage.

Beyond original Switch games and upgrades gobbling up precious storage, the Switch 2 also sees the addition of GameCube titles to the retro library available to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Like the classic games available for earlier consoles such as the NES, SNES, or Game Boy, these are all packaged in one launcher, with every game in the respective collection installed at once.

That's fine for the SNES collection—with around 80 titles crammed into a barely-noticeable 267 MB bundle, who cares if there's a bunch you'll never play? Yet with just four titles presently available (F-Zero, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur II, and Super Mario Strikers), NSO GameCube is already a 6-GB commitment. Original GameCube discs could hold just shy of 1.5 GB, so each addition is going to see that launcher demand ever more space, and each unwanted game could prevent you from installing something else you want to play. While this only affects NSO subscribers who use the GameCube library, the freedom to choose which GameCube games get installed would be a huge help.

SanDisk

Amazon

The good news is that Switch 2 still allows users to expand storage via microSD cards. Problem solved—just whack a massive capacity card in, right? Not quite. Switch 2 only supports microSD Express format cards. There's good reason for this—the new standard offers much faster data read and write speeds, allowing games to load faster—but the rule causes problems.

One is cost. MicroSD Express cards cost more per GB of storage than their predecessors. At the time of writing, a SanDisk 128 GB card is $17, while its Switch 2-compatible microSD Express format card is $54 for the same amount of storage—a 3X premium. Another is card capacities. There are a handful of 1-terabyte microSD Express cards on the market, but supplies are vanishingly low, and prices are astronomical. Although you can technically use multiple microSD cards with your console, Nintendo advises against it, so swapping several smaller cards around isn't an option either.

More confusingly, the SD Express format only refers to speed, not capacity, which has its own standards. Most microSD cards you're likely to buy, whether they're in the Express speed format or not, are ""SD eXtended Capacity"" standard, or SDXC. These can theoretically hold a maximum of 2 TB of data, though the largest legitimate card you're likely to find on sale is 1.5 TB.

However, in 2018, the SD Association—the industry body that sets standards for SD memory cards—introduced SD Ultra Capacity, or SDUC. This supports capacities up to a staggering 128 TB, “regardless of form factor, either micro or full size, or interface type including […] SD Express.” There are no SDUC cards on the market at all yet, so we're a long, long way from being able to slap ""even"" an 8-TB card in your Switch 2 and install everything you could dream of. In theory, though, surely this means you'll one day be able to do just that?

Again, not quite. Beyond the microSD Express requirement for speed, the Switch 2 only supports cards up to 2 TB in capacity. For now, this is a nonissue—the largest microSD Express cards on the market are half that at 1 TB, and all are in the SDXC format for storage, which maxes out at 2 TB anyway. What's less clear is whether the Switch 2 will support SDUC cards when they eventually enter the marketplace. If it does, a firmware update might lift that 2-TB cap. If not, 2 TB of SDXC is the Switch 2's ultimate storage fate. Nintendo did not respond to our request for comment.

There are some reasons for the storage anxious to be optimistic, though. The mere existence and huge success of the Switch 2 will see more consumers demand microSD Express cards, eventually driving prices down and capacities up, at least to the SDXC standard's 2-TB limit. For most players, that amount of storage is realistically enough for all but the most covetous data hoarders. Consumer backlash could also push more third-party publishers into releasing their physical games on cartridges, rather than as Game-Key Cards, reducing storage demands.

Even simpler, if Nintendo provided more control to the user—choosing which GameCube games to install or officially supporting swapping microSD cards—players themselves could easily manage their digital collections. In the meantime, as Switch 2 digital libraries grow, there's only one option: getting used to juggling installs for the foreseeable future.

If it's been a while since you added up how many digital subscriptions you're paying for, it's likely to be more than you think: streaming services, software packages, games, AI bots, health and fitness wearables ... the list goes on.

You can add cloud storage subscriptions to that list too. Apple, Google, and Microsoft offer very little in the way of free storage in the cloud, which means if you want the convenience of having your photos, videos, and other files safely backed up and accessible on every device, you're probably going to have to pay for it.

What if you don't want to have these subscriptions for life, though—what if you've found a better option for your backups and storage (and there are plenty of options out there)? You might be wondering what happens to the years and years of files you've amassed in the cloud if you cancel your storage subscription.

While we can't cover every single cloud storage service here, we've picked four of the main ones below. Here's what happens to your data if you stop paying, and what you need to do with your files before hitting the unsubscribe button.

You can manage your iCloud subscription from any Apple device.

Pricing for Apple iCloud storage starts at $0.99 per month for 50 GB of space, and you get extras like Hide My Email included too. You can manage your subscription from your iPhone by going to Settings, tapping your name and then Subscriptions, and from System Settings on a Mac by selecting your name, then iCloud.

If you cancel your iCloud storage, you go back down to the free allocation of 5 GB. If you currently have more than that in the cloud, you won't be able to make new backups or sync any new files until you've freed up some space—so you'll need to delete files to add any new ones.

What Apple is less clear about is what will happen to your existing data. The official documentation implies, but doesn't specifically say, that your files will be kept in a read-only state, with no backups completing until you delete files or increase your storage plan. The iCloud terms and conditions state that if you've not backed up a device for 180 days, Apple “reserves the right” to delete any existing backups (including photos and videos)—so it may delete your files, and it may not.

Given this timeline, it's unlikely that anything will happen to your files immediately after you cancel, though we'd recommend getting your iCloud files backed up somewhere else as soon as possible—bearing in mind that any local copies of this data you have won't be affected by canceling your iCloud storage plan.

Google Takeout lets you download everything in your Google storage.

If you pay Google for cloud storage, your pricing options start at $1.99 per month, which gets you 100 GB of space in the cloud. As with Apple, there are extras attached, and you can manage your current plan via the Google One dashboard on the web.

Choose to unsubscribe from your Google One package, and you go back down to 15 GB of storage space, across Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, and Google's other apps. For all the time you're over that limit, those apps will essentially freeze—as in, you won't be able to send or receive emails in Gmail or create new files in Google Docs.

You won't be able to sync new files to Google Photos or Google Drive, either. Google says if you stay over the free storage limit without paying, “all the content that counts toward your storage quota may be deleted”—so as with Apple, there's a “may” in there.

Your files are safe from this fate for two years after canceling, but unless you want your Gmail and other Google apps to become pretty much unusable, you'll need to free up some space or back up your files somewhere else. Thankfully, you can download everything from your Google cloud storage quite simply, via Google Takeout.

OneDrive is tightly integrated into Windows.

As with Apple and Google, Microsoft OneDrive storage comes with bonus goodies included, not least Microsoft Office at the higher storage tiers. The most basic one, which gives you 100 GB of room, will set you back $1.99 a month.

You get 5 GB of OneDrive cloud storage space for free with a Microsoft account, and if you cancel your subscription, that's what you go back to. As per Microsoft, as long as you're over that limit and not paying, you won't be able to sync any new files. Existing files will remain, but in a read-only state. You also won't be able to send or receive emails in Outlook.com, or Teams messages with attachments.

Microsoft gives you six months to decide what to do with the files in your OneDrive account, after which it “may” (there's that word again) decide to delete the files you have on Microsoft's servers. Once they're deleted, Microsoft warns, they're gone forever. If you need these files, you need to download them and move them somewhere else (the OneDrive clients for Windows and macOS can help here).

Unlike Google, Microsoft treats its cloud storage and email storage services separately. You get 15 GB of cloud space with Outlook for free, and 100 GB of space if you pay $1.99 a month (on top of the other 100 GB). You can't send or receive email if you are over your limit, so you'll need to clean up your inbox to start using it again.

You can sync your Dropbox files to Windows or macOS using the desktop clients.

We can't cover every single cloud storage service in this article, but here's one more: Dropbox. Dropbox users get 2 GB of storage space in the cloud free of charge, and then the paid plans begin at $9.99 per month for 2 TB of space.

If you store more than 2 GB of files in your Dropbox, and then stop paying, nothing happens to those files: They will just stay as they are, in the cloud, and on your synced devices. However, you won't be able to add new files, and any changes you make locally to files won't then be synced to the cloud.

There's no expiration date on your files either—they'll just stay as they are permanently. Presumably Dropbox wants to encourage users to sign up for another paid plan somewhere down the line, at which point you can pick up where you left off.

You can use the Dropbox clients for Windows and macOS to sync files from the cloud to your computers, and from there to other locations and backup services. Once files are moved out of or deleted from your Dropbox folder on your computer, they'll be wiped from the cloud too.

It's important to know how to clean your mattress. Not just for day-to-day cleanliness and hygiene, but let's say you're dealing with an emergency—a “my mattress is ruined"" situation where you have the frantic energy of an emergency clean-up crew. Is a trip to the dump inevitable? Not necessarily.

Before you think, “I'm so clean, this would never happen to me!” I'm telling you, it can. I've seen a lot over the course of my career as a professional mattress tester and certified sleep coach. If you plan to have your mattress for its full eight- to 10-year lifespan, you'll want to keep it as pristine as possible. I chatted with cleaning influencer and third-generation janitor Brandon Pleshek of Clean That Up to see how he would approach the common situations below.

Bissell

Life happens, sleep happens, and sometimes bladder control is an issue. This can be common at any age, from little kids to seniors. Or, maybe your pet had an accident. I've been there. Time is of the essence with this situation, to avoid a stain and—more urgently—smells from taking root. According to Pleshek, the quicker you address a fresh urine stain, the better. “Speed is gonna help,” he says. “The longer you let the urine sit, the more it'll soak in, and the harder it'll be to get it completely out.”

According to Pleshek, urine contains a lot of salt. It will require more heavy-duty cleaning agents to adequately get it out. The solution of choice: enzyme cleaners, like Nature's Miracle ($13). “Enzymes are your best approach right away, because those can attack the urine stain instantly,” says Pleshek.

Extracting via a Shop-Vac or portable carpet cleaner is also a great first step. “Suck as much of that out as possible so that it can't go deeper. Enzymes help with odor.” When it comes to using enzymes, Pleshek cautions, “You have to make sure to let them sit for as long as they say on the label. Enzymes need time to work. The label's the law, so do your best to follow it and that'll help things clean up better.”

Now, let's say that you don't have an enzyme cleaner handy. For fresh urine, using a clean towel or paper towels, blot at the stain to pick up as much moisture as you can. Grab a spray bottle (Pleshek says in a pinch, you can just grab a spray nozzle off a bottle you have and stick it on the bottle you're using) and put together a cup of white vinegar, two cups of cold water, and a few drops of either dish soap or laundry detergent. Mix well, and then spray down the affected area. After 10 to 15 minutes, grab a fresh towel or paper towels to blot up the solution. Then sprinkle baking soda over the stain like there's no tomorrow. Once the spot is fully covered, leave it alone for eight to 10 hours—again, use your judgement based on how bad the stain is. Once Mount Baking Soda has dried up, and enough time has passed, you can vacuum it all up using a hose attachment.

One note: Be wary of over-saturating your mattress. Leaving liquid behind can cause mold and mildew within your mattress.

“Anytime you're getting your mattress wet: vacuum, vacuum, and then when you think you're done at vacuuming and extracting that out with a little spotter machine, do it two more times,” Pleshek says. “Always put a fan on it and get good airflow through the room.”

Amazon Basics

Looks like you have a crime scene on your hands: the crime being the mattress mess. Blood stains are a pain when it comes to removing them from any fabric, and mattresses are not exempt. Periods aren't the only situations where blood could mysteriously appear; healing cuts, scabs, and nosebleeds are also common. The miracle cleanup go-to for bloody situations, according to Pleshek, is hydrogen peroxide.

Pleshek's cleanup process is this: “Grab a brown bottle, get a basic spray bottle, and mist the area where the blood is. Let it sit.” It'll have a small reaction akin to a middle school science experiment, but that's good. Leave it alone for a good 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the size and severity of your stain. “What's kind of cool and fun about cleaning up blood with hydrogen peroxide is that you will see it bubble and it vanishes really fast,” adds Pleshek. “Follow up with a damp towel and blot a bit to remove the stain.”

Nature's Miracle

Time is, once again, of the essence here. “Vomit is extremely acidic,” says Pleshek. Depending on what was eaten, whether that be food or medication, it can make bile even more acidic than is typical. You need to act quickly to address the stain—and the smell. If any vomit made its way onto the mattress itself, remove any residual solids off the surface—you may want to wear gloves for this one.

Enzyme cleaner is once again going to be your go-to. However, removing the excess vomit is a crucial step—you can't just spray it on top of the mess as is and hope for the best. According to Pleshek, the enzyme cleaner isn't going to be able to efficiently do its thing if all the excess hasn't been adequately removed first.

I don't think you're going to be spilling chili all over your bed like Kevin in that scene from The Office, but I won't discount any possibilities. First, Pleshek says to grab a spray bottle, a tablespoon of dish soap, and warm water. From there, “lightly agitate it with a toothbrush or soft material to suspend the soil.” Follow with a spotter machine.

If something has the tenacity to stick around even after that, time to bring back our friend hydrogen peroxide. “Mist [the stain] with hydrogen peroxide, and let it sit. The hydrogen peroxide should be able to pull out the color,” Pleshek says. He suggests doing this as a multistep process, because hydrogen peroxide and a degreaser don't work well simultaneously. While this two-prong approach may take more time and evaluation as you go, it's the recommended way to tackle the stain.

Utopia Bedding

Amazon

This is one of my nonnegotiables, and it's backed by Pleshek: Get a waterproof mattress protector or encasement. It may save you a lot of heartache from big messes. These cleanup tips hopefully prove to be helpful. But from experience, you may breathe one big sigh of relief when you just have to handle bedding and not the bed itself by using one of these as a fail-safe.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

At the turn of the 20th century, the renowned mathematician David Hilbert had a grand ambition to bring a more rigorous, mathematical way of thinking into the world of physics. At the time, physicists were still plagued by debates about basic definitions—what is heat? how are molecules structured?—and Hilbert hoped that the formal logic of mathematics could provide guidance.

On the morning of August 8, 1900, he delivered a list of 23 key math problems to the International Congress of Mathematicians. Number six: Produce airtight proofs of the laws of physics.

The scope of Hilbert's sixth problem was enormous. He asked “to treat in the same manner [as geometry], by means of axioms, those physical sciences in which mathematics plays an important part.”

His challenge to axiomatize physics was “really a program,” said Dave Levermore, a mathematician at the University of Maryland. “The way the sixth problem is actually stated, it's never going to be solved.”

But Hilbert provided a starting point. To study different properties of a gas—say, the speed of its molecules, or its average temperature—physicists use different equations. In particular, they use one set of equations to describe how individual molecules in a gas move, and another to describe the behavior of the gas as a whole. Was it possible, Hilbert wondered, to show that one set of equations implied the other—that these equations were, as physicists had assumed but hadn't rigorously proved, simply different ways of modeling the same reality?

For 125 years, even axiomatizing this small corner of physics seemed impossible. Mathematicians made partial progress, coming up with proofs that only worked when they considered the behavior of gases on extremely short timescales or in other contrived situations. But these fell short of the kind of result that Hilbert had imagined.

In 1900, David Hilbert came up with a list of 23 problems to guide the next century of mathematical research. His sixth problem challenged mathematicians to axiomatize physics.

Now, three mathematicians have finally provided such a result. Their work not only represents a major advance in Hilbert's program, but also taps into questions about the irreversible nature of time.

“It's a beautiful work,” said Gregory Falkovich, a physicist at the Weizmann Institute of Science. “A tour de force.”

Consider a gas whose particles are very spread out. There are many ways a physicist might model it.

At a microscopic level, the gas is composed of individual molecules that act like billiard balls, moving through space according to Isaac Newton's 350-year-old laws of motion. This model of the gas's behavior is called the hard-sphere particle system.

Now zoom out a bit. At this new “mesoscopic” scale, your field of vision encompasses too many molecules to individually track. Instead, you'll model the gas using an equation that the physicists James Clerk Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann developed in the late 19th century. Called the Boltzmann equation, it describes the likely behavior of the gas's molecules, telling you how many particles you can expect to find at different locations moving at different speeds. This model of the gas lets physicists study how air moves at small scales—for instance, how it might flow around a space shuttle.

“What mathematicians do to physicists is they wake us up.”

Zoom out again, and you can no longer tell that the gas is made up of individual particles. It acts like one continuous substance. To model this macroscopic behavior—how dense the gas is and how fast it's moving at any point in space—you'll need yet another set of equations, called the Navier-Stokes equations.

Physicists view these three different models of the gas's behavior as compatible; they're simply different lenses for understanding the same thing. But mathematicians hoping to contribute to Hilbert's sixth problem wanted to prove that rigorously. They needed to show that Newton's model of individual particles gives rise to Boltzmann's statistical description, and that Boltzmann's equation in turn gives rise to the Navier-Stokes equations.

Mathematicians have had some success with the second step, proving that it's possible to derive a macroscopic model of a gas from a mesoscopic one in various settings. But they couldn't resolve the first step, leaving the chain of logic incomplete.

Now that's changed. In a series of papers, the mathematicians Yu Deng, Zaher Hani, and Xiao Ma proved the harder microscopic-to-mesoscopic step for a gas in one of these settings, completing the chain for the first time. The result and the techniques that made it possible are “paradigm-shifting,” said Yan Guo of Brown University.

Yu Deng usually studies the behavior of systems of waves. But by applying his expertise to the realm of particles, he has now resolved a major open problem in mathematical physics.

Boltzmann could already show that Newton's laws of motion give rise to his mesoscopic equation, so long as one crucial assumption holds true: that the particles in the gas move more or less independently of each other. That is, it must be very rare for a particular pair of molecules to collide with each other multiple times.

But Boltzmann could not definitively demonstrate that this assumption was true. “What he could not do, of course, is prove theorems about this,” said Sergio Simonella of Sapienza University in Rome. “There was no structure, there were no tools at the time.”

The physicist Ludwig Boltzmann studied the statistical properties of fluids.

After all, there are infinitely many ways a collection of particles might collide and recollide. “You just get this huge explosion of possible directions that they can go,” Levermore said—making it a “nightmare” to actually prove that scenarios involving many recollisions are as rare as Boltzmann needed them to be.

In 1975, a mathematician named Oscar Lanford managed to prove this, but only for extremely short time periods. (The exact amount of time depends on the initial state of the gas, but it's less than the blink of an eye, according to Simonella.) Then the proof broke down; before most of the particles got the chance to collide even once, Lanford could no longer guarantee that recollisions would remain a rare occurrence.

In the decades since, many mathematicians tried to extend his result, to no avail.

Then, in November 2023, Deng, now at the University of Chicago, and Hani, of the University of Michigan, posted a preprint that teased the desired proof. A forthcoming paper, they wrote, would build off their latest result to investigate “the long-time extension of Lanford's theorem.”

Other mathematicians didn't know what to make of the announcement. “I didn't think it was possible,” said Pierre Germain of Imperial College London. Deng and Hani didn't even usually work with particle systems; until that point, they'd mainly been studying systems made up of waves (like rays of light).

So mathematicians eagerly awaited the promised proof.

Deng and Hani's 2023 result involved an analysis of the transition from the microscopic scale to the mesoscopic scale in the context of waves. About a year before the mathematicians posted their paper online, Deng was at a conference, where he met with a graduate student at Princeton University named Xiao Ma. They ended up discussing Deng and Hani's work, and how they might adapt the methods to particles. Doing so would allow them to extend Lanford's result—to show that particle recollisions are rare even on longer timescales.

It was an idea that Deng and Hani had already been considering. Impressed by Ma's insights on the topic, Deng invited him to help them turn their intuition into a proof.

The trio hoped to focus on a much-studied scenario where mathematicians had already proved the second, meso-to-macro step in Hilbert's sixth problem. In this scenario, a dilute gas of spherical particles is trapped in a box. If a particle hits one of the box's walls, it reappears on the opposite wall.

But to prove the harder micro-to-meso step for this setting—thereby resolving Hilbert's sixth problem—Deng, Hani, and Ma had to port their wave-based techniques over to particles. So they started in a setting where that task would be a little bit easier. They worked with a gas whose particles are distributed randomly in an infinite amount of space; unlike the particles in the boxed gas, which keep bouncing off each other forever, these particles eventually disperse and stop colliding. “In the whole-space case, there is a shortcut,” Deng said.

The three mathematicians first needed to tabulate the different patterns of collisions that might occur in their gas, and how likely each of those patterns was. They could easily rule out scenarios with particularly high rates of recollisions. This left them with a finite, though still massive, number of patterns to analyze—each involving a certain subset of particles colliding, in a certain order. Once they knew exactly what each pattern entailed, they could use that information to estimate its likelihood of occurring.

But that often felt like an impossible task, because many of the patterns involved huge numbers of particles and intricate, indirect interactions between them. “The structure of these sets [of colliding particles] gets exceedingly complicated,” Deng said. In principle, the mathematicians would need to keep track of every one of these particles simultaneously to compute the probability estimates they needed.

That's where Deng and Hani's previous work on waves gave them an important insight. In that result, they'd figured out ways to break up complicated patterns of interacting waves into simpler ones. They'd carefully crafted their technique so that, by working with only a few waves at a time, they could still get a good estimate for the likelihood of the more complicated complete wave pattern.

They hoped the same idea would work in the particle setting.

But after a collision, particles behave very differently from waves. For instance, particles, unlike waves, bounce off each other, greatly affecting the resulting pattern of collisions and its probability of happening. Deng, Hani and Ma needed to rework the details of their strategy from the beginning.

Zaher Hani studies solutions to equations that arise in oceanography, plasma physics, and quantum mechanics.

First, they tackled the simplest cases, in which each particle collides just a few times over a very short time span, with no recollisions. They then gradually moved on to harder and harder cases—longer amounts of time, with more collisions and recollisions.

It was as much an art as a science. “The intuition was developed gradually, starting with some unsuccessful attempts,” Deng said. They had to get a sense for how to slice up large, complicated patterns of particle collisions in a way that would simplify their calculations while keeping their estimates highly accurate.

“This is a process that takes months,” Hani said. “We would be stuck constantly.” Nearly every day, they jumped on a Zoom meeting to talk things through. “Much to the dismay of my wife, some of them happened very late at night, or very early in the morning,” Hani said. “I would put my daughter to sleep, and then we would have two or three hours of Zoom meetings.”

Finally, by the spring of 2024, the trio was sure they had covered everything. Their proof, which they posted online that summer, confirmed that recollisions had to be very, very uncommon. They'd shown, as they'd hoped to, that in their infinite-space setting, Boltzmann's description of the gas could be derived from Newton's. The microscopic and mesoscopic scales fell under a single rigorous mathematical framework.

“I think it's outstanding work,” said Alexandru Ionescu, a mathematician at Princeton who was also Deng's and Ma's doctoral adviser. “These are some of the most significant advances in many, many years.”

They were now ready to return to the gas-in-a-box setting, where they could finally solve Hilbert's sixth problem.

It didn't take long for them to extend their result from the infinite-space setting to the boxed one. “Eighty percent of the proof is still the same in the whole-space case,” Deng said.

In March, they posted a new paper that combined their proof with the earlier results connecting the Boltzmann equation to the Navier-Stokes equations. The logical chain was complete: They'd shown that, for a realistic model of a gas, a microscopic description of individual particles does indeed ultimately give rise to a macroscopic description of the gas's large-scale behavior.

The work didn't just mark the resolution of a major case of Hilbert's sixth problem. It also provided a rigorous mathematical resolution of an old paradox.

At the microscopic scale, where particles act like billiard balls, time is reversible. Newton's equations predict both where a particle comes from and where it's going. The future is not fundamentally different from the past.

But at the mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, there is no going back in time. “We know very well that, going forward in time, one ages but does not rejuvenate; heat does not spontaneously pass from a cold body to a warm body; a drop of ink in a glass of water spreads, darkening the liquid, but does not spontaneously return to the small, round shape it originally had,” Simonella wrote. Neither the Boltzmann equation nor the Navier-Stokes equations are time-reversible; if you try to run time backward, the results will be nonsensical.

To Boltzmann's contemporaries, this was perplexing. How could a time-irreversible equation be derived from a time-reversible system?

But Boltzmann argued that there was no paradox: Even if each particle can be modeled in a time-reversible way, almost every collision pattern ends up with a gas dispersing. The chance of, say, a gas suddenly contracting is essentially zero.

Lanford had confirmed this intuition mathematically for his very short time frame. Now Deng, Hani, and Ma's result confirms it for more realistic situations.

Going forward, mathematicians—who are still poring over the details of the new proof—want to test whether similar techniques might be useful in other, even more realistic contexts. These might include gases made up of particles of different shapes, or particles that interact in more complicated ways.

Meanwhile, Falkovich said, these sorts of rigorous proofs can help physicists understand why a gas behaves a certain way at various scales, and why different models might be more or less effective in different scenarios. “What mathematicians do to physicists,” he said, “is they wake us up.”

Controversial crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun finally got his suborbital ride into space today from Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture, four years after he put in the winning $28 million bid for a seat.

Five other spacefliers were alongside Sun when Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket ship rose from its launch pad at the company's Launch Site One in West Texas at 7:43 a.m. CT (5:43 a.m. PT) for a 10-minute trip.

When Sun emerged from the crew capsule after the flight, he made a thumbs-up gesture, then stepped down to kiss the ground.

“I wished to go into space since I was a child, and after almost 30 years, it's come true,” Sun said on Blue Origin's webcast. “For this mission I waited four years, but we finally delivered it. I really appreciate Mr. Bezos and his team to make it possible. … This is my first commitment and step to space, and we will have more.”

Sun is the founder of a blockchain venture called Tron and an adviser to HTX, one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. When the 35-year-old, Chinese-born billionaire won Blue Origin's space auction in 2021, it was meant to guarantee him a spot on New Shepard's first crewed flight that summer. Instead, Sun put his reservation on hold, reportedly due to scheduling conflicts.

While Sun was waiting for his flight, legal complications arose: In 2023, he became the subject of a federal investigation over alleged market manipulation and unregistered sales of crypto asset securities. But that case was put on hold in February, and a couple of months later, Sun earned a place of prominence at a crypto dinner with President Donald Trump by purchasing the biggest share of the $TRUMP meme coin. 

Last month, Tron Inc. became a publicly listed company on Nasdaq.

Today's mission, known as NS-34, marked the 34th flight and 14th crewed flight for Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital space program. This flight followed the standard profile for crewed missions: The autonomously controlled, reusable rocket ship's hydrogen-fueled booster sent the crew capsule to an altitude of 65.7 miles (105.7 kilometers), just above the 100-kilometer Karman Line that marks the internationally accepted boundary of outer space.

At that height, the NS-34 crew members experienced a few minutes of zero gravity and got an astronaut's-eye view of Earth beneath the black sky of space. Then, at the end of the ride, they made a parachute-assisted touchdown not far from their launch pad.

Sun's five crewmates for NS-34 reflected varied backgrounds. Here's the list:

“It was an honor to see so many nations represented on our flight today,” Phil Joyce, Blue Origin's senior vice president for the New Shepard, said in an online recap of today's mission. “The view of our fragile planet from space has a unifying effect on all who witness it, and I am always eager to see how our astronauts use this experience for the benefit of Earth.”

Blue Origin has now sent 75 people on suborbital space trips, including Russell and four other people who have taken multiple trips. The company doesn't typically reveal how much its customers are paying for their flights. Sun's case is the rare exception, due to the fact that the 2021 auction was conducted publicly. 

Sun's $28 million fare went to Blue Origin's nonprofit educational foundation, the Club for the Future. Most of that money was distributed in the form of million-dollar grants to 19 space-focused nonprofits. 

In addition to the crew, today's flight carried more than 1,500 digital postcards and 16,000 physical postcards for the Club for the Future's “Postcards in Space” program, which collects messages from students around the world. Sun set up his own “To the Sun” program to collect messages — and carried more than 1,000 of those messages into space on a thumb drive.

Sun's space ride isn't his only notable purchase: Last December, he made headlines when he spent $6.2 million to purchase a work of conceptual art featuring a banana that was duct-taped to a wall — and then ate the banana.

And for what it's worth, Sun isn't the only controversial crypto figure to take a trip on New Shepard. In February, Blue Origin withheld the identity of one of its spacefliers on the NS-30 mission. An analysis of photos and references to the flier in public records, including the Federal Aviation Administration's list of spaceflight participants, suggested that the mystery man was an Australian crypto entrepreneur named Russell Wilson (not to be confused with the former Seahawks quarterback).

In response to emailed inquiries, a Blue Origin representative told GeekWire that the company works with a third party to accept crypto payments for spaceflights.

Shortly after Hunter Lightman joined OpenAI as a researcher in 2022, he watched his colleagues launch ChatGPT, one of the fastest-growing products ever. Meanwhile, Lightman quietly worked on a team teaching OpenAI's models to solve high school math competitions. 

Today that team, known as MathGen, is considered instrumental to OpenAI's industry-leading effort to create AI reasoning models: the core technology behind AI agents that can do tasks on a computer like a human would.

“We were trying to make the models better at mathematical reasoning, which at the time they weren't very good at,” Lightman told TechCrunch, describing MathGen's early work.

OpenAI's models are far from perfect today — the company's latest AI systems still hallucinate and its agents struggle with complex tasks.

But its state-of-the-art models have improved significantly on mathematical reasoning. One of OpenAI's models recently won a gold medal at the International Math Olympiad, a math competition for the world's brightest high school students. OpenAI believes these reasoning capabilities will translate to other subjects, and ultimately power general-purpose agents that the company has always dreamed of building.

ChatGPT was a happy accident — a lowkey research preview turned viral consumer business — but OpenAI's agents are the product of a years-long, deliberate effort within the company. 

“Eventually, you'll just ask the computer for what you need and it'll do all of these tasks for you,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at the company's first developer conference in 2023. “These capabilities are often talked about in the AI field as agents. The upsides of this are going to be tremendous.”

Whether agents will meet Altman's vision remains to be seen, but OpenAI shocked the world with the release of its first AI reasoning model, o1, in the fall of 2024. Less than a year later, the 21 foundational researchers behind that breakthrough are the most highly sought-after talent in Silicon Valley.

Mark Zuckerberg recruited five of the o1 researchers to work on Meta's new superintelligence-focused unit, offering some compensation packages north of $100 million. One of them, Shengjia Zhao, was recently named chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs.

The rise of OpenAI's reasoning models and agents are tied to a machine learning training technique known as reinforcement learning (RL). RL provides feedback to an AI model on whether its choices were correct or not in simulated environments.

RL has been used for decades. For instance, in 2016, about a year after OpenAI was founded in 2015, an AI system created by Google DeepMind using RL, AlphaGo, gained global attention after beating a world champion in the board game, Go.

Around that time, one of OpenAI's first employees, Andrej Karpathy, began pondering how to leverage RL to create an AI agent that could use a computer. But it would take years for OpenAI to develop the necessary models and training techniques.

By 2018, OpenAI pioneered its first large language model in the GPT series, pretrained on massive amounts of internet data and a large clusters of GPUs. GPT models excelled at text processing, eventually leading to ChatGPT, but struggled with basic math. 

It took until 2023 for OpenAI to achieve a breakthrough, initially dubbed “Q*” and then “Strawberry,” by combining LLMs, RL, and a technique called test-time computation. The latter gave the models extra time and computing power to plan and work through problems, verifying its steps, before providing an answer. 

This allowed OpenAI to introduce a new approach called “chain-of-thought” (CoT), which improved AI's performance on math questions the models hadn't seen before.

“I could see the model starting to reason,” said El Kishky. “It would notice mistakes and backtrack, it would get frustrated. It really felt like reading the thoughts of a person.” 

Though individually these techniques weren't novel, OpenAI uniquely combined them to create Strawberry, which directly led to the development of o1. OpenAI quickly identified that the planning and fact checking abilities of AI reasoning models could be useful to power AI agents.

“We had solved a problem that I had been banging my head against for a couple of years,” said Lightman. “It was one of the most exciting moments of my research career.”

With AI reasoning models, OpenAI determined it had two new axes that would allow it to improve AI models: using more computational power during the post-training of AI models, and giving AI models more time and processing power while answering a question.

“OpenAI, as a company, thinks a lot about not just the way things are, but the way things are going to scale,” said Lightman.

Shortly after the 2023 Strawberry breakthrough, OpenAI spun up an “Agents” team led by OpenAI researcher Daniel Selsam to make further progress on this new paradigm, two sources told TechCrunch. Although the team was called “Agents,”  OpenAI didn't initially differentiate between reasoning models and agents as we think of them today. The company just wanted to make AI systems capable of completing complex tasks.

Eventually, the work of Selsam's Agents team became part of a larger project to develop the o1 reasoning model, with leaders including OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, chief research officer Mark Chen, and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki.

OpenAI would have to divert precious resources — mainly talent and GPUs — to create o1. Throughout OpenAI's history, researchers have had to negotiate with company leaders to obtain resources; demonstrating breakthroughs was a surefire way to secure them.

“One of the core components of OpenAI is that everything in research is bottom up,” said Lightman. “When we showed the evidence [for o1], the company was like, ‘This makes sense, let's push on it.'”

Some former employees say that the startup's mission to develop AGI was the key factor in achieving breakthroughs around AI reasoning models. By focusing on developing the smartest-possible AI models, rather than products, OpenAI was able to prioritize o1 above other efforts. That type of large investment in ideas wasn't always possible at competing AI labs.

The decision to try new training methods proved prescient. By late 2024, several leading AI labs started seeing diminishing returns on models created through traditional pretraining scaling. Today, much of the AI field's momentum comes from advances in reasoning models.

In many ways, the goal of AI research is to recreate human intelligence with computers. Since the launch of o1, ChatGPT's UX has been filled with more human-sounding features such as “thinking” and “reasoning.”

When asked whether OpenAI's models were truly reasoning, El Kishky hedged, saying he thinks about the concept in terms of computer science. 

“We're teaching the model how to efficiently expend compute to get an answer. So if you define it that way, yes, it is reasoning,” said El Kishky.

Lightman takes the approach of focusing on the model's results and not as much on the means or their relation to human brains.

“If the model is doing hard things, then it is doing whatever necessary approximation of reasoning it needs in order to do that,” said Lightman. “We can call it reasoning, because it looks like these reasoning traces, but it's all just a proxy for trying to make AI tools that are really powerful and useful to a lot of people.”

OpenAI's researchers note people may disagree with their nomenclature or definitions of reasoning — and surely, critics have emerged — but they argue it's less important than the capabilities of their models. Other AI researchers tend to agree.

Nathan Lambert, an AI researcher with the non-profit AI2, compares AI reasoning modes to airplanes in a blog post. Both, he says, are manmade systems inspired by nature — human reasoning and bird flight, respectively — but they operate through entirely different mechanisms. That doesn't make them any less useful, or any less capable of achieving similar outcomes.

A group of AI researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind agreed in a recent position paper that AI reasoning models are not well understood today, and more research is needed. It may be too early to confidently claim what exactly is going on inside them.

The AI agents on the market today work best for well-defined, verifiable domains such as coding. OpenAI's Codex agent aims to help software engineers offload simple coding tasks. Meanwhile, Anthropic's models have become particularly popular in AI coding tools like Cursor and Claude Code — these are some of the first AI agents that people are willing to pay up for.

However, general purpose AI agents like OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent and Perplexity's Comet struggle with many of the complex, subjective tasks people want to automate. When trying to use these tools for online shopping or finding a long-term parking spot, I've found the agents take longer than I'd like and make silly mistakes.

Agents are, of course, early systems that will undoubtedly improve. But researchers must first figure out how to better train the underlying models to complete tasks that are more subjective.

“Like many problems in machine learning, it's a data problem,” said Lightman, when asked about the limitations of agents on subjective tasks. “Some of the research I'm really excited about right now is figuring out how to train on less verifiable tasks. We have some leads on how to do these things.” 

Noam Brown, an OpenAI researcher who helped create the IMO model and o1, told TechCrunch that OpenAI has new general-purpose RL techniques which allow them to teach AI models skills that aren't easily verified. This was how the company built the model which achieved a gold medal at IMO, he said.

OpenAI's IMO model was a newer AI system that spawns multiple agents, which then simultaneously explore several ideas, and then choose the best possible answer. These types of AI models are becoming more popular; Google and xAI have recently released state-of-the-art models using this technique.

“I think these models will become more capable at math, and I think they'll get more capable in other reasoning areas as well,” said Brown. “The progress has been incredibly fast. I don't see any reason to think it will slow down.”

These techniques may help OpenAI's models become more performant, gains that could show up in the company's upcoming GPT-5 model. OpenAI hopes to assert its dominance over competitors with the launch of GPT-5, ideally offering the best AI model to power agents for developers and consumers. 

But the company also wants to make its products simpler to use. El Kishky says OpenAI wants to develop AI agents that intuitively understand what users want, without requiring them to select specific settings. He says OpenAI aims to build AI systems that understand when to call up certain tools, and how long to reason for.

These ideas paint a picture of an ultimate version of ChatGPT: an agent that can do anything on the internet for you, and understand how you want it to be done. That's a much different product than what ChatGPT is today, but the company's research is squarely headed in this direction.

While OpenAI undoubtedly led the AI industry a few years ago, the company now faces a tranche of worthy opponents. The question is no longer just whether OpenAI can deliver its agentic future, but can the company do so before Google, Anthropic, xAI, or Meta beat them to it?

Users and developers need to be shown how to get value from something radically new, and Apple hasn't done that recently.

I was not expecting Apple silicon from Apple, I didn't even realize they'd been hiring chip designers for the past decade before that.Personal computing really sucked before the mid 2000s. You had windows computers which were cheap and fast, but had lots of bugs and were hard to use and didn't do low energy very well, you had Linux as a powerful novelty, you had expensive well designed Mac's that were sort of slow but with better battery life. It took Apple's intel transition to fix all of that, and I basically thought it was finally done and personal computing all of a sudden got very boring. But today I'm running mid-sized LLM inference on a Max 3, and it's all very exciting again.

Yes, but what use is the best consumer hardware when the software is degrading?Considering the liquid glass thing, there's no one at Apple left who understands and cares about usability, for example.Plus the iOSification of Mac OS for no good reason... maybe to make it less attractive to developers?

So, being an absolute Apple-skeptic, I don't blame them for not having a crystal-clear future direction right now. VR/AR? Nah, probably not happening. AI? Probably huge, but in which direction? Who knows? And they've got products in all these markets, just not obviously compelling ones.So, a holding pattern is more than warranted at this point. Will this allow anyone to bypass Apple? Possibly, but the chance/hope of Apple front-running everyone else is definitely still alive.

I think if a new form of computing emerges Apple basically gets a free first swing at it, in terms of consumer trust. We've seen that with their VR headset, that while a dud was given far more interest and attention than Facebook's and Microsoft's offerings.I do think they show signs of vulnerability as well, even if I think they're less than their strengths. Apple's famously design focused culture seems to be cracking a bit and giving way to more Microsoft / Google style PM-led culture. That can be OK, but I think PM led cultures are sometimes almost too strategic for their own good, like someone you can tell is a salesmen not a friend, and that can result in gradual brand erosion.A simple example of this happening is Apple's website. Like Microsoft the tabs at the top of their website now reflect the company's internal organization, not what makes the most sense to the user. In the Jobs era they insisted that there would be no separate ""store"" tab, a redundancy because the whole website was a store, but I suspect that changed because the ""Store"" division within Apple wants that extra prominence.If Apple isn't careful with enough missteps they may dilute their brand and Google / Microsoft may seem just as appealing for early adopters of emerging AI OSs.

Apple is a hardware company. Its primary products are smartphones, laptops, desktop computers, and tablets. That's always been true, since they were ""Apple Computer"". On the other hand, Alphabet and Meta are advertising companies. Their primary products are ads. Does the author suggest that Apple become an advertising company? How would that even fit with Apple's hardware portfolio? Tesla sells automobiles; Apple could try to sell automobiles too, but... why? Apple has no experience in automobiles. Nvidia is kind of a one trick pony: it sells GPUs, which are currently in massive demand. But is anyone saying, well, Tim Cook has no vision, because Apple didn't make GPUs? Surely Steve Jobs wasn't going to make GPUs either. That's not what Jobs was all about.Apple is the most successful and profitable consumer computing hardware vendor in the world. They kick their direct competitors asses. Perhaps that market is somewhat saturated and doesn't have as much room for growth as other markets. But so what? It seems like critics just want ""growth"" without any purpose behind the growth. Steve Jobs always had a purpose and wasn't just looking for money, money, money. The innovation was oriented toward consumer computing hardware.Meta tried to pivot to the so-called ""metaverse"", and that got them nowhere. They're still throwing billions at it every year with hardly any return. Nonetheless, Meta is still kicking ass at its core business: selling ads on social media. Now Meta is trying to pivot to AI, throwing a ton of money at it, but who knows how that will pan out for them. Nothing yet. We're supposed to be impressed by 9-figure pay packages for individual engineers, and that is impressive in a way, but it's not impressive in the sense of, look how that paid off for Meta.It's not clear that even Apple and Microsoft are direct competitors. There's still macOS vs. Windows, which is more or less at a stalemate, but that's not the biggest piece of either company's revenue anymore. And again, nobody is out there saying that Tim Cook lacks vision because Apple is not winning desktop OS market share. None of the critics in the media even care about desktop OS market share.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Silicon Valley's AI Spend Goes Berserk as Microsoft Starts Cashing In","https://gizmodo.com/silicon-valleys-ai-spend-goes-berserk-as-microsoft-starts-cashing-in-2000638318","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 10:00:27 GMT","

Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon all reported quarterly earnings this week, and there was a common thread tying them together: a boom in AI spending and plans to increase it even more, beyond analyst expectations.

Although capital expenditures above expectations often don't tend to make investors particularly happy, it had pretty much the opposite effect this week, especially for Meta and Microsoft, both of which saw a pop in their stock following the releases.

And for Microsoft, which posted its largest ever quarterly capital expenditure forecast, the boost in shares led the tech giant to become the second-ever company to hit $4 trillion market valuation, when it briefly breached the threshold on Thursday.

The move was largely because both Meta and Microsoft finally had the revenue to show for their investments.

Meta's ad revenue, which is a huge moneymaker for the tech giant, for the past quarter came in a couple billion dollars ahead of Wall Street expectations, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed that to the deployment of artificial intelligence in the ad system. Zuckerberg went on to assure investors that this surprise increase in revenue was bound to continue, saying that his multi-billion dollar investment into building a team dedicated to creating “superintelligent” AI will lead to even more payoffs for its advertising business.

Microsoft reported that sales were up 18% from last year and that revenue for its cloud computing platform Azure had surpassed $75 billion this fiscal year, up 34% from last year. Revenue from the company's productivity and business processes segment also exceeded expectations, and company executives shared that the business software sales were boosted partially thanks to widespread adoption of its AI product Microsoft 365 Copilot.

All the news combined brings to mind one question: Is Silicon Valley's AI bet finally starting to pay off?

Meta has been in the midst of a multi-billion dollar AI push after Zuckerberg admitted that the company had fallen behind competitors in the AI race. The push has been marked by high profile strategic talent hires, and particularly the poaching of OpenAI employees tempted by multi-year deals worth millions of dollars.

In the meantime, the company is going all in on data centers as well. Last month, Zuckerberg said that Meta would be investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI data centers. The company's first of multiple multi-gigawatt data centers is to be unveiled next year, and Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads account that just one of these data centers “covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.”

This week, Meta said it's expecting to shell out between $66 billion and $72 billion this year, and that it expects to spend even more next year on data centers and hiring.

Microsoft, on the other hand, said that it is expecting to spend more than $100 billion next year, with much of it going toward AI. This upcoming quarter alone, the company is eyeing $30 billion in capital expenditures, again mostly for AI, in what is a record forecast for the company.

Apple also posted better than expected revenue on its earnings report this week, but that was mostly attributable to iPhone sales. Despite that, CEO Tim Cook told investors during the company's earnings call that the tech giant was planning to “significantly” increase its investments in AI to catch up with rivals and was open to acquisitions to do so.

One of the biggest concerns when it comes to AI is regarding spending. Even though Silicon Valley is pouring in countless dollars—over $300 billion this year alone, according to numbers from the Financial Times—not everyone believes demand for AI will scale up accordingly. And if it does not, it would cause a major problem for the industry.

In a paper published earlier last month, the Federal Reserve claimed the biggest challenge with generative AI was not the potential of the tech itself but rather getting people and businesses to actually use it. The technology isn't necessarily adopted widely outside of tech, science, and finance fields, and is deployed mostly by large firms. 

As the technology gets better, demand for AI is bound to increase, too, but by just how much is a mystery. If that demand does not grow as expected, the Fed paper warns, it could have “disastrous consequences,” much like the railroad overexpansion of the 1800s and the economic depression that followed.

The answer to whether or not AI demand will scale up to the level of investment is still not a definitive yes or a no, but this round of earnings gave a substantial dose of hope to the AI bulls.

But the risk for overspending is still there, as the tech giants continue to make record pledges of investment: if the increase in investments isn't followed by a tangible increase in demand and revenue, especially for the companies' core businesses, then the possibility of “disastrous consequences” is still there.

Every new campaign for Critical Role provides a shakeup in some way, whether it's a new location or cast of characters. With the upcoming fourth campaign, the Actual Play series sees its biggest change yet with Brennan Lee Mulligan in the Game Master's seat.

Mulligan, who runs games for his own Actual Play series Dimension 20 over on Dropout and the Critical Role miniseries Calamity, will take helm of a full campaign set to begin on October 2. During Critical Role's live event on Saturday, he came on stage as part of the announcement. This new campaign will be set outside the Exandria setting of the first three—”Vox Machina,” “Mighty Nein,” and “Bells Hells”—and help to give original Critical DM Matthew Mercer a break.

“We've been enormous fans of Brennan's for many years now, and…he felt like the perfect storyteller to take our community somewhere entirely new,” said Critical alum and CEO Travis Willingham. “Critical Role has always been about genuine connection through storytelling first and foremost, and as Brennan himself will tell you, he's still played more TTRPGs away from a camera than in front of it. His passion and drive for worldbuilding is infectious, and it's been an absolute joy to spark off him as we forge ahead.”

For Dimension 20 fans wondering how this change affects that show, Mulligan will still to lead that show. Per Variety, he recently renewed his contract with the media company for another three years, which includes a “new long-term contract for nonstop new seasons of D20,” said Mulligan on Instagram. At least two of those seasons will bring back the Intrepid Heroes who've headlined Fantasy High, Unsleeping City, and the current season Cloudward, Ho!. His separate Actual Play series Worlds Beyond Number will also continue.

“Needless to say, I'm finally playing almost as much tabletop as I'd like to!” he continued. “It's a gift, honor, and privilege to set out on this new epic adventure with Critical Role.”

Even before Marvel Studios retook ownership of the Fantastic Four and got a new movie into production, there was always a bit of fondness for the old Fox movies. Not so much the 2015 one, but the mid-2000s pair directed by Tim Story and starring Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis still have their fans. Those films were general audiences' first introduction to the characters, and there remains a bit of attachment to those versions, particularly after Evans came back for brief, fiery thirds in Deadpool & Wolverine.

In a recent Vulture interview, Gruffudd talked about still having “pure excitement” over booking the role of Reed Richards. He didn't grow up reading the comics, but he felt a duty to portray Reed as “naïve” about his powers at first, but still “honorable and noble, and clearly a bookish character who was passionate about science and wanted to do good for the world.”

“There was a great belief that we needed to represent that friendship, camaraderie, bickering,” Gruffudd added about the dynamic with his costars. And we had that innately as actors when we got together. We all had our own responsibility, but then an understanding that this was a team, this was the Fantastic Four — we are one.” Speaking to the late Julian McMahon playing his rival Doctor Doom, he remembered his former costar as “such a big part of this franchise and the success of the movies. You saw the envy and jealousy that Reed had towards Victor, and that there had been a friendship, so that sense of betrayal and devastation was an interesting aspect to play. […] You remember great performances from movies of this nature, like Gene Hackman in the original Superman, and that's the kind of flair and panache that Julian brought to this.”

In Gruffudd's recollection, Story and everyone else were staying true to the “lighter, family feel” of the Fantastic Four comics at the time, and he figured Fox's previous track record with the X-Men inherently meant the this would blossom into a franchise.  The series ended with 2007's Rise of the Silver Surfer, though there were plans for a third movie that were later scrapped despite “some sort of momentum.” These days, it wouldn't be out of the question for him to come back, but he says he's not been asked about it stretching one more time for Avengers: Doomsday or Secret Wars.

But even if that never happens, he remains “incredibly proud” of playing the character and getting to be “part of something really beautiful and much bigger than you. And I'm excited that the comic and franchise lives on.”

Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


DeepCool has been delivering innovative, interesting, and often budget-conscious PC cases and cooling products for more than a decade. Its current lineup includes air and AIO coolers, computer cases, keyboards, power supplies, and other accessories. We've been impressed by the company's AK620 and Assassin IV air coolers in the past. In 2014, the Beijing-based company was banned from selling products in the U.S., but has continued to produce and improve its cooling products for markets elsewhere.Today we'll be testing the successor to the Assassin IV, the Assassin VC Elite, as its name implies, features an upgraded vapor chamber coldplate that DeepCool claims increases cooling performance to the point it's rated to handle CPUs with up to a 300W TDP.



Will DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite make our list of best coolers on the market? On its merits, yes. But again, if you are in the United States, you'll have to looke elsewhere, no matter how good the Assassin VC Elite's performance is – and make no mistake, its performance is excellent.

Socket Compatibility

Intel Socket LGA 1851/1700/1200/115x/2066/2011/2011-v3

AMD AM5 / AM4 

Radiator Dimensions 

144 (L) x 147 (W) x 164mm (H)

Maximum TDP (Our Testing)

255W with Intel Core i7-14700K 238W with AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D





The packaging for the cooler is similar to the Assassin IV, having a square brown box with a cover which showcases the cooler and its design. The cooler is protected by a plastic cover and foam packaging, with the accessories contained in an adjacent box.



Included in the box are the following:



 ▶️ Enhanced vapor chamber coldplate and seven copper heatpipes



To transfer heat away from the CPU, this air cooler features seven copper heatpipes connected to the newest feature present in the Assassin VC Elite, which also gives it its name – a vapor chamber (VC) coldplate.



This new design is said to increase the cooling power of the Assassin VC Elite by 20W compared to the Assassin IV, with a TDP rating of up to an impressive 300W.



▶️ Change from quiet to performance modes at the flick of a switch



Like its predecessor, the Assassin IV, DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite supports two modes of operation: Performance and Quiet modes. Performance mode allows the cooler to run at its full speed, whereas quiet mode places a speed limit on the fans to ensure low noise levels.

▶️ Checkerboard Matrix fin design

One of the eye-catching features of the Assassin VC Elite is its use of a checkerboard matrix on its fins, a design choice which is said to help maintain increased levels of air pressure.



The checkerboard matrix is only incorporated into one side of the cooler; the other sides of the heatsinks use a jigsaw-style fin design.



▶️ Sturdy metal backplate

For users of Intel platforms, a sturdy metal backplate is included – much stronger than typical backplates included with air coolers!



▶️ Complete RAM Compatibility, no matter the size of DDR5



On standard AMD and Intel systems, the DeepCool Assassin VC Elite will not overhang or interfere with DIMM slots in any way, ensuring full compatibility with the tallest DDR4 or DDR5 RAM sticks.

▶️ Premium DM9 thermal paste

DeepCool includes its premium DM9 paste with the Assassin VC Elite, which is one of the best thermal pastes out there,on par with ID-Cooling's Frost X45!



▶️ Mixed size fans

Like its predecessor, the Assassin IV, DeepCool's Assassin VC Elite sports two fans of mixed sizes – 120mm and 140mm, which is said to create a “vortex” effect that increases static air pressure.



▶️ Adapter for (optional) third fan

For those who want the absolute best performance possible, DeepCool has included a bracket adapter that will allow you to install a third fan to the unit if you desire. But as we'll see in testing, that's not necessary for most setups.



▶️ Two-in-one screwdriver with Torx and Phillips support

DeepCool also includes a basic screwdriver that supports Phillips screws on one end and torx screws on the other.



▶️ Real world testing configuration – Intel LGA1700 and AMD AM5 platform:

I place an emphasis on having results that are comparable to real-world use. This means I test CPU coolers inside a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods. Many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they really are. And some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions.

I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real-world conditions where a CPU cooler is used.

CPU

Intel Core i7-14700K

GPU

ASRock Steel Legend Radeon 7900 GRE

Motherboard

MSI Z790 Project Zero

Case

MSI Pano 100L PZ Black

System Fans

Iceberg Thermal IceGale Silent

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending, which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

In order to prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, we've installed Thermalright's LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright's LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

We've recently added testing of AMD's new flagship sixteen-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D. This is one beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market – and can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

CPU

AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D

GPU

Motherboard

Case

As with previous DeepCool products, this cooler's installation is fairly easy.



1. You'll first need to apply the included backplate if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.



2. Next you'll need to install the standoffs. Intel users will slide the black standoffs onto the backplate's studs.



AMD users will instead take the silver standoffs and screw them against the motherboard.



3. Next, you'll want to take the mounting bars and apply them to the standoffs, then secure them with the included screws.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy how to apply thermal paste guide.

5. Next, you'll need to take the unit's cover off, and pull the middle fan from the unit – make sure you disconnect the PWM cord before doing so. Then take the cooler, press it against the mounting bars, and secure it with the included screwdriver.



6. Reinsert the middle fan.



7. Reattach the unit's cover and connect the PWM cables to your motherboard, and you are good to go.

Nintendo just confirmed that its Switch 2 console can potentially overheat when used in hot environments. According to its X (formerly Twitter) post [machine translated], both the original Switch and the newer Switch 2 must be used in ambient temperatures between 5 and 35 degrees Celsius (41 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit). It also warned against using its consoles outdoors, especially as temperatures in Japan have been soaring above 35 degrees Celsius recently.

“Using Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a hot environment may cause the console to become hot. Please use it in a place between 5 and 35°C, as it may cause a malfunction,” Nintendo Japan's customer service posted on X. “Recently, the temperature has been exceeding 35°C for several days. Please be careful when using outdoors.”

気温が高い場所でNintendo SwitchやNintendo Switch 2 を使用すると、本体の温度が高くなることがあります。故障の原因となる可能性がありますので、5～35℃の場所でご使用ください。最近は35℃を超える日が続いています。屋外で使用する際はご注意ください。August 1, 2025

Many users have already reported the overheating issue on the Switch 2 in early July, with the console's fans spinning at max speed trying to cool the unit. There were also several instances of the handheld crashing — both in handheld and docked modes — with one even saying that it became too hot to hold. More concerningly, these incidents weren't limited to AAA titles like Cyberpunk 2077. There were reports of this happening even while playing less demanding games like Splatoon or Pokémon.

Beyond that, this warning is also concerning for players based in hotter climates. Some regions, especially in the Middle East, the Sahara, and South Asia, often experience temperatures far exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. So, players based in this area would have trouble playing with the Switch 2 unless they're in an air-conditioned area. And as global temperatures continue to soar, we can only expect more areas to experience higher ambient temperatures, causing more consoles to experience overheating.

The Nintendo Switch 2 received a major hardware upgrade from the original Switch. But despite that, it's still a woefully underpowered console compared to modern handhelds like the GPD Win 5 and the Ayaneo Next 2. Although most of its fans buy it for its Nintendo exclusives, the company's decision to have more AAA games available on its platform means that its hardware will be pushed to its performance and thermal limits by more demanding, less optimized titles.

Tantalizing Battlefield 6 morsels have been making the rounds ever since the title's official announcement last month. The iconic shooter franchise is poised to make its return this year with a back-to-basics approach, something sorely missing from contemporary FPS titles. Add to that the disappointing response to COD: Black Ops 6 and EA has found themselves stirring the perfect concoction of demand for an AAA game launch. A couple of days ago, it revealed the relatively modest hardware requirements for the upcoming Battlefield 6 and, today, we allegedly have our first performance report to pick over.

Popular Twitch steamer, Bruhskey, took to social media to show off the game's average performance. Running at 1440p, they were able to get over 300 FPS on a setup consisting of an AMD Ryzen 9800X3D CPU and an RTX 5080 GPU — both attractive top-end components. Upon this foundation was 32GB of 6400MT/s DDR5 memory running in a 1:1 ratio, which explains the excellent 6.7-8.5 total system latency the streamer was able to achieve. The game is still under embargo so they couldn't say much, like whether any upscaling was used to hit those numbers, but in general ~300 FPS in a modern blockbuster title remains impressive.

In the same thread, Bruhskey mentioned that their friend rocking an Intel Core i9 14900K, and the same RTX 5080 GPU, were short about 110 FPS compared to the 9800X3D, signaling that the extra L3 cache in the AMD CPU was being utilized very well by the game engine.

Please add a sprinkle of salt to these comparison numbers, which we can't guarantee are representative of the finished game, or be certain were based on reasonably equivalent 9800X3D vs 14900K systems (all else being equal), among other potential issues.

The 14900K is the Blue Team's best-performing consumer desktop CPU at the moment, but it only has 36MB of L3 cache whereas the 9800X3D has 96MB, and in this case it trails behind its Ryzen counterpart by roughly 30%. This is a good sign for 3D V-Cache CPU owners because, if Bruhskey's right, they'll be able to get the most out of their processors, ensuring minimal chances of a processor bottleneck here.

These performance numbers aren't just limited to PC either, by the way, as the devs are working hard to push 60 FPS across all consoles as well. In an interview with Tech & Co., Florian Le Bihan, Principal Game Designer at Battlefield Studios, said optimization was one of the most important things to get right. Not only does every console, including the Xbox Series S, get a 60FPS mode by default, but you'll be able to cross that barrier with Performance Mode. On PC, of course, the sky (read: your hardware) is the limit, so it's great to see an AAA launch in 2025 not bogged down with unrealistic requirements.

Bruhskey did not attach any screenshots or gameplay clips to support their claims (because the game is under embargo) but it is probable that the game was running natively at 1440p since there was no mention of frame-gen or DLSS anywhere in their thread. That being said, Battlefield 6 will support all the major upscalers and feature real-time environmental destruction that the franchise is known for. The game is set to release on October 6, 2025 with an open beta planned for August 9-10. Everything seems to be lining up nicely for Battlefield's comeback, and initial impressions have been nothing but positive, to say the least.

This AMD 7800 XT was cooked, literally.

We've seen our fair share of repair jobs recently, but this one takes the cake for being the most botched attempt—before it hit the legendary desk of Northwest Repairs. They brought back a dead 5090 to life not too long ago, and this time it's an AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, one that survived being baked in an oven. Instead of the intended reflow that would've otherwise fixed it, the card just died. Fret not, though, as it reached the hands of a master chef.

Let's walk back a bit and add some context. The owner bought this XFX Speedster 7800 XT Merc 319 from Facebook Marketplace, and it never worked, so it was sent to Northwest Repairs for assessment. Once on the bench, our host Tony opened it up and was greeted with flux residue all over the board, indicating a reflow was (poorly) attempted previously. Upon further inspection, the GPU core looked intact, but its retention frame came undone the moment it was touched. This drove down the chances of a successful repair to ""0.1%,"" according to Tony, but since the core wasn't cracked, all hope was not lost yet.

The right way to reflow a PCB is by putting in on a BGA rework station and heating momentarily while regulating temperatures. This ensures the flux melts properly, allowing the solder to reflow in a natural, calculated way. Baking the board in the oven can cause a sudden thermal shock which can warp it or—worst case scenario, crack the on-board components, including the GPU core itself. That's an irreversible fate but, fortunately, the 7800 XT had not slipped that far.



The fix, then, was simple... by expert standards. Put the PCB under a thermal camera to detect any anomalies and address them one by one. Right off the bat, the GPU core was seen exhibiting short bursts of heat that looked like mini explosions. Moreover, running a memory test showed that three memory chips were faulty. This confirms why the reflow attempt from before did not work; the VRAM likely has ripped pads underneath that need to be reballed now. As such, Tony got to work on not just taking out the memory chips, but also the core itself.

A beautiful montage follows... which ends up in failure. The GPU, despite having a reballed core and memory, still doesn't boot. A memory test is run again and one of the VRAM chips turns out to be the culprit. Our repair guy wasn't sure at this point whether he did a bad job repairing the pads, or whether the chip was simply a goner. Nonetheless, he replaced the last suspect memory chip with a new one known to work and, voilà, the card finally posted. As a final measure, Tony replaced the thermal pads before reassembling the card since the original ones were ""all junk to begin with.""

This repair job shows the importance of ingenuity, a core (no pun intended) human trait, mixed with our tenacity. Not everyone can afford to casually buy a new graphics card if their current one dies on them, especially if you're in a region with shoddy warranty systems or dealing through the second-hand market. Service shops like Northwest Repair help keep hardware out of landfills, ensuring there's a safe haven for parts stuck in a coma. After all, there's a certain convenience associated with tinkering with your own components, and it serves as a key constituent of this custom gaming PC hobby we're all enrolled in.

Equally crucial is to not downplay the sheer craftsmanship involved in such a task. Replacing a GPU's memory is a tall order in of itself, let alone reballing the core. The 7800 XT in question came with non-human blood and poop marks over the PCB as well, but that's an uninteresting detail compared to everything else the repair entailed. Because we're used to seeing crazy shunt mods and DIY goodies left and right, it might not stand out as special but remember that these are professionals operating at the top of their game.

'And now the fun really begins'.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Christian ‘Peri Fractic' Simpson has confirmed that his much touted community-led acquisition of Commodore has been signed, sealed, and paid for. The Retro Recipes YouTuber announced the finalizing of the Commodore Corporation BV deal on the streets of the Netherlands this week, flanked by an assortment of Commodore legends of old, under the banner “We did it! Commodore is home!”

In the triumphant video short, Simpson breathlessly addressed his audience, stating that “We just made history. Together, we've just signed the final contract and paid in full, ahead of schedule, to complete the acquisition of the whole Commodore Corporation BV, and all 47 original Commodore trademarks, the oldest, dating back to 1983.” Behind him, you can see familiar Commodore stalwarts like David Pleasance, Leo Nigro, and Colin Proudfoot. Actually, there is a clearer view of the Commodore 'takeover' team in a Facebook post by Commodore International Corporation (see below).



In his street-filmed mini episode, Simpson continued, “And it all means that Commodore is finally in the hands of those who truly care - the community and the original employees… And now the fun really begins as Commodore reboots, not just as a retro brand with next-gen ideas, but as a digital detox brand, picking up right where we left off in the 90s. Therefore, we will be positioned to free society from toxic tech, and bring joy back to computing – 90s and Y2K style.”

This sounds positive for fans of both retro computing and new gadgetry, which plays to the strengths of home computers from a few decades past. The will and talent seem to be there. Moreover, Simpson seemed especially pleased that funding had come through, early, so this deal was signed sealed and delivered ahead of schedule.

We already witnessed the first product launch of the ‘new' Commodore, Last month we reported on the Commodore 64 Ultimate computer launch. In brief, it is a machine pulled together from various enthusiast projects, but it is welcome to see it packaged and marketed in a connected way, and priced from $299, as long as you're partial to beige – more cosmetically adventurous models ramp up in price.

Some more hints at what to expect going forward are provided by the latest updates to the official Commodore.net about page. Here, Simpson (we assume) expands on his “digital detox brand” idea, as well as the direction that will lead to “retro futurism” under the Commodore banner.

Personally, as someone who didn't enjoy the 8-bit home computer era nearly as much as the following 16-bit era, I'd like to see some more ‘futurism' from the revamped Commodore. However, I am aware that Cloanto are the current custodians of the public-facing Amiga Inc. brand with its excellent Amiga Forever emulation products.

U.S. men's national team winger Timothy Weah looks set to leave Juventus ahead of the 2025–26 European season, with a move to Ligue 1's Olympique Marseille reportedly lined up.

Weah, 25, joined the Serie A giants in 2023 but struggled to make a significant impact and looked to be outside of head coach Igor Tudor's plans for the upcoming season. Tensions became frayed. Last week, Weah's representative, Badou Sambague, spoke out against Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, accusing the Turin club of showing “total disrespect” to his client after Comolli criticized Weah's push to join Marseille over other clubs. 

“The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli fired back. “And the offer hasn't arrived yet.”

Now, it appears as though a deal will be done. Marseille have “verbally agreed” to loan Weah for the 2025–26 campaign in a deal which includes an obligation to buy, per Fabrizio Romano. The Ligue 1 outfit are expected to pay €1 million ($1.16 million) for the loan through the end of the season before committing to a €14 million ($17.4 million) transfer fee next summer.

The clubs have also reportedly agreed on €3 million ($3.48 million) of add-ons and a sell-on clause for the player who scored seven goals in 78 matches with the Bianconeri. 

Signing with Marseille, Weah joins demanding Italian manager Roberto de Zerbi. He also returns to France's top flight, where he previously had stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Lille. With the latter, Weah scored eight goals in 107 matches, helping them win a surprise Ligue 1 title in 2020–21. 

The new club and return to the league should also set Weah up for regular minutes ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in North America, where he could be among the key pieces for the USMNT. 

This summer, Weah was unable to join the USMNT for the Concacaf Gold Cup due to Juventus FIFA Club World Cup commitments, but only played 45 minutes in their four matches through the quarterfinals of the tournament. 

With Marseille, he becomes the latest North American to join the club alongside Canadian center back Derek Cornelius. He will hope for a better fate than another Canadian, Ismael Koné, who had a very public falling out with De Zerbi and is now at Sassuolo in Serie A. 

Marseille open the Ligue 1 season against Rennes on Aug. 15, and will also compete in the 2025–26 edition of the UEFA Champions League.

Updated on August 02, 2025

By Martina Alcheva

As the U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) prepared for the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup, the conversation surrounding the squad became less about tactics and matchups—and more about who wasn't there. The absence of Christian Pulisic and other key American stars drew sharp criticism from pundits, former players, and fans alike. The decision has drawn mostly outrage, with some fans and former players labeling the move unpatriotic.

But now, a respected USMNT legend has come to the defense of Pulisic and his fellow absentees, backing their decision to rest and blasting their critics with a harsh nine-word claim that has reignited the national debate.

The 26-year-old's exclusion from the Gold Cup was not a surprise to U.S. Soccer insiders. The Milan forward played 57 matches for club and country in the 2024-25 season and requested time off to physically and mentally recharge. With the World Cup less than a year away, the decision was jointly made between the player, his team, and U.S. Soccer officials.

“Christian and his team approached the federation and the coaching staff about the possibility of stepping back this summer,” U.S. Soccer sporting director Matt Crocker explained. “After thoughtful discussions and careful consideration, we made the collective decision that this is the right moment for him to get the rest he needs.”

Despite this, the absence of Pulisic, along with other key players like Weston McKennie, Gio Reyna, and Timothy Weah, sparked fierce criticism—most notably from Landon Donovan, who suggested some players lacked the commitment to represent their country.

During Fox Sports' broadcast of the UEFA Nations League final on June 8, Donovan appeared to criticize Pulisic—without naming him directly—by drawing a comparison to Cristiano Ronaldo. “This is what it means to represent your country. If you don't want to take that opportunity seriously and responsibly, then don't come in,” Donovan said. “Ronaldo is 40 years old. He's tired. He's still out there grinding.”

The remarks set off a firestorm. Pulisic responded days later during an appearance on CBS Sports' Call It What You Want. “To question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line,” he said. “My body started talking to me… I thought about what would be best for me leading into next year and the World Cup.”

Now, former USMNT captain Marcelo Balboa has joined the conversation—and he's not holding back. Speaking on the Call It What You Want podcast, Balboa defended Pulisic and criticized the growing negativity aimed at American stars.

“We all want to see soccer grow. We want this team to do well,” Balboa said. “Tell me—what good does it do, beating up Christian Pulisic every day, or Tyler Adams, or Weston McKennie? It makes no sense.”

And then came his boldest statement, a nine-word critique that captured attention across the U.S. soccer community: “There's a fine line between being negative and being an idiot.” Balboa acknowledged that scrutiny is part of the job, especially with the national team under a global spotlight, but emphasized that constructive criticism must not devolve into personal attacks. “We wanted this kind of pressure as athletes… But I've got their back and always will.”

While Mexico celebrates another historic milestone, questions loom around one of the region's other traditional powerhouses — particularly Christian Pulisic and the USMNT, who find themselves in unfamiliar territory.


CONCACAF's final stage of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup will feature 12 national teams split into three groups of four. Each team will play six home-and-away matches. The winner of each group will qualify directly for the World Cup, while the two best runners-up will move on to the intercontinental playoffs, giving the region a chance to send a record eight teams to the tournament.

Tottenham Hotspur are now trying again to sign a France international after they failed to convince him to come to N17 during the January window.

Thomas Frank has admitted that Tottenham may not be done adding to their forward line this summer, despite landing Mohammed Kudus from West Ham earlier this summer.

That might be down to the fact that Heung-min Son is edging closer to a move to Los Angeles FC.

Now, the Lilywhites have expressed an interest in a Paris Saint-Germain star just two weeks before they take on the Ligue 1 giants in the UEFA Super Cup clash.

It was revealed last month that Tottenham had been contacted about Randal Kolo Muani's availability after his permanent move to Juventus stalled.

It has now been revealed by The Times that Spurs have renewed their interest in the forward as Thomas Frank's men look to add to their attack after missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White.

The outlet says that the North Londoners were keen on landing Kolo Muani in January prior to his move to Turin, and they are now trying again this summer.

According to a recent update from TBR Football, PSG are demanding €50m (£43.3m) for Kolo Muani after Luis Enrique deemed the striker surplus to requirements.

However, the same update revealed that Manchester United and Newcastle United are also interested in the Frenchman.

Earlier this summer, Chelsea were also credited with an interest in Kolo Muani, which means that a deal for the former Eintracht Frankfurt man may not be straightforward for the Lilywhites to complete.","{'href': 'https://www.spurs-web.com', 'title': 'Spurs Web'}","soccer"

World Cup

This is the eighth in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup. The previous articles have looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962. This time, it's the turn of England in 1966.

The codifiers of association football had a mediocre record at the World Cup until hosting it. England hadn't entered the first three tournaments because the FA were still refusing to be a part of FIFA. In their four attempts since deciding to take part, England had twice reached the quarter-finals, but had twice been eliminated at the group stage.

Yet England still enjoyed great reverence across the footballing world. In 1963, the FA celebrated its centenary by hosting a game between England and a Rest of the World XI, a genuine collection of the best footballers from every other nation. England won 2-1. Even accounting for home advantage and the unfamiliarity of the opposition players with one another, it's clear England had outstanding individuals. The spine of Gordon Banks, Bobby Moore and Bobby Charlton were all arguably the best in the world in their position.

But they needed home advantage to become the world champions. And while hosting the tournament has always increased the chances of success, particularly in the early days of the World Cup, this was the first time since the opening two editions — Uruguay and Italy — that the hosts actually won it.

Upon taking charge of England in October 1962, Alf Ramsey declared that England would win the World Cup. It was a bold claim.

But this was a manager who had recently completed something even more unlikely than winning the World Cup with the host nation. In 1955, aged 35, he'd taken charge of Ipswich Town, in the third tier of English football. Two years later, he won promotion to the second tier. Four years after that, he won promotion to the First Division. And then he promptly won the title at his first attempt. Even when considering that the gap between the divisions was less substantial than in the modern age, this was an unprecedented transformation of a club. Sensing things couldn't get much better, he left Suffolk for the England job.

Ramsey had been a no-nonsense England full-back in his playing days, including at World Cup 1950. He also scored the final goal in England's most famous defeat, the 6-3 loss to Hungary at Wembley in 1953. He was never overwhelmingly popular with the press or supporters, but he never tried to be.

He remained in charge of England for another eight years after this World Cup success, before being sacked when he failed to qualify for World Cup 1974. He was barely seen afterwards, aside from a brief stint in charge of Birmingham City, when he'd originally joined to serve on the board. But Ramsey really only had two major jobs in his coaching career, and he won the First Division and then won the World Cup.

Ramsey was, in a sense, the first proper England manager. Until the Second World War, there had been no official position of head coach, and the squad was selected by a selection committee. This seems bizarre today, but in a world before matches were widely televised, and when all weekend matches kicked off at the same time, it was thought that keeping across the entire First Division (and beyond) was impossible. England merely had a ‘trainer' in charge of tactics.

Walter Winterbottom is generally considered England's first official head coach, but he was also the FA's first director of coaching, and used to joke — maybe half-joke — that “the job had a sideline to it: manager of the England teams”. The plural reflects that he was in charge of both the main England team and the amateur equivalent, and genuinely seemed to consider this of less overall importance than his other role. Besides, he also had his squad picked by an eight-man selection committee.

Ramsey, almost routinely described as ‘not an establishment figure', wasn't going to stand for any of that and was given full control of picking the England squad and starting XI. “It's a new position,” he said upon his appointment. “This sort of thing has never been done before and I think we'll have to find out what we can do. It's something that has to be established and something that one has to find out about.”

Ramsey was considered unusual for picking a full 22-man squad for every international break; in the days before substitutes, it was previously considered enough to pick a much smaller group.

England's success didn't convince everyone that the position of England manager was necessary. In the early 1980s, Brian Glanville, the most revered 20th-century English football writer in English football, wrote a World Soccer column claiming that England had generally coped fine without one, although this was partly a dig at the poor performance of Ramsey's successors, Don Revie and Ron Greenwood.

Surprisingly, for a country not renowned for being overly interested in tactics, England are unique in that their World Cup-winning side had a nickname describing their tactical approach: these were ‘Ramsey's wingless wonders'. A telling sign of this approach is that England's centre-forwards can be seen taking throw-ins in the final.

The idea of playing without wingers was almost unthinkable before World Cup 1966. English football's most adored players were wingers — in the previous decade, they'd fielded Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney in the same side. And in Ramsey's early days in charge, he put great emphasis upon the importance of wingers. But his sides became increasingly narrow. He started the tournament with Manchester United's outside forward John Connelly, something of a forgotten figure, in the side. But by the end of the tournament, England barely had any width at all.

The eventual starting XI was difficult to describe in terms of system, but players had very clear characteristics. Moore was the refined ball-playing defender, while Jack Charlton was more old-school. Both full-backs pushed forward. Nobby Stiles was a combative defensive midfielder who came under fire for his tackling during this tournament, and his presence allowed Martin Peters to roam. On the right, Alan Ball was something between a box-to-box player and a wide man, and notable for his sheer energy in the final, while Charlton very vaguely played from the left but was more of a No 10.

Up front was the biggest talking point. Jimmy Greaves, the greatest goalscorer in English top-flight history, dropped out of the starting XI through injury midway through the tournament and never regained his place. Hurst, who had only made his debut earlier in the year but had headed the quarter-final winner against an infamously physical Argentina side, remained in the team. Ramsey also stuck with Roger Hunt, who lacked Greaves' natural talent but had a reputation as a hard worker.

That, for many, symbolised Ramsey — an admirer of disciplined workers rather than talented individualists.



You can make a case for various players. Hurst scored a hat-trick in the final. Moore was the captain and became the symbol of England's victory. Banks was a truly legendary goalkeeper. Ball was the best performer in the final.

But ultimately England's true star was Bobby Charlton, a player who won that year's Ballon d'Or and finished second in the subsequent two years. A rampaging attacking midfielder who was the all-time top goalscorer for both Manchester United and England until Wayne Rooney surpassed him in both respects (Harry Kane since surpassed Charlton and Rooney for England goals), he produced the best individual moment of England's campaign with a brilliant goal in the group stage win over Mexico, running from the halfway line, feinting to go on his left foot, before chopping onto his right and firing into the top corner from 30 yards.

“He was one of the greatest players I have ever seen,” Ramsey later said. “He was very much the linchpin of the 1966 team. Early in my management, I knew I had to find a role suitable to Bobby's unique talents.” That was a particular compliment from a manager who hadn't appreciated the talents of other big-name attackers. Charlton, unusually considering he was England's third-most advanced player, wore No 9 in the tournament, partly a reflection of the fact that Ramsey had previously used him as a centre-forward.

Charlton's best display for England came in the semi-final win over Portugal, where he lit up the game with his passing — sometimes considered a relative weakness compared to other greats in his role — and also scored both goals in a 2-1 win.

The quality of that display led to him being quieter in the final, however. West Germany manager Helmut Schon was so scared of Charlton's goalscoring threat that he instructed Franz Beckenbauer, at this point renowned as an exciting attacking midfielder, to man-mark Charlton out of the game. Broadly speaking, Beckenbauer managed that, but possibly at the expense of West Germany's own attacking threat.

Overall, a really good game between two sides — Beckenbauer's role aside — focused on pushing forward and attacking. Helmut Haller put West Germany ahead after a rare mistake from Ray Wilson, before Hurst headed home unmarked from Moore's flighted free kick.

Goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski was often criticised for not coming to claim this cross — and the way he stood behind his line and simply pointed at Hurst did look rather odd — but he'd previously taken a bad knock when coming for another cross and was therefore hesitant to leave his line again.

Peters seemed to have won the game with a simple volley at a corner, after Hurst's effort had been blocked and looped up into the air, but then defender Wolfgang Weber scored an even scrappier goal to equalise in the penultimate minute.

That meant extra time. Ramsey famously told his players that they'd won the game once, and now they had to do so again.

There are two options from extra time. You can argue that England's goal to go 3-2 ahead is the most famous moment — on the turn, Hurst smashed the ball against the bar. It bounced down onto the line and then out. The goal was given by linesman Tofiq Bahramov, who became referred to as “the Russian linesman” in England, although he hailed from present-day Azerbaijan. In fact, he's such a hero in the otherwise unremarkable footballing nation of Azerbaijan that the country's former national stadium was named after him.

Without wanting to go over the nuances of a 59-year debate and the various modern technological attempts to prove it one way or another, it seems unlikely the ball actually crossed the line. The common argument from Hurst is that it must have been over because England striker Hunt turned away to appeal for the goal rather than heading in the rebound. This is somewhat disingenuous; Hunt wasn't at the right angle to tell, and the ball was bouncing slightly past him anyway.

England at least scored a fourth, although there was further confusion here. Referee Gottfried Dienst had put his whistle to his lips, seemingly about to blow for full time, before waving on the play. This meant some England supporters had started their pitch invasion with the play still going on, with Hurst sent in behind by a long ball. This prompted the most famous commentary line in British sporting history, courtesy of the BBC's Kenneth Wolstenholme. “Some people are on the pitch! They think it's all over,” and then, as Hurst slammed home another goal, “It is now.”

It was Moore's second assist of the final, and more significantly, Hurst's third goal — his hat-trick is analysed in more detail here. He remained the only hat-trick scorer in a World Cup final until Kylian Mbappe's for France in 2022. Hurst now proudly declares that he's the only hat-trick scorer in a World Cup final to finish on the winning side.

England were hardly hailed as spectacular winners across the world, especially in an era when Brazil were regularly winning the tournament with wonderful football, but this was a tournament of few genuine contenders. Caution and discipline in their first four matches, when they were underwhelming but kept four clean sheets, gave way to more impressive displays in their last two matches. They were the better side in open, entertaining games against both Portugal and West Germany.

It's difficult to identify who else should have won it. Hungary started promisingly before fading. The most praise was generally reserved for two first-time qualifiers: North Korea, who famously defeated Italy and then went 3-0 up against Portugal before losing 5-3. Portugal, the other key debutants, had the most revered player at the tournament, Eusebio. But they lost to England fair and square in the semi. The majority of matches were considered somewhat drab and overly aggressive at a time when a more defensive approach to football seemed to be on the rise.

The 1966 success is sometimes retrospectively framed as ‘the worst thing that could have happened to English football', as it convinced them to knuckle down and focus on hard running over talent. That always seems overly contrary, and besides, that wasn't Ramsey's fault — unlike Winterbottom, he wasn't the FA's director of coaching, too. His task was to win the World Cup, and he did.

Six-time world player of the year Marta came off the bench to score twice, including an equalizer in stoppage time, as Brazil came from behind three times before winning the penalty shootout 5-4 against Colombia on Saturday to secure their ninth Copa América Femenina title.

The 39-year-old Marta entered the match in the 82nd minute and scored in the sixth minute of stoppage time to level for Brazil at 3-3, before scoring again in extra time to have the Brazilians in front for the first time in the match.

Leicy Santos scored in the 115th to bring Colombia back level at 4-4 as the match went to a penalty shootout.

Goalkeeper Lorena Da Silva then saved two penalty kicks in the shootout to clinch Brazil's fifth title in a row at the continental championships, and beat Colombia for the fourth time in the past five finals.

Marta, who has played in six World Cups and six Olympics, has 122 goals in 206 games with Brazil.

Angelina Alonso in the 45th and Amanda Gutierres in the 80th also scored for the Brazil team that won the silver medal at the Paris Olympics, losing to the United States in the final.

Gutierres scored her sixth goal of the tournament to finish as the top scorer alongside Paraguay's Claudia Martinez.

Linda Caicedo in the 25th, Mayra Ramirez in the 88th and Santos scored for Colombia. The Colombians also had an own goal by Brazil defender Tarciane in the 69th as it took the lead three times before being pegged back in an extraordinary final.

The Brazilian women have won eight of the nine editions of the Copa América and are considered the best team in South America. Their best finish at the World Cup was runner-up in 2007, and they have reached the Olympic final three times.

Saturday's match at Estadio Rodrigo Paz Delgado in Ecuador was a rematch of the 2022 final that was played in Colombia and that Brazil won, 1-0.

					Bridging the gap				

Paryaj Lakay, a sports betting and casino company based in Pétion-Ville, has supported the Haitian men's under-17 soccer team by donating 19.8 million gourdes—about $150,000—to aid their preparation for the Qatar 2025 FIFA World Cup in that category. This donation highlights betting platform funds as a new source of financing for Haiti's sports sector and renews its longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship.

CAP-HAÏTIEN — Sports betting and casino company Paryaj Lakay, Haitian Creole for Home Bet, has partnered with the Haitian Football Federation (FHF) to help prepare the men's under-17 national soccer team for the 2025 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in Qatar in November. According to its Aug. 1 Facebook post, the Pétion-Ville-based company has donated through its foundation 19.8 million gourdes—approximately $150,000—to the FHF to ensure the team arrives in the best possible condition for the competition. 

“They are our future,” the betting platform officials wrote. “There's no bigger pride than waving our flag for the world to see.”

The donation is among the largest ever made by a Haitian betting platform to a national sports entity—signaling the country's growing reliance on private betting sponsors amid chronic underfunding from the government and lack of transparency from national federations. The country's sports sector, particularly soccer, has a longstanding reliance on gambling sponsorship—notably the lottery industry, mostly known as bòlèt. 

FHF confirmed the partnership in a July 31 statement, adding that a donation feature is also active on the ParyajLakay.com site to allow public contributions.

“Through this gesture, the Paryaj Lakay Foundation reaffirms its commitment to Haitian youth and launches a call for national mobilization,” the statement read.

Despite appreciation for the donation, many Haitians remain concerned that the funds won't be used as intended.

“We can't trust them [FHF],” said Varona Jean-Charles, a soccer fan from Léogâne. “Yes, Paryaj Lakay is trying to save the team, but people in the federation might not use all of it on the team. We must have doubts. We live in a corrupt country.”

Jean-Charles, 28, said he still plans to contribute through Paryaj Lakay's platform—but with reservations.

“If they misuse my money, karma will hit them,” he said, calling for  Haiti's Anti-Corruption Unit (ULCC) to audit FHF spending.

Others echoed his sentiments on social media.

“It would've been great if this money did exactly what it's supposed to do,” wrote Facebook user Vilgard Charles.

“Yes, Paryaj Lakay is trying to save the team, but people in the federation might not use all of it on the team. We must have doubts. We live in a corrupt country.”

The exact breakdown of how the $150,000 will be used remains unclear, and neither FHF nor Paryaj Lakay responded to messages from The Haitian Times seeking comment.

The FHF has long faced allegations of embezzlement and unaccountability. In 2017, for instance, FIFA donated half a million US dollars to rehabilitate six fields damaged by Hurricane Matthew—funds that failed to yield visible results.

In 2019, Haiti's senior men's national team made a historic run to the Gold Cup semifinals, yet players never received their promised bonuses. According to  AyiboPost, the federation received $200,000 from CONCACAF for that tournament.

This pattern of missing funds continues to cast doubt on even well-intentioned contributions.

Haiti's under-17 team is currently in Port-au-Prince with 26 players for the first phase of training. On July 29, they defeated local club Abeilles FC in a friendly match. They will travel to the south and the north this month to continue with their training and play more warm-up games. 

The second phase will take place in Jamaica from August 31 to September 14. The final phase will be held in Spain from September 15 through October 31 before traveling to Qatar.

At the 2025 U-17 FIFA World Cup,  Les Grenadiers will face Egypt on Nov. 4, England on Nov. 7, and Venezuela on Nov. 10 in the group stage.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Report: USMNT's Tim Weah Nears Conclusion to Stormy Transfer Saga","https://www.si.com/soccer/usmnt-tim-weah-conclusion-stormy-transfer-saga","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 15:35:00 GMT","

U.S. men's national team winger Timothy Weah looks set to leave Juventus ahead of the 2025–26 European season, with a move to Ligue 1's Olympique Marseille reportedly lined up.

Weah, 25, joined the Serie A giants in 2023 but struggled to make a significant impact and looked to be outside of head coach Igor Tudor's plans for the upcoming season. Tensions became frayed. Last week, Weah's representative, Badou Sambague, spoke out against Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, accusing the Turin club of showing “total disrespect” to his client after Comolli criticized Weah's push to join Marseille over other clubs. 

“The player wants to go to Marseille, but in soccer you can't choose a team because if the right offer doesn't arrive, you stay on the sidelines,” Comolli fired back. “And the offer hasn't arrived yet.”

Now, it appears as though a deal will be done. Marseille have “verbally agreed” to loan Weah for the 2025–26 campaign in a deal which includes an obligation to buy, per Fabrizio Romano. The Ligue 1 outfit are expected to pay €1 million ($1.16 million) for the loan through the end of the season before committing to a €14 million ($17.4 million) transfer fee next summer.

The clubs have also reportedly agreed on €3 million ($3.48 million) of add-ons and a sell-on clause for the player who scored seven goals in 78 matches with the Bianconeri. 

Signing with Marseille, Weah joins demanding Italian manager Roberto de Zerbi. He also returns to France's top flight, where he previously had stints with Paris Saint-Germain and Lille. With the latter, Weah scored eight goals in 107 matches, helping them win a surprise Ligue 1 title in 2020–21. 

The new club and return to the league should also set Weah up for regular minutes ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in North America, where he could be among the key pieces for the USMNT. 

This summer, Weah was unable to join the USMNT for the Concacaf Gold Cup due to Juventus FIFA Club World Cup commitments, but only played 45 minutes in their four matches through the quarterfinals of the tournament. 

With Marseille, he becomes the latest North American to join the club alongside Canadian center back Derek Cornelius. He will hope for a better fate than another Canadian, Ismael Koné, who had a very public falling out with De Zerbi and is now at Sassuolo in Serie A. 

Marseille open the Ligue 1 season against Rennes on Aug. 15, and will also compete in the 2025–26 edition of the UEFA Champions League.

The Newcastle striker is at the centre of this summer's longest-running tug of war in a throwback to some epic transfer tussles of the past

Newcastle wantaway Alexander Isak is pulling out all the textbook moves to force a switch to Liverpool; having told the Magpies he wants to leave, the striker has been left out of a friendly, pulled out of the pre-season tour and, of course, gone 'AWOL'. It's a throwback to some of the great transfer sagas of years gone by, and it seems to have some way to run yet.

A matter of days after Liverpool made their interest clear, Isak was sent home ahead of Newcastle's friendly defeat to Celtic having been unsettled by the intense speculation surrounding him. Then, after Al-Hilal joined the race for his signature, the striker was left out of the Magpies' pre-season tour to Asia due to a supposed thigh injury.

Reports that he had gone 'AWOL' soon followed amid the Tynesiders' refusal to sell, and it emerged that he had been training at former club Real Sociedad in Spain, rather than at Newcastle's facilities, in a bid to get back to full fitness. Isak wants to join the Reds, and it's even been claimed that he could even take the 'nuclear' option of unilaterally terminating his contract to make the move happen.

This one's not over yet, but how does the saga centring around Isak compare to some of the most infamous in football history? GOAL runs through the top 10:","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The top half of the draw wrapped up its Round of 16 action on Saturday in Toronto, and while the matches weren't packed with drama, they did offer a glimpse of who's settling into gear heading into the business end of the tournament.

Alexei Popyrin kept his title defence alive with a gritty comeback over Holger Rune, flipping the script after a frustrating first set where he went 0-for-11 on break points. His serving and forehand fired up just in time, setting up a quarterfinal against top seed Alexander Zverev, who advanced after Francisco Cerundolo retired early in the second set due to an abdominal issue.

Elsewhere, Alex Michelsen dominated fellow American Learner Tien in a match that never really got going, while Karen Khachanov delivered one of his cleanest performances of the season to dismiss Casper Ruud in straight sets.

Here's a full breakdown of Day 7 action as we head into the final stretch in Toronto.

Alexei Popyrin def. Holger Rune, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3

Defending champion Alexei Popyrin kept his title defence alive, rallying past fifth seed Holger Rune 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals.

I thought Rune looked in pretty good form after his training block with Agassi, and after Popyrn went 0/11 on break points in the first set, it looked like the Dane had one foot in the last eight.

However, Popyrin has an explosive game, and he unleashed 14 aces and 13 forehand winners while committing just two unforced errors in the second set to get level before carrying that momentum into the third.

The World No. 26 faces top seed Alexander Zverev next, aiming to defend his 1000 points.

Alex Michelsen def. Learner Tien, 6-3, 6-3

Alex Michelsen outclassed Learner Tien 6-3, 6-3 in 80 minutes, reaching his first ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

Tien is usually a brick wall, but his 42 unforced errors allowed Michelsen to dictate with his forehand. 8 double faults didn't help his cause either and he was on the back foot in basically every service game, not a good position to be in.

Karen Khachanov def. Casper Ruud, 6-4, 7-5

Karen Khachanov upset eighth seed Casper Ruud 6-4, 7-5, securing his first win over the Norwegian in three meetings.

The Russian's relentless baseline game proved too solid and he moved the ball around nicely, winning 80% of rallies under five shots.

I'd mistakingly thought Ruud had found some decent form based on highlights, but having watched some longer footage of his first two matches, his game was all over the shop, relying more on his experience to get the job done.

Alexander Zverev def. Francisco Cerundolo, 6-4, 2-1 (Ret.)

Alexander Zverev advanced to the Toronto quarter-finals when Francisco Cerundolo retired at 6-4, 2-1 due to an abdominal strain at the National Bank Open. 

Cerundolo struggled throughout with taped abs and limited serving power. He's not known for retiring at the drop of the hat so it's safe to assume he wasn't able to play.

Zverev consoled Cerundolo at the 5-4 changeover before closing out the first set and the Argentine played one more game before calling it quits.

First !

Thx as always Jonathan for keeping us up to date on men's world class tennis 🎾

Year after year this tournament remains strange and might be the easiest possibility for second & third row players to grab a masters title (then comes with Monte Carlo and former Paris-Bercy).

I would hand over the 1000 tournament license to a grass court event before Wimbledon instead.
Generally the masters tournaments should be distributed a bit better regarding more equidistant scheduling

Yeah, I think the '96 draw is also going to destroy Cincinnati, which was always one of my favourite events.

Monte Carlo is probably now the best as it's still 1 week long and better organised.

I think they should leave IW as the only 96 draw event.

Defending champion Alexei Popyrin claimed his second consecutive win over a former Top 5 player when he rallied from a set down to defeat fifth seed Holger Rune 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 at the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto Saturday night.

Popyrin went 0/11 on break point opportunities in the first set before dropping his brand of ‘Big Man Tennis' on the Dane, converting both break points in the second set and his first of the third as he powered to the finish line behind 14 aces and 13 forehand winners.

“I started this week not high on confidence, needing to get a grasp of the mental side,” Popyrin said of defending his title and 1000 points. “But this week I kind of just let go of all the pressure.

“After the first set I was pissed [about not breaking]. But when I came back out to return again, it felt like I was in control of the match. I told myself to be aggressive on the next break point that I got, and from then on I felt quite comfortable.""

The 25-year-old Australian produced a perfect blend of Serve + 1 power and consistency, making just two unforced errors from the baseline in the second set, as he extended his winning streak to nine matches in Canada. He will next play top seed Alexander Zverev.

Popyrin, who ousted former World No. 1 Daniil Medvedev in the third round, advanced to his first hard-court quarter-final at any level since his stunning run to the title 12 months ago in Montreal.

“I feel comfortable on these courts, where I hit my first aggressive shot and then can dictate from there… My forehand was the standout today,” Popyrin said.

Popyrin, who recently told ATPTour.com that he wanted to find consistency in his results by staying in baseline rallies longer by using his mobility, hit 30 winners to 24 unforced errors, while Rune hit 24 winners and 39 unforced errors, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Jannik Sinner has arrived at the Cincinnati Open, where he will aim to defend his title at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Ohio.

The 23-year-old Italian, competing for the first time since winning Wimbledon last month, hit at the hard-court event on Sunday, sharing laughs with his team before fine-tuning his game. Sinner has fond memories in Cincinnati, having defeated Frances Tiafoe to clinch the trophy last year.

Sinner will be joined at the event by Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz and Carlos Alcaraz, who fell to Sinner in the Wimbledon final in the pair's latest Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

French Open winner Carlos Alcaraz opened up on his unique rivalry with fellow Slam winner Jannik Sinner and how he overcame the Italian at a Roland Garros final that ranks right up there with some of the greatest tennis matches of all time. 

Alcaraz said that he believed that closing a slam was going to be tough on Sinner and that he would get his chances to make his way back into the match. 

“I simply thought about coming back little by little: one point, then another point, then another point, especially those three points,” he said in an interview to the Financial Times. “Closing a Grand Slam is very, very difficult, so I knew that I would have chances. That's why I stayed calm. I knew it wasn't going to be easy for him.”

Alcaraz also spoke about the mental warfare during a match of this significance that took place in this year's French Open. The Spaniard revealed that his confident demeanor was also one that he portrayed in order to not show any weakness.

“It was a bit the image I wanted to give as well,” he said. “At no time did I doubt that I could come back, but obviously you have to show an image of self-confidence at all times. As soon as you show weakness to the other, that's it – you are lost.”

Alcaraz also spoke about his relatioship with Sinner. While the initial years of a Roger Federer-Rafa Nadal rivalry was respectful yet distant, the same isn't necessarily true for this generation's greatest two tennis players. 



“Jannik and I, who have had great battles on the court, see each other a lot off of it. We talk, we train together sometimes. And in the end you forge a good relationship, a beautiful relationship … We want to win and beat each other, but then off court, being good people and getting along is another matter. For me that is one of the virtues and values of sport,” said Alcaraz, who will next be a part of the US Open. ","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","‘That Killed Me' -- Alexander Zverev Rues Career-Defining Incident That Took Away His Dream of Becoming World No. 1","https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tennis/alexander-zverev-ankle-injury-roland-garros-career-impact/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 14:58:43 GMT","

The moment Alexander Zverev's career shifted was as raw as sports get. He was flying on court, one win away from reaching the top spot in the world rankings and chasing Grand Slam glory. Then, just like that, his season and his climb came to a painful halt. Fans and experts still wonder how different things would be if not for what happened at Roland Garros that day.

Zverev has been one of the most consistent players on the ATP Tour in recent years. In 2022, he recaptured his best form and was closer than ever to the World No. 1 ranking. But during the French Open semifinal that year, an ankle injury forced him off the court and brought his career goals to a screeching stop. Lately, Zverev has opened up about that moment and why it was so tough for him to deal with.

On a recent episode of the “Nothing Major” podcast, host John Isner got straight to it, asking Zverev: “Would you say that match at Roland Garros is, so far in your career, your biggest career setback?”

Zverev didn't hesitate: “Yes, and I'll tell you why.” He went on to say:

“It's not because I lost that match, right? Like everybody keeps saying, ‘Oh, I would have won a match.' Well, actually, he was up a set when it happened. Of course, it was an incredible match. I felt like I was playing some of the best tennis of my life, but the thing that was so upsetting to me was like just imagine: I lose that match, right? I lose that match, it's Rafa on Clay, at Roland Garros, millions of people lost to him there.”

 

Alexander Zverev's comeback is one of the greatest injury comeback stories in recent memory. From sustaining a brutal ankle injury, tearing all his ligaments and screaming at the top of his lungs due to the pain, then two years later, he's once again falling to his knees 1/2 pic.twitter.com/jNZp6wtfGT

— Vishal❤️ (@Fans4AlexZverev) November 3, 2024

He dug deeper into what stung the most: “But the one thing that people don't realize, I was 45 points away from the number one spot for three months. I needed to win one match, just one match at any tour level tournament to become world number one. That's the thing that hurt me the most, right? Because I was playing the best tennis of my life.”

Going over his results, Zverev laid it out: “In 2021, I won six titles. I won the Olympic gold medal. I won the world finals. I won two master's events, and then 2022 started. I started off playing well as well. I made semis of Monaco, finals of Madrid, semis of Rome, semis of Roland Garros and then the ankle injury happens like I lose that match fine but I go to Halle and I make quarters of Halle, I'm world number one, right?”

To wrap up, Zverev talked about what could have been without that injury: “That's the thing that killed me because I broke seven ligaments and shattered three bones, so there's really not much I can do about it and even without that the way I was playing, I felt like I was in my best ever position to win a grand slam, to win Wimbledon, to win US Open, to win something big because the way I was playing.”



On June 3, 2022, Zverev faced Rafael Nadal in a dramatic clash that went deep into a tiebreak, with Zverev controlling rallies and pushing the clay-court legend. But then disaster struck as he rolled his right ankle, tearing three lateral ligaments and fracturing bones in his foot. He had to retire while trailing 7-6, 6-6, ending a three-hour, 13-minute slugfest where he had saved set points and built a lead in the second set.

That injury was more than just a loss on the scoreboard and a drop in rankings. He went through surgery, missed Wimbledon, and watched as the group known as the Big Three's run in the top two ended without him there. After getting back on tour, Zverev came close but finished as runner-up at 2024 Roland Garros to Carlos Alcaraz and at the 2025 Australian Open to Jannik Sinner.

Still chasing that first Grand Slam, Zverev keeps working. Nadal, his opponent that day and often a mentor, has shown support and belief in the German's future, telling him in Mallorca that “when you're aggressive, it's very hard to outplay you” and that he “truly believes” Zverev will get over the hump and win a major.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Iga Swiatek critics silenced for now","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-features/swiatek-critcism-hits-back","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:01:25 GMT","

True sporting greats often have their motivation fuelled by a belief that the world has an agenda against them, but criticism seems to have an alternative impact on Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek.

Basketball legend Michael Jordan confirmed he was inspired to silence his critics and the same story is true of soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo and Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen.

Novak Djokovic has admitted on numerous occasions that he has been driven to silence doubters in the crowd or the media, but Swiatek has a very different personality and she takes criticism personally.

She was asking for the Polish media to treat her with more respect long before she tested positive in a doping test in August 2024 and that was the moment when an armoury of abuse was fully unleashed in her direction.

When it was revealed that she had tested positive for a banned substance after taking the sleeping drug melatonin, there was a mood of elation among some of her critics and that was especially the case on the often toxic social media platforms.

Bad news seems to sell well when Swiatek is thrust into the spotlight and while she was ultimately proved to have done nothing wrong other than unwittingly taking a contaminated product, that has not stopped sniping suggesting she was lucky to win at Wimbledon at a time when she could have been banned from tennis.

Those making such claims do so without looking into her case, but Swiatek suggests she is used to such snipes as she has opened up on her emotional vulnerabilities in a series of interviews in recent months.

“For sure, the past months, how the media sometimes describe me – and I've got to say, unfortunately, Polish media, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant,” said Swiatek.

“I hope they will just leave me alone and let me do my job because obviously you can see that we know what we are doing, and I have the best people around me.

“I have already proved a lot. I know people want more and more, but it's my own process and my own life and my own career.”

Questions over the relationship with her psychologist Daria Abramowicz have been among the more hurtful and there have also been numerous questions asked over what was perceived to be a failing relationship with coach Wim Fissette, who joined her team for the start of this season.

By her lofty standards, Swiatek's form following her fourth French Open win in June 2024 through to her Wimbledon triumph last month was poor.

She went over a year without winning a title and looked out of sorts on her favoured clay courts, with a defeat against Aryna Sabalenka at the French Open ending her reign as the ‘Queen of Clay' at Roland Garros.

Swiatek was forced to deny rumours she was set to take a break from tennis and skip Wimbledon before she roared back to top form to beat Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in a one-sided women's final at the All England Club.

Now she is closing in on a return to the No 2 ranking and is starting to rebuild the aura that was such a big part of her armoury before her fall from grace.

It is hard to understand why a legend of the game who has now won six Grand Slam titles and needs to win the Australian Open to complete the full set of major titles continues to attract so much negativity.

Yet those critics have been silenced for now by a champion who has emerged from her toughest year to highlight he class all over again.

Coco Gauff was sent crashing out of the National Bank Open in Montreal in straight sets by Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko.

The 18-year-old, ranked 85 in the world, needed just 62 minutes to beat the top seed 6-1 6-4 and book a place in the quarter-finals.

""Your support was incredible,"" Mboko told the crowd in French after a chorus of ""Ole, Ole, Ole!"" chants echoed around the venue. ""I'm really happy to win today... It's incredible. I'm so happy to beat such a great champion.""

Mboko started the year by tearing up the ITF circuit with five titles, including one as a qualifier and two doubles. She won an incredible 27 matches with one loss, made her WTA Tour debut in March and took Gauff to three sets in Rome in just her second event.

""I was actually really thinking about it a lot during the match,"" said Canadian prodigy Mboko. ""I had flashbacks to when I played her in Rome a little bit. I just remember when she came out playing even better and stepped it up a bit better.

""I wanted to step my game up a little bit more and make sure I matched whatever she was producing, and I wanted to stay right there with her.""

She raced through the first set in 25 minutes, breaking the American three times.

The second set was a tighter affair which went on serve for the first 11 games.

Gauff failed to convert three break points throughout the set, Mboko seizing on her sole opportunity to close out the victory.

World No 2 Gauff said: ""She's very athletic. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative.

""I don't know her too well, but l have spoken to her a little bit since Rome.

""I think she has a great support system around her, and I think that's important when you're young and on tour. Hopefully we have many more battles, and I look forward to playing her again in the future.""

Former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard said Mboko's rise ""has been nothing short of incredible"".

""Anyone who knew her in Canadian tennis would not be surprised,"" said the recently-retired tennis star. ""She has so much power to her game. I remember practising with her when she was 14,15 years old and she was smacking forehands and bowling me off the court, so we all knew she would be really good.

""I'm so happy to see it happening at such a big event like this as well. She seems to be handling the moment really well, taking it all in her stride and using it as motivation.""

After her win over Gauff, Bouchard added: ""I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age. You see her on the court and she's handling it like she's done it a hundred times.""

Mboko is only the second wildcard in the Open Era to defeat the top seed at the Canadian Open after Stephanie Dubois in 2006 (versus Kim Clijsters)
She is also the youngest Canadian quarter-finalist at the Canadian Open since Helen Kelesi in 1987
Mboko, who began the season at No 333 in the WTA Rankings, came into the tournament at No 85. The win over Gauff sends her to No 53 in the live rankings. One more would take her to No 24

Mboko, who came through qualifying to reach the third round at the French Open and second round at Wimbledon, will face Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the last eight after the Spaniard beat China's Lin Zhu 7-5 1-6 6-2.

Earlier, 24th-seeded Marta Kostyuk of Ukraine and ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan set up a quarter-final clash.

Kostyuk beat McCartney Kessler 5-7 6-3 6-3, and Rybakina came through against Dayana Yastremska 5-7 6-2 7-5.

On the men's side of the tournament, which is being held in Toronto, defending champion Alexei Popyrin claimed his second consecutive win over a former Top 5 player when he rallied from a set down to defeat fifth seed Holger Rune 4-6 6-2 6-3.

Alex Michelsen reached his first quarter-final of a Masters 1000 event with a 6-3 6-3 win over fellow American Learner Tien.

Michelsen, seeded 26th, will face hard-hitting 11th seed Karen Khachanov, who upset eighth seed Casper Ruud in their fourth round match 6-4 7-5.

Alex de Minaur, who triumphed at last month's Washington Open, advanced to the quarter-finals over fellow Australian Christopher O'Connell via walkover.

Meanwhile, Argentine Francisco Cerundolo was forced to retire early into the second set of his night match with Alexander Zverev due to an abdominal strain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Emma Raducanu starring at a major rankings setback ahead of the US Open","https://www.tennis365.com/tennis-news/raducanu-ranking-target-usopen","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 11:55:45 GMT","

Emma Raducanu is facing an uphill battle to secure a seeded position at the US Open after her comprehensive defeat against Amanda Anisimova at the WTA 1000 tournament in Montreal.

Anisimova hammered Radudanu 6-2, 6-1 in a defeat that will set alarm bells ringing for the Brit, who looked helpless as she was blown away in a match that was all over in a little over one hour.

Raducanu had beaten Anisimova in their previous two clashes in 2025, so she will have been shocked by the scale of the defeat against her friend and rival who reached the Wimbledon final last month.

Now Raducanu needs a strong run at the WTA 1000 event in Cincinnati later this month to have a chance to break into the top 32 of the rankings and secure a seeding for the final Grand Slam of the year at the US Open.

She may need to make it through to the quarter-finals in Cincinnati to get a seeded berth in New York, as that would give her 215 points.

Emma Raducanu's biggest fear came back to haunt her in crushing Amanda Anisimova defeat

What prize money & ranking points did Emma Raducanu earn at Canadian Open?

A last-16 appearance would be worth 120 points and that may also be enough if other players drop down the rankings.

She could also opt to play in the WTA Tour 250 event in Cleveland or the WTA 500 tournament in Monterrey the week before the US Open, if a seeded berth in New York is a driving ambition.

Being seeded would help Raducanu avoid the prospect of taking on players such as world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka, newly crowned Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek or the in-form Anisimova in the opening couple of rounds at the US Open.

Raducanu doesn't have any ranking points to defend over the next few weeks, as she did not play any tournaments ahead of the US Open last year due to some bizarre scheduling decisions.

Her reluctance to play in qualifying for big tournaments she did not qualify for on her ranking meant she headed into the US Open with limited match practice on US hard courts last year.

She predictably lost in the first round against Sofia Kenin, so she has a huge chance to gain plenty of ranking points over the next few weeks.

While she may now come up short of a seeding for the US Open, she could finish that tournament well inside the top 30 of the rankings if she has a good run of results in New York and according to former British No 1 Tim Henman, Raducanu is making progress in her career.

“This is not about the next four weeks for Emma, it's about the next four years and where she can go,” Henman told Tennis365 in an exclusive interview.

“What is success? It is for her to get back into the top 30 or maybe the top 10? It's about being the best version of yourself and maximising your potential.

“Now she has got a good team around her and I hope she sticks with it. Petch has been around the game for a long time and has been good for her.

“She has played lots of tournaments, been on court for a lot of matches and built up that physical resilience over what is a long season.

“I'm sure she will be licking some wounds after that defeat [against Swiatek] and the upside of finishing early at Roland Garros is she can put the clay court shoes away, head home and get ready for grass. I don't have any concerns so long as she keeps on this path.”

Alexander Zverev entered the 2025 Australian Open final with genuine belief that this would be his breakthrough moment. Instead, he walked away from Melbourne questioning everything about his game. The German's candid admission on the Nothing Major Show reveals just how deeply Jannik Sinner's dominant victory shook his confidence and left him searching for answers across an entire season.

John Isner, one of the four hosts of Nothing Major Show, asked Zverev for his opinions on how he would assess his 2025 season so far. Isner acknowledged the German reaching the final in Australia and winning Munich (2025 BMW Open), but wanted to know how Zverev himself felt about his performances so far this year.

Zverev's response was brutally honest: “Terrible year.” He continued, “A lot of times I felt quite lost on the court this year, especially after the Australian Open final where I've had another Grand Slam final. I actually went into the match believing like ‘I'm going to win this. This is my third final. I'm going to win it,' because the other two finals I lost in five sets. I had a lot of chances.”

The weight of his previous near-misses had actually fueled his confidence heading into Melbourne. He then talked about the challenge when playing against Carlos Alcaraz: “I lost to Carlos the year before at the French Open which for me is one of the toughest challenges playing Carlos on play right now.”



However, reality hit hard once the match began. Zverev shifted back to the Australian Open final and said: “So I was going into the match, like I was feeling so confident, and then in that match I got ‘smoked.' Like, he was doing everything better than me at that moment. Like I was serving better than him, but apart from the serve, he was doing everything better than me.”

The numbers from Melbourne tell the story of complete dominance by Sinner. The Italian defeated Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, never allowing a break point while facing ten against him and saving eight of those chances. Zverev managed 12 aces but also committed 45 unforced errors, particularly from the forehand side. His forehand, which had troubled him late in his semi-final win over Novak Djokovic, broke down early again under Sinner's relentless targeting.

The aftermath proved even more challenging than the defeat itself. While Zverev performed well on clay courts, winning the 2025 BMW Open and reaching the quarter-finals of Roland Garros, where he lost to Djokovic, his struggles became evident on other surfaces. The most shocking moment came at Wimbledon, where he was knocked out in the first round despite being the third seed.

Zverev lost against Arthur Rinderknech in an intense five-set match and admitted to feeling “very alone out there at times. ” He acknowledged that he had been struggling mentally since his Australian Open final loss to Sinner and that Melbourne defeat's mental toll had extended far beyond a single match.



Seeking to rebuild his confidence, Zverev recently spent ten days at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca. Under Toni Nadal's guidance, he participated in intense training blocks designed to sharpen his aggression and mental resilience. Zverev described dinners with Rafael Nadal, during which the 22-time Grand Slam champion urged him to maintain an aggressive mindset and reminded him of his Grand Slam potential.

While Toni Nadal is “a very busy man,” Zverev remains hopeful this collaboration will deepen. He believes the lessons learned in Mallorca could be the key to finally breaking his Grand Slam drought and recovering from the psychological damage inflicted by that devastating loss to Sinner.

P10 Antonelli happy to score 'first point from the European season'

'Glad it's over' - few words from despondent Hamilton 

Lewis Hamilton was almost lost for words following Saturday's Qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton cut a dejected figure at the end of Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the seven-time World Champion dropping out in Q2 before Ferrari team mate Charles Leclerc took pole position.

Hamilton described a “big struggle” after Friday's practice sessions at the Hungaroring, admitting he was “quite far off” the pace, but there were signs of encouragement in FP3 when he shadowed Leclerc in fourth position.

However, when it came to the all-important Qualifying hour, Hamilton could go no further than the second phase, winding up in 12th position and referencing previous struggles when he sighed “every time, every time” over the radio.

Asked by Sky Sports F1 to reflect on his session, a visibly upset Hamilton simply stated: “I'm useless, absolutely useless.”

Pushed on whether he has any answers, with Ferrari working hard to improve the SF-25 via recent updates, Hamilton added: “The team, they have no problem – you've seen the car is on pole. So, they probably need to change driver.”

In a separate interview for F1 TV, it was put to Hamilton that his “useless” self-assessment cannot be the case, given his incredible F1 record, but the Briton replied: “It clearly is. I drove terribly. It is what it is.”

Hamilton's Q2 exit in Hungary follows on from a Q1 elimination last time out at the Belgian Grand Prix, though he managed to recover from a subsequent pit lane start to finish seventh in the race and win Driver of the Day.

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

Max Verstappen gave his thoughts after his worst Qualifying performance of the season for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen claims that Red Bull's lack of pace ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix is ""a bit of a mystery at the moment"" having registered his worst Qualifying performance of the season.

The four-time and reigning World Champion will start eighth for Sunday's 70-lap race having struggled for grip all weekend at the Hungaroring with Red Bull's RB21.

Verstappen claimed that although Red Bull usually struggles on Friday before turning it around for Saturday running, that was not the case in Budapest despite only finishing 0.356s behind shock polesitter Charles Leclerc.

""We didn't seem to find it. We tried a lot as a team and unfortunately nothing really helped our balance,"" said Verstappen when asked if there had been a performance increase overnight.

""It's really difficult to explain how we suddenly just this weekend have a lot of difficulties with the car. Just no grip on the front, in the rear, difficult to balance it out.

""It's a bit of a mystery at the moment. Just the whole weekend off the pace.""

Team mate Yuki Tsunoda also struggled, failing to move beyond Q1 despite only being just over one-tenth slower than Verstappen at the same stage in Qualifying.

The Japanese driver, who will start P16 for the race, also believed that not optimising his running during FP3 played a role in advancing further up the grid when the margins remain so small in 2025.

""I think overall this weekend we've struggled as a team,"" he said. ""In that situation, I wanted to maximise performance but we're just slow and also FP3 preparation wasn't good at all which was in our control completely.

""We completely missed that, especially fighting in a tight session like this, all these things count. It can happen like that.

""[The car] is just sliding around. I think pretty much that's it. The grip we should normally get is not there and probably something we are missing completely.""

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Oscar Piastri got the better of his McLaren team mate Lando Norris in the final practice hour in Hungary.

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri set the pace in the final practice hour for the Hungarian Grand Prix, narrowly heading his team mate Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.

As teams shifted their focus to honing set-ups ahead of Qualifying this afternoon, the McLaren duo were two of the first to head out onto the track, hoping to reinforce their hold on P1 and P2 established in the earlier practice sessions.

They quickly returned to the pits without completing a full timed lap, paving the way for a somewhat slow start to the hour – it wasn't until the 45-minute mark that the Qualifying preparations properly kicked off.

Yuki Tsunoda, whose Red Bull had flow-viz paint around the diffuser, initially went fastest on a set of medium tyres before he was heard complaining over the radio about oversteer. His team mate Max Verstappen, who struggled in Friday's running, then set a benchmark of 1m 16.547s on softs but this was rapidly displaced by George Russell and Charles Leclerc.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 LENOVO HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

As expected, the top three was shaken up once the McLarens returned to set their own competitive times with Piastri snatching the top spot, albeit around six-tenths slower than Norris' effort in yesterday's FP2 session. The Briton, meanwhile, could only manage P5 on his first attempt.

Soon after, Ferrari's Leclerc was on a flying lap and was purple in sectors one and two, but an error at Turn 12 saw him dip his left rear wheel in the gravel trap and lose a small amount of time – it was nevertheless still quick enough for P1, before Piastri went clear by 0.266s.

Further down the order, Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto continued his superb recent form over one lap as he settled into sixth position, just under four-tenths adrift of the Australian's fastest time in the McLaren.

It was a different story for fellow midfield driver Alex Albon who, at the halfway point of the hour, found himself at the bottom of the timesheets and advised his team to check the floor after he rattled over the kerbs.

As the clock ticked down, some teams elected to carry out long runs on the medium tyres rather than continuing their Qualifying simulations, causing some traffic issues for those still on fast single laps – Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar directly picked out Norris and claimed that “he doesn't know how to let by someone”.

The track cleared as many drivers reset ahead of their final laps, allowing Piastri to make the most of the clear air and break into the 1m 14s. His team mate then found a remarkable amount of time in the last sector and ended just 0.032s slower than Piastri's lap.

Others' push laps didn't quite go to plan – Hadjar spun into a run-off area and momentarily brought out the yellow flags, and Verstappen reported: “You try to fix the rear and it ploughs into understeer”, echoing a struggle shared by many of the drivers.

A much-improved Lewis Hamilton finished the session in fourth, with Kimi Antonelli and Fernando Alonso, who bounced back from a back injury earlier in the weekend, claiming the rest of the top-six positions.

Lance Stroll was seventh, ending an encouraging hour for Aston Martin, followed by Russell and the Sauber pair of Bortoleto and Nico Hulkenberg. In another tricky practice hour, Verstappen took P12 just behind Haas' Ollie Bearman, leading Franco Colapinto, Liam Lawson and Carlos Sainz.

Albon, Esteban Ocon, Pierre Gasly, a frustrated Tsunoda, and Hadjar brought up the rear and will be seeking improvements ahead of the crucial Qualifying hour at the Hungaroring, set to get underway at 1600 local time.

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Charles Leclerc came out on top in a thrilling, ultra-close finish to Qualifying at the Hungaroring.

Charles Leclerc grabbed pole position in dramatic circumstances at the end of Saturday's Qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix, pulling a lap out of the bag to beat McLaren pair Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris.

After drops of rain in Q2, and with track conditions appearing to fall away, Leclerc produced a stunning time of 1m 15.372s on his final Q3 lap to overhaul previous session leaders Piastri and Norris by a matter of thousandths.

George Russell was another driver to impress amid dropping temperatures and rising wind levels, putting his Mercedes fourth, while Aston Martin built on their strong practice pace to take P5 and P6 with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll respectively.

Kick Sauber also had more reasons to celebrate with Gabriel Bortoleto's run to seventh – the Brazilian's final lap enough to beat reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, who faced a tricky session aboard his Red Bull.

Qualifying results

FORMULA 1 LENOVO HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Following his points finish in Belgium last time out, Liam Lawson's upward trajectory continued with a fine drive to ninth, just ahead of rookie team mate Isack Hadjar in what represented a double top-10 result for the Racing Bulls squad.

Lewis Hamilton was the biggest name to drop out in Q2 after another tough Qualifying run – the seven-time World Champion sighing “every time” on the radio as he ended up 12th, between Haas' Ollie Bearman and Williams' Carlos Sainz.

Kimi Antonelli experienced troubles of his own, having narrowly missed the Q3 cut in 11th and then lost a handful of places due to a deleted lap time for exceeding track limits. It leaves him 15th on the grid, just behind Alpine's Franco Colapinto.

After a stronger weekend at Spa-Francorchamps, where he reached Q3, Yuki Tsunoda returned to dropping out in Q1 – the Japanese racer taking 16th position over the other Alpine and Haas machines of Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon respectively.

Nico Hulkenberg and Alex Albon sat above the Q1 drop zone following their initial Qualifying runs, but could not replicate the late-session gains of their Sauber and Williams team mates en route to the back row for Sunday's Grand Prix.

Following Norris' clean sweep on Friday and Piastri's strong start on Saturday, attention soon turned to Qualifying, which began under overcast skies but with air and track temperatures remaining high – and rain crucially staying away for the time being.

The entire field unsurprisingly bolted on the soft tyres for the opening Q1 runs, which brought the first moment of drama when Sainz locked up heavily under braking for Turn 1 and had to navigate the rest of his lap with flat-spotted tyres.

Once every driver had put a banker on the board, Piastri sat at the top of the timesheets with a 1m 15.554s, despite running over the gravel at the exit of Turn 12, with Russell and Antonelli following in their Mercedes cars from Norris, Hamilton and Alonso.

At the other end of the order, Sainz was in the drop zone after that compromised opener, along with Tsunoda, Gasly and Haas duo Bearman and Ocon – while Verstappen was only just above the cut mark in 13th amid ongoing struggles for Red Bull.

Aston Martin were first to make a move in the closing minutes, leading to a new P1 time from Alonso on a 1m 15.281s and a rise to P4 for Stroll, before their rivals returned to the track and set about finding gains – Ocon reporting that a screw was stuck on his tyre.

A flurry of green and purple sector times ended with Piastri reclaiming the top spot via a 1m 15.211s, from Alonso, a similarly high-flying Hadjar and Norris, with Leclerc keeping his cool amid some late pressure to rise from the drop zone all the way up to fifth place.

While Sainz and Bearman got themselves out of danger with their final laps to the chequered flag, the same could not be said for Tsunoda, Gasly and Ocon, who all fell at the first Qualifying hurdle alongside Hulkenberg and Albon.

After the segment, which also saw Bortoleto catch the eye in sixth, and Verstappen make it through in a low-key 11th, Antonelli and Russell were both noted for potentially failing to follow the Race Director's instructions regarding maximum delta time.

Knocked out: Tsunoda, Gasly, Ocon, Hulkenberg, Albon

In the break between Q1 and Q2, which featured an extra couple of minutes to allow marshals to clear loose gravel at Turn 12, the clouds appeared to grow darker and, by the time the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, spots of rain had arrived.

“Expect the best conditions at the end of session,” Verstappen was told by his engineer as the remaining 15 drivers pushed to get some initial Q2 times on the board with soft tyres – Norris going quickest on a 1m 14.890s from Piastri, Alonso, Stroll, Hadjar and Bearman.

Russell, the aforementioned Verstappen, Lawson and Leclerc held the final top-10 spots after those runs, leaving Hamilton, Sainz, Bortoleto, Antonelli and Colapinto – who had a lap time deleted for exceeding track limits at Turn 9 – with work to do.

Across those second runs, which again saw Alonso and Stroll go early and involved a massive queue between their rivals to get out of the pits, there were some big disappointments on the cards as both Hamilton and Antonelli missed the Q3 cut.

“Every time, every time,” lamented 12th-placed Hamilton over the radio, with Antonelli similarly dejected after winding up 11th but then falling to 15th due to a track limits violation. Bearman, Sainz and Colapinto were the other three drivers to drop out.

Norris remained fastest from Piastri despite neither of the McLaren drivers improving, from Stroll, Russell, Alonso and Leclerc, while Verstappen squeezed through to Q3 in eighth around the Racing Bulls of Hadjar and Lawson and Bortoleto.

Knocked out: Bearman, Sainz, Hamilton, Colapinto, Antonelli

With further rain continuing to hold off, but temperatures dropping slightly and wind levels rising, Piastri landed the first blow of the pole position shootout by clocking a 1m 15.398s – putting him just under a tenth clear of team mate Norris.

Russell and Mercedes also appeared more competitive in the cooler conditions, going third over Alonso, Verstappen, Leclerc, Lawson and Bortoleto, while Stroll lost a time for exceeding track limits and Hadjar bided his time in the garage.

Aston Martin once again left the pit lane early for their final runs, with Alonso shooting to P2 (just 0.083s behind provisional polesitter Piastri) and Stroll moving up to fourth – but what could everyone else do with their final efforts of the afternoon?

Leclerc answered that spectacularly by brilliantly stringing his three sectors together to clock a 1m 15.372s – denying both Piastri and Norris and leaving him speechless over the radio as he returned to the pit lane to celebrate Ferrari's first pole of 2025.

Russell booked a spot on the second row in fourth (both the Briton and team mate Antonelli being cleared over their delta time investigation), followed by the rapid Aston Martins of Alonso and Stroll, Bortoleto's Sauber, Verstappen's Red Bull and the two Racing Bulls of Lawson and Hadjar.

“Today I don't understand anything at Formula 1!” Leclerc said afterwards. “Honestly, the whole Qualifying has been extremely difficult – when I say extremely difficult, it's not exaggerating. It was super, super difficult. It was difficult for us to get to Q2, it was difficult for us to get to Q3. In Q3 the conditions changed a little bit, everything became a lot trickier and I knew I just had to do a clean lap to target third. At the end, it's pole position. I definitely did not expect that.”

The 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix is set to begin at 1500 local time on Sunday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action from the Hungaroring.

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

There was a surprise ending to Qualifying ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with Charles Leclerc beating both McLarens to take what he admitted was an ""unexpected"" pole position.

Charles Leclerc admitted that he “did not expect” to claim pole position during Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Ferrari driver revealing that trying to manage the changing conditions made it an “extremely difficult” session.

While the McLaren pair of Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris looked to have a clear edge during the earlier stages, the wind and drops of rain in Q2 contributed to a change in track conditions, making Q3 a tougher segment for the papaya cars.

It was also tricky for Leclerc – but the Monegasque unexpectedly got the better of the field by pumping in a 1m 15.372s, beating Piastri by less than three-hundredths of a second to clinch his and the Scuderia's first pole position of the season.

“Today I don't understand anything at Formula 1!” a stunned Leclerc reflected after jumping out of the car. “Honestly the whole Qualifying has been extremely difficult – when I say extremely difficult it's not exaggerating. It was super, super difficult.

“It was difficult for us to get to Q2, it was difficult for us to get to Q3. Q3 the conditions changed a little bit, everything became a lot trickier and I knew I just had to do a clean lap to target third. At the end, it's pole position. I definitely did not expect that.”

Pushed on whether he could feel the change in grip as the conditions evolved, the 27-year-old explained: “Yeah, I could definitely feel it a lot and I was also on the lower side of the downforce, so when the rain started in Q2 I was just hoping that it wouldn't stay there.

“It didn't, the conditions changed which made everything very tricky, and at the end we are on pole position. Honestly I have no words. It's probably one of the best pole positions I've ever had because it's the most unexpected for sure.”

Now Leclerc faces the challenge of trying to convert that pole into a first victory of the campaign, with his best result so far this season being a P2 at his home event in Monaco.

In terms of how confident he is of holding the lead into Turn 1 and going on to win Sunday's race, the Ferrari driver conceded: “The start and Turn 1 will be key.

“I have no idea how it will go, but one thing for sure is that I will do absolutely everything in order to keep that first place – if we manage to do that then that should make our life easier for the rest of the race.”

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Hungarian Grand Prix in Budapest.

For the first time in 2025 we have a Ferrari starting a Grand Prix from pole position. The question now is can Charles Leclerc stay ahead of the all-conquering McLarens when the lights go out at the Hungaroring.

Leclerc will have championship leader Oscar Piastri and team mate Lando Norris breathing down his neck in the run to Turn 1, and don't discount P4 qualifier George Russell getting in on the action for Mercedes on the opening lap.

Come to that, probably best to keep an eye on the Aston Martins too. The team in green have been the biggest shock of the Budapest weekend so far, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll a superb fifth and sixth respectively on the grid.

There was another superlative qualifying performance from rookie Gabriel Bortoleto, who put his Kick Sauber a stunning seventh, immediately ahead of the Red Bull of reigning World Champion Max Verstappen. Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar complete the top 10 starters.

Starting from the pit lane will be Yuki Tsunoda. The Japanese driver had qualified 16th, but Red Bull have since opted to change the power unit and set-up on his car.

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

David Tremayne shares the incredible story of Hungary's history-making Grand Prix racer ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix in the country.

The first race to carry the official moniker of ‘Grand Prix' was the 1906 Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, held at a circuit near Le Mans. It was, appropriately enough, won by a 90CV Renault, but the man driving it was not one of several French star drivers but a Hungarian mechanic-turned racer. His name was Ferenc Szisz.

Szisz was a genial fellow by all accounts, most notably his own description of how he won the race, which appeared in the German newspaper Algemeine Automobil-Zeitung later that year. He had been born September 20th, 1873 in Szeged, in Hungary's Theiss lowlands between Subotica and Timisoara. Having trained as a locksmith his career as a mechanic was interrupted by his military service with the cavalry regiment stationed on the Russian-Galizian border.

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

The McLaren pair nearly came together in the Hungarian Grand Prix, but Oscar Piastri eventually had to settle for second.

Oscar Piastri admits that overtaking Lando Norris was always going to be ""much easier said than done"" as he had to settle for second in the Hungarian Grand Prix, with his Drivers' Championship lead trimmed to just nine points.

The Australian came just fractions away from adding another victory to his tally for the 2025 campaign ahead of the summer break, having closed a 12s gap to leader Norris in the closing stages.

With fresher hard tyres courtesy of a two-stop strategy as opposed to Norris' one-stop, Piastri directly challenged his team mate in the final three laps but had to settle for second.

""I pushed as hard as I could. I think after I saw Lando going for a one [stop], I knew I was going to have overtake on track, which is much easier said than done around here,"" said Piastri.

""I tried a few things, it was a gamble either way, and today unfortunately we were just on the wrong side of it. The team did a great job, the car really came alive in the second half of the race, and the car's been great all weekend – thank you to the team. I'm looking forward to a couple of weeks off.""

Piastri looked to move into the lead over the final laps primarily at Turn 1 and came just inches away from hitting his team mate having locked-up on the penultimate lap.

But the Australian admitted that he was never realistically close enough to pass around a circuit where overtaking proved difficult all day.

""I think I needed to be at least a couple of tenths closer, which was going to take a mistake from Lando to achieve that,"" said Piastri.

""I felt like that was going to be my best chance. You never want to try and save it for the next lap and then it never comes, so I thought I would at least try. Not quite.""

Piastri found himself behind Norris having made an early first stop after being stuck behind polesitter Charles Leclerc in the opening phase.

Having been unable to undercut the Ferrari driver, Piastri eventually moved ahead after both had made a second pit stop but fell short of repassing Norris on the alternative strategy.

""Yes and no,"" said Piastri when asked if he was surprised Norris had opted for a one-stop strategy.

""At that point he didn't really have much to lose. It wasn't a huge surprise. I don't know if trying to undercut Leclerc was the right call in the end, but we can go through it after.""

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Lando Norris got the better of Oscar Piastri in the latest scrap between the McLaren drivers at the Hungaroring.

Lando Norris was all smiles following the Hungarian Grand Prix, having resisted a blistering charge from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri to take the chequered flag first.

Norris endured a difficult start to Sunday's race in Budapest when he dropped from third to fifth, behind Aston Martin rival Fernando Alonso and the Mercedes of George Russell.

After making his way past Alonso's car, Norris decided to stretch out his first stint and opt for a one-stop strategy, while Russell, Piastri and pole-sitting Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc went down the two-stop route.

Norris assumed the lead of the race once the final pit stops had been completed and, despite Piastri closing a gap of more than 10 seconds to pile the pressure on in the closing laps, the Briton ultimately had enough in hand to secure the win.

“I'm dead, I'm dead,” Norris smiled when giving his initial reaction to the fight and race as a whole before the podium ceremony.

“We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning, but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough.

“The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat-out. My voice has gone a little bit! But good, rewarding even more because of that – the perfect result today.”

Asked to expand on why he went for one stop rather than two, Norris continued: “I didn't think it would probably get us the win; I thought maybe it would get us at least into second.

“I knew our pace was good. Even in the first stint behind George, I couldn't get past but the pace was strong, so I knew if I just had some clean air and I could push, I could maybe make things work. That's what we did.

“It's always a bit of a gamble, these kind of things, but it also requires no mistakes, good laps, good strategy, all these things. That's what we had today, so I'm very happy.”

Norris' ninth career win means he cuts Piastri's championship lead from 16 points to nine as teams head into the summer break – setting up a thrilling second half of 2025.

As for whether he feels momentum is on his side in the intra-team battle, Norris said: “I think we're so tightly fought it's hard to say if momentum is on anyone's side.

“We're fighting hard, I think both of us… It's tough, but fun racing against Oscar.

“It's great for us as a team, another 1-2, our 200th win actually in F1. Credit to Oscar, he put up a good charge and I just about held on. I look forward to plenty more of these.”

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

Alex Albon found himself at the bottom of the pack in Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Alex Albon believes Williams were “way too slow” in Qualifying at the Hungaroring, leaving him with an uphill battle after he bagged his worst starting position since 2022.

The 29-year-old was eliminated in Q1 and will start the Grand Prix from P20 just behind Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, whose effort was 0.142s clear of Albon as the latter suffered from uncharacteristically poor one-lap pace.

After a remarkably strong weekend last time out in Belgium that saw him claim P5 in Qualifying, the Williams driver has struggled to match the performance of other midfield teams in Hungary, failing to break into the top-10 throughout practice.

But after their first flying laps, Albon and his team mate Carlos Sainz were up in P15 and P16 before they both bolted on a fresh set of soft tyres. While the Spaniard improved to P8, Albon could only manage 17th before he was bumped down to last place by Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon and Hulkenberg.

Reflecting on what went wrong after the session, he said: “I think mainly we just didn't account for the cooler track temperatures. We got a little bit slow on the out lap – way too slow, really.

“I went into Turn 1 and the tyres were too cold and then it just spiralled. Not ideal but it can happen, and let's see. Hopefully tomorrow we can do something.

“It is tricky to drive, but it's not P20 tricky. It's been one of those weekends so far where we've just been throwing stuff at it and nothing's really been working.

“We went back to the FP1 car for Qualifying just to try to get back somewhere where I was happiest, which was in FP1. I don't know, maybe the track's moved on since then.”

Sainz similarly confirmed that they took a step back in terms of the set-up on his car, but he was ultimately able to progress to Q2 and secure P13 on the grid, which nevertheless marked his third consecutive Q2 elimination.

“I think we ended up reverting back on a lot of the set-up items we tried during the week,” he said. “We went back to a car I know and I more or less did the maximum that was available to us today with P13.

“It's been a very difficult track for the Williams so far, but we knew that coming into here and we just need to maximise whatever we have.

“I think we're going to try our best to get a point or two but realistically speaking, we don't have the pace to do so.”

P5 Alonso delighted with 'best result of the year' in Hungary

Hulkenberg knew 'it was always going to be difficult from the back' of the grid

Lando Norris emerged triumphant in the Hungarian Grand Prix, the McLaren man beating team mate Oscar Piastri to take the victory.

Lando Norris has won the Hungarian Grand Prix after holding off a thrilling late-race challenge for the lead from McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri, the Briton having made an alternative strategy work in his favour to take victory.

Polesitter Charles Leclerc had made a strong start to hold P1 when the race got underway, allowing the Ferrari driver to build up a steady lead over Piastri in P2 during the opening stages of the race – a position he maintained amid the first round of pit stops, despite Piastri's attempt to undercut his rival.

However, the picture started to evolve as different strategies played out amongst the frontrunners, with Leclerc and Piastri – both on two-stop plans – finding themselves behind the one-stopping Norris in the final phase of the race.

While Leclerc's pace fell away in the latter stages, a fast Piastri set about chasing down Norris for the lead – leading to a gripping conclusion as the Australian was hot on the tail of his team mate in the final laps.

Race results

FORMULA 1 LENOVO HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Despite a couple of attempts, Piastri could not find a way past the other McLaren, with Norris crossing the line just 0.698s ahead to seal his fifth win of the season. This has cut Piastri's lead in the Drivers' Championship down to nine points entering into the summer break.

George Russell took third for Mercedes, having overtaken a struggling Leclerc to claim the final spot on the podium. Leclerc had to settle for fourth on a disappointing day for the Monegasque, who also received a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during his battle with Russell.

Fernando Alonso put in a solid drive to claim fifth for Aston Martin, marking a valuable double points finish for the squad with Lance Stroll not far behind in seventh. Between them was Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, marking another eye-catching performance from the rookie.

Liam Lawson was eighth for Racing Bulls, followed by the Red Bull of Max Verstappen who had a tricky day in ninth. The Dutchman faced an investigation after the race for an incident with Lewis Hamilton that saw the Ferrari man go wide, but no further action was taken and he kept his P9 finish.

Kimi Antonelli took the final point on offer in P10 for Mercedes, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar just missed out in P11. Also outside of the top 10 was Hamilton, who had to settle for P12 on a tough weekend for the seven-time World Champion.

Nico Hulkenberg placed in 13th for Kick Sauber, followed by the Williams pair of Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon in 14th and 15th respectively. Esteban Ocon was the sole Haas to finish the race in 16th, with Yuki Tsunoda behind in 17th for Red Bull.

It was a difficult day for Alpine, as Franco Colapinto and Pierre Gasly completed the order down in P18 and P19, the latter having received a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Sainz.

Ollie Bearman, meanwhile, failed to make the chequered flag, with damage to his Haas forcing him to retire from the running.

After the dust had settled amid a surprise ending to Saturday's Qualifying at the Hungaroring – with Leclerc outpacing the McLaren duo to grab an unexpected pole position – attentions shifted to Sunday's 70-lap Hungarian Grand Prix, the final race before F1's traditional summer break.

In the wake of that eventful grid-deciding session, one change had been made to the starting order during the build-up to race day. It was confirmed that Tsunoda would be required to start from the pit lane, due to Red Bull having replaced power unit elements in his car – as well as changing the brake cooling configuration – under parc ferme conditions.

While rain had fallen in Budapest earlier on Sunday, the drivers were greeted by dry, gusty and slightly cooler conditions as the start time neared, with a 20 per cent chance of rainfall predicted during the race.

When the tyre blankets were removed once the cars had assembled on the grid for the anticipated two-stop event, it was revealed that the majority of the field would start on the medium compound, the exceptions being Sainz, Hulkenberg and Albon on the softs, and Hamilton and Gasly running the hards.

Once the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out, Leclerc made a good launch off the line to hold the lead into Turn 1, while Norris attempted to move down the inside of Piastri but, after braking early, allowed Russell to slip through into third.

There was further trouble for Norris as Alonso soon snatched P4, pushing the Briton down to fifth. Elsewhere, Verstappen had lost a place to former team mate Lawson – only to retake it later in the lap – while Stroll had dropped backwards to seventh.

As Lap 3 ticked down, Norris swept past Alonso on the main straight to get himself back up to fourth. Verstappen, meanwhile, was also on the move, the Dutchman having overtaken Stroll for P7 before starting to chase down Bortoleto up ahead for sixth – a driver noted by Race Control for a potential false start.

Hulkenberg was the first to pit on Lap 6, the Kick Sauber driver swapping his soft tyres for a set of mediums. Like his team mate, the German driver had also been noted for a possible false start. Elsewhere, up at the front, Leclerc had built a lead of nearly three seconds from Piastri, with Norris trying to catch Russell for fourth while Alonso was heading a DRS train in fifth.

Hadjar – who had lost a place earlier on to Bearman – seemed to be in some discomfort, the Frenchman reporting that his hand had been hit by gravel flicked up from the car ahead during the opening lap.

There was bad news for Hulkenberg, the German having received a five-second penalty for that false start, while no further action was taken in regards to Bortoleto. Up ahead, questions were started to emerge over strategy as the race headed towards Lap 10, with Piastri asked about the possibility of a one-stop race.

""Difficult to know with so many laps to go,” the Australian responded. Team mate Norris, meanwhile, was told that he needed to get past Russell, the McLaren having found himself stuck behind the Mercedes. Others struggling to overtake included Hamilton, the Ferrari man running close to Antonelli in a battle for 13th.

As Lap 15 arrived, Leclerc was now ahead of Piastri by just over three seconds, while others further back were starting to make pit stops, including Colapinto, Albon and Ocon. Sainz was the next to swap his soft tyres for the hards, but the frontrunning cars showed no signs of pitting yet.

Piastri, meanwhile, was encourage to push – and subsequently started to eat into Leclerc's advantage, the gap down to 2.3s by Lap 18. On the same tour, Verstappen was the first in the top 10 to pit, the Red Bull man emerging with hard tyres on in an attempt to undercut Alonso and Bortoleto.

Another driver trying an undercut was Piastri, having been told “box to overtake Leclerc”. The McLaren emerged back on track between Alonso and Bortoleto – while Leclerc made his own pit stop for the hard compound shortly afterwards.

Leclerc returned to the track still ahead of Piastri, with that lap having seemingly not been enough for the Australian to warm up his tyres. However, the McLaren team radioed in to warn that Leclerc may struggle with the same issue on his own out-lap.

Norris, meanwhile, had inherited the lead after remaining out on track, while Piastri had overtaken Alonso – yet to pit – for P3. The situation for Norris posed some interesting strategy questions, with the Briton asked about the possibility of Plan A and Plan B. Would the squad attempt a one-stop?

McLaren were not the only ones keeping a driver out on track. Alonso – still running his medium starting tyre – lost P4 to Russell on Lap 26, while Verstappen – one of the early stoppers – reported that his own strategy had been a “really terrible idea”, having spent much of the race since in traffic as he tried to make gains from P12.

As the Dutchman set about chasing down former title rival Hamilton for 11th place, Piastri was questioning whether a one-stop strategy could work, leading to the response that it could prove difficult. On the other side of the garage, Norris was asked for his thoughts on doing a one-stop himself, to which he responded: “Yeah, why not!”

“I can feel what we discussed before the race,” Leclerc cryptically reported, before going on to state that the issue would cause the Scuderia to “lose this race”. The Monegasque was running some 1.6s ahead of Piastri with 40 laps remaining.

Further back, Verstappen boldly moved down the inside of Hamilton into Turn 4 to take P11, with the Ferrari subsequently going wide – an incident that was noted by Race Control. Elsewhere, Norris pitted on Lap 32 for the hard tyres on a rapid 1.9s stop, bringing him back out on track in P4 ahead of Alonso.

As the race reached its halfway point, Leclerc was leading Piastri by just under two seconds, with Russell running in third some eight seconds ahead of Norris. Alonso, Bortoleto, Stroll and Lawson were all still to pit in fifth to eighth respectively, while Verstappen and Hamilton rounded out the top 10.

Stroll was the first Aston Martin to pit on Lap 37, returning to the track with the hard tyres bolted on. Elsewhere, Norris was looking fast as he tried to chase down Russell, the Briton dipping a wheel as he pushed hard. This charge had brought his distance to the leaders down to just 13.9s by Lap 40.

Shortly afterwards, Leclerc made another pit stop for a second set of the hard rubber, bringing him back out in fourth around seven seconds behind Norris. Piastri – now in the lead – was subsequently told to push, the Australian now leading by 9.2s from Russell.

While the stewards confirmed that the earlier incident between Verstappen and Hamilton would be investigated after the race, the former – running in P5 – was informed that Red Bull were considering keeping him on a one-stop strategy. “It's not going to be easy,” the Dutchman reported.

With Russell pitting for the hard compound – and returning to the track in fourth – Norris had been promoted to second and was now 8.7s away from his team mate. As Lap 46 ticked down, Piastri dived into the pits and rejoined in third, five seconds back from Leclerc in P2 and a further 12s adrift of new leader Norris. Could Piastri or Leclerc catch the Briton before the chequered flag?

As the race moved towards the final 20 laps, Verstappen could not hold out any longer on his medium tyres and pitted for a set of hards, bringing him back out into P9 just ahead of Antonelli. Piastri, meanwhile, had caught Leclerc and made a move into Turn 1 to snatch P2 from the Ferrari.

Elsewhere, Bearman became the first retiree from the race, the Haas driver having reported that his car was “broken” after struggling for grip.  It also seemed to be turning into a tough day for Leclerc, who voiced his frustration about his SF-25 being “undriveable” before suggesting that a podium finish would be a “miracle”.

The Monegasque's position did indeed look to be at risk, with Russell closing the gap down to 3.1s with 15 laps to go. Up ahead, Piastri was now 5.6s away from Norris and lapping quickly – setting up a thrilling conclusion to the race.

By Lap 60 of 70, that gap had come down to 3.3s – while Russell was mere tenths away from a struggling Leclerc in the scrap for third. The Silver Arrows driver looked at making a lunge into Turn 1, only for Leclerc to cover him off.

“That was moving under braking!” an irritated Russell complained. The Briton was warned to keep cool – and seemed to do so when he repeated the move at the same place one lap later. This time he made it stick, though was still left unhappy with Leclerc's defensive moves on track in an incident that was set to be investigated by the stewards.

As the stewards also put Gasly and Sainz under investigation for a collision at Turn 2 – leading to a 10-second penalty for Gasly – all eyes were on the battle at the front. With six laps to go, Piastri was only 1.2s behind Norris – just as the leader was approaching traffic to lap in the form of Hamilton, Hadjar and Antonelli.

After clearing those cars, the gap had dropped to just 0.6s as the final two laps approached. A late lunge on Lap 69 failed to pay off for Piastri, who locked up and just missed his team mate. “Remember how we go racing,” the 24-year-old was warned.

With one more attempt remaining, Piastri ultimately was too far back to make a move on the final tour – meaning that Norris crossed the line to take victory by 0.698s from his team mate and in the process cutting Piastri's lead in the World Championship down to just nine points.

Russell completed the podium in third place, while Leclerc held onto fourth despite being handed a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during his scrap with Russell. Alonso took a season-best fifth, while Bortoleto – a driver managed by the Spaniard – followed in sixth.

Stroll completed a good day for Aston Martin in P7, while Lawson, Verstappen and Antonelli completed the top 10. Verstappen, however, will still need to visit the stewards post-race for that earlier incident with Hamilton.

Hadjar claimed 11th place ahead of Hamilton in 12th, followed by Hulkenberg in 13th and the Williams duo of Sainz and Albon in 14th and 15th respectively.

Ocon placed in P16, with Tsunoda facing another tough outing behind in P17, while Alpine ended a difficult day with Colapinto in P18 from Gasly in the last classified position.

Bearman proved to be the only retiree of the race in F1's final outing before the sport embarks on a summer break.

""I'm dead, I'm dead,"" joked Norris as he reflected on his race. ""It was tough, it was tough. We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning, but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough. The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat-out. My voice has gone a little bit. But good, rewarding even more because of that – the perfect result today.""

F1 will now embark on its traditional summer break before returning for the Dutch Grand Prix on the weekend of August 29-31. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

After ‘Freakier Friday,' the actress is next set to star in the upcoming Hulu drama ‘Count My Lies.'


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Lindsay Lohan is opening up about her feelings of being pigeonholed by roles she's played in the past as a longstanding actress in the entertainment industry. 


	After starring in 1998's The Parent Trap when she was 12, Lohan's career skyrocketed. She went on to appear in many more beloved projects, including Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, and she is next up set to reprise her role in the former film with the 2025 followup Freakier Friday. 




	In a Saturday profile with The Times U.K., Lohan admitted that she “wanted to take a minute” to herself, which saw her shy away from leading roles from 2013 until 2022.

	“I was losing that feeling of excitement about doing a film, and I wanted to live my own life for a bit, figure out how to have a more private life, a real life,” she explained. “I wanted to wait to get that itch again.” 


	A new project Lohan is admittedly excited about is her upcoming Hulu Drama Count My Lies, where she will star and produce. Still, when reflecting on her career thus far and asked if she felt “pigeonholed,” she replied, “Yeah, I do.” 


	“I was so thrilled to work on A Prairie Home Companion, and yet even today I have to fight for stuff that is like that, which is frustrating. Because, well, you know me as this — but you also know I can do that. So let me! Give me the chance,” Lohan said. “I have to break that cycle and open doors to something else, leaving people no choice. And in due time, if Martin Scorsese reaches out, I'm not going to say no.”


	At the Los Angeles premiere of Freakier Friday, Lohan told The Hollywood Reporter that moving forward in her career, she would “​​like to take on some more serious, dramatic roles,” further noting that she felt a bit of pressure to stick to the rom-com genre. 

	











	“I love doing romantic comedy because that's where my home is and I feel like where my fans want to see me, but I'd like to take on some things that are different; maybe find something that's an action-packed film. Just really show people a different side of me,” she added.

The Marvel superhero pic tumbled 66 percent in its sophomore outing domestically, compared to a 53 percent drop for DC's 'Superman.'


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Talk about a two-edged sword.


	Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps easily stayed atop the domestic box office chart in its second weekend with $40 million, but tumbled a worrisome 66 percent. That's more than anyone could have predicted after the event pic opening to $117.6 million last weekend amid stellar audience and critical reaction. At the same time, it isn't entirely outside the range of normal for the superhero genre. And there's still a clear runway ahead before summer ends. 




Fantastic Four had hoped to clear $200 million domestically through Sunday, but instead is projecting a 10-day domestic tally of $198.4 million, compared to cume of $236.2 million and a drop of 53 percent for DC Studos' Superman in its second weekend (to be fair,  the Man of Steel didn't have another superpic to compete with, although Jurassic Park Rebirth had only opened a week earlier). Overseas, Mister Fantastic and his family made up ground in earning another $39.6 million for an early global tally of $368.7 million globally. That includes $170.3 million internationally, compared to Superman‘s current overseas total of $235 million.

	In North America, Fantastic Four had no trouble fending off Universal/DreamWorks Animation's new family pic The Bad Guys 2 and Paramount's comedy Naked Gun, which opened in second and third place, respectively.

	










			Popular on THR		







Bad Guys 2 started off with a better-than-expected domestic opening of $22.2 million. The sequel boasts the second-best animated launch of the year to date and came in not far behind the first film, which debuted to $23 million domestically on its way to transforming into a sleeper hit and earning more than $250 million globally (the series is adapted from Aaron Blabey's best-selling book series about a crackerjack crew of animal outlaws).


	Director Pierre Perifel and producer Damon Ross reteamed to make the sequel, which boasts both an A CinemaScore and generally strong reviews. The sequel also sees the return of original voice stars Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos and Awkwafina. Newcomers lending their vocal talent include Zazie Beetz, Richard Ayoade, Alex Borstein and Lilly Singh.


	In the sequel, the animal crew is trying their best to be good, but plans go awry when they come out of retirement to stop one more heist and encounter a new trio of masterminds known as “The Bad Girls,” who are voiced by Danielle Brooks, Maria Bakalova and Natasha Lyonne.


Paramount's acclaimed The Naked Gun revival — starring Liam Neeson opposite Pamela Anderson — also opened on the high end of expectations, with a North America launch of $17 million and $28.5 million globally.


	 As fate would have it, the $40 million comedy is the last film that the current iteration of Paramount Pictures will release before David Ellison's Skydance officially closes its $8 billion merger with Paramount Global on Aug. 7. Affable movie studio chief Brian Robbins — who has also been serving as one of the three interim CEOs of Paramount Global since sale talks began last year — intends to step down once Ellison takes control of the entertainment conglomerate and installs his executive team both in the C-suite and at Paramount Pictures, according to sources.

	











The Naked Gun revival, produced by Seth MacFarlane, stars Neeson in his first leading comedic role opposite Pamela Anderson. He plays Lt. Frank Drebin Jr., who is trying to follow in the footsteps of his father, Frank Drebin, the infamous comedic character played by Leslie Nielsen in the original films. The new pic boasts an A-CinemaScore from audiences and strong PostTrak exits.


	Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu and Danny Huston also star. The fourth film in the long-dormant franchise, directed by Akiva Schaffer from a script he wrote with Dan Gregor and Doug Mand, opens 31 years after the last movie, 1994's Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, graced the big screen.


	One fun fact: Anderson is on double duty this weekend between Bad Guys 2 and Naked Gun.


Superman, now in its fourth outing, finished Sunday with a global tally of $551.2 million after earning another $13.9 million domestically and $11.2 million overseas. Last week, it became the first DC title in years to cross the $300 million mark in North America in a major win for the new leadership at DC, James Gunn — also the director of Superman — and Peter Safran (DC has struggled far more than Marvel in modern times).


	Produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin in partnership with Universal, Jurassic World Rebirth rounded out the top five in North America with $8.7 million for a domestic tally of $448.4 million and $766 million globally.

	











	The weekend's other new offering is Neon's buzzy horror-comedy Together, starring Alison Brie and Dave Franco. The indie pic came in sixth with a three-day weekend gross of $6.8 million for a five-day debut of $10.9 million.

The street name was announced on what would have been the Grateful Dead guitarist's 83rd birthday.


													By
												

	Associated Press



	A few hundred people gathered Friday (Aug. 1) to name a tiny San Francisco street after legendary Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia on what would have been his 83rd birthday, and as part of a citywide celebration to mark the band's 60th anniversary.

	Harrington Street, which is one block long, will also be called “Jerry Garcia Street.” Garcia died in 1995, but the band's popularity has only grown as younger generations discover the Dead's improvisational music, which blended rock, blues, folk and other styles.

	Garcia spent part of his childhood in a modest home in the city's diverse Excelsior neighborhood. He lived with his grandparents after the death of his father, Jose Ramon “Joe” Garcia.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I hope that you all get a chance to enjoy the music, dance, hug, smile,” said daughter Trixie Garcia, growing emotional during her brief remarks. “Cherish what's valuable, what's significant in life.”




	Tens of thousands of fans are in San Francisco to commemorate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary with concerts and other activities throughout the city.


	The latest iteration of the band, Dead & Company, with original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field for three days this weekend (beginning with Friday's show), with an estimated 60,000 attendees expected each day.


	Formed in 1965, the Grateful Dead played often and for free in their early years while living in a cheap Victorian home in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. The band later became a significant part of 1967's Summer of Love, and the Grateful Dead has become synonymous with San Francisco and its bohemian counterculture.On Friday, fans in rainbow tie-dye and Grateful Dead T-shirts whooped and cheered as the sign was unveiled. Nonfans with shopping bags and some using walking canes maneuvered around the crowd on what was for them just another foggy day in the working-class neighborhood.


	Afterward, devotees peeled off to pose for photos in front of Garcia's childhood home.


	Jared Yankee, 23, got the crowd to join him in singing “Happy Birthday.” Yankee said he flew in from Rhode Island for the shows. He got into the music about a decade ago.


	“It's a human thing,” he said of his impromptu singing. “I figure everyone knows the words to ‘Happy Birthday.'”

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	How is this for an ironic twist — as Stephen Colbert is preparing to say goodbye as the host of CBS‘ The Late Show, he also is portraying a late-night host for CBS with a guest role on the upcoming third season of the network's crime anthology Elsbeth, Deadline has confirmed. 


	Colbert is not playing himself in the episode, which filmed this week. According to Vulture, which first reported the news, he plays the host of the fictional Way Late with Scotty Bristol. Each episode of Elsbeth solves a different murder; it is unclear how Bristol is connected to that case of the week.

	A rep for CBS declined comment. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Primetime series take months of lead time from conceiving an episode to its filming, Colbert's appearance is believed to stem from a handshake “deal” he made with Wendell Pierce during the Elsbeth star's appearance on The Late Show in February. 


	After Colbert professed that he had long been asking CBS to play a corpse on one of the network's crime dramas, Pierce promised to help. “I can make that happen,” he said, referring to Season 3 of Elsbeth, which had just been picked up. “I know a guy who knows a guy. We can get you on,” he added. (You can watch the video below.)


	The jokey exchange led to real discussions and Colbert's appearance on Elsbeth. The role of Bristol is believed to have been written for him. In the wake of the Late Show cancellation, the part could've been recast but everyone proceeded with the original plan. 


Elsbeth, from Robert and Michelle King and CBS Studios, is headlined by Carrie Preston reprising her role from The Good Wife. Notable guest stars over the show's first two seasons include Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick and Retta.

Chris Meloni will return to his alma mater, Law & Order: SVU, for the upcoming 27th season of the perennially popular procedural, the actor confirmed in a recent Instagram post.


	“Hangin with friends on a Friday nite @therealmariskahargitay @dannflorek,” the Emmy-nominated actor wrote on social media alongside selfies of himself with fellow series vets Mariska Hargitay and Dann Florek.


	Deadline's sister publication TVLine first reported the news, which follows previous announcements of behind-the-scenes changes at the NBC juggernaut. In May, Deadline exclusively reported that Juliana Martinez and Octavio Pisano would not be returning to SVU as series regulars, and writer/executive producer Julie Martin and director/executive producer Norberto Barba would also be exiting the venerable drama. Additionally, Kelli Giddish is returning full-time, reprising her role as Amanda Rollins. And, viewers will get to see more of Captain Curry via Aimé Donna Kelly, who is being upped from her heavily recurring role to series regular.

	Both SVU and the mothership Dick Wolf series were renewed by the network earlier this year, with Michele Fazekas stepping in as the showrunner, the first woman to shepherd the veteran series. The two shows are having their best seasons on Peacock in total viewers in Live+35, having reached more than 44 million total viewers across linear and digital platforms this season, combined.


	Meloni's Elliot Stabler exited SVU back in Season 12 as a series regular, though he has featured a number of times since his departure, most notably during Season 24, when his character and Hargitay's Olivia Benson shared a near-kiss, driving both a ratings high and fans wild. Just earlier this week, the actor responded to a fan's demand that his character “kiss her already” with “I'm f—ing trying.”


	Both flagship Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU will return Sept. 25.

As far as I'm aware it's only for the one episode. I don't expect more than a single scene either. Cassidy and Huang are also in this episode.

So, for a single episode? The whole season? I suppose they can't share how many, but it would be nice to have a general idea.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox host and commentator, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.


	Pirro was confirmed on a 50-45 vote along party lines.


Donald Trump named her acting U.S. attorney in May, and later nominated her to take the position permanently.


	Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, wrote on X in reaction to the confirmation, “Jeanine Pirro should never be a permanent U.S. Attorney. She endorsed the firing of January 6 prosecutors. She recklessly spread the Big Lie to the point her *own producers* had to tell her to cool it. Ultimately, she's a rubber stamp for Donald Trump.”

	











	Durbin was referring to revelations that were made public in Dominion Voting Systems defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The network settled the case for $787.5 million.

There has to be a Trump supporter that thinks hiring people from TV is stupid. Just one MAGA.

Says someone who thinks Ketanji Jackson is a good justice.

Is she a drunk conspiracy peddler too?

Says someone who is thinks Trump won the 2020 election, and that the confirmation of another lying, MAGA lunatic is a good thing.

We have a convicted criminal in the White House who led an insurrection to try to stay in power. Who skated on indictments only because he came back to the presidency. Every move he's pulled since then has been to guarantee his authoritarianism and profit. None of these appointments should be surprising.

Idiocracy is here.

America has fallen off.

Yayyyyyyyyyyyy Judge Pirro

	After four years, the stars of Freeform‘s The Bold Type are itching for a Scarlet Magazine reunion.


Katie Stevens, who played budding editor Jane Sloan in the Sarah Watson-created series, recently expressed her interest in reprising the role for a movie with co-stars Meghann Fahy and Aisha Dee.


	“I'm in. Me, Meghann, and Aisha, every interview we do separately, we talk about how we want to do something Bold Type-related again, to do a movie or something,” she told People. “We're all primed and ready to do it.”

	Stevens added, “So I'm just like, ‘We just need to get it out there that we want to do it and then have fans rally.' Because there's a lot of remakes of things happening and spinoffs of things, and I'm just like, ‘Let's just do a Bold Type Hulu original movie or something!'”

	











	Inspired by Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, The Bold Type ran for five seasons from 2017 to 2021, following Jane (Stevens), Kat (Aisha) and Sutton (Fahy), three work besties who juggle life, love and career while working at fictional women's magazine, Scarlet.


	Raving that her former co-stars are “my girls for life,” Stevens noted that she will “hype every single thing that they do” in their respective careers.


	“It's the most beautiful friendship and the two of them are some of the greatest loves of my lives, being my sisters for life,” explained Stevens. “And it means so much to me that we are champions of one another no matter what is going on in life.”

	











	After The Bold Type was renewed for a fifth and final season in 2021, Stevens said filming the ending was “definitely bittersweet,” knowing that it was goodbye.


	“But I think it's a privilege of having the information that you are ending…it allowed us to be intentional in real life when filming the show,” said Stevens at ATX Television Festival.

	A somewhat long time ago in a galaxy not so far away, Liam Neeson took a lightsaber to the gut.


	The Oscar nominee recently expressed dissatisfaction with his Jedi Master character Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace, noting that he was “supposed to be a Master Jedi” but got duped during a lightsaber duel.


	“I thought my death was a bit namby-pamby. I'm supposed to be a Master Jedi,” he told GQ. “My character fell for that. ‘Oh, I'm going for your face! No, I'm not, I'm going for your stomach.' ‘Oh, you got me!' Like, oh please. Hardly a Master Jedi.”


	“But still, it was great,” noted Neeson of the filming experience.

	More than 20 years later, he reprised the role for a reunion with Ewan McGregor in his Disney+ spin-off series Obi-Wan Kenobi. “I kinda liked that. It was just one line. It was nice to recreate that and be with Ewan after 18, 20 years. It was sweet,” he recalled.


	During the prequel's 25th anniversary last year, concept and storyboard artist Iain McCaig revealed that George Lucas had another “very poignant” ending in mind, that would have involved Neeson playing Obi-Wan from the jump, with McGregor as his Padawan, Qui-Gon


	“As Obi-Wan dies and Qui-Gon defeats Darth Maul and stays with his Master as he passes away, he not only takes on his Master's quest, but he takes on his name,” explained McCaig in November. “Qui-Gon becomes Obi-Wan.”


	Although the switch-up would have ended on a more shocking reveal, it would have yielded the same outcome, with McGregor's Obi-Wan going on to train Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, Hayden Christensen), and ultimately his son Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in the original trilogy.

Weekend Editor


Ioan Gruffudd, who notably portrayed Mister Fantastic/Reed Richards in 20th Century Fox's Fantastic Four duology, reflected on the scrapped plans for a proposed third film that never came to be.


	In a Q&A with Vulture tied to the release of Marvel's new take on the storied comic book family, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the Welsh actor talked about feeling “incredibly proud to be part of such a beautiful franchise,” which comprised 2005's Fantastic Four and 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.


	“The mindset was that we were going to do three, and I think the second movie was equally successful as the first and equally enjoyable for the fans,” said Gruffudd, who attended the world premiere of the MCU entry, which features Pedro Pascal in the main role. “I particularly loved working with Doug Jones [as the Silver Surfer] on that movie, who's just a terrific artist and an expert in the field of movement. If you want to witness somebody bringing a character to life physically, he's just untouchable. So there was definitely that sort of momentum, and the plan was to do three movies, but these decisions are beyond my control.”

	Though both aughts superhero films had a box office upward of $300 million and similar mixed/positive reviews, Fox scrapped a potential threequel and, by 2009, announced plans to reboot the franchise, per previous reporting. That movie, released in 2015, featured Miles Teller as Reed Richards and was a critical and box office flop. 

	











	Speaking to his previous comments about having lost confidence and seeking therapy after the pace of his projects slowed down post-franchise, Gruffudd told the outlet: “As an actor, you almost grieve every part that you've played, and this was no different. This was a massive stepping stone in my career, and because this was two movies over several years, the character becomes part of you. So I think the grieving process is that you've enjoyed the character so much and you're not getting to play them again.”


	The Black Hawk Down actor also said he is “excited that the comic and franchise lives on” with Marvel's 1960s-set reimagining, though regarding any future reprisals he noted: “I'm not in the new movie. Fans are convinced that I'm going to be in a particular aspect of this universe that hasn't been written or filmed yet. But this idea of people showing up has been introduced, like Chris [Evans' Johnny Storm] in Deadpool [& Wolverine], or I think Mister Fantastic appeared in the guise of John Krasinski at one point. So, no, I haven't been approached to reprise Mister Fantastic. But you never know.”


	Since its July 25 release, First Steps accumulated just short of $200 million at the box office, facing a 66% decline in the vicinity of Captain America: Brave New World in its second weekend in theaters.

The first two films were pretty mundane, but they got most of the cast very, very right – it's a shame they couldn't deliver as well on the other aspects of the film.

his version way way better than the recent one.

That's nostalgia talking

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Liam Neeson is happy to talk a little shit about Qui-Gon Jinn","https://www.avclub.com/liam-neeson-qui-gon-jinn-death-namby-pamby","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 00:14:00 GMT","

Liam Neeson is out on the promo tour at the moment, producing lots of fun interview moments and soundbites in support of his new Naked Gun movie. (And, so far at least, no incredibly worrying, racially tinged revenge fantasies. Hooray!) That includes Neeson looking back on his long and storied career, sometimes with reverence—when, say, talking about Schindler's List—and sometimes not so much.

﻿

Case in point: Neeson's conversation with GQ this week about filming Star Wars: Episode 1—The Phantom Menace, and his role as surprisingly ineffective Jedi mentor Qui-Gon Jinn. Describing the general style of the film's swordfights as “cowboys in armor,” Neeson recounts the famous story in which he and Ewan McGregor both got caught making the lightsaber noises with their mouths the first time they used them in a scene. But also, the Taken star has some notes: “I thought my death was a bit namby-pamby,” he remarks, suggesting that a true Jedi Master wouldn't have fallen for—in Neeson's words—the old “‘Oh, I'm going for your face! No, I'm not, I'm going for your stomach.' ‘Oh, you got me!'”

Neeson seems ever-so-slightly amused about the whole process, noting that George Lucas specifically told him that he doesn't really enjoy directing actors, and only really comes alive when in the editing bay. (Giving his impression of Lucas' directing style, Neeson deadpanned, “Natalie, a little bit faster. Liam, a little bit faster there.”) Also, that same interview—a career-wide retrospective— briefly gives the viewer a taste of the actor's impression of flying blue stereotype creature Watto, in case that was something you were actively missing from your life.

Elsewhere in the interview, Neeson talks about reprising the role for the Obi-Wan show—basically waving it off as a nice way to hang out with McGregor for a day—talks about his genuine shock that both Taken and Batman Begins became big hits, and speaks glowingly about working with Pamela Anderson on Naked Gun.

Some scary incidents leave a lasting mark, especially when they involve your family. Mandy Moore is speaking out after her family was involved in a frightening hit-and-run accident.  The “This Is Us” star shared the news Friday on Instagram Stories, revealing that everyone is safe, but she didn't hold back when addressing the driver who fled the scene.

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

“The woman who rear-ended my family and then drove off, we pulled over, hope your karma finds you,” Moore wrote on her (now expired) Instagram stories, as reported by Page Six. “Thankfully everyone was ok but what kind of human does that?”

A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm)

The 41-year-old actress didn't go into further detail about the incident. However, she made it clear that the experience was both alarming and upsetting.

Just like her role as fiercely protective mom Rebecca Pearson on “This Is Us,” Mandy Moore is just as devoted to protecting her family in real life. 

Moore, who shares sons August, 4, Oscar, 2, and daughter Louise, 10 months, with husband Taylor Goldsmith, has become known for fiercely standing up for her loved ones.

In January, she clapped back at social media users who criticized her for posting a GoFundMe campaign to help her in-laws recover after losing their home in the Los Angeles wildfires. Some questioned why she wasn't covering the costs herself.

“And people questioning whether we're helping out our own family or attributing some arbitrary amount of money Google says someone has is NOT helpful or empathetic. Of course we are,” Moore wrote in an updated caption, as reported by People on 12th January, 2025.

“We just lost most of our life in a fire too. Kindly F OFF. no one is forcing you to do anything.”

Following the devastating fire that destroyed her in-laws' home, Moore also took to social media in February to express frustration after an Amazon package was delivered to the burned property. 

“Can we not have better discretion than to leave a package at a residence that no longer exists?” she wrote alongside a photo of the destroyed home with the package sitting outside, as reported by People. “This is my mother and father-in-law's home. Smh.”

Matty Healy was seen comforting his mother, Denise Welch, outside a restaurant in West Hollywood photos obtained by TMZ show.

She was crying and the singer helped consoled her by giving her a hug, along with sitting on the curb with her and chatting. TMZ reports that “she dabbed her eyes with a tissue,” while they chatted

“The two seem deep in a difficult conversation … with Healy appearing animated at one point while his mom was shedding tears,” the outlet wrote, further reporting that Healy was comforting his mom over a family matter. 

Healy's mom, Denise Welch, appeared on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Thursday, July 24, and the Bravo host asked her about her son's relationship with Swift, along with her album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is rumored to include songs about Swift and Healy's relationship. 

“Obviously, on pain of death can I talk about that episode, but being her mother-in-law is a role that I am glad that I lost,” Welch said. “Not that I have anything against her at all! It was just — it was tricky.”

“She — listen, you're not allowed to say anything, and then she writes a whole album about it,” she continued. “Matty has taken it all in completely good grace… “She — listen, you're not allowed to say anything, and then she writes a whole album about it.” 

According to US Weekly, the songs that were rumored to be about her relationship with Healy are “But Daddy I Love Him,” “Down Bad,” “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” “Guilty as Sin?,' “The Tortured Poets Department,” and “Fortnight.”

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

Following her breakup with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn in April 2023, Swift had a brief relationship with Matty Healy before her love story with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce began. 

Rumors that the two had a fling date back to 2014 when Swift met Healy backstage at one of his concerts. However, Healy denied the rumors shortly after, emphasizing that they had just met and formed a friendship. 

Things started back up again in May 2023 when Healy was spotted at one of Swift's Eras Tour shows. Shortly after, the two were seen in New York City together. 

“She and Matty are madly in love,” a source told The Sun at the time. “It's super-early days, but it feels right.”

However, in June 2023, multiple outlets reported that the two broke up. 

“Taylor and Matty broke up. They are both extremely busy and realized they're not really compatible with each other,” a source told Entertainment Tonight. “Taylor's friends want what's best for her and aren't shocked that their relationship fizzled out, since she recently got out of a long-term relationship.”

Multiple stars of “The Voice,” including coach Reba McEntire, are mourning the death of country music icon Jeannie Sealy at age 85. Sealy, who won a Grammy for her 1966 song “Don't Touch Me,” was a legend at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, where she performed more than any other artist in history, the venue revealed on August 1, 2025. 

“It is with a heavy heart we say goodbye to a true icon to us here the Opry, Mrs. Jeannie Seely,” the Opry wrote in an online tribute to the singer. “Jeannie is the definition of a mentor and dear friend to many in the country music community.”

McEntire was among many country artists and “The Voice” stars who have paid tribute to Sealy in the days since her death. In an Instagram post on August 1, McEntire shared a photo of herself with Sealy and fellow country icon Dolly Parton, and wrote, “I've always loved this woman! She was a little spitfire, opinionated team player! Rest in peace, Jeannie”

A post shared by Reba McEntire (@reba)

Parton, who served as an advisor on “The Voice” in 2015 and 2016, also paid tribute to Sealy on social media, calling her one of her “dearest friends.”

Parton wrote, “I have known Jeannie Seely since we were early on in Nashville. She was one of my dearest friends. I think she was one of the greater singers in Nashville and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had many wonderful laughs together, cried over certain things together and she will be missed.”

Season 22 winner of “The Voice” Bryce Leatherwood also paid tribute in his Instagram Stories with two photos of Sealy, including one of them together, and wrote, “Rest in Peace…from the first time I met Jeannie at the Bluebird Cafe, she said ‘we have to get you to the Opry…I just love that voice.' She was one of a kind and such a sweet soul. Condolences to her family and friends.” 

Leatherwood also commented on the Opry's announcement of Sealy's passing, “She was so kind to me … so sad to hear this. RIP”

A post shared by Grand Ole Opry (@opry)

Sealy died on August 1 at Summit Medical Center near Nashville due to complications from an intestinal infection, according to Billboard. Her health had been failing since the fall of 2024, the outlet reported, including multiple back surgeries and two emergency abdominal surgeries.

Many who paid tribute to Sealy called her a trailblazer and a “fierce advocate for women artists and performers.” Her career began at age 11, appearing on a local radio station in Pennsylvania, and then performing regularly on a local weekend TV show there by age 16. 

After moving to California, per Billboard, she made her name as a songwriter, earned a record deal, and appeared with Glen Campbell on the TV show “Hollywood Jamboree.” In 1964, the Country and Western Academy — now known as the Academy of Country Music — named her “the most promising female artist.”

After moving to Nashville, Sealy was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in September 1967 and became the first woman to regularly host Opry segments, per Billboard. Her final performance was on February 22 — her 5,397th appearance on the Opry stage.

After weeks of hinting about a big move for their family, Hallmark star Brant Daugherty revealed on August 2, 2025, that he and his wife, Kimberly, have moved from Los Angeles to Italy with their two young sons — Wilder, 4, and Aero, 1. 

Posting from their new upper level home in a charming Italian town, Brant wrote, “La nostra casa nuova 😍” — which, translated into English, means “Welcome to our new home.” 

“We spent months packing, cleaning, prepping and moving,” he continued, “but we're finally settled into our new home and let me tell you, I love this place already. The people are lovely. The food is even better. And the violin player outside is a nice touch. Benvenuto a Italia, famiglia Daugherty.”

A post shared by Brant Daugherty (@brantdaugherty)

Brant rose to fame playing Noel Kahn on “Pretty Little Liars” and has starred in multiple Hallmark movies since 2018, including 2024's “Trivia at St. Nick's.” Kimberly, meanwhile, is an actress who's written and produced Hallmark movies like 2023's “Christmas in Bethlehem, PA” and “Joyeux Noel,” which Brant co-wrote and starred in. The two married in 2019. 

Although Brant didn't give a reason for their family's move, he did reveal two months prior that he'd obtained dual citizenship in Italy, celebrating the milestone with his wife at a Festa della Repubblica event in Beverly Hills to commemorate the day in 1946 when Italy voted to become a republic. 

“Five years ago, we started a journey to seek out dual citizenship and learn more about my Italian family and heritage,” he shared on Instagram in June. “Along the way; I visited my family in Italy for the first time, showed my kids their ancestors' country and got to meet with the Italian Consul General in Los Angeles.”

“Very grateful to my lovely wife @kimdaugherty_ for spearheading this whole thing,” he continued, “and getting us in touch with a side of my family I'd never explored. I love that we get to share this with our sons.”

The Daughertys have shared their love of Italy over the years, including sharing pics and videos from a trip there in July 2023 with their son Wilder. 

A post shared by Brant Daugherty (@brantdaugherty)

Brant teased his family's impending move on July 14, posting a time-lapse video of himself getting their Los Angeles house ready to sell. 

“Cleaning up the place for someone else to move in,” he captioned the video. “We bought this house in 2018. Since we've lived here: we got married, our kids were born, we've had three of our scripts produced (Kim has more on her own), went through a pandemic and been through the highest highs and the lowest lows… but we've done it all together.”

“It's hard to say goodbye to a beautiful chapter of your life,” Brant continued. “So many good things happened here. But what matters is that we're still together for the next exciting chapter ahead. You never know where life will take you. New adventures await, my friends.”

On July 30, he posted a series of photos from their last days in Los Angeles and wrote, “Our last week before moving. Time for a big adventure.”

In mid-July, Deadline reported that Brant's next project is the feature film “By the Roots,” a “queer feminist biopic” co-starring Ally Sheedy, Emily Robinson, and Margaret Cho. He'll also be back in the U.S. to appear with 25 other rom-com stars at Christmas Con in December.

“The Naked Gun,” for most younger folk was — if anything — a movie series that ran a lot on cable during the '90s and '00s. But for Gen Xers and Boomers, it was the ultimate spoof franchise, starring the king of deadpan Leslie Nielsen. But excitement has been building across all demographics for the this year's reboot (evidenced in the film‘s youth-heavy opening weekend numbers), as ad after ad has built upon action star Liam Neeson‘s new, bumbling persona. And, in turn, audiences have revisited the original “Naked Gun” trilogy in preparation (or at least, that's how things were going down with my Letterboxd follows).

 










Neeson, however, is not to be counted among the rewatchers. In fact, the actor made a point of not revisiting the original films, which also starred Priscilla Presley (who you might just spot in the new movie) — though he did see them when they originally hit cinema screens (“They were a good giggle, he said. “Fun. School boy humor”).

“I just trusted the script,” Neeson told Variety. “And knew it would get better the more they worked on it. [Director Akiva Schaffer] was the co-writer but there was always another writer on set — a friend of Akiva's, obviously — and they would supply alternate endings to scenes. ‘Try this, try that.'”

 










As for whether or not he attempted to emulate Nielsen in his delivery, Neeson said, “No, those sort of notes I wouldn't have accepted. I've done over 100 movies, so I don't need someone to tell me how to act.”

Neeson has indeed done over 100 movies — 106 with “Naked Gun” to be exact — but he had never before done an out-and-out farce. On set, though, the “Taken” actor stuck to business as usual. “When we rehearsed stuff, we'd get rid of our personal giggles. And some of the scene require certain choreography — sight gags and stuff like that. I don't want to say it was always serious, far from it. But it was serious business, of course, shooting any movie and keeping a sense of lightness. You know, that's very important,” he explained.

Working with co-star Pamela Anderson — whom he's now reportedly dating — Neeson described as a wholly pleasant experience. “I admire her very much… No airs and graces, no big ego. She's there to do the work. She's just a lovely human being,” he said.

Neeson is Nielsen's son in the new “Naked Gun” timeline — an interesting choice considering the 72-year-old Neeson is roughly 40 years older than the son that was born to Nielsen and Presley's characters in “The Naked Gun 33 1/2: The Final Insult.” But putting aside that math, Neeson was happy to be associated with the “Airplane!” star… though he did have one condition in which he would definitely not have succeeded him. “But if the producers had said I must bleach my hair for the role, there's no way I would have done that,” Neeson shared.

The most important life lesson that a teenage Craig Wedren ever received may have been something that his voice teacher loved to repeat: “Take your bel canto and make it a can-belto!” Wedren, fortunately, was a born belter. A precocious middle-class kid from the Cleveland suburbs, he knew he wanted to be a rock star as soon as he discovered KISS. He sponged up the music his mom played in the car—Elton John, the Doors, Carole King, the Bee Gees—and internalized every lick of it. That knowledge served him well as a young teen: Cover bands were a central feature of middle-school social life in early-'80s Cleveland, and Wedren had both the repertoire and the voice for them.

He honed his falsetto by imitating vocalists like Freddy Mercury, Ozzy Osbourne, and Journey's Steve Perry—stars who embodied the notoriously high registers of '70s and '80s rock radio. Singing into the Shure 58 he'd received for his bar mitzvah, and sharpening his vibrato to cut through the midrange, he learned to make himself heard over his eighth-grade bandmate's Marshall half stack. They called themselves the Immoral Minority and played at being new wavers—a video shot by Wedren's childhood friend David Wain, future director of Wet Hot American Summer, captures the 13-year-old singer in all his budding New Romantic splendor—although in Cleveland at the time, there wasn't really any difference between underground and commercial, cool and uncool. The Bee Gees and the Germs, Def Leppard and Dead Kennedys—they all swirled together in the local teens' tape decks, their only common denominator the big adolescent feelings they were capable of summoning.

That spirit of openness, combined with his teacher's technical advice, fatefully shaped young Wedren's voice and vision, planting the seeds that would yield Shudder to Think, one of the strangest and most distinctive bands ever to emerge from the cauldron of American hardcore punk—creators of the 1994 album Pony Express Record, perhaps the unlikeliest masterpiece of the post-Nevermind major-label alt-rock signing frenzy.

In 1985, when 16-year-old Wedren moved to Washington, D.C. to live with his dad, kids from coast to coast were shaving their heads, shouting choruses, jumping off stages, and figuring out the bare minimum number of chords necessary for a 90-second juggernaut masquerading as a song. A loosely connected network of scenes was coalescing around the nascent American form called hardcore, and the nation's capital was one of its major hubs, thanks to bands like Minor Threat, the Faith, Void, Government Issue, et al. At the center of the action was Dischord, the staunchly independent, fiercely idealistic record label helmed by Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye.

Inspired by the example MacKaye and his acolytes set, teenagers assembling at venues like the 9:30 Club and DC Space—not to mention VFW and Grange halls across the region—were realizing that anyone could be in a band; why shouldn't they? One of those kids was high-schooler Stuart Hill, who taught himself electric bass and cobbled together a group called Stüge. He recruited one bandmate, guitarist Chris Matthews, from Bob's Famous Ice Cream in Glover Park, where they both worked. (The pipeline from ice-cream scooper to hardcore shredder was a popular career path in '80s D.C.) Their drummer, Mike Russell, was a university grad with a day job in engineering. When Stüge's singer left for college, Matthews' girlfriend suggested that they talk to a new kid from her high school who'd just been kicked out of his band and was desperate to find someone to play with: Craig Wedren.

It was an inauspicious audition. In preparation for the gig, Matthews' girlfriend had passed Wedren a tape of the band, but Stüge's approach—Wedren would later describe it as “boom bap boom bap boom bap D.C. hardcore with shouting and vaguely political lyrical content”—couldn't have been further from his own melodic instincts. “We had Craig come over and we played for him and he totally hated our music,” Hill recalled in a 2015 oral history. But the uneasiness was mutual, he added: “Actually, I didn't like his vocals at all. He freaked me out when he started singing.” Still, Wedren was bored and lonely, and Stüge apparently didn't have any better options on the table. “They didn't like me, I didn't like them,” recalled Wedren, “but by the end of the rehearsal I was the singer in the band anyways.”

Somehow, something clicked. “There's just something about putting my vocal style on top of this music that turned it into something else,” Wedren recalled. Constitutionally incapable of shouting out the songs like the band's old singer, he began finding new ways to attack the lyrics—stranger melodies, odder phrasings, slinkier ways of projecting. In their 1987 demos, you can hear Wedren feeling his way across the contours of the music like a vine seeking purchase on a mottled brick surface: The chugging guitars and double-barreled snare rolls are bog-standard hardcore with a touch of metal thrown in, but instead of barking or screaming, Wedren mercurially pleads, warbles, keens, shrieks, and purrs, theatrical in a way that was unheard of for hardcore frontmen at the time.

Perhaps it was Wedren's idiosyncratic vocal style that sparked some latent spirit of iconoclasm in his bandmates. As they contemplated their future on a rehearsal commute one day, Russell winced behind the steering wheel: “I shudder to think we'll be just another boom-bap hardcore band.” For Wedren, it was a eureka moment: They'd been contemplating a name change for their first official gig. Now they had one.

By 1987, the harder-faster-louder ethos of D.C. hardcore had morphed into something more unpredictable, searching, and rhapsodic. Bands like Rites of Spring and Embrace had twisted hardcore's sturdy steel girders into undulating shapes, eking expressionist forms out of brutalist materials. The nascent Shudder to Think fit loosely into this mold of what was becoming known—with extreme reluctance on the part of the style's originators—as emotional hardcore, emocore, or simply emo. Their debut 7"", It Was Arson, and LP, Curses, Spells, Voodoo, Mooses—both released in 1988 on Amanda MacKaye and Eli Janney's Sammich label, a kind of younger sibling to Amanda's brother Ian's Dischord—paired hardcore's muscled churn with yearning bass melodies, lightning-bolt zigs and zags, and Wedren's garment-rending croon, often multi-tracked and closely harmonized in a way that suggested that all that emotion was too much for the tape to handle.

Shudder to Think joined Dischord proper with 1990's Ten Spot, an even more ambitiously idiosyncratic showcase of the band's evolving melodic sensibility and Wedren's increasingly angelic coo. (Sadly, it was also marred by tinny, two-dimensional production, as though someone had decided to lock all that longing in a lead box.) The band was now officially part of D.C.'s inner circle. But even within a punk scene where individuality was notionally a badge of pride, they felt like misfits.

“People really didn't like us at first,” Wedren said. “They didn't get it.” It didn't help that Shudder to Think were playing opening slots for far more traditional hardcore bands (their first cross-country tour was with Canadian punks SNFU) whose audiences could be knuckleheaded at best. Flying projectiles—bottles, coins, batteries—frequently hurled from the crowd, along with homophobic epithets directed at Wedren, whose style of dressing could be as gender-ambiguous as his voice. (The missiles would continue well into the band's major-label years; Wedren got hit with a bottle at Lollapalooza 1994, and the meathead crowds when they toured with Foo Fighters could be just as hostile.)

“We were kind of shoehorning ourselves into something we didn't really fit into,” Hill would later recall. “A lot of people had an expectation with Dischord records, and we just did not fit that mold.”

“At the time, there was this sort of leaden stigma attached to D.C. hardcore,” Wedren said. Especially outside the city, “people's perception of D.C. hardcore was very narrow and very conservative, and that was difficult for us. We were always trying to shed that and to convince people or prove that we were something else.”

What most set the band apart from its D.C. peers was its apolitical identity. Leftist politics and a communal ethos had become central tenets in the Dischord world. In 1985, a group of D.C. scenesters had staged a “punk percussion protest” at the South African Embassy—the first action in what Fire Party's Amy Pickering had dubbed Revolution Summer, an attempt to wrest the hardcore scene from the violence and misogyny that was threatening to destroy it, as legions of thrill-seeking male newcomers flooded the pit at shows. That same year, Mark Andersen and Kevin Mattson founded the activist collective Positive Force DC with the intention of redirecting hardcore punk's creative energies toward social justice and political change. But, aside from Wedren's tendency to unintentionally draw out the worst in the scene's most homophobic members, Shudder to Think were largely apolitical. That was especially true of Wedren's cryptic lyrics.

“That was a straight-up ‘fuck that' choice on my part,” Wedren told Anti-Matter zine of his lyrical approach in 1995. “Fuck the big messages. Big messages make small music. … I honestly don't give a fuck about most singers' opinions about politics. I'm inundated with political information. I don't need to hear knee-jerk left-wing responses by punk-rock has-beens.”

Wedren's lyrics were the opposite of knee-jerk—they were head-spinning, running from nonsensical (“The moon bakes all my dough/Who buys it, I don't know/The bread they make there/Tastes like thin air”) to free-associative (“Cockroaches on the clocks and the cuckoos are all Jewish/I'm naked except for the plaid patch you're stitching into my groin”) to whatever you'd call the self-indulgent surrealism that closed 1991's Funeral at the Movies, setting dream-journal spoken-word against the repeated exhortation, “Ride that sexy horse, ride that sexy horse.” While other hardcore singers were focusing their agitprop, Wedren was taking experimental theater courses at NYU, listening to John Coltrane, and reading John Cage, discovering an off-balance world of “delicious discomfort.” (There was also a fair amount of acid involved, he'd later admit.)

By 1992's Get Your Goat, he and his bandmates were doing everything they could to delight and discomfit in equal measure. The band's playing on the record is virtuosic, at least by hardcore standards, full of dazzlingly complex time signatures and counterintuitive feints. The songs are colored whirlwinds striking wild poses, like columns of smoke caught beneath strobe lights. Wedren changes forms like a Greek god, shifting on a dime from operatic powerhouse to muttering conspirator to mournful sylph. If Shudder to Think had broken up after 1992, they would likely be remembered today as the authors of one of Dischord's greatest, most improbable triumphs. But they had bigger things in store.

After three albums for Dischord, they'd lasted longer than most of their peers, and they felt like they were outgrowing D.C. scene politics. Russell and Matthews had both gotten tired of van life and quit the band, replaced by Jawbox drummer Adam Wade and former Swiz bassist Nathan Larson. Wedren and the band didn't want to be scrappy indie heroes, or big fish in a small, insular pond. “Our aspirations were not to be like Pavement,” he told Pitchfork in 2008; “they were to be like the Cars or Van Halen or Duran Duran.”

There was no time like the early 1990s to try to make that happen; the recent success of Nirvana's Nevermind had major labels on the prowl for potential crossover jackpots. And Shudder to Think had some powerful fans in their court. One was the Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha; Shudder opened for the group on a run of dates in 1993. Another was Eddie Vedder, who tipped off Michael Goldstone, the A&R exec who had signed Pearl Jam to Epic. Goldstone knew a thing or two about unconventional, uncompromising alt-rockers, having also signed Rage Against the Machine. He offered Shudder to Think a two-album deal, with the option for up to six more LPs.

Whether you were a day-one fan who'd been following the band since its first releases or a newcomer enticed by Epic's marketing spend at Tower, the first time you heard Pony Express Record probably came as a cosmic rug-pull. It is bigger and stranger than anything Shudder to Think had yet recorded, by several orders of magnitude. It slips sneakily between known forms and swaggers with cock-rock abandon, an avant-garde behemoth in hair-metal spandex; Gastr del Sol masquerading as Def Leppard, or vice versa—Van Halen getting their rocks off as Slint.

Album opener “Hit Liquor” begins with a rifle-crack snare hit—a favorite trick of Wade's—before the full band plunges into a loping 12/4 groove, with a dubby undercurrent not a million miles from what MacKaye's Fugazi were doing in those years. Hill's bass paces in confused, chromatic circles; the guitars are scabrous and atonal, the vibe nervous, itchy. Wedren begins singing in a deceptively dulcet tone, then almost immediately ratchets up at an odd angle, dangerously close to falling out of key, his vibrato positively seismic. A honeyed falsetto follows, then a plaintive yelp and a basso purr. Within three lines—just 13 meager syllables—he hits four or five different registers. He's all over the place, prowling, wolflike, almost menacing in his movements.

The song is dripping with sexual portent: “A party of mouths, a finger-fan courtship,” he lilts, with faux innocence; a lasciviously homophonic double entendre lurks inside “liquor.” The lyrics make no literal sense; possible meanings hover over the words like semi-sheer fabric. “Wanna… watch?” taunts Wedren in his gravelliest, most come-hither baritone, and Larson's guitar explodes into ribbons of liquid distortion. Based purely on the song's unspoken libidinal energies, Pony Express Record ought to have come slathered in parental advisory stickers. Emo may have developed a reputation for bruised-ego sexlessness, but not Pony Express Record—right from the jump, the album fucks.

Swiz practiced a blunt, unrelenting strain of purist hardcore, but on Pony Express Record, Larson gives free rein to all his rock-god fantasies, unleashing cascade after cascade of squealing harmonics, hammer-ons, pick slides, and incendiary solos. But there's nothing kitschy or pastiche about the record's fretwork: He and Wedren contort their fingers around dissonant chords, slash-and-burn soundscapes, changes that make no sense, except by dint of extreme repetition. The contrasts can be laugh-out-loud thrilling—“Gang of $” surgically jabs at a series of ingrown chords, only for “9 Fingers on You” to kick off with a strutting palm-muted stadium-rock riff. Rarely is music this difficult so flat-out fun.

Wade's drumming is a math-rock fever dream, a patchwork of 17/8 time signatures, 7/4-into-13/8 changeups, trap-door fills, and bridges to nowhere. I'm hardly alone in struggling to parse his timekeeping—yet I'm rarely not toe-tapping to it, if not all-out air-drumming. Without Wade's rocksteady pulse, the rest of the band would have spun violently out of control, like moons falling out of orbit. Wade's job, he told Modern Drummer in 2014, was to impose order: “I would find my ‘1' of the loop. That was the fun thing about these weird riffs—there was no real beginning or ending, so you'd kind of make one…. I'd find the downbeats and accents and the little pockets for the kick drum. My mantra became, ‘The weirder Craig's going to get with these riffs, the more duh I'm going to play.'” His pulse, accordingly, was a marriage of rocket scientist and caveman. Looking for reliable tentpoles, he turned to classic rock, borrowing patterns from lunkheaded totems like AC/DC's “Hell's Bells” and the Stooges' “Down on the Street.”

Despite the complexity of the music, it's the opposite of cluttered: Wade leaves vast chasms of empty space for the guitars and vocals to sail through. He makes every fill count, and he obliterates his cues with extreme prejudice. In his targeting, he was assisted by a device that producer Ted Niceley brought to the sessions, called a Russian Dragon—a play on the words, “rushin', draggin'”—that tracked the timing of his hits by triggering a row of LEDs. “We'd do a take and Ted would watch the machine and go, ‘You're rushing a bit there, you're dragging a bit there—do it again,'” he told Modern Drummer. “And maybe if you hit one of the far outside lights it was audible to a normal person. We're talking milliseconds here. But Ted demanded perfection.” (Ironically, Niceley also produced Jawbox's For Your Own Special Sweetheart—the year's other major-label debut by a Dischord defector.)

“We had a lot of unspoken rules for ourselves,” Larson remembered. “You could work in rock riffs, but you had to break it up into parts. Seven of this chord, three of this chord. It was like a broken version of popular music.” Wedren was puzzling out his lyrics on the Amtrak between D.C., where the band was rehearsing, and his home in New York—rehearsal tapes looping on his Walkman, the landscape flashing by as he dreamed up messenger girls riding around on inner tubes, their asses all scraped up; and ape-guy 8x10s; and heaven holding out for high scores. Some of his writing could resemble John Ashbery's hypnopompic logic in its lateral slide across almost making sense. One song, the prancing “Chakka,” was omitted from the lyric sheet; its free-associative sprawl, Wedren is said to have remarked—“Kiss you can't vibrate bone/I can get thought of you whe-e-ay-re”—was never meant to scan beyond a purely syllabic level.

If you've never heard Pony Express Record, many of Wedren's lines might look like doggerel, but any fan will recognize them as though they were burned into their brain, branded there with neurosurgical wands. I've been listening to the album for 31 years, and a single syllable—picking at random: the saucy way Wedren moans “ooh” in “Earthquakes”—can trigger in me a practically Pavlovian response.

Shudder to Think had their randy moments, but Pony Express Record ventures leaps and bounds beyond their horny early trial balloons, offering the kind of progressive expression of male sexuality that was all too rare in '90s alternative rock—even in the underground, where ethically minded acts like Fugazi wore the mantle of righteousness, not necessarily pleasure. Shudder to Think offered a glimpse of something else: something liberated and louche, non-traditional, nonbinary, unshackled—unless, of course, handcuffs were your deal, in which case, OK! “It definitely felt like the next step after Get Your Goat, but so much darker,” Wedren said of the album in 2018. “And so much… meaner. And more sexual versus sensual. Get Your Goat is kind of ecstatic and sensual. But Pony Express Record, there's something kind of midnight black about it. It's the way the era felt. It was all very nocturnal. Everyone was getting signed to record deals and on tour. There was a lot of heat and a lot of darkness, and I think that trickled into the writing of the record.”

Pony Express Record is steeped in shadow; it's often as scary as it is sexy. Darkness oozes from the cracks of “Own Me,” a woozy lament (“I'm barely born/Too old for drugs but too young/To know how to not get too high”) that reimagines Lesley Gore's “You Don't Own Me” as a blues dirge in the fashion of the Stooges' “Dirt.” A lone candle seems to illuminate the flickering acoustic introduction to “Trackstar,” a proto-post-rock sprawl influenced by Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden (itself an album famously recorded in total darkness). After all the rock'n'roll pyrotechnics of the preceding 51 minutes, the album ends with a muffled sob: “I'm drowned/Can't get far,” mourns Wedren over spiderwebbed acoustic guitars in “Full Body Anchor,” the record's 110-second finale. “Can't hear you/Help/Home is where the ground/Can't come to a well.” The guitar fizzles out like a wick snuffed between licked fingertips.

The album's centerpiece, arriving smack dab in the middle of the CD, is “X-French Tee Shirt.” The second single, it was also the big hit, at least in relative terms; the video, directed by Pedro Romhanyi—he'd also direct videos for Blur, Suede, Kylie Minogue, and Robbie Williams—fell into rotation in MTV's Buzz Bin, a promotional gambit deemed to have nearly alchemical powers of turning alt-rock into gold. (“A New Formula: Into the ‘Bin.' Out Comes a Hit,” marveled a New York Times headline in 1992, noting the successful push given to singles from Temple of the Dog, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Nirvana.)

It's hard to imagine an unlikelier hit. To begin with, it's built around one single chord, an eighth-note chug that arcs from end to end like a long, straight road. The only chords that break the monotony, early in the song, sound alarmingly wrong, fistfuls of tritones fished from a wasp's nest. The song's introduction thrashes and writhes, torn between the consonance of a gleaming pre-chorus and sudden eruptions of bent and broken metal, shards of rebar thrown down at fucked-up angles. Wedren sings of chewing foil and giving up; you can practically feel the electrical current sizzling through your teeth.

Then, without warning, a hush descends, and over a trim, plucked guitar string, Wedren lights into a lullaby of a chorus, his quavering falsetto barely louder than a whisper: “Hold back the road that goes/So that the others may do/That you let me in just to/Pour me down their mouths.” That's it; repeat ad infinitum. The lines scroll and tumble, a tangle of weird enjambments and unforeseen pauses, glowing like the bioluminescent mantra of Jeff VanderMeer's Annihilation.

The melody is a slow-motion roller coaster, a gravity-defying Moebius trip. The chorus loops in 28-beat phrases—the beat regular enough to headbang to, strange enough to buckle your knees. The lyrics float just past the boundary of intelligibility, yet you can feel some kind of meaning trying to break through. “I remember I was thinking vocally about Joni Mitchell—she packs so much challenging and satisfying into her melodic and syllabic flights,” Wedren would later recall. “The lyrics were stream-of-consciousness, but I worked them to a point where the stream was satisfying to me, emotionally and image-wise. So I couldn't tell you what it's ‘about' in the literal sense, but it feels right, and somehow meaningful to me intuitively, like seeing shapes and shadows out of the corner of your eye.”

At some point, you realize that Wedren's whisper has expanded into a gale-force bellow, hard-panned and all around you. The road that goes just goes and goes, soaring skyward, hammered flat on anvil-sized chords, buoyed by Larson's screaming harmonics. The fade-out is unambiguous in its implications: This song will never, ever end. It's still going, way, way out there, like the Voyager spacecraft.

A lot of major-label alt-rock signings didn't have very happy endings, but all things considered, things could have turned out worse for Shudder to Think. The album sold decently enough—it had moved 60,000 units by 1997. Goldstone, the A&R who signed them, had moved on to Dreamworks by the time they returned to the studio to record a follow-up, 1997's 50,000 B.C., but he stuck by them, visiting them in the studio to offer his ear, and advice, as a friend.

The album sessions were not without difficulty. In the aftermath of Pony Express Record, by Wedren's own admission, he went a little crazy—couldn't sleep at first, then couldn't stop itching. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma; he was still in treatment while they were recording 50,000 B.C., in fact. The radiation dried him out terribly, turned his mouth and throat into sandpaper; in between vocal takes, he'd guzzle gallons of water. “I would just go glug glug glug glug, and then sing,” he told Anti-Matter last year. “Glug glug glug glug, and then sing. And then whoever the Pro-Tools engineer was, after we were done recording, would have to go through all my vocal takes and have to remove all the glugs.”

Wedren and Larson's friendship faltered; each wanted to steer the ship. Where Wedren wanted to take the follow-up in even more extreme directions, the others just wanted to rock. He tried to mollify his bandmates, he says—“write something more soulful, more pop, something that would make Nathan happy and would get the band back in lock step with one another”—but, like so many attempts to save a floundering relationship, it was too little, too late. 50,000 B.C. isn't a bad album, but it doesn't have the brilliance of Pony Express Record; it feels like a compromise, like they're holding back their more esoteric urges—precisely the instincts that made their earlier work so singular.

“I just feel like the point of music is to get sprung,” Wedren said last fall. “To be free of this body, this world, and these rules…. I just want to stay slippery and free.” Shudder to Think's songs have endured, he theorized, because they're loose enough, “in this liminal space between meaning and interpretation. I can sing them and have whatever associations I have to the imagery that are relevant to me now, or even revisit where I was and whatever those associations were back then in a more dear and tender way.” He told the interviewer that later that day, he'd be going to rehearsal with his boyhood pal David Wain and some other friends who have a group called Middle Aged Dad Jam Band. They were getting ready for a New Year's show; at Wain's urging, he was going to sing some Shudder to Think songs. “Is that going to be strange?” Wedren asked. “No. It's not going to be strange at all. I love those songs. They're all very sturdy boats, you know?”

It's a good metaphor—over the years, those sturdy boats carried Shudder to Think through some choppy waters, and to once unfathomably distant shores. Here's another one. The one-of-a-kind Pony Express Record is a unicorn, powerful and iridescent and lithe, in shiny black latex. A sexy horse, charging triumphantly into the unknown.

	In the video, a man putters up and down the street carrying a pitchfork, shouting at his neighbors and at no one, punctuated by the occasional obscenity. He isn't happy that the neighbors are filming. “You guys are taping me? For what?” he asks. “I'm walking down the street! I'm rehearsing! I make movies, man! I'm rehearsing a scene.” During the four-minute, 30-second clip, later shared with local TV news stations in San Antonio, the man mentions police visits to the neighborhood, which had been frequent. He references arson. He hints at a dispute that runs way deeper than this one moment, then claims he has done nothing wrong. “I can yell. I can scream. I can pray,” he says. “Whatever I want.” Separated from the phone recording him by a spearlike black fence, he departs with his pitchfork still in hand. “Keep filming me, boy. Boy,” he says. Bleep. Then the video is over, and he is gone.


	He told no lies about who he was. Jonathan Joss had done big things in Hollywood. He was best known for voicing John Redcorn, a recurring character on the Fox animated sitcom King of the Hill, which ran from 1997 to 2009, and has a reboot scheduled for release Aug. 4 on Hulu, in which Joss is set to return. He also appeared in five episodes of the NBC hit Parks and Recreation as Chief Ken Hotate, a Native American tribal elder, as well as in films like True Grit and The Magnificent Seven. But that night, after filming had ended, another neighbor encountered him outside his San Antonio home. The man shot Joss dead. 

	











	The next day, Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, issued a statement: “We were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship,” he wrote. “Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.” And so, he argued, was the shooting. The couple had been living in hotels after a January fire burned down Joss' longtime home, and had arrived that afternoon just to check the mail. They found a dog's skull and harness “placed in clear view,” Kern de Gonzales wrote, and deduced it was one of their pets — taunting them, they believed, for the fire, which killed Joss' three pups. Before pulling the trigger that night, the neighbor, later identified as Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, also “started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us,” Kern de Gonzales alleged. Ceja Alvarez raised his rifle and aimed toward the couple. Joss pushed his husband out of the way and was hit. He later died at the scene. “He saved my life,” his husband wrote. Ceja Alvarez, according to the police report, told the first officers to arrive, “I shot him.”

	In part because the shooting took place on June 1, the first day of Pride Month, Joss' death became more than a news story. It became a cause. It embodied the worst fears of the queer community, who saw confirmation of homophobic violence growing more mainstream. But almost as quickly, a counter-narrative emerged. A man who was not killed for being gay, but for being intolerable, and according to some, even threatening. “Everyone has made a judgment based on information that contradicts every known fact,” one observer wrote on Facebook. “Before you start screaming ‘hate crime,' spend 5 minutes looking into the past 3 years of his life.” Each perspective was shaped by limited information, snippets of a life reduced to headlines. But conversations with people who knew Joss reveal a complex person whose death defies an easy explanation. Jonathan Joss was a devoted friend and partner to his husband, and he struggled with addiction and mental health. He was engaged with his fans, and prone to violent verbal outburst and erratic behavior. He was an attentive friend and a difficult neighbor. He was entrepreneurial, and an accomplished professional — but unpredictable. Chaotic.


	So much so that when Brandy Wahl-Trejo, a longtime ex-girlfriend, learned that he had been killed, she wasn't surprised it had happened. “I was surprised,” she says, “that it took this long.”

	WAHL-TREJO HAD DATED JOSS for 13 years, starting in 2006, she says, when she visited a friend who lived in Joss' neighborhood. The first time she saw him, Joss was wielding an ax, trying to chop down a neighbor's fence. Wahl-Trejo believed him when he told her the neighbor was running a chop shop in their yard. His mom lived with him, he said, and it was keeping her up at night. Wahl-Trejo was 28, using meth, and ready to believe anything. She says Joss was a regular meth user then, too.


	“I've got $5,000,” Wahl-Trejo  remembers Joss telling her that same day. “Want to go to Vegas?” They stayed at the Hard Rock Casino. They gambled and attended a marijuana convention. And when it was over, she followed him to the Viejas Reservation outside San Diego, where they stayed with some of his friends. Within a week, she says, Joss got them kicked out. “He gets loud and wants attention and starts stirring up trouble,” she says. But she also loved that he didn't judge her. That he could make her feel at ease with herself and her past. “He could make me smile when there wasn't really a lot of reasons for me to smile.”

	











	They set off for his houseboat in Marina del Rey, two hours up the coast. During the drive, Wahl-Trejo says, Joss' continued meth use sparked hallucinations and frantic yelling. She remembers pulling over at a psychiatric facility. “I don't know what's wrong with this guy,” she says she told them. “Y'all need to help him.” But Joss instantly transformed. “He sat there and put on his best act, like he was a good boy,” she says. “And they made me feel crazy.”


	She kept going on their road trip because she'd never seen California, nor the new life it promised. Joss made her feel good about herself. He made her smile. And the world he brought her into may have been volatile, but it was also novel and exciting and, eventually, downright life-affirming — even if the houseboat was disappointing, especially for a man of his credentials. “It looked like the dinghy of the boat in front of it,” she says. 


	The Jonathan Joss origin story Wahl-Trejo cobbled together, over time, goes like this: Joss grew up in San Antonio, born to parents of Comanche and White Mountain Apache descent, and worked in their restaurant starting in middle school. To make it a bit more fun, he inhabited different characters to wait on different tables, which unlocked his love of acting. He would tell her that his parents never took his professional acting ambitions seriously, which bugged him, because he wanted nothing more than to make them proud. He graduated from a local Catholic university in 1990 with a degree in theater, and by 1994, he'd appeared in Walker, Texas Ranger. It's remarkable, Wahl-Trejo admits, what he was able to achieve at a time when very few Native American actors got big opportunities. And she's not the only one who thinks so. 


	“Jonathan was one of the very few actors who up-and-coming Native people could look up to,” says Tafv Sampson, a Native actress whose father, Tim, lived for a time on Joss' houseboat. “He's kind of an icon in that way.” He was even rarer in the sense that some of his contemporaries from the 1990s, legends like Graham Greene and Wes Studi, weren't showing up in comedies, and here he was in 1997 getting cast in the latest Mike Judge animated project. “The only roles really available at that time were the stoic Indian, the warrior, the savage,” Sampson says. “And Jonathan got to be a cartoon character. That was really rare back then, to be able to play and poke fun and make Rez jokes, and sort of be the lonely voice in the room bringing that comedy in.”

	











	Mike Schur, the acclaimed co-creator of Parks and Recreation, also remembers Joss as “an actor that you never had to explain anything to.” He was always funny, and always a professional. He was first recommended to Schur by Parks and Rec co-creator Greg Daniels, who had worked with Joss on King of the Hill. Daniels had no hesitations, as far as Schur recalls, and thought he'd be a perfect fit for the role of John Redcorn. Joss once told Schur that he really liked the fact that his character on the show wore a suit, because all his past characters wore more traditional, more cliché Native costumes. “He really liked that,” Schur says. “That was meaningful to him.” Schur never had any trouble with Joss on set, and doesn't remember anyone else who did, either. After Joss died, a group text among former cast and crew flooded with only fond memories. “He was just lovely,” Schur says. “He just was a lovely part of the show.” 


	Joss' signature role as John Redcorn on King of the Hill began in Season Two, after the character's original voice actor died in a car accident. Joss would go on to perform in the Red Corn Band, an acoustic, bluesy group which released its first album in 2004. Joss loved the Redcorn character, Wahl-Trejo remembers, even though he felt self-conscious about the fact that he was a replacement actor. “He never felt like he deserved any kind of recognition for what he did, yet he wanted recognition for what he did,” she adds. “He was just so conflicted and at odds with himself.”


	That inner conflict could spill out in explosive ways. Wahl-Trejo says she got sober in 2007; Joss, as far as she knows, never did. During filming for his role as Denali, a rogue Comanche assassin in Antoine Fuqua's 2016 remake of  The Magnificent Seven, cast members were given slushies during breaks. Wahl-Trejo, who was on set with Joss, remembers him losing it when Denzel Washington got two, and he only got one. When he was told second slushies were “only for the main cast,” he “flipped out,” she says, and took off on foot down a dirt road in Louisiana, in costume, bound for nowhere. His volatile behavior was even worse at conventions, which became a major source of his income. “I cannot tell you how many comic cons we have been uninvited to because Jonathan just acts crazy,” Wahl-Trejo says. “If he would have just acted right, he would have gone so, so far. Jonathan was his own worst enemy.”

	











	Joss' self-destructive instincts, Wahl-Trejo says, were at their worst in his dealings with neighbors. “He terrorized that neighborhood,” she says. Once, when his neighbor from three doors down — Ceja Alvarez, who would later be accused of his murder — installed a fence for Joss' next-door neighbor, Joss claimed it encroached an inch and a half onto his property, Wahl-Trejo remembers. He responded, she says, by dousing the fence with red paint. And in an area where many of his neighbors were Latin American, Joss, Wahl-Trejo adds, had a habit of using racist insults. He'd call people names, threaten to get their kids taken from them. Kern de Gonzales offers a different perspective rooted in context. “If he ever said something in anger, it was in response to being verbally attacked,” he explains. “Jonathan did not have xenophobic beliefs. He believed no human was illegal. He told me that many times, and it came from a deep understanding of what it means to have your very existence questioned.” 


	Nevertheless, Wahl-Trejo argues, Joss was often to blame for the conflict. Back when they were still together, sometimes he'd go out of town for work, and she'd stay in the house without him. The difference, she remembers, was obvious. “Everybody could relax. Everybody didn't have to stay inside,” she says. “And then he would come into town, and everybody would have to stay in their houses because he would just act like an asshole.”


	Other neighbors told a nearly identical story. “They don't know what we went through,” Alejandro Ceja, a relative of the shooter, told the San Antonio Express-News. “We were afraid — all the time.” Another neighbor alleged in the same story that Joss would often run around brandishing weapons, including a machete and a tomahawk he liked to throw at telephone poles. Joss' shooter, in a June 2024 police report, claimed Joss had driven past his house waving a crossbow and hurling racial slurs. Multiple neighbors reported Joss to police for damaging their fences with his Hummer. “Everyone can try to judge me for what I have said about my neighbor,” one person wrote on Facebook, “but y'all didn't live next to him and witnessed everything he did.” Ceja Alvarez, the shooter, echoed Wahl-Trejo's recollections from 2006 in police reports: Joss would put on an act when police arrived, then resume harassment after they left. Reports documented Joss driving by Ceja Alvarez's house threateningly, once saying he was “coming for him.” 

	











	Josh Long, a local San Antonio friend who met Joss at a comic con roughly 15 years ago, remembers visits where Joss would gallop out the door when certain neighbors walked by, sometimes provoked and sometimes not. He'd yell at them to get away from his property, and from Long's car. “He'd come back all winded and mad,” Long says, “and you could see the anger in his face.” Joss, he adds, is best described as a “force of nature” — for better and worse.


	Wahl-Trejo left Joss in 2019, after which he got married to a different woman in 2020; then divorced in 2023; then married again, this time to Kern de Gonzales, a trans man, after coming out as gay. All the while, despite the difficulties, Wahl-Trejo always felt indebted to Joss. She was a girl from the south side of San Antonio, and because of him, she got out and grew into her full self — and had an awful lot of fun along the way. “I would have never been able to meet Chris Pratt or Amy Poehler or Josh Brolin. Brittany Murphy was, like, my friend. All these things would have never, ever happened if not for Jonathan,” she says. Even her sobriety, she owes in part to her time with him. To the world he opened up for her. “That's what kept me around so long,” she adds. “I felt like I owed him something in life, because I felt like he gave me my life back.” At the end, though, her purse of forgiveness had finally been emptied.


	The last time Wahl-Trejo saw Joss was a few months before the shooting, when she happened to be in his neighborhood. She drove by his house and found Joss outside, in his underwear, with an arrow in one hand and a pan in the other. “I didn't stop and talk to him,” says Wahl-Trejo. “I just kept going.”


	COURTNEY LYNN SENT JOSS A a Facebook friend request back in 2016. She didn't expect him to respond — but he did, almost right away. She'd been a fan of his work, from King of the Hill to Tulsa King, but starting then, she became a fan of his person, too. Joss was a prolific poster, livestreaming videos and sharing updates about his daily life on a near-constant basis. The messages offered any fan's dream: a window into his existence. But Joss wasn't posting for branding alone. He cherished those fan interactions. And many of his fans likewise cherished him. They never saw the side of Joss that Wahl-Trejo and his neighbors describe. 

	











	After Joss' death, hundreds of his fans flocked to Facebook to offer condolences. Some of them had known him personally, but many did not. Some lamented not being able to meet him in person. Others talked about how he still had so much to give. “I can't believe this is true,” one wrote. “I was so excited to meet you one day.” 


	Lynn was yet another voice in the chorus. Her connection to Joss, she explains, grew in 2023, when she re-joined TikTok. He followed her, and messaged her randomly with a “Hello” and a waving sticker. They chatted briefly over DMs, but never really talked until shortly before Joss' house burned down in January. He'd been trying to sell his very own “King of the Grill” spice blend — an idea hatched back in 2011 with his longtime friend and collaborator, Robert Rios. He'd sold many things on Facebook, from T-shirts to headshots to personal videos, often corresponding with buyers through his personal phone number. Lynn reached out to place an order, and Joss video-called her right away. Joss told jokes in his John Redcorn voice and was nothing but pleasant. Later, they talked more over text. “He was definitely somebody who was going to speak his mind and tell his truth, and he wasn't afraid of what other people thought,” Lynn says. “I liked that about him.”


	Joss, in general, showed up for his friends — digital and nondigital alike. Like Patrick Zachary Cortez, who remembered him in a Facebook post as a childhood friend, someone always willing to help or to call him up at random hours for “hilarious diatribes,” and for generally being “kind, giving, respectful, articulate, well-mannered and sweet.” Likewise, Rios remembers Joss as smart and welcoming. He was happy to talk to anyone, fans and friends alike. “He knew a lot. He would teach you a lot,” Rios says. “He would stand out. He would take over. Very lovable. Very gullible. And he could get by on a dollar any day of the week.”


	Long, the friend who met Joss around 2010, remembers hanging out with him last year — one of his last visits before Joss died. Long had just lost his job and was feeling down. Joss invited him over, cooked up some homemade chalupas, and joked about how they were eating “tapas” — “you know,” Long remembers Joss saying, “the Spanish word that white people call broke Mexican food.” Long chokes up at the memory. “The good times around Jon were really good,” he says. “And then the bad times were sad, watching from the outside, wondering what he was going through.” Long insists he never saw Joss so much as drink around him, but he suspected his friend was drinking or using substances, just given the emotional roller coaster he appeared to be on from one visit to the next. That, and what seemed to Long to be an accelerating waste in his face.

	











	Trey Brown, a King of the Hill superfan with a Hank Hill tattoo on his thigh, knew nothing of Joss' struggles when planning his wedding back in 2022. He happened to Google members of the show's cast, which led him to Joss' website, where he saw an advertisement for one more entrepreneurial venture: For a few hundred dollars, Joss would perform wedding ceremonies. Right then, Brown hired him. 


	The ceremony was supposed to take place at the Alamo. Rain forced the couple to relocate to their hotel room, where Joss met them dressed in tight black pants, white cowboy boots, and a scarlet stole. The couple brought along the bride's father, while Joss brought along his then-wife. Joss placed a pair of moccasins between the couple, symbolizing their journey. “He really incorporated his personal touch into the ceremony,” Brown says. “He turned it into a pretty great experience.” In return, Joss asked for his payment of several hundred dollars and a bottle of Crown Royal Vanilla. While Brown mostly remembers someone who took his role as a wedding officiant seriously, he also saw someone who was troubled. As a minister in a religion called “Dudeism,” inspired by the Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski, Brown calls himself the “Official Dude” of Texas. When he told Joss about his spiritual work, Joss “took that in a way where he's like, ‘Oh, I can talk to this guy about my problems.'” He'd call often to vent. About what, Brown will not say, citing religious confidentiality. But Joss, he remembers, said plenty. He was almost dying to be heard.


	In a tribute to his friend, Brown is planning to get a new King of the Hill tattoo — this one featuring a shirtless John Redcorn, with one word underneath: “Persevere.”


	THE MAN WHO WOULD SOON FIND find himself at the center of a national debate about hate crimes, homophobia, and what really happened that evening in Texas, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, met Jonathan Joss online, too, having admired his work in Parks and Recreation. On TikTok, he watched Joss throw knives and feed homemade tortillas to his dogs. “I thought the knife-throwing thing was the coolest thing I'd ever seen,” says Kern de Gonzales, 32. “I thought, ‘Why don't I throw knives in my house?'” Kern de Gonzales reached out to express appreciation, not expecting a response. He got one right away.


	That was Jan. 19, 2023. By February, Kern de Gonzales, who lived in South Carolina, was visiting Texas. “He was wearing a beautiful blue dress with a leather jacket and cowboy boots,” Kern de Gonzales recalls of their first meeting. “It was an absolutely iconic look.” The real spark, though, was their conversation. “We both just felt instantly safe with each other,” he explains. “Almost like we had known each other for a long, long time.” He was struck when Joss thanked him for his kindness. “It took me aback,” he admits. “But also it made me start thinking, ‘Why aren't more people nice to you?'”

	











	Kern de Gonzales didn't dare imagine, at first, that their bond would be anything more than friendship. “I didn't even know he had any sugar in the tank,” he says of Joss's orientation. But he had a suspicion, based on a few suggestive TikTok videos, which was confirmed when Joss started flirting with him. “I was elated,” he remembers, “but at the same time a little nervous.” Kern de Gonzales had to explain that not only was he gay, but trans. He worried about how Joss would react, which he finds silly in hindsight. “You know, we have two-spirit people in the indigenous community,” he remembers Joss telling him, and that was the end of it. “There was no hesitation,” Kern de Gonzales says. “I didn't feel like I had to be anything other than myself.”


	Joss, however, had struggled with defining his own orientation. “It took him a long time to figure out and just come to terms with who he was,” Kern de Gonzales says. Only recently, in the last few years, did Joss begin to embrace his true sexuality. Yet he also told his future husband about performing in drag shows many years before they'd met. They bonded over their shared love of Tina Turner songs. Joss told him he'd worked in gay bars. “He had always been around the community,” Kern de Gonzales says in his steady Southern drawl. “It just took a little bit, I think, for him to find a label and then find acceptance.” Once he did, though, he was very open about it. “Having a faithful spouse who stands by you 100% is worth more than all the money in the world,” Joss posted on May 3. “Never have to worry about where he is and he builds me up. We can handle anything together.”


	When Kern de Gonzales moved in with Joss, though, he immediately got a front-row seat to the conflict that, in the days following Joss' shooting, would be described in local and national news reports. KSAT, the local ABC affiliate, detailed 66 visits to Joss' home between September 2023 and his death, along with a more specific breakdown: 13 “disturbance neighbor” calls; 10 mental health calls; four wellness checks; and numerous conflicts with Ceja Alvarez, his shooter, in particular. In an interview with the San Antonio Express-News, one neighbor claimed he never heard homophobic insults hurled toward Joss. Long also doesn't remember hearing anything homophobic when he saw Joss fighting with his neighbors, although he admits most of the flare-ups he saw took place before Joss and Kern de Gonzales were together. Kern de Gonzales, however, describes an atmosphere of rampant harassment of all kinds, including frequent homophobia. He views Joss as a victim of neighbors who tormented him for being different and a local law enforcement apparatus that did nothing to help him. In a statement to Rolling Stone, the San Antonio Police Department's Public Information Office defended its response. “SAPD officers responded to more than 70 calls for service at Joss' address,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “Additionally, the [San Antonio Fear Free Environment] officer assigned to the neighborhood maintained regular contact with both Joss and his neighbors for over a year. The SAPD Mental Health Unit was also engaged and provided additional resources and support.” 

	











	But those interventions were hollow, Kern de Gonzales argues. All show, no substance. “Jonathan would be trying to report through the proper channels,” he says, “but a lot of it was just dismissed because it was easier for them to say, ‘Oh, you're just high. You're just hearing things.” Joss was begging to be heard, in other words — but no one was listening to what he had to say. 


	Then came the house fire, and a video that circulated in its aftermath. The video was filmed that same day in January, when local news trucks showed up to ask about the blaze. At first, Joss blamed himself. He admitted to burning mesquite wood indoors — not in a fireplace — for warmth that morning. “It was my mistake,” he said. “We checked the fire, and we thought there was no fire burning, but evidently there was.” Case closed, argue his critics: He burned down his own house. He said so right there. 


	Yet the rest of the clip was framed around his ongoing feud with his neighbors. And at one point, he did hint at threats of arson. “I've already had neighbors tell me to leave. [That] they're gonna burn my house down. Call me a fag,” he said. “All these different things.” 


	The official investigation, a spokesman for the San Antonio fire department tells Rolling Stone, has been closed. He wouldn't reveal the specific findings, but referred to the aforementioned video. While no criminal charges were filed, it marked the first in a series of bizarre headlines for Joss in the months leading up to his death. 


	THE COUPLE HAD PLANNED TO LEAVE San Antonio, Kern de Gonzales says. They just needed to pick up a check from a charity for fire victims from Joss' mailbox, which is why they were there on the evening of the shooting. They were going to use the money to buy a teardrop trailer and drive around the country. “I really try hard not to think about how close we got [to leaving],” Kern de Gonzales says. He finds some comfort in Joss' rich legacy, including a “historical Western horror” graphic novel that is set to be published posthumously next year in June, for Pride Month. But those final days do linger. 


	On May 30, two days before the shooting, the couple visited Austin, where a King of the Hill reboot panel was scheduled featuring Mike Judge, the show's co-creator and star, as well as five other major figures — including main-character voice actors, its co-creator, and the revival's showrunner. Many other prominent cast members weren't invited, but Joss felt uniquely left out. “That character, that voice, that story…they were my home, my pride, my connection to something bigger than myself,” he wrote in an April 21 Facebook post. “To not be invited felt like being shut out of a place I helped build.” 

	











	So he showed up anyway. About 37 minutes in, he commandeered an audience mic long before the scheduled Q&A had begun. He started with a tribute to Johnny Hardwick, the voice of Dale Gribble, who died of undetermined causes in 2023. But from there, his speech was difficult to follow. He pivoted to the interruption itself: “I see a mic, I use it,” he said. “I see a wrong, I make it right. I want to breathe.” He repeated his claim that his neighbors burned his house down “because I'm gay.” He quoted one of John Redcorn's most famous songs from the show, “There's a Hole in My Pocket Where My Money Should Go,” to reference his own dire financial situation. In a play-by-play account of what happened written for Variety, the panel's moderator later called it “jarring for everyone.”


	The next night, at a marijuana-themed venue called the Green Room, Joss appeared on a King of the Hill-themed podcast hosted by a pair of superfans. He explained the panel outburst stemmed from feeling disrespected on behalf of his character, who had come to define him — from his band to his spices to his fame. “When the only thing in my life — other than my husband — I got because somebody else lost their life,” he said, “I kind of owed it to myself to make an asshole out of myself.” Later, the subject turned to his ongoing neighborhood feud. To investigators refusing to “rule out” arson. And to a dark bit of sarcasm. “I would never hurt my dogs. I would never light my dogs on fire,” he said, following up with an apparent joke: “That's why I shot the little fuckers. And then I burned the house.” One host asked Joss whether he was sober. “No. No. Man, I've already lost everything. My house burned down. I ain't gonna give up drugs,” he said. “I ain't gonna give up drinkin'. They're my friends.” The other host remained silent throughout, later explaining in YouTube comments that he was “just watching and soaking it in.” His empathy for addicts, and for Joss' obvious pain, left him “at a loss for words.”


	The next day, Joss would be dead. His shooter, Ceja Alvarez, would claim self defense and deny allegations of homophobia, and his relative would tell the San Antonio Express-News that no one in the family had made homophobic comments to Joss. Ceja Alvarez's lawyer didn't respond to Rolling Stone's multiple requests for comment, but he did speak with KSAT on June 24, arguing that the shooting “has nothing to do with sexual orientation” and that “people in Texas have a right not to be a victim.” His client, he said, had a right to self-defense, and said that “other people know the real truth about the circumstances and the often dangerous behavior” of Joss.

	











	Kern de Gonzales, following his initial statement, has continued to insist the shooting was motivated by bigotry. And while San Antonio police at first rejected the hate-crime allegations, they later walked back that statement, saying it was still too soon to tell. 


	That night at the Green Room also marked Joss' final performance. With Rios backing him on guitar, he belted out “There's a Hole in My Pocket Where My Money Should Go” to several dozen people. “We couldn't leave without playing that,” says Rios. “There's a hole in my heart where he used to go.”

	Rios also has a video from that night. It shows Joss stomping, grunting, chanting, and shuffling across a stage in cowboy boots and a form-fitting white vest. Without additional context, the video is baffling. But Kern de Gonzales was there, and he saw something beautiful. When Joss was on that stage, tortured as he was, he could be at peace in performance. In what he loved. And in the company of the fans who made it possible. “Everyone was really nice to him,” Kern de Gonzales says. “That's something that he really, really needed.” 


	These final glimpses of Jonathan Joss capture what makes his story so unsettling. We crave clear heroes and villains, but Joss embodied contradiction — bringing representation to underserved communities while battling demons; creating memorable characters while struggling to understand himself. His life defies the easy narratives of the internet, challenging us to recognize excellence without excusing behavior. To see humanity without ignoring responsibility. In the space between binary judgments, complicated people leave complicated legacies. And they shouldn't be remembered by choosing sides, but by embracing the messy reality — something Joss seems to have understood instinctively as he moved through life, always stomping away to a rhythm all his own.

	The much-hyped battle between Jelly Roll and Logan Paul finally hit the ring Saturday at WWE's SummerSlam event, where the country singer and tag team partner Randy Orton faced off against the social media provocateur and his partner Drew McIntyre. 


	The fight, which was set up over a month ago on Smackdown and was heavily promoted since then, marked Jelly Roll's first official match as a wrestler after making a handful of appearances at WWE events over the past year.


	Jelly Roll — who claimed he broke his pinky and suffered other injuries while training for the match — endured a significant amount of beating during the match; at one point, Jelly Roll was outside the ring, lying on an announcers table when Paul jumped from the top post and landed on the singer, causing the table to overturn. “The day the music died,” one of his opponents quipped.

	That aforementioned move knocked out Jelly Roll for a considerable amount of time as Orton fought against Paul and McIntyre alone. However, he recovered and made his way back to the ring “like the walking dead” in time to accept Orton's tag-in, and delivered some clotheslines and choke slams on Paul to even up the match.

	However, the match concluded when Paul dropped his signature move the “Paul from Grace” on Jelly Roll, who was then promptly pinned and defeated. The loss likely sets up WWE future involvement and an opportunity for revenge for Jelly Roll, but no plans have been announced as yet:

Donald Trump is looking to hire 10,000 officers to help carry out his administration's widespread detention and deportation of migrants with tens of billions of dollars in funds from his “Big Beautiful Bill.” 


	Job postings show that in 25 cities from coast to coast, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is hiring deportation officers who will arrest, detain, and deport migrants, and manage migrants' cases. The listings give insight into where ICE may be ramping up operations. 


	ICE has already been carrying out broad arrests, including at workplaces and courthouses. Agents have been wearing masks and lacking identifying information as they snatch immigrants, sometimes breaking their car windows to drag them out faster. 


	“Are you ready to defend the homeland?” the job posting reads. “Launch a dynamic and rewarding career as a Deportation Officer with Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) at ICE! Join a dedicated team safeguarding U.S. borders and upholding immigration laws, playing a key role in defending our nation.”

	At a time when the U.S. job market is slowing down and prices remain high, ICE is offering $50,000 signing bonuses and $60,000 in student loan repayment with a salary of about $50,000 to $90,000. 


	The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has already issued 1,000 tentative job offers, the Associated Press reported Friday. A spokesperson for DHS said many of the people offered jobs were “ICE officers who retired under President Biden because they were frustrated that they were not allowed to do their jobs.” These retired officers are being offered $88,000 to $144,000 along with a $50,000 bonus.

	











	An image of Uncle Sam, the ultimate recruitment propaganda, appears on the DHS website with the words “RETURN TO MISSION.” 


	“Your country is calling you to serve at ICE. In the wake of the Biden administration's failed immigration policies, your country needs dedicated men and women of ICE to get the worst of the worst criminals out of our country,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said earlier this week. “This is a defining moment in our nation's history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.”

	ICE is hiring in Los Angeles, where Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to lead a militarized crackdown on protests against his immigration raids. 


	Major cities where ICE is hiring include Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. The agency is hiring in several large cities with large Latino populations including Dallas, Houston, Miami Beach, Phoenix, San Antonio, and San Diego. ICE is also hiring in Baltimore, New Orleans, Newark, Saint Paul, and Salt Lake City. 


	The agency is hiring in El Paso, a city on the Texas.-Mexico border where detentions are reportedly increasing. They are also looking to hire in Detroit and Buffalo, which are on the U.S.-Canada border. 


	ICE is looking to hire in Harlingen, a Texas border city. The deportation flights taking migrants to an El Salvador torture prison and war-torn South Sudan, both in defiance of judicial orders in cases that went to the Supreme Court, took off from Harlingen.


	DHS is hiring new criminal investigators, or special agents, at salaries of $63,000 to $102,000 with a bonus $50,000. Returning criminal investigators are being offered $105,000 to $171,000 per year, plus the $50,000 bonus. The department is hiring attorneys all over, at field locations in 90 cities.

	The jobs are being funded with tens of billions of dollars included in Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill,” the president's first major agenda legislation. The bill also slashes taxes for the wealthy and will force millions of Americans off Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled people. 


	“The funding from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill will play a key role in fulfilling his promise to the American people to deport criminal illegal aliens,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, Politico reported.

	











	“Getting 10,000 [new employees] means basically hiring the people who walk in the door because you're trying to hit your quota,” Josiah Heyman, an anthropology professor who directs the University of Texas at El Paso's Center of Inter-American and Border Studies, told The Los Angeles Times. “Rapid, mass-hiring lends itself to mistakes and cutting corners.”

	The Trump administration is also looking at increasing their use of the military in domestic immigration enforcement, The New Republic reported Saturday. A memo from Philip Hegseth, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's younger brother, calls on military leadership to “feel — for the first time — the urgency of the homeland defense mission” and work together with ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents. 


	“The memo is alarming, because it speaks to the intent to use the military within the United States at a level not seen since Japanese internment,” Carrie Lee, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, told The New Republic. “The military is the most powerful, coercive tool our country has. We don't want the military doing law enforcement. It absolutely undermines the rule of law.”

Flying saucers. The term evokes thoughts of government conspiracies, little green men, the X-Files, or maybe even Lost in Space. But do you remember the UFO craze that swept the country – and Sault Ste. Marie?

Mysterious disc-shaped objects have been seen in the sky since at least medieval times. However, they entered public consciousness in a big way on June 24, 1947, when pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen multiple saucer-shaped flying objects travelling through the sky in Washington State.

In the wake of this incident, public reports of flying saucer sightings spiked. On July 8, 1947 – the same day as the Roswell Army Air Field in New Mexico reported they had “come into the possession of a Flying Saucer” – the Sault Daily Star bemoaned the lack of local sightings. In an editorial, they jokingly claimed that “Algomans may be charged with having no pride in their district if no volunteer comes forward soon to report having spotted one of these ‘flying saucers.' Just about every other area on the continent can claim the distinction of a resident who saw one.”

As it turned out, the Star didn't have to wait long. On July 11, they reported that a Timmins man saw “a ring in the sky…. It was very clear and looked like a large smoke ring. It stayed together and appeared to be moving very fast.” The following day, reports emerged of another flying saucer sighting near Pine Island.

By July 22, a Sault Ste. Marie woman claimed to have seen a saucer in town: “I saw, whizzing by on edge at incredible speed over the north side of the city, travelling from east to west, a dark object resembling in shape and size a pie plate revolving at terrific speed. Its flight lasted only a few seconds. Then it disappeared in the west. About 30 seconds after it vanished, I heard a whizzing sound like a circular saw in motion.” Anticipating a skeptical response, she ended her description by clarifying, “I'm not weak-minded or weak-eyed and I swear on my honour that the above statement is true in every detail.”

By September, Hawk Junction got in on the excitement, with reports of a flying saucer resembling “a huge ball of fire” in the sky. Even the small community of Franz reported seeing an eerie object in the sky – although news reporters were quick to note this was likely an atmospheric phenomenon.

As the 1940s ended, so too did the spate of local flying saucer sightings. However, the lull was short-lived, and in 1952, news broke again of people seeing “bright shiny balls flashing across the sky, towing tiny white clouds.” This time, there was a clear answer: jets flying from a field in Michigan. However, it was the first in another trend of reported sightings: flying saucers in Thessalon, an “egg-shaped” craft over Bruce Mines, a silver craft over Wawa, and a glowing object over Pointe des Chenes. At least some were assumed to be weather balloons launched by the U.S. Weather Bureau, with the organization even warning that new balloons were likely to “bring a rash of flying saucer tales.”

As time went on, news reports had expanded beyond just describing odd objects in the sky; they also focused on the people researching them. In December 1957, the Sault Daily Star profiled Allan Coggon, who was in the process of building and refining his own telescope with the goal of spotting UFOs.

Coggon led a fascinating life beyond his celestial pursuits. In WWII, he served in the RCAF as a bomber pilot, and he was decorated for his service. He would remain an advocate for veterans throughout his life. Post-war, he continued to fly, working as a commercial and private pilot, which included setting up and leading Algoma Steel's air service. He wrote two books – one a memoir of his time in the war, and the other a military history book about the civilian air detection crews who defended possible targets, including the Sault Ste. Marie locks. The latter book even became the basis for a documentary by the War Amps.

Coggon also had a clear passion for the stars. The Sault Daily Star described how Coggan opted to build a reflecting telescope, grinding and polishing his own lenses, in a display of “exacting work” with “a tolerance of ten millionths of an inch.” The homemade instrument provided enough detail that he could make out the polar cap on Mars and, possibly, even a dust storm on the surface of the red planet. On a clear evening, Mr. and Mrs. Coggon would set up the telescope in the front yard and invite neighbours walking by to look at the sky.

While Coggon wouldn't answer one way or another whether he believed in aliens, he spent countless hours searching the night sky. And he told the Sault Daily Star that “[it wasn't his] intention to look at astral bodies.”

The Sault Daily Star also ran ads for organizations looking to bring like-minded extraterrestrial searchers together. In May 1960, the Dwarsault Observation Club was looking for members aged 17 to 20 to help fulfill its mandate: investigating reports of flying saucers. Interested parties were to fill out a form and return it to a Hudson Street address. The organization – which boasted an expert director, a typewriter, a planetarium, books, and “saucer materials” – would be in touch.

This organization was founded in 1959 by Norman Ouellette, who would also go on to become a Mormon missionary, an Algoma Genealogical Society spokesperson, and a watercolour artist. The group operated out of his basement and was known by various names, including the Flying Saucer Club and the Saucer Observation Club. Members hailing from both sides of the river would keep a “constant watch for unidentified flying objects over this area.” They would also track down and investigate any reports that came their way.

In an interview with the Sault Daily Star, Ouellette described how he was aware of “several objects [that] had been sighted over the Sault for which no logical explanation could be given.” Ouellette had considered the possibility of weather balloons, military operations, and more, none of which were validated by officials. He also highlighted the importance of research, saying that the club took care to make sure reported incidents were legitimate and not a hoax.

By June 1960, membership opened to a wider audience: “The Soo's own Flying Saucer Club is now taking older people for better opinions and investigating,” read one classified ad.

Around the same time, a woman looked at the sky above Sault Ste. Marie and caught sight of a formation of six jets. She ran inside to get her camera and returned to see a small silver object in the sky, moving faster than the jets. After it disappeared came “a noise like a plane breaking the sound barrier.” Later in the day, local news would report that a “shock wave” had been caused by US Air Force planes flying in the area.

However, she couldn't shake the thought of the smaller, silver craft – which, as it turns out, was briefly visible in the footage she recorded: approximately one and a half seconds of it flying into view, turning around, and leaving as if pushed by rays of light. She contacted the Flying Saucer Club, which took her report very seriously: “They told me not to tell anyone else and that they'd take care of it.” However, short of sharing the footage with other flying saucer clubs in Southern Ontario, she wasn't sure what the club had done with it.

She contacted the Sault Daily Star in May 1961, showing the footage to a reporter. The reporter, in turn, attempted to get broader attention for the video. The RCAF declared flying saucers non-existent and wasn't interested in pursuing them, and a weekly magazine wasn't interested in picking up the story either. However, the Kincheloe Air Force Base was interested and arranged for a meeting. In attendance were the woman who recorded it, her husband, the base commander, a Pentagon official, and more. None of them had an explanation for what appeared to be a flying saucer.

Somewhat excited, the officials forwarded the video to Washington for further evaluation. The woman was told to be prepared to go in for more questioning, either by the Canadian or the American governments.

Norman Ouellette of the Flying Saucer Club wrote to the Sault Star to defend his club's role in the matter, stating that he did not forward the footage on to government officials because “they had been sent such films before, and never returned.”

And as for the footage in question, it's not clear what became of it once it was sent to Washington for evaluation.

Over the years, there continued to be sightings of UFOs and flying saucers in the area, although with less excitement and fanfare than during the 1940s through the early 60s. However, people continue to watch the skies – for known and unknown objects – in a testament to our fascination with the universe beyond the confines of our planet.

A video has gone viral with the claim that a UFO was spotted over Dallas, Texas. DramaAlert shared the video on X, captioning it, “SQUID SHAPED UFO SPOTTED OVER DALLAS, TEXAS.”

Take a look:

In the comment section, many speculated that the footage is not real and is AI-generated. Some said it might be something else, and not a UFO. HindustanTimes.com could not independently verify the incident.

“Bro that was my drone malfunctioned,” one user joked. “Weird. They don't sell that kind of fireworks in Texas,” wrote one user, while another said, “Ai af”.

“Looks fake af,” one user said, while another wrote, “The government is trolling us”. “Since no one seems to be explaining this I will, It's called the ""Jelly fish / Twilight effect"" during a rocket launch,” claimed a user.

A list compiled by tracker revealed that Houston has had the most UFO sightings in Texas history. Since 1995, Houston has recorded as many as 435 UFO sightings. Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and El Paso are other Texas locations with high UFO sightings.

Stacker opened up about America's ""alien obsession,"" and about compiling the information to find out the top ten places in each state with the highest UFO sightings. It said, ""Stacker compiled a ranking of cities with the most UFO sightings in Florida using data from the National UFO Reporting Center. Data encompasses all reports of UFO sightings dating back to 1995. Sightings with locations listed across multiple cities were not included in this analysis. For now, the U.S. government's official stance is that extraterrestrial life does not exist. But if the last century is any indicator, that will do little to curb America's alien obsession.""

Stacker explained, “UAP and UFO sightings in the U.S. are particularly concentrated in the West, partially because of the abundance of dark sky locations, where it's easier to spot objects with less light pollution. Those who believe they've seen something otherworldly can report it to the National UFO Reporting Center, which relies on volunteers to separate fact from fiction.”

In the last few years, alien-related news and its sightings have become an everyday thing in Texas, US. However, some claims have been proven out as ""false"" as they were just some phenomena or weird clouds

A video has been making the rounds on the internet, claiming that a UFO was spotted over Dallas, Texas. Social media accounts on X shared videos, saying, ""squid-shaped UFO"" spotted over Texas.

“SQUID SHAPED UFO SPOTTED OVER DALLAS, TEXAS,"" DramaAlert shared the video with this caption.

People started asking Grok in the comment section, asking, ""Grok, is this footage real?"" Another asked, ""Why are aliens only in the USA?""

One of the users joked, ""It's just the interdimensional imp from Superman"". Another believed it to be true, writing, ""Looks real"".

One user even asked, ""Why is it only over the US when they're spotted?"" Some people also shared funny GIFs in the comment section, making fun of the news as they claimed it was an AI-generated video.

Last month, the internet went crazy after a video of what looked to be ""UFO sending down a giant beam"" was shared on social media. Some people claimed that it was simply a tall electric pole, while others said that the people recording would have known if it was a pole, as the sighting happened just near their home.

In the last few years, alien-related news and its sightings have become an everyday thing in Texas, US. However, some claims have been proven out as ""false"" as they were just some phenomena or weird clouds.

In June, another UFO was sighted, as claimed by the netizens. “A video posted on June 9th out of Dallas, Texas, in the United States, shows a group of neighbors witnessing what appears to be a UFO sending down a giant beam of light, casting chaos and excitement around the group,” according to a viral video post.

According to some reports, Houston has had the most UFO sightings in Texas history. Since 1995, Houston has recorded around 435 UFO sightings. Moreover, apart from Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and El Paso have also spotted UFOs.","{'href': 'https://www.wionews.com', 'title': 'WION'}","other"

A groundbreaking preprint paper, released just days ago by researchers Dr. Stephen Bruehl and Dr. Beatriz Villarroel, adds compelling new evidence to the long-standing correlation between unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and nuclear activities.

Titled “Some Transients in the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS-I) May Be Associated with Above-Ground Nuclear Testing and Reports of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena,” the study analyzed thousands of mysterious “transient” star-like objects (brief, unexplained flashes of light) captured in astronomical photographic plates from 1949 to 1957, before the era of artificial satellites, like Sputnik (1957). Using a comprehensive dataset spanning over 2,700 days, the authors found a statistically significant association between these transients and above-ground nuclear weapons tests, with such events 45% more likely to occur within one day before or after a detonation.

Drs. Bruehl and Villarroel speculate that these transients may result from atmospheric effects linked to fallout, but they also proffer the possibility that UAP are drawn to nuclear detonations. Indeed, there is documentation spanning decades indicating UAP incursions around nuclear assets, a pattern I've explored in previous columns.

From the dawn of the Atomic Age, evidence suggests that UAP have shown an uncanny interest in our nuclear capabilities, from production and stockpiling to deployment and testing. Recall the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU) research I highlighted last year, which meticulously charted UAP activity from 1945 to 1975. The activity aligned with key milestones in U.S. atomic warfare development; bursts of UAP sightings spiked at sites like missile complexes and warhead facilities, evolving as our technology advanced from radioactive materials handling to Strategic Air Command bomber bases and emerging ICBM sites. Disc-shaped craft exhibited impossible maneuvers, speeds over 9,000 mph, instantaneous accelerations, and sharp turns, focusing first on development hubs, then shifting to the newest missile deployments, and ignoring outdated ones.

Consider the 1967 Malmstrom Air Force Base incident, where a UAP reportedly disabled nuclear-tipped ICBMs while officer Robert Salas was on duty. And the 1982 Soviet Ukraine case, where nuclear missiles inexplicably entered launch countdown for 15 harrowing seconds before returning to standby, and more recent reports, like UAP lights over India's Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in the summer of 2023. These aren't isolated anomalies, but instead they seem to be part of a systematic scrutiny that defies explanations like foreign adversaries or misidentified objects. China's first nuclear test was in 1964 and the Soviet Union's was in 1949.  Both postdate early waves of UAP sightings, and these countries' ICBM capabilities lagged even further, making it implausible that their militaries surveilled U.S. assets with impunity in the 1940s and 1950s.

At the 2022 UAP congressional hearing, convened by the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence, and Counterproliferation of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, officials like Ronald S. Moultrie, who was then serving as undersecretary of defense for Intelligence and Security and Scott W. Bray, then deputy director of Naval Intelligence, appear to have feigned ignorance about the Malmstrom incident, passing the buck despite promises to investigate.

Three years later, despite mounting evidence of a connection between UAP and nuclear assets, the Pentagon continues to obfuscate. For example, they've issued recent statements and articles that dismiss reports of UAP around nuclear assets as calculated attempts by military personnel to hide top-secret weapons programs. In a June 6, 2025, Wall Street Journal article titled “The Pentagon Disinformation That Fueled America's UFO Mythology,” former All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) Director Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick is heavily featured. He claims the U.S. military fabricated UFO evidence and allowed rumors to fester to conceal real secret-weapons programs, including stealth aircraft.

Kirkpatrick and the article reframe incidents like Malmstrom as Cold War-era electromagnetic pulse (EMP) tests or pranks. But that deflection collapses under scrutiny. EMP effects are typically irreversible, destroying circuitry, not temporarily deactivating it. The 1962 Starfish Prime test proved that. Yet at Malmstrom, the missiles returned to full functionality shortly after the disruption. Kirkpatrick's and the WSJ's assertions also conveniently omit international parallels, like the Soviet incident and the SCU's peer-reviewed studies showing targeted surveillance patterns incompatible with U.S. tests on live nuclear systems during peak tensions.

Echoing his former boss, former AARO Deputy Director Tim Phillips, in a July 2, 2025, interview on John Michael Godier's ""Event Horizon"" podcast, denied any evidence of UAP activity during Malmstrom's missile shutdown, despite Blue Book files documenting “numerous” UFO sightings that night, including a landed “huge dome-shaped object.”

AARO's more general statements, including their March 2024 historical report and recent briefings, reinforce this narrative: UAP are often “misidentified authentic, highly sensitive national security programs that are not related to extraterrestrial technology exploitation.” AARO also denied the existence of hidden UAP crash retrievals and reverse engineering programs. And the DoD has echoed this in outlets like the New York Post and LiveNOW from Fox News, admitting to planting UFO myths around Area 51 to hide weapons programs.

These claims surfaced amid the Bruehl-Villarroel findings and just before the public release of AARO's Historical Record Part II report, suggesting a coordinated disinformation campaign. According to congressional staff I've met with, AARO has already delivered Part II of its Historical Record report to Congress, yet remains classified. The deception mirrors Project Mockingbird tactics: infiltration of media to launder narratives, stigmatization of whistleblowers and perpetuation of ambiguity. The Pentagon dismisses decades of data, international cases and astronomical correlations as folklore or hazing, while downplaying threats like reversible missile interference that no known EMP or secret program can explain.

What is the Department of Defense hiding?

It's time for Congress to act, conduct more public hearings, launch a formal investigation into DoD disinformation, and ensure true transparency. The American people have a right to know.

Stephen Hawking's chilling extraterrestrial life warnings have resurfaced amid 'intelligence trap' studies and interstellar object alarm bells being rung by esteemed Harvard researchers.

British cosmologist and former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, Stephen Hawking, is one of history's greatest minds.

Before his death in 2018, the revered scientist strongly opposed the idea of contacting aliens to draw them to our planet, as he issued an eerie warning about life among the stars. 

Hawking's opinions have reentered rhetoric after an international team of researchers began studying a so-called 'intelligence trap.'

This concept suggests that successfully contacting a UFO could draw the attention of a malevolent species that destroys humanity, as per the Daily Mail.

The study comes amid Harvard University researchers who claimed a so-called giant comet named 31/ATLAS could potentially be an alien probe.

Professor Avi Loeb and other scientists alleged there are signs that the interstellar object has been artificially created, including its extremely unusual course that will make close passes by three planets: Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.

Back in 2004, Hawking issued a warning about alien life. 

“The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us,” Hawking warned. 

“The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy, and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low.”

The famed theoretical physicist said something extremely similar amid a 2010 episode of Into the Universe.

He told docuseries viewers: “If aliens ever visit us, the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.”

Despite strongly opposing the idea of actively sending messages into space, alerting potential off-world beings of our presence in the universe, Hawking was a passionate advocate for more passive intelligent life searches.

He previously supported projects like Breakthrough Listen - the astronomy project aimed at finding evidence of civilizations beyond Earth.

“We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,” he warned.

31/ATLAS is expected to pass within 223 million miles of Earth later this year.

If the comet does turn out to be aliens, then ‘two possibilities' will follow. 

“First, that its intentions are entirely benign and second, they are malign,"" researchers said. 

Advert

Of course, the comet could still just be a comet. But some conspiracy theorists are convinced it could be aliens after hearing Baba Vanga's reported prediction.

The Bulgarian mystic, who died in 1996, is alleged to have left a realm of prophecies for each year, including the idea that aliens would successfully contact the Earth during a ‘major sporting event'.

There are a handful of stellar sports outings lined up for the rest of the year, including a handful of F1 races, the Women's Rugby World Cup, and the WTA/ATP finals in Riyadh and Turin, respectively.

So, more than enough time for extraterrestrial beings to get in touch.

But like Hawking says, aliens knowing of our existence may not be a good thing.

While global fascination with UFOs and alien life continues to surge, famed physicist Stephen Hawking long urged caution, arguing that humanity's eagerness to make contact with extraterrestrial civilizations might be a grave mistake.

In the years leading up to his death in 2018, Hawking repeatedly warned that any deliberate attempt to reach out to alien life, especially civilizations potentially far more advanced than ours, could endanger the future of humanity. His fear: that rather than greeting us with curiosity or benevolence, a highly intelligent alien species might see Earth as a planet ripe for exploitation.

“If aliens ever visit us,” Hawking said in a 2010 episode of Into the Universe, “the outcome might be similar to when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans.”

According to Hawking, it's a mistake to assume advanced civilizations would automatically be peaceful. If anything, the historical record of human behavior, especially when powerful societies encounter less developed ones, suggests conquest, colonization, or indifference to suffering are just as likely as diplomacy.

Hawking believed alien civilizations capable of interstellar travel would likely have exhausted their own planet's resources, prompting them to roam the galaxy in search of new worlds to inhabit or strip for materials. In such a scenario, Earth could be seen as a habitable target rather than a partner.

Despite being a passionate advocate for the search for intelligent life beyond Earth, Hawking drew a sharp line between listening and reaching out. While projects like Breakthrough Listen, which Hawking supported, aim to detect alien signals, other efforts such as Breakthrough Message and METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) propose actively sending messages into space to alert other civilizations to our presence.

Hawking firmly opposed these efforts. In his view, passive observation made scientific sense, but advertising our location to unknown cosmic neighbors was dangerously naive. “We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldn't want to meet,” he warned.



The warning resurfaced recently amid renewed public and political interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs, the military term for UFOs).

The U.S. government has declassified multiple military encounters with unknown flying objects, and congressional hearings have drawn attention to whistleblower claims about potential non-human intelligence.

While many scientists remain skeptical of these sightings being extraterrestrial, the public imagination has reignited, and so has interest in Hawking's perspective.

Critics of active messaging argue that we have no idea what alien ethics, goals, or behaviors might be. Even if intelligent aliens were aware of Earth, announcing ourselves might trigger a reaction, good or bad, that we're not prepared to handle.

Hawking was not alone in this concern. Figures such as physicist Michio Kaku and SETI pioneer Frank Drake have expressed mixed feelings about interstellar messaging.

The late Carl Sagan, while more optimistic, also emphasized caution, noting the unpredictability of alien psychology.

Despite these warnings, some scientists argue that staying silent is impractical or even counterproductive. Earth has been leaking radio waves into space for over a century, meaning that technologically advanced civilizations could already know we exist.

From that view, deliberate messaging may make little difference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","How 'Supernatural' Carries on Through Its Massive, Dedicated Fanbase at Creation Entertainment Conventions","https://www.tvinsider.com/1203855/supernatural-fans-creation-entertainment-conventions/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:00:36 GMT","

Ask any former Supernatural actor their reaction when they heard their character was being killed off, and they generally answer with a smile: “No one really dies on Supernatural.” And neither, it seems, does the show, which has managed to survive long after the final monster-hunting episode aired on November 19, 2020. The 15 seasons live on through syndication, streaming and, of course, in the hearts of millions of fans.

Indeed, the series continues to find new life from a growing fanbase. With all 327 episodes available on Netflix, a younger generation has been discovering the show. Their allegiance is apparent in the impressive numbers of fans faithfully attending Supernatural conventions across the country and abroad — including Australia, Germany, and the U.K. — where they get to meet the stars, shop for signed photographs from the cast, buy merch and, most meaningfully to many, line up for a personal photo with their favorites. Other perks have included group karaoke, mini golf with cast members, and rocking out on Saturday nights with Louden Swain, a band fronted by God (a.k.a. actor Rob Benedict) and a revolving roster of the show's former castmates.

All this fun does not come cheap. At Creation Entertainment's May 16-18, 2025, convention “The Road So Far…The Road Ahead: Celebrating 20 Years of SPN” in Secaucus, New Jersey, visited by TV Guide Magazine, fans were delighted to spend roughly $1,000 to secure a gold pass that covered all three days and admission to every event, including a special VIP Q&A with Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, who played beloved brothers Sam and Dean Winchester.

Other popular genre shows like Doctor Who, Star Trek, and The Walking Dead draw crowds to conventions with attendees often paying tribute with elaborate cosplay. For Supernatural, though, it's not about imitation but about feeling part of the SPN family, as fans call themselves. “That face-to-face interaction has created more reciprocal relationships than any other fandom enjoys,” says Lynn Zubernis, a psychologist and university professor who has edited several books on the show's appeal.

The faithful form strong bonds with Sam and Dean, whose brotherly ties are never broken (except maybe when one of them is demon-possessed), as well as with the siblings' powerful angel ally Castiel (Misha Collins). “New fans discover the show and are drawn in by the intensity of those relationships, their complexity and the courage of the actors to show a great deal of emotionality and vulnerability onscreen,” says Zubernis.

As I spoke with fans from across the country at the convention, another emotional tie to the show became clear: the close friends they met through their shared love for the series. SPN convention royalty undoubtedly seems to be North Dakotan Andrea Hurtt, who has been to 93 of the gatherings. After attending several cons 10 years earlier, she closed her clothing store and began making “support pillows” modeled after the show's characters and selling the merch at the cons. “It gets very emotional here,” she explains, “and I help a lot of people with a tangible memory of meeting their heroes.” She says she's raised $250,000 for charity through the pillows.

Family legacy is also common at the cons. I met a father and his 13-year-old daughter from Connecticut who was happily going through her Supernatural goody bag. Her dad began watching the show before she was born, he said, and couldn't wait for her to be old enough so they could binge it together. It was their second time at the New Jersey convention. “It's like a little community here,” he says.

Alabama's Stephanie Gentry was another legacy fan. “Supernatural was my dad's favorite show,” she says. “When he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, we got him passes to a con, but he passed away three weeks before the event.” Despite her pain, her mom urged her to go; she did and has since kept coming back. “I feel like my dad led me to having all these new friends,” she says. “I've done 14 conventions because I love the show, the cast and all my friends here.”

Fans and actors alike would be thrilled to see a new limited series or a movie, which Ackles and Padalecki have publicly mused about, especially since Netflix will drop Supernatural in December after their five-year contract ends. Whether there are any original episodes in the future or a new bingeing life on another streamer, it's safe to say that the fans — and the dedicated cast —  will carry on.

            TikTok this week removed an inflammatory anti-Israel video posted by celebrity beauty mogul and influencer Huda Kattan.
    


            Kattan, the founder and face of the billion-dollar brand Huda Beauty, shared a video to her more than 11 million followers on TikTok, accusing Israel of orchestrating World War I, World War II, the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7.
    


            World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) both occurred before the State of Israel was established in 1948.
    


            “All of the conspiracy theories coming out and a lot of evidence behind them — that Israel has been behind World War I, World War II, September 11, October 7 — they allowed all of this stuff to happen. Is this crazy?” Kattan said on camera in her since-removed TikTok post, which included other unfounded claims about Israel. “Like, I had a feeling — I was like, ‘Are they behind every world war?' Yes.”
    


            A representative for TikTok confirmed to CNN that it removed Kattan's video for violating its community guidelines.
    


            “In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” TikTok's community guidelines state. “We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.”
    


            Kattan's agency did not respond to CNN's request for comment. A manager listed on public databases as a representative for Kattan was contacted by CNN and said in an email that they no longer represent her.
    


            Kattan's video has spurred calls across social media and among Jewish groups for retailers like Sephora to cut ties with her popular beauty brand, Huda Beauty, which was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017 and brings in roughly $200 million in annual sales, according to Forbes.
    


            A representative for Sephora has not responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            This is not the first time the beauty influencer has faced calls for boycotts due to her public commentary after October 7. Kattan, whose company has over 57 million followers on Instagram, has been an outspoken critic of Israel and a staunch supporter of Palestinians in Gaza.
    


            Within a week of Hamas attacking Israel on October 7, 2023, an Israeli Instagram user threatened to boycott her products, to which Kattan replied: “I don't want blood money.” In response to that comment, a Change.org petition was launched and received over 30,000 signatures, calling on Sephora to remove Huda Beauty products from its stores.
    


            Kattan's most recent TikTok video drew swift backlash from Jewish groups.
    


            “Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.”
    


            The American Jewish Committee posted Kattan's since-removed TikTok video on social media, writing, “Huda Kattan, founder of Huda Beauty, is using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories — accusing Jews of harvesting the organs of Palestinians, causing 9/11, and running global pedophile rings. This isn't ‘criticism of Israel.' It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions.”
    


            “Retailers have a choice,” said Ari Hoffnung, managing director of the Jewish nonprofit, JLens. “They can continue to platform a brand whose founder promotes hate-fueled conspiracy theories, or they can take a stand against antisemitism.”
    


            Forbes included Kattan on their 2023 list of America's Richest Self-Made Women and on their list of Most Powerful Women in Business in 2024.

TikTok has removed a contentious anti-Israel video that was posted by influencer and famous beauty mogul Huda Kattan.

In a video shared with her over 11 million TikTok followers, Kattan, the creator and spokesperson for the billion-dollar company Huda Beauty, accused Israel of masterminding the September 11 terrorist attacks, World War I, World War II, and the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

Notably, both World Wars I (1914–1918) and II (1939–1945) took place prior to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

“All of the conspiracy theories coming out and a lot of evidence behind them — that Israel has been behind World War I, World War II, September 11, October 7 — they allowed all of this stuff to happen. Is this crazy?” Kattan stated on camera. “Like, I had a feeling — I was like, ‘Are they behind every world war?' Yes.”

Speaking to CNN, TikTok spokesman confirmed that they pulled Kattan's video for breaking its community rules, a spokesman confirmed to CNN.

“In a global community, it is natural for people to have different opinions, but we seek to operate on a shared set of facts and reality,” as per TikTok community rules.

“We do not allow misinformation that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent.”

The video has sparked calls on social media and among Jewish communities for Sephora and other retailers to sever the association with Kattan's well-known cosmetics business, Huda cosmetics, which Forbes estimates generates about $200 million in sales annually and was valued at $1.2 billion in 2017.

Kattan has previously been the target of boycott calls over her anti-Israel remarks after Hamas October 7 attack. She has been a vocal opponent of Israel and a strong advocate for Palestinians in Gaza.

The latest TikTok video that Kattan posted sparked immediate criticism from Jewish organizations.

“Huda Kattan built a brand around beauty — but these antisemitic conspiracy theories are nothing short of ugly hate,” Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League. “Spreading vile myths about Jews to millions of followers isn't just reckless — it's dangerous.”

The American Jewish Committee shared her video, saying that she “is using her massive platform to spread vile antisemitic conspiracy theories.”

“This isn't ‘criticism of Israel.' It's centuries-old hate, repackaged and broadcast to millions,” the Committee added.

Kattan appeared in Forbes's 2023 and 2024 lists of America's Richest Self-Made Women and Most Powerful Women in Business, respectively.

      Recently I have been reflecting on the strange emergence of whistleblower Matthew Brown. These people like MB that come forward almost always have one flaw in common: they share some information, often plausible, but invariably they go too far. To me it is this last step that makes them untrustworthy. This is exactly what MB did. In his three-part interview with Corbell and Knapp, he initially seemed credible, and he shared some seemingly significant information. If he would have just stopped there, I might have a completely different opinion of him. But as usual in UFO world, he didn't stop there:
    


      ""I think humanity to some level is a resource (for NHI), possibly a commodity, possibly a form of entertainment.""
    


      ""They (NHI) are just as powerful as we think, but also less."" Bro what???



      ""We live in a dream, a carefully constructed reality."" 
    


      ""You are not free. And this reality, has far more to it than you have been allowed to believe. And God is real.""
    


      At this point in time, he was only Whack Job adjacent. Shortly thereafter though he went full Whack Job on social media. Others here have done a good job breaking down (his breakdown). Which brings us to the Whack Job Quandary. Why do they all do this? Is this disinformation? Are they all unstable attention seekers? Is it performative? Are they compulsive liars? Is this untreated mental illness? How are we supposed to take Matthew Brown seriously after this? He has completely undermined his own credibility and appears to be a total Whack Job.

Lando Norris made it three wins from his last four races on Sunday with a hard-fought victory in the Hungarian Grand Prix.
    


            Despite a disastrous start which saw him slip from third to fifth in the opening seconds, the McLaren driver benefited from an improvised strategy to pit just once and managed to hold on to the lead despite a late challenge from teammate Oscar Piastri.
    


            The Australian driver started and finished in second, meaning he is now just nine points ahead of Norris in the drivers' world championship.
    


            “That was tough, we weren't really planning on the one stop at the beginning but after the first lap that was our only option to get back into things,” Norris told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward.
    


            “The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat out, it's rewarding even more because of that, the perfect result today.”
    


            Charles Leclerc began in pole position courtesy of a brilliant final lap in qualifying, but endured a difficult race and has now won just one of the last 16 races in which he has started at the front of the grid.
    


            He finished in fourth after being overtaken late on by George Russell, who claimed his first podium finish since he won the Canadian Grand Prix in June.

            For the first half of the race, Leclerc looked in total control. But during lap 29, cracks began to show as the Monégasque driver signaled to his team that something they had discussed before the race was affecting his car. He told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward that there had been an issue with the car's chassis.
    


            By the time he pitted on lap 40, Leclerc came out behind Norris and could not challenge the English driver.
    


            Suddenly, it was Piastri who looked most likely to catch Norris, especially after lap 51 when – on fresher tires – the Australian caught Leclerc and breezed past him at the first opportunity.
    


            “This is so incredibly frustrating. We've lost all competitiveness,” said Leclerc on the team radio. “Now it's just undriveable, undriveable. It's a miracle if we finish on the podium.”
    


            With just under 20 laps remaining, Piastri used his better tires to make up the 8.5-second gap on Norris, but could not quite pass him despite a thrilling attempt at an overtake on turn one with two laps to go.
    


            A seventh McLaren one-two of the season ensured a 200th grand prix victory for the team. No team has more than the 13 victories that McLaren has managed at Hungaroring.
    


            “I pushed as hard as I could,” Piastri told broadcaster Sky Sports afterward. “After I saw Lando go for a one (stop), I knew I was going to have to overtake on track which is much easier said than done here.
    


            “It was a gamble either way. Today, unfortunately, we were just on the wrong side of it.”
    


            Elsewhere, Fernando Alonso finished in fifth, one place ahead of Gabriel Bortoleto, who achieved the best finish of his rookie season.
    


            Max Verstappen, who was racing for Red Bull for the 200th time and confirmed this week that he was staying with the team, finished in ninth.
    


            Lewis Hamilton's disappointing weekend did not see any improvement. A day after he called himself “useless” and suggested Ferrari should drop him, the British driver, who has eight wins on this track, finished in 12th.

Former Fox News host boosted lies that Trump lost 2020 election because of electoral fraud

The US Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro – a former Fox News host and staunch Donald Trump ally who boosted lies that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of electoral fraudsters – as the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital.

Pirro – a former New York state district attorney and county judge who joined Fox News in 2011 – was confirmed on Saturday in a 50-45 vote along party lines.

In a statement issued by Pirro after the vote, the Republican said she was “blessed” to have been confirmed as the US attorney for Washington DC. “Get ready for a real crime fighter,” said Pirro's statement, which called the US attorney's office she had been confirmed to lead the largest in the country.

Before her media career, Pirro spent over a decade as a Republican district attorney in Westchester county, New York, and also served as a county judge.

She hosted her own Fox show Justice with Judge Jeanine. And more recently, she became a co-host on the Fox show The Five.

Pirro used her time at Fox News in part to publicly support the baseless claims that Trump lost his first presidency to Joe Biden in 2020 because of voter fraud. In 2021, she was among several Fox News hosts named in the defamation lawsuit against Fox News by Dominion Voting Systems, which accused the network of knowingly airing false claims about the company's voting machines after the previous year's election.

Fox ultimately settled the lawsuit for $787.5m and has acknowledged that the fraud claims were false.

Pirro has been serving as the interim US attorney since May, when her fellow Republican Trump nominated her to the post months into his second presidency. She was nominated after Trump withdrew the nomination of conservative activist Ed Martin, his first choice for the role. A key Republican senator, North Carolina's Thom Tillis, had said he would not support Martin's nomination.

In announcing Pirro's nomination in May, Trump praised her record, and said that she was a “powerful crusader for victims of crime” and someone who “excelled in all ways”.

“Jeanine is incredibly well qualified for this position,” the president added.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, on Saturday published a statement exalting Pirro as “a warrior for law and order”.

At the end of his first presidency, Trump pardoned Pirro's former husband, Albert Pirro Jr, after he had been convicted in 2000 on federal charges of fraud and tax evasion.

Pirro is one of a number of Trump loyalists with ties to Fox who have joined the president's administration. Other prominent ones include her fellow ex-Fox News host Pete Hegseth, the embattled defense secretary, and the former Fox Business personality Sean Duffy, the embattled transportation secretary.

In June, US senator Adam Schiff accused Pirro of “blind obedience to Donald Trump is nearly unrivaled among his ardent supporters”.

“For an important prosecutorial position like this one, the country has a right to demand a serious and principled public servant,” Schiff said. “Jeanine Pirro is not it.”

Despite Pirro's confirmation, the US Senate left Washington DC on Saturday night for its monthlong August recess without a deal to advance dozens of Trump nominees despite days of contentious, bipartisan negotiations.

After one of the workers fell into a sewage pipe in the Japanese city of Gyoda, the other three tried to save him but also lost their lives, according to the local fire department.

Four workers have died in Japan after falling into a manhole while inspecting sewage pipes, authorities said on Sunday.

The workers, all in their fifties, were checking pipes in the city of Gyoda on Saturday. When one fell down the manhole for an unknown reason, three others tried to save him, eventually falling in themselves, the local fire department told the AFP news agency.

The workers were then retrieved and taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead, local media reported.

The four deceased were among at least seven workers present at the site as part of a nationwide survey of sewage pipes. They had been ordered to clean the pipes if required. 

The fire department said rescuers detected hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas in high concentrations, coming out of the manhole.

Local law enforcement also said the gas had been detected, Japan Times reported, adding that they suspected the workers might have inhaled it.

The city is yet to confirm this.

""Detailed circumstances leading up to the accident are still unknown, so it's too early for us to say anything about our responsibility,"" a Gyoda city official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Pope Leo XIV remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine who could not join their celebration in his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth on Sunday.

ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV on Sunday told more than a million Catholic youths at a closing Mass for a weeklong encounter with the next generation of faithful that they are “the sign that a different world is possible” where conflicts can be resolved with dialogue, not weapons. 

In his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth, Leo remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine and other countries at war who could not join their celebration. 

“We are closer than ever to young people who suffer the most serious evils, which are caused by other human beings,” Leo said. “We are with the young people of Gaza. We are with the young people of Ukraine, with those of every land bloodied by war.”

“My young brothers and sisters, you are the sign that a different world is possible. A world of fraternity and friendship, where conflicts are not resolved with weapons, but with dialogue.”

The young people camped out in sprawling fields southeast of Rome overnight after attending a vigil service on Saturday, also presided by Leo who has been ferried from Vatican City by helicopter. The special Jubilee celebration is part of the Holy Year that is expected to draw 32 million people to the Vatican for the centuries-old pilgrimage to the seat of Catholicism.

The Vatican said more than 1 million young people were present, along with 7,000 priests and 450 bishops.

During the Sunday homily, Leo urged the participants to “spread your enthusiasm and the witness of your faith” when they return home to some 150 countries.




“Aspire to great things, to holiness, wherever you are,” Leo urged the young faithful. “Do not settle for less. You will then see the light of the Gospel growing every day, in you and around you.”

Leo reminded the crowd that their next encounter will be during World Youth Day, set for Aug. 3-8, 2027, in Seoul, South Korea. 

The week has been a joyous gathering marked by bands of youths singing hymns as they move down cobblestoned streets, praying the Rosary in piazzas and standing for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to priests offering the sacrament in a dozen languages.

Leo also shared some tragic news on Saturday: two young people who had made the pilgrimage to Rome had died, one reportedly of cardiac arrest, while a third was hospitalized.

Rain overnight awakened the faithful but didn't dampen their spirits.

“At least we were a little covered, but we still got a bit wet. We lost our voices a little. It was cold, but we woke up to a beautiful sun and view,” said Soemil Rios, 20, from Puerto Rico. “Despite the difficulties, it was very nice and very special to have been part of this historic moment.”

Sister Giulia De Luca, from Rome, acknowledged that “waking up was a bit tough,” but that she was looking forward to seeing the pope again.

“It will be very nice to conclude a very intense week together. Definitely a lot of fun, but also very challenging in many ways,” she said.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's far-right national security minister led prayers on Sunday at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, drawing international condemnation and escalating tensions as Israel faces strong criticism over the war in Gaza. 

Itamar Ben-Gvir has frequently visited the contested Jerusalem hilltop compound during the war in Gaza.

Jews revere the site as the Temple Mount, where the biblical temples once stood. It is the holiest site in Judaism. Today, it is home to the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. Tensions at the compound have frequently spilled over into violence over the years. 

It was the latest act of defiance by the 49-year-old ultranationalist settler leader who transformed himself over the decades from an outlaw and provocateur into one of Israel's most influential politicians.

Here is a closer look at Ben-Gvir:




Since Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Palestinians consider the mosque a national symbol and view visits by Jewish leaders as provocative and as a potential precursor to Israel seizing control over the compound. Most rabbis forbid Jews from praying on the site, but there has been a growing movement in recent years of Jews who support worship there. Ben-Gvir has long called for greater Jewish access to the holy site.

Ben-Gvir was visiting to mark the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples, key events in Jewish history. 

Visits like Ben-Gvir's are legal. Israeli media said the visit was the first time that a sitting minister actively and vocally led prayers. Ben-Gvir also called for Israel to conquer and declare sovereignty over all of the Gaza Strip and encourage “voluntary” migration from Gaza in order to end the war and bring the hostages back. Palestinians say the migration plan is a disguise for forced expulsions.

In response to Ben-Gvir's visit, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the status quo at the site had not changed and would not change to allow Jewish prayer. 

Ben-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. The army banned him from compulsory military service when he was a teen, deeming his views too extreme. 

Ben-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late radical rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's car in 1995.

“We got to his car, and we'll get to him too,” he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians.

Two years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O'Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem.

The political rise of Ben-Gvir was the culmination of years of efforts by the media-savvy lawmaker to gain legitimacy. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence.

Ben-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians.

With a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. He was first elected to parliament in 2021.

Ben-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents. In an episode in 2022, he brandished a pistol and encouraged police to open fire on Palestinian stone-throwers in a tense Jerusalem neighborhood. In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country's police force. He used his influence to encourage Netanyahu to press ahead with the war in Gaza and recently boasted that he had blocked past efforts to reach a ceasefire.

As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters.

Ben-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party, into power.

“Over the last year I've been on a mission to save Israel,” Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. “Millions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.”

Ben-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure — encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu's contentious attempt to overhaul the country's legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel.

Ben-Gvir temporarily resigned from Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet earlier this year to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. 

The ceasefire ran from Jan. 19 to March 1. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to what remained of their homes, and there was a surge of humanitarian aid.

Ben-Gvir's resignation did not stop the ceasefire, but it did weaken Netanyahu's governing coalition. Ben-Gvir rejoined the cabinet when Israel ended the ceasefire and returned to active combat in Gaza in March 2025. 

Last week, the Netherlands banned Ben-Gvir and far-right Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich from entering the country. Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway imposed financial sanctions on the two men last month.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, discusses the Trump administration's efforts to eradicate Medicare and Medicaid fraud and build a digital health ecosystem on ‘Hannity.'

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz says the Trump administration plans to invest more than $200 billion ""more dollars"" into Medicaid following the passage of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill."" 

""I'm trying to save this beautiful program, this noble effort, to help folks, giving them a hand up,"" Oz told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""And as you probably gather, if Medicaid isn't able to take care of the people for whom it was designed, the young children, the dawn of their life, those who are twilight of their lives, the seniors, and those who were disabled living in the shadows, as Hubert Humphrey said, then we're not satisfying the fundamental obligation of a moral government,"" he continued. 

Oz, the 17th administrator for CMS, said the government wants ""an appropriate return"" on the Medicaid investment. He addressed the difference in drug costs between the U.S. and Europe, adding that work is being done by the administration in an attempt to bring drug prices down.

Last week, the Trump administration announced it is launching a new program that will allow Americans to share personal health data and medical records across health systems and apps run by private tech companies, promising that this will make it easier to access health records and monitor wellness.

CMS will be in charge of maintaining the system, and officials have said patients will need to opt in for the sharing of their medical records and data, which will be kept secure.

Those officials said patients will benefit from a system that lets them quickly call up their own records without the hallmark difficulties, such as requiring the use of fax machines to share documents, that have prevented them from doing so in the past.

""We're going to have remarkable advances in how consumers can use their own records,"" Oz said during the White House event.

Israeli forces on Sunday killed at least 27 Palestinians seeking food at different aid distribution sites in Gaza after opening fire on the hungry crowds, according to reports.

The latest casualties amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza come as Palestinians were hit by a severe famine, leading to food shortages in the region. U.N. officials claim Israel deliberately created Gaza's hunger crisis by blocking humanitarian aid to the territory. The Israeli military controls the entry and exit points into the Gaza Strip.

Witnesses described Sunday's events as indiscriminate gunfire.

“I couldn't stop and help them because of the bullets,” said a man named Yousef Abed, who was traveling to a distribution site with crowds of people.

“Troops were trying to prevent people from advancing. They opened fire and we fled. Some people were shot,” said Hamza Matter, a Palestinian eyewitness seeking aid at another location.

Hospital officials also commented on the news, with southern Gaza's Nasser Hospital saying it retrieved multiple bodies from routes near distribution points in Khan Younis and Rafah. It said more were killed by Israeli troops near the Morag Corridor in southern Gaza.

Others were killed near a site close to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, according to the nearby Al Awda Hospital.

The hospitals' figures bring the total casualties to 27 deaths, four more than the initial death count.

The reported gunfire occurred near food sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which took over Gaza aid distribution in May. The organization has faced international criticism over recent outbreaks of deadly violence at its distribution points.

Israel has carried out similar gunfire in recent days, leading to dozens more deaths at these sites.

The Israeli military said its troops have only fired warning shots toward the hungry crowds approaching distribution sites and claimed the casualty figures have been greatly exaggerated.

The death toll figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.

TOP TRUMP OFFICIALS WITKOFF AND HUCKABEE VISIT GAZA AID SITES AS HUNGER CRISIS WORSENS

The United States is determining the best course of action for delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza to relieve the suffering. Late last week, the Trump administration sent special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee to the war-torn region to assess the humanitarian crisis for themselves. Witkoff and Huckabee are expected to report back to President Donald Trump and formulate a final plan for food and humanitarian aid.

The pair's visit came days after Trump said the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza to address “real starvation.” Trump's comments contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insisted there was no starvation in Gaza happening at the hands of Israel.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asserted his belief that Joe Biden “was not running things” by citing the former president's lack of communication.

Biden's former chief of staff, aides, and White House physician have taken turns testifying to the House Oversight Committee regarding Biden's cognitive acuity. The former president is fighting off allegations that he experienced a cognitive decline during his term, while his witnesses have pleaded the Fifth Amendment during questioning.

According to Cruz, he heard concerns about Biden's abilities long before he left office. Cruz appeared on Fox News's My View with Lara Trump on Saturday to lament that little is still known about Biden's term.

“The single most frequent question I would get: Who's running things? Here's the terrifying answer: I don't really know,” Cruz said. “I can tell you: in four years that Joe Biden was president, you know how many times I spoke with him? Zero. Not once.”

During Biden's term, Democratic senators held the majority in the chamber. Even as two senators left the party to become independents, they often still caucused with the Democrats, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris's tiebreaking vote ensured wins for Biden's party.

“Joe Biden was not running things that I know,” Cruz said. “Who actually was making the decisions? D***ed if I know, and I don't know anybody who else knows either.”

Biden confirmed he used the White House autopen, a machine that allows someone to duplicate the signature of the commander in chief onto a document, due to the large number of clemencies he granted. The former president set a record in presidential pardons, commutations, and clemencies for over 4,200 people.

Former Biden aide Stefanie Feldman was revealed as the manager of the autopen. Feldman has yet to appear before Congress.

BIDEN'S DEFENSE OF AUTOPEN BACKFIRES, SPARKS OUTRAGE

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) suggested he might subpoena Biden, former first lady Jill Biden, and former chief of staff Ron Klain as part of the investigation into the former president's autopenned orders after the committee hears from more aides.

Joe Biden referred to the investigation as “crazy” and claimed all Republican lawmakers who were questioning his cognitive decline were “liars.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The American Revolution was won by dramatic deeds, but also by decidedly undramatic efforts.

In August 1775, nothing particularly dramatic was happening among the roughly 14,000 soldiers of the Continental Army besieging the British army in Boston. Indeed, nothing particularly dramatic happened for the next six months. And then, in March 1776, the British suddenly evacuated Boston. Which is why the months of apparent calm deserve a close look.

The semiquincentennial of American independence has begun: The anniversaries of the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill are behind us; the reenactment of Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys' storming Fort Ticonderoga was a smashing success. Other big moments await, culminating, no doubt, in a big party on July 4, 2026. One hopes and expects that there will be plenty of hoopla, because that is the American way.

But 250 years ago today, the real and unspectacular work of American independence was under way. The Continental Army, created in June of 1775, had warily welcomed its new leader, George Washington, without much fuss. A slaveholding Virginia gentleman and loosely religious Anglican was going to lead an army that was mainly made up of New Englanders—including both psalm-singing, Bible-quoting descendants of the Puritans and dissenting freethinkers. For his part, Washington was appalled at what he saw: militia units that elected their own officers and called them by their first names, free Black men carrying weapons, money-grubbing Yankees (as opposed to land-grubbing Virginia gentry), and general squalor. “They are an exceeding dirty and nasty people,” he told his cousin Lund Washington.

Lindsay Chervinsky: The ‘dirty and nasty people' who became Americans

What happened that summer outside Boston was of monumental importance. If this was to be an American army and not just an assembly of colonial militias, then Washington would have to be the first American general, and not just a provincial. He would have to create a system out of chaos, and hold together a force against a dangerous enemy. Although slightly outnumbered and bottled up in Boston, which connected to the mainland by only the narrowest of peninsulas, the British army was tough, cohesive, professional, and eager to avenge its unexpected defeats and Pyrrhic victories.

Washington did the work in many ways—by organizing the army in divisions and brigades, inspecting the troops, regularizing discipline, hammering home the importance of digging latrines, and quarantining soldiers who had smallpox. It helped that he looked the part of a military leader: tall, well turned out, graceful, and the best horseman in the colonies, by most accounts. No less important, he was able to transcend his aversion to those strange New Englanders.

Two men utterly unlike his social set in Virginia quickly became his most trusted subordinates: Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island, a Quaker with a talent for organization, and a tubby Boston bookstore owner, Henry Knox, who became the chief of artillery. The former was eventually made quartermaster of the army and then commander of the southern army, where he displayed a flair for field command. The latter brought 59 heavy-artillery pieces from Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga to the army outside of Boston in the dead of winter, before developing the artillery arm into the equal of its British opponent.

Washington quickly realized that his most talented military leader was a third New Englander, the Connecticut merchant Benedict Arnold, who, until he committed treason, was the best field commander on either side of the conflict. In the autumn of 1775, Washington sent him off on a daring march through the Maine wilderness that very nearly wrested Quebec from British control.

The commander in chief needed a headquarters guard—what we today call a personal security detail—and so in March 1776, the army created a unit known as the life guard. Washington selected men from each army unit, which meant that the life guard's personnel skewed in favor of New Englanders; as its first commander, he chose a Massachusetts man, Caleb Gibbs, who lasted until 1780. He chose southerners, too, for crucial positions, and not all of them gentlemen—Daniel Morgan of Virginia, for example, was a roughneck leader of riflemen who formed an elite corps. The point was clear: This was an American army, and talented men, no matter their background, could win their leader's trust and rise up the ranks.

Washington remains in some ways the most remote of America's national heroes; he is more distant from us than Abraham Lincoln because of his greater austerity and reserve. He mastered his volcanic temper, prudently handled both his subordinates and his superiors, and knew the value of dignity and a certain distance in exercising command. He was brave but not particularly gifted as a tactical leader, and he was prone to devising overly aggressive and complicated plans, but these did not matter as much as the larger leadership qualities that he had brought with him to Boston. Small wonder that many years later, men who were his intellectual superiors—Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams—worked for him. His story shows why character and good judgment are far more important in a leader than mere intelligence.

Despite wonderful writing about Washington in recent books, including Ron Chernow's 2010 biography and the first two volumes of Rick Atkinson's trilogy on the history of the Revolution, Americans do not value him as we once did. The fault lies across the political spectrum. For some (think of the 1619 Project), the fundamental sin of slavery overwhelms every aspect of biography. Washington controlled several hundred enslaved people on his Mount Vernon estate; he often treated them badly, and as of 1775, he felt no shame about that.

Being a plantation owner was part of his identity, but not all of it, and more important: Like some of the other Founders, he became uneasy about reconciling the ideals of the Revolution with the practice of holding men and women as chattel—which is why he manumitted all of his slaves in his will.

At a deeper level, this view of American history cannot help but crush patriotic pride in what remains, in retrospect, an astounding achievement. The Revolution culminated not in despotism but in a new political order based on liberty and self-government, built on ideals that, described with exceptional eloquence by another slaveholder, Jefferson, eventually blew up the evil institution on which their way of life rested.

George Packer: A view of American history that leads to one conclusion

A different form of relentless present-mindedness afflicts the current administration, which seeks to purge national parks and museums of references to the darker sides of American history, beginning with slavery but also including the slaughter and dispossession of American Indians, and various forms of discrimination and persecution thereafter. In everything from signage to artwork, the Trump administration reaches for pabulum and kitsch, a false and unidimensional depiction of the American past.

As for academic historians, although some exemplary ones are at work—including Gordon Wood and David Hackett Fischer—the contemporary trend is to shun great individuals in favor of subaltern history. There is not much place for a commanding general in a pantheon composed of people overlooked by previous generations.

That summer and fall in Cambridge and the other towns surrounding Boston, George Washington's work made a difference. It reminds us that American independence was won by dramatic deeds, to be sure, but also by mastering—slowly and painfully—the undramatic things, such as insisting on rank insignia and saluting, managing gunpowder production, and digging latrines properly. It reminds us that there is such a thing as individual greatness, and that it can make all the difference. And particularly in an age of self-righteous scorn, we would do well to recall how Washington's lifelong struggles with himself—his prejudices, his emotions, his upbringing and background—contributed to final victory. We can still profit by the example.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

OPEC+ agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share, as concerns mount over potential supply disruptions linked to Russia.

The move marks a full and early reversal of OPEC+'s largest tranche of output cuts plus a separate increase in output for the United Arab Emirates amounting to about 2.5 million bpd, or about 2.4% of world demand.

Eight OPEC+ members held a brief virtual meeting, amid increasing U.S. pressure on India to halt Russian oil purchases - part of Washington's efforts to bring Moscow to the negotiating table for a peace deal with Ukraine. President Donald Trump said he wants this by August 8.

In a statement following the meeting, OPEC+ cited a healthy economy and low stocks as reasons behind its decision.

Oil prices have remained elevated even as OPEC+ has raised output, with Brent crude closing near $70 a barrel on Friday, up from a 2025 low of near $58 in April, supported in part by rising seasonal demand. U.S. light crude oil prices fell about $2 a barrel in early trade in New York on Friday ahead of the anticipated increase in production by OPEC and its allies, however.

""Given fairly strong oil prices at around $70, it does give OPEC+ some confidence about market fundamentals,"" said Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, adding that the market structure was also indicating tight stocks. 

The eight countries are scheduled to meet again on Sept. 7, when they may consider reinstating another layer of output cuts totalling around 1.65 million bpd, two OPEC+ sources said following Sunday's meeting.

Those cuts are currently in place until the end of next year. OPEC+ in full includes 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries, most notably Russia and Kazakhstan.

The group, which pumps about half of the world's oil, had been curtailing production for several years to support oil prices. It reversed course this year in a bid to regain market share, spurred in part by calls from Trump for OPEC to ramp up production.

The eight began raising output in April with a modest hike of 138,000 bpd, followed by larger-than-planned hikes of 411,000 bpd in May, June and July, 548,000 bpd in August and now 547,000 bpd for September.

""So far the market has been able to absorb very well those additional barrels also due to stockpiliing activity in China,"" said Giovanni Staunovo of UBS. ""All eyes will now shift on the Trump decision on Russia this Friday.""

As well as the voluntary cut of about 1.65 million bpd from the eight members, OPEC+ still has a 2-million-bpd cut across all members, which also expires at the end of 2026.

""OPEC+ has passed the first test,"" said Jorge Leon of Rystad Energy and a former OPEC official, as it has fully reversed its largest cut without crashing prices.

""But the next task will be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion.""

In this article

Mark Zuckerberg may be the most famous college-dropout-turned-tech-billionaire. Dylan Field is the latest, after his design startup Figma soared in its stock market debut this week.

The two entrepreneurs have something else in common: close ties to Peter Thiel.

Zuckerberg got his first outside check for Facebook from Thiel in 2004, soon before leaving Harvard University to build his social network in Silicon Valley. Facebook went public in 2012, the same year that Field scored a Thiel Fellowship, which gives money ""to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom."" Over 300 people have been selected since its inception in 2011.

Field, now 33, was part of the second batch of Thiel fellows, a group of 20 entrepreneurs who each took home $100,000. The program doubled that sum earlier this year. Like Zuckerberg, Field came to Thiel from the Ivy League, having spent two and a half years at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

On Thursday, Figma's stock price more than tripled in its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It rose again on Friday, wrapping up the week with a fully diluted market cap above $71 billion. Field's stake is worth about $6.6 billion. Zuckerberg, meanwhile, is now the world's third-richest person, with a net worth of over $260 billion. 

While the contours of Field's story may sound familiar, he's a very different kind of character.

""Dylan is, by far, the most humble billionaire I've ever met,"" said Joshua Browder, CEO of legal services startup DoNotPay and a former Thiel fellow.

Mike Gibson, who used to help run the fellows program as vice president for grants at the nonprofit Thiel Foundation, contrasts Field with another tech luminary.

""He's kind of like the anti-Steve Jobs,"" said Gibson, a co-founder of 1517 Fund, a venture firm that prides itself on investing in dropouts. ""When it comes to Jobs' legend as this hard-charging a--hole, Dylan is the opposite.""

The Apple co-founder, who dropped out of college after one semester, died of cancer in 2011, as his company was on its way to becoming the most valuable business in the world.

Field was poised to officially enter the billionaire ranks almost three years ago. With Figma having emerged as a leader in web-based tools for designing apps and websites, Adobe agreed to snap up its budding rival for $20 billion. But regulators in the U.K. said the tie-up would've hurt competition, and the companies scrapped the transaction in late 2023. Adobe payed Figma a $1 billion breakup fee.

Figma's IPO this week represented not only a massive valuation markup for the company but also served as a banner event for Silicon Valley, which has seen a dearth of high-profile IPOs since the market cratered in early 2022 due to soaring inflation and rising interest rates.

""The most important thing to remind myself of, the team of, is share price is a moment in time,"" Field told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""We're going to see all sorts of behavior probably today, over the weeks ahead.""

Figma declined to make Field available for an interview for this story.

Field's trek back to the Bay Area, where he'd grown up, began with a TechCrunch article about the fellowship. He submitted his application two hours before the deadline, on New Year's Eve of 2011, while he was a junior at Brown. He left out his SAT scores.

""It is my belief that the SAT is a poor reflection of aptitude and can easily be gamed,"" he wrote in his application, which he posted on LinkedIn years later. In the essay section, he was asked to offer a highly controversial take.

""Chocolate is repulsive,"" he wrote. ""Even the smell of it makes me want to vomit."" 

In response to a question about how he was going to change the world, Field said he was going to build better software for drones, and that he would ""cofound a company with the smartest programmer I know and work on this problem.""

That co-founder was Evan Wallace, who had been a teaching assistant for some of Field's courses at Brown. Wallace was technologically gifted, earning the nickname ""computer Jesus,"" or CJ. But he was already 20, meaning he was too old to be eligible for a Thiel Fellowship.

Field scored the $100,000 from Thiel, and shared it with Wallace, convincing him to leave his academic pursuits. The pair moved into a small apartment in Palo Alto, California.

The drone software plan had gone out the window. Wallace wanted to develop something related to WebGL, a graphics rendering system for web browsers. A year later, they were showing investors a slick browser-based demo that allowed for the movement of a ball in a pool of water.

The obvious competitive target was Adobe, which was ending development of Fireworks, an app design product that it acquired with the 2005 Macromedia purchase.

""We thought, 'Wait, maybe there's an opportunity here,'"" Field said on a podcast earlier this year.

""What we're trying to do is make it so that anyone can be creative, by creating free, simple creative tools in the browser,"" Field said in a 2012 interview for a CNBC special on the Thiel Fellowship.

In 2013, the founders started talking with investors about raising a seed round. Field showed the pool water demo to John Lilly of Greylock Partners at a Starbucks in Palo Alto. Lilly had previously been CEO of Mozilla, where an engineer developed software that led to WebGL. He was impressed with what he was seeing, but he didn't think it had much economic potential.

Figma took on seed funding from Index Ventures and other investors. The founders assembled a small group of employees at an office in Palo Alto. Progress was slow. Early versions of the product failed to impress potential users. Field was micromanaging.

When Figma would show the product to companies in the Bay Area, reception wasn't always great. Stress was building. Lilly, who ended up leading Figma's Series A round in 2014, came to the company's San Francisco headquarters the following August as struggles were mounting. Employees wanted changes.

""We both heard it,"" said Danny Rimer, the Index partner who led the seed funding, referring to conversations he and Lilly were having with staffers about Field.

""We sat down with him and explained to him the situation,"" Rimer said. ""We heard it and we sort of said, 'Look, this is an impasse. You're going to have to adapt and change.' And he heard it and he changed. I think that's such a great character trait of Dylan, is to hear the information, be objective about it, process it and accept it and act accordingly, if it makes sense.""

Around that time, Sho Kuwamoto joined the company. Kuwamoto brought with him experience from Macromedia and Adobe. Four months later, Figma launched its debut product in a free preview.

Field got involved with users. He replied to people on social media who were posting about Figma, telling them they were receiving access to the preview. He also sought out prominent designers.

Companies like Coda and Uber became early adopters. Some designers were excited by the idea of sharing documents by copying and pasting a URL, instead of having to deal with versions, formats and updates. Figma operated in the cloud, providing all the necessary computing infrastructure, so users didn't need their own powerful graphics cards.

It wasn't until September 2016 that Figma made the design editor available for free to the general public and made it possible for multiple designers to make changes in a single file simultaneously. That became the killer feature.

The software started gaining traction inside Microsoft. But there was an issue. Microsoft feared that Figma's lack of a clear business model might lead to a burial in the startup graveyard. Jon Friedman, a design executive at the software giant, visited Figma's headquarters to deliver the message, Field told CNBC in 2022.

""Look, we're all worried you're going to die as a company,"" Field recalled Friedman telling him.

The following year, Figma introduced its first paid tier.

By the time venture stalwart Sequoia Capital came on board in 2019, Figma was a hot commodity, raising its Series C round at a $440 million valuation. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed said some of his firm's portfolio companies had started migrating to Figma, and founders were using it for pitch decks.

""Companies often will show prototypes in board meetings of new products they want to build, and so the first thing we saw a lot of Figma links for was that,"" Reed said in an interview this week.

""It was a very easy investment,"" Reed said. ""We went through some of our old investment voting data. I think Figma might have been the highest vote we ever had for an investment.""

Sequoia's extensive roster of winners over the decades includes Apple, Google, LinkedIn, Zoom and WhatsApp.

Financial analysts covering Adobe started asking about Figma. Adobe, which had released the XD app for user experience design, responded, adding the startup to its official list of competitors.

But Adobe's market capitalization sat above $170 billion, and Figma wasn't even a ""unicorn,"" a status reserved for startups worth at least $1 billion. Field told Forbes that some job candidates were hesitant to join because of the modest valuation. In 2020, the company raised a funding round from Andreessen Horowitz at a $2 billion valuation.

Then came Covid. Offices closed. The world went remote overnight. Figma's collaboration capability suddenly became critical to the way many more people worked.

""We asked ourselves: how can we help teams connect, have fun and enter a flow state during the earliest stages of the design process?"" Field later wrote on Twitter.

The result was FigJam, a digital whiteboard that became Figma's second product, and represented a key step toward diversification.

The Adobe noise continued to get louder. In 2020, Field had discussions with Adobe executive Scott Belsky about a partnership or acquisition, but Field chose to stay the course. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen talked to Field about a possible deal in early 2021, but again the Figma CEO demurred, opting to raise a round at a $10 billion valuation.

""Our goal is to be Figma not Adobe,"" Field wrote in a 2021 tweet.

The environment quickly changed. By early 2022, with the Fed lifting interest rates to fight inflation, investors were selling out of high-growth tech and rotating into businesses with predictable profits. Sequoia was encouraging its startups to reduce costs.

Belsky again approached Field in April of that year, this time alongside David Wadhwani, who was leading Adobe's digital media business.

""Mr. Field expressed openness to understanding the terms of a potential acquisition of Figma by Adobe, and Mr. Field, Mr. Belsky and Mr. Wadhwani continued their discussion of the potential benefits of a combination the following week,"" Adobe stated in a regulatory filing.

Field was considering the implications of the rise of artificial intelligence.

""Look, when we did the deal with Adobe in the first place, my head space in 2022 was, ""Oh my god, AI is coming. This is clearly exponential as a technology. I don't know what this does to us. Is this one-tenth our market, is it 10x our market? What does it mean for creatives and designers?"" Field said in an interview with The Verge last year. ""And I was like, it's better to team up in this world with Adobe and to navigate this together and to figure this out together than it is to go it alone.""

In September 2022, Adobe agreed to buy Figma for about $20 billion, announcing that Field would remain in charge of his part of the business and would report to Wadhwani.

""Adobe has a unique opportunity to usher in a world of collaborative creativity,"" Narayen told analysts on a conference call the day of the agreement. ""In my conversations with Dylan at Figma, it became abundantly clear that together we could accelerate this new vision, delivering great value to our customers and shareholders.""

That opportunity never came. An intensifying regulatory environment in the U.S. and Europe had made sizable tech deals more burdensome. Adobe was suddenly in the crosshairs, and the transaction was hitting repeated hurdles.

""We're worried this deal could stifle innovation and lead to higher costs for companies that rely on Figma and Adobe's digital tools — as they cease to compete to provide customers with new and better products,"" Sorcha O'Carroll, an official at the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, said in a press release in mid-2023.

Around that time, Field announced another step toward product diversification by introducing Dev Mode, which turns Figma designs into source code that can serve as a starting point for software developers. The reveal came at Figma's Config user conference in San Francisco, which attracted 8,000 attendees.

The U.K.'s investigation dragged on for months. Field was pulling double duty running the company and engaging with regulators. Adobe had said it expected to complete the deal in 2023, but time was running out. Regulators were proposing remedies that the parties didn't like.

""Even toward the final months, there were these moments of, 'Oh, this is going to go through,' and moments of, 'F---, what are we doing?'"" Field told The Verge. ""And obviously at the end, there's a mutual understanding of,' This decision has been made for us and let's call it.'""

On a Sunday in December 2023, Field gathered board members for a 10-minute call, informing them that the deal was off. The official statement followed early on Monday morning.

""It's frustrating and sad that we're not able to complete this,"" Field told The New York Times.

Not everyone in Field's orbit saw it that way. Grammarly CEO Shishir Mehrotra, a friend of Field's and longtime Figma user, said the whole ordeal was having an impact.

""You could see it in his face,"" Mehrotra said of Field, adding that he was relieved when he learned Figma would remain independent. ""He was getting older right in front of us.""

But Figma had some business concerns. Its net dollar retention rate, a measurement of the company's ability to sell more to existing customers, slid from 159% in the first quarter of 2023 to 122% by the end of the year, according to Figma's IPO prospectus. Figma chalked it up to a tough comparison from the year before, thanks to the launch of FigJam, and economic uncertainty that caused some clients to reduce seat counts. The retention rate bounced back to 132% in the first quarter of 2025.

During the 2023 winter holidays, Field considered ways to rally the workforce. After the new year, he announced internally that Figma would give extra equity to employees who joined or received promotions following the acquisition announcement, because the valuation was going back down to $10 billion. He said any employees who wished to leave would get three months of severance, with no hard feelings.

Fewer than 5% of staffers took him up on the offer.

As Figma pursues a go-it-alone strategy, it faces an existential question: Is the company ready for a future dominated by AI?

In May, Field took the stage at Figma's user conference before 8,500 attendees at San Francisco's Moscone Center, wearing a black ""Config 2025"" T-shirt. He walked the crowd through a slew of new products, including Figma Make, which draws on Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a large language model from AI startup Anthropic.

""With Figma Make, you could take an existing design and prompt your way to a fully coded prototype,"" Field said.

A product manager, Holly Li, came up for a demo. At a laptop, she copied the design for a music player in the Figma editor and pasted it into a chat box, typing instructions to rotate the album art like a record while a song is playing. She showed apps created with Figma Make, eliciting some cheers, and returned to the demo.

""Okay. This time, the model had a little bit of difficulty, but that's okay,"" she said. The cloudy background image from the original design was gone, and track names became difficult to read. The crowd was silent. She brought up a working version in a different browser tab.

The feature went live last week. Mehrotra said it's off to a good start.

Other products in the market were built with generative AI in mind. They include Lovable, Miro's Uizard and Vercel's v0. Brent Stewart, an analyst at Gartner, said that Figma is ""utterly, utterly dominant"" in design but that some of the offerings from other companies look more impressive.

Andrew Chan, a former Figma software engineer, wrote in a blog post last year that ""an interesting and ongoing question is whether Figma can repeat the success it had in design with other products.""

Nadia Eldeib, a former Lyft product manager and CEO of startup CodeYam, tried Figma Make before the broad launch and put it up against Lovable and v0. Writing on Substack, she said it appeared to be at an earlier stage.

It's the sort of feedback that Field will read and send to his employees, known as Figmates. He reads support tickets and mentions of Figma's name on X, formerly Twitter. He took no time off to address such matters on the very day that his company was conducting its IPO, ultimately pricing shares $1 above the expected range.

Yianni Mathioudakis, a creative director in Maryland, tagged Figma in a post on Wednesday, asking if anyone had found a way to take a Figma Make design and bring it into the main design editor.

""Hi Yianni, we are working towards this and very excited about what it will unlock!"" Field replied. ""Please keep the Make feedback coming!""

Oops, something went wrong

Professor Andrew Urquhart is Professor of Finance and Financial Technology and Head of the Department of Finance at Birmingham Business School (BBS).

This is the eighth installment of the Professor Coin column, in which I bring important insights from published academic literature on cryptocurrencies to the Decrypt readership. In this article, I discuss what gives Bitcoin value.

In just over a decade, Bitcoin has gone from a niche innovation in cryptography to a globally traded asset with a market capitalization in the hundreds of billions.

Yet despite its prominence, a persistent question remains: what gives Bitcoin its value?

Bitcoin doesn't generate cash flow like a company, isn't backed by physical reserves like gold, and has no central authority guaranteeing its worth. So why are people willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a digital token? Recent academic research points to several factors.

The first pillar of Bitcoin's value is its programmed scarcity. Bitcoin has a fixed supply: only 21 million coins will ever be created. This limit is enforced by the network's consensus rules and is viewed by supporters as a bulwark against inflation.

Academic studies have likened Bitcoin to gold because of this scarcity. Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018) model Bitcoin as a decentralized network whose value stems from user adoption and security, both of which are underpinned by the incentives embedded in its monetary policy. In their equilibrium framework, scarcity plays a key role in sustaining long-term value.

Why is Bitcoin's supply limit set to 21 million?

Scarcity makes Bitcoin attractive as a hedge against inflation, particularly in a world of expanding money supply. A number of economists have investigated whether Bitcoin's scarcity can explain its valuation, with Bui et al (2024) documenting that scarcity is a major determinant of excess returns.

Scarcity is not sufficient without demand—and Bitcoin's demand comes from its use as a peer-to-peer digital asset and from the belief that others will accept it in the future.

This is where network effects come into play. According to Cong, Li, and Wang (2021) Bitcoin's value grows with its user base. Their tokenomics model shows that the more people adopt and trust Bitcoin, the more valuable the network becomes. This dynamic helps explain why Bitcoin has survived multiple boom-and-bust cycles.

Furthermore, Bolt and van Oordt (2016) argue that the value of a virtual currency arises if users expect it to retain value and be accepted in transactions. Their model formalizes how expectations of acceptance can stabilize a volatile asset like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is also underpinned by a real-world cost: mining. To secure the network and process transactions, Bitcoin relies on a system called proof-of-work, where miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles using electricity and hardware.

This energy-intensive process is not without controversy, but researchers such as Hayes (2015) have shown that the cost of production provides a fundamental floor for Bitcoin's price. He finds that Bitcoin rarely trades below the marginal cost of mining, reinforcing the idea that energy and security provision matter for valuation.

Moreover, the work of Pagnotta and Buraschi (2018) supports this by showing that mining incentives and the strength of the network's security are central to Bitcoin's equilibrium value, not just supply and demand in the traditional sense.

In practice, however, Bitcoin's price also reflects investor sentiment and speculation. A surge in media coverage or social media buzz can trigger price rallies or sharp selloffs.

Studies by Urquhart (2018) and Shen et al (2019) demonstrate that Bitcoin prices are strongly correlated with online search trends and that trading volume in turn, drives investor attention.

Similarly, Liu and Tsyvinski (2021) show that cryptocurrency returns are significantly predicted by investor attention proxies. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin lacks ties to macroeconomic fundamentals, so sentiment and belief play an outsized role.

Bitcoin's value is also shaped by its role in the broader financial system. In a low-interest-rate environment and amid concerns about fiat currency debasement, investors have turned to Bitcoin as a non-sovereign store of value. This is demonstrated by early work by Baur et al (2018) who show that investors are holding Bitcoin for long periods, but is supported by followup work by Jahanshahloo et al (2025).

Recent research has reassessed Bitcoin's role in portfolios, particularly in times of market stress. Corbet, Larkin, and Lucey (2020) find that Bitcoin behaves more like a speculative asset than a traditional safe haven, but it can act as a weak diversifier under certain market conditions. In a similar vein, Ji, Bouri, Lau, and Roubaud (2021) use time-varying spillover models and show that Bitcoin's hedging properties fluctuate significantly, with greater hedging effectiveness during tranquil periods rather than during crises.

Professor Coin: Can Bitcoin Replace Gold?

Bitcoin's value emerges from a blend of engineering and economics: scarcity enforced by code, utility derived from decentralized consensus, and demand shaped by sentiment, costs, and macro conditions.

It behaves like a commodity, a tech stock, and a speculative token—often all at once. That complexity is what makes Bitcoin both so fascinating and so difficult to value with traditional models.

In the end, Bitcoin's worth is anchored not in what it does today, but in what its users believe it can become tomorrow. And as long as that belief persists—backed by utility, adoption, and incentives—the value may persist too.

Trump Media's $2B bitcoin buy and $300M options plan could reshape Bitcoin market outlook. Explore price predictions, technical levels, and a short-term trade setup.

Trump Media and Technology Group (Nasdaq: DJT) has gone all in on digital assets, announcing in its Q2 2025 earnings report that it holds $2 billion in bitcoin and bitcoin-related securities. 

The company also allocated $300 million to an options-based strategy targeting BTC, so it's going to get even more crypto exposure. 

This puts Trump Media in the top U.S.-listed companies with significant bitcoin reserves.

Total assets grew 800% year-over-year to $3.1 billion as the company built up its crypto treasury and raised institutional capital. 

The Q2 release showed the company's first positive operating cash flow of $2.3 million from its core media business, a sign of financial stability.

Trump Media's hybrid crypto portfolio includes spot BTC and instruments like bitcoin ETFs and trusts. By holding these diversified assets, the company can maintain liquidity and capture long-term upside.

The company's CEO, Devin Nunes, said the liquidity from this will drive product expansion, including Truth+ streaming service, AI integrations, and a potential Truth Social utility token. Trump Media also hinted at launching crypto ETFs and managed products to tap into institutional demand.

Key points from Trump Media's Q2 2025 strategy:

DJT closed at $16.92 on Friday, down 3.81% on the day and 50% year-to-date. Despite the stock volatility, the company's deepening into crypto may impact market sentiment and institutional interest in bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is at $113,985 after breaking below a symmetrical triangle. The 4-hour chart is bearish with three red candles in a row like the “Three Black Crows” pattern. The 50-period SMA at $116,852 is now resistance capping upside.

RSI is coming up from oversold (31.71) but still at 41.69 with no bullish divergence. Price is facing resistance at $114,939. If it fails to clear this level, it could retest $112,043 and then $110,065.

Trade Idea: Short if BTC is rejected between $114.9K-$115.5K with stop above $116.9K and targets $112K and $110K. Close above $117K invalidates this bearish view.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the first BTC-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6.2 million in its public presale, with $6,278,761 out of a $21,644,097  target. The token is priced at $0.0115, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon.

Designed to merge Bitcoin's security with Solana's speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity.

The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

A major Ethereum whale moved 25,540 ETH—valued at approximately $86.6 million—from FalconX on August 2, 2025, marking a significant outflow following a prior deposit of 35,615 ETH totaling $130.11 million for staking purposes. This transaction comes after the same whale recorded an estimated $10 million unrealized loss from previous staking activities, highlighting the volatility and risk associated with large-scale crypto positions [1].

The movement has sparked speculation among market participants regarding the whale's strategy and the broader implications for Ethereum liquidity and staking dynamics. While no direct commentary from FalconX or regulatory authorities has been released, the transfer underscores the sensitivity of institutional crypto positions to market conditions. Analysts suggest that large movements from institutional players often signal shifting sentiment and could influence short-term price behavior [1].

Ethereum's current price stands at $3,487.18, with a total market cap of $420.94 billion. The asset maintains a dominance of 11.39% within the broader crypto market, although 24-hour trading volume has declined by 17.48% to $27.48 billion. Over the past 90 days, ETH has seen a 92.40% price increase, indicating a period of heightened activity and market engagement [1].

Coincu analysts have noted that emerging regulatory developments may impact institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in the near term. Market participants are closely monitoring for any substantive regulatory or technological shifts that could affect Ethereum's trajectory. Institutional investors, in particular, are grappling with the challenges posed by current volatility, with this recent $10 million loss serving as a stark reminder of the risks involved [1].

Market observers have pointed out that Ethereum liquidity has become increasingly volatile in 2025, and large transfers like this one could further disrupt stable pool dynamics if not offset by counter-movements. The absence of public statements from FalconX representatives or regulatory bodies has left the market to interpret the significance of this event independently [1].

The broader Ethereum community is watching closely, as such movements can have ripple effects across the market. However, without direct insight from key stakeholders or regulators, the full implications remain speculative. The event highlights the ongoing evolution of Ethereum's market landscape and the need for institutional investors to remain agile in response to shifting conditions [1].

Ethereum whales have been significantly increasing their holdings amid a recent market dip, with over $400 million worth of ETH acquired by large investors. Institutional interest in Ethereum appears to be growing, as demonstrated by the accumulation of ether through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and expanded positions by specialized investment firms [1].

A major whale wallet, tracked by Arkham Intelligence, purchased approximately $300 million of ETH over three days via Galaxy Digital's OTC desk. This purchase, equivalent to roughly 85,000 ETH, occurred despite an unrealized loss of $26 million, signaling a long-term accumulation strategy rather than short-term speculation [1].

SharpLink, an Ethereum-focused investment firm, expanded its holdings by acquiring 30,755 ETH for $108.57 million at an average price of $3,530 per token. This purchase increased the firm's total ETH holdings to 480,031 tokens, valued at approximately $1.65 billion. Such large-scale acquisitions highlight the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a core digital asset [1].

On-chain activity for Ethereum has also surged, with Sentora reporting 931,000 active addresses in a single day—the highest in nearly two years. The increase in active addresses reflects heightened user engagement and network adoption, reinforcing a bullish outlook for Ethereum [1].

U.S. regulatory developments are increasingly favorable toward blockchain technology, further positioning Ethereum to benefit as a leading smart contract platform. According to venture capitalist Thomas Lee, continued dominance by Ethereum in institutional finance could drive its price toward $60,000, reflecting its expanding influence in global markets [1].

These developments suggest that Ethereum's role in global finance is strengthening. With rising on-chain activity, institutional buying, and supportive regulatory trends, Ethereum appears well-positioned for long-term growth in 2025 and beyond [1].

Bitcoin's price action has recently shown signs of entering a Wyckoff Distribution phase, a technical analysis model that often signals the end of a bullish cycle and the beginning of a distribution period driven by institutional selling [1]. Crypto analyst Joao Wedson outlined this development on the social media platform X, noting a 13-phase schematic unfolding in real time. The pattern begins with the Preliminary Supply phase, where subtle signs of institutional sales emerge, followed by a Buying Climax as prices hit a peak driven by exhausted retail demand. This is then succeeded by an Automatic Reaction, marked by a sharp drop in Bitcoin's price, which defines the bottom of the distribution range [1].

According to Wedson, phases C and D of the model present the most irrefutable signs of weakening demand, including a Sign of Weakness (SOW), often characterized by a strong breakdown on high volume, and a Last Point of Supply (LPSY), where a weak rally creates favorable conditions for short positions. The final stage involves a break of ICE, leading to a deeper fall, followed by a second LPSY trap that seals the distribution phase [1].

The analyst further noted that as Bitcoin transitions through these phases, institutional investors are quietly offloading positions while retail traders remain optimistic. This dynamic is particularly evident in the current sideways movement of Bitcoin's price, which has left many retail participants confused about the market's direction. As of the latest report, Bitcoin's price has remained relatively flat at around $113,439 over the past 24 hours [1].

In parallel, Wedson highlighted a growing trend of market capital rotation into altcoins, suggesting that altcoins are now exiting their accumulation phases and entering structural uptrends. This shift could mean that altcoins may outperform Bitcoin in the near term, with Wedson forecasting a full rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins and eventually to fiat by the end of 2025 [1]. Such a development would reflect a broader reallocation of capital and changing market dynamics, with altcoins potentially benefiting from increased institutional interest and retail speculative activity.

The broader crypto market has also seen developments that could support this narrative. For instance, Russian crypto holders have recently received clarity on travel restrictions related to their digital assets, indicating a move toward more structured and regulated global crypto environments [2]. This regulatory clarity may encourage further institutional participation and market liquidity, aligning with the broader trend of altcoin momentum.

Additionally, certain altcoins such as XRP have been identified as potential beneficiaries of this reallocation. Industry forecasts suggest that XRP could experience a 20% price surge in the coming months [3], underscoring the growing interest in smaller-cap assets as Bitcoin consolidates. While this is a speculative projection, it reflects the current appetite for altcoin exposure amid Bitcoin's possible distribution phase.

As the crypto market continues to evolve, investors are being urged to closely monitor Bitcoin's price behavior and altcoin performance. The Wyckoff model remains a useful tool for interpreting institutional selling patterns and identifying shifts in market leadership. Those who recognize the early signs of distribution and capitalize on altcoin momentum may be well-positioned to navigate the potential transition from a Bitcoin-led market to a more diversified altcoin-driven rally.

Pudgy Penguins remains the top NFT collection by market cap, holding over 123,000 ETH despite a 53% decline in daily trading volume. The collection's floor price has risen to 14.05 ETH, and the average sale price increased by just over 2%, signaling continued holder confidence. This resilience contrasts with the broader market trend, where overall NFT sales have dropped 10% in the past week, with Pudgy Penguins and CryptoPunks experiencing declines of 43% and 42%, respectively[2].

Moonbirds posted the strongest performance in terms of liquidity, with trading volume increasing by nearly 19% to 201.2 ETH. The average sale price also rose by almost 11%, driven by 86 sales in a single day—the second-highest among the top five collections. This uptick highlights a shift in buyer behavior, with liquidity and active trading becoming more critical than volume alone[1].

Lil Pudgys maintained a market cap above 33,700 ETH, but its trading volume fell by 17%, and the average sale price dipped slightly. However, its floor price remained stable at 1.549 ETH, suggesting a degree of market confidence in the collection's value. In contrast, No Bad Trippers saw the most significant price jump, with the average sale price rising nearly 58%, despite a drop in sales by over a third. The collection recorded over 460 transactions in the past 24 hours, the highest among the top five, indicating strong short-term interest[1].

Milady closed out the list with a 25% drop in daily trading volume and a 31% decline in sales. Nevertheless, its floor price and average sale price remained steady, reflecting a cautious but firm stance from current holders. Collectively, these collections illustrate a market in transition, where some blue-chip assets hold value while others struggle amid reduced trading activity and shifting investor priorities[1].

The broader NFT landscape is also witnessing a potential pivot, with gaming-related assets and AI-curated collections attracting renewed attention. Monthly sales reached $574 million, marking one of the strongest performances of the year and pointing to a possible realignment in the types of NFTs that are driving investor interest. This development challenges the traditional dominance of older collections and suggests a market still in the process of defining its new equilibrium[3].

While platforms like OpenSea continue to play a central role in facilitating NFT trading, the evolving nature of the market underscores the importance of platform adaptability and innovation. OpenSea's ongoing support for token trading and onchain asset creation remains critical as collections and market dynamics shift[4].

Looking ahead, the SEED NFT Marketplace token has drawn speculative attention, with some analysts forecasting a rise to $1.29 by 2026 under a 5% annual growth assumption. These projections offer a potential framework for long-term strategy but remain speculative and should not be treated as guaranteed outcomes[5].

The mixed performance of top NFT collections reflects the sector's current volatility and sensitivity to both macroeconomic factors and evolving investor preferences. While traditional benchmarks are losing relevance, niche areas like gaming and AI curation are emerging as new drivers of value. Investors must remain agile, continuously assessing the unique dynamics of each collection to navigate this rapidly changing market effectively.

Home - Crypto Presales - Ethereum ICO Investor Buy Best Crypto Presale Pepe Dollar, Why PEPD Will Make More Profits Than Snorter Bot (SNORT)

In the volatile world of meme coins, seasoned Ethereum investors are making a surprising pivot—into Pepe Dollar (PEPD). With the 2025 bull market in full swing, analysts now predict that Pepe Dollar (PEPD) is primed to outperform meme challengers like Snorter Bot (SNORT), offering better returns and long-term gains.



Ethereum early adopters have witnessed multiple meme runs—from Dogecoin to Shiba Inu—and they know the patterns. The key is timing, scarcity, and actual network traction. That's where Pepe Dollar (PEPD) excels. As an Ethereum-based Layer-2 token focused on MemeFi utility, PEPD is now being listed as a 200x to 300x opportunity by traders who previously rode ETH from $0.30 to $4,000.

Pepe Dollar (PEPD) isn't just a meme—it's a Layer-2 utility token designed for actual use cases. Its roadmap includes casino gaming integration, mobile wallet support, and decentralized tipping systems. The presale is still in Stage 1, offering one of the best early-entry points for those who missed the 2020 ETH boom.







Snorter Bot (SNORT) gained fast attention with its absurd memes, Telegram sniff bots, and comical NFT drops. But that's where the roadmap stops. It lacks the infrastructure to be used as anything more than a meme-based bet. Unlike Pepe Dollar (PEPD), SNORT doesn't offer transactional utility, developer tools, or staking rewards.

While SNORT's team has teased a meme-based game and sniff leaderboard, there are no confirmed partnerships or dApps supporting token demand. In contrast, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has already integrated into Web3 microgaming apps and is actively building out Pay-Fi features that connect meme culture with finance.

Pepe Dollar (PEPD) features a capped supply and deflationary burn system that mirrors the economic design of successful Layer-2 tokens. Ethereum ICO investors understand the power of scarcity and velocity—two things SNORT currently lacks. As the Pepe Dollar (PEPD) presale advances, these mechanics are expected to tighten supply and increase floor pricing dramatically.

More importantly, the PEPD ecosystem includes more than just a whitepaper. With Telegram integration, Pay-Fi tools, meme casino access, and NFT staking features in development, the token's actual use cases support ongoing demand post-launch.







Ethereum ICO investors aren't just chasing laughs—they're looking for asymmetric upside with smart economic design. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) fits that mold. It's early-stage, meme-driven, and infrastructure-ready. With whale accumulation starting and top analysts flagging it as the best crypto presale, it's no surprise that seasoned ETH holders are rotating into PEPD.

Snorter Bot (SNORT) may still draw eyes and emojis, but in the battle of profits, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) appears better equipped to deliver real returns in 2025.

Home - Crypto Presales - Top Crypto Presales Pepe Dollar and Nexchain AI Gain Interest From Ethereum (ETH) ICO Whale, PEPD Named As Favorite Presale

A major Ethereum (ETH) ICO whale has reportedly made moves into two of 2025's most talked-about presales: Pepe Dollar (PEPD) and Nexchain (NEX). But sources close to the presale tracker say the whale's favorite — and largest position — is firmly with Pepe Dollar (PEPD), the MemeFi altcoin aiming to disrupt both meme culture and stablecoin functionality.








PEPD is everything traditional altcoins are not: playful, efficient, memeable, and fast-moving. It exists as a meme-stable hybrid with staking, DEX integration, and soon, a mobile MemeFi game. The Ethereum (ETH) whale reportedly favors PEPD not only for its low entry point and deflationary supply — but because of its viral appeal. In crypto, attention equals liquidity.

Early supporters say Pepe Dollar (PEPD) brings back the energy of Dogecoin, but with real utility. Unlike Nexchain (NEX), which still faces developer onboarding, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) already has a plan to integrate with top Ethereum-based swaps and roll out community governance via token-weighted voting.

Ethereum (ETH) whales are known for spotting trends early. In 2015, they bought ETH for pennies. Now, as AI tokens and meme-stable hybrids battle for dominance, they're making selective plays. This week's whale move suggests that while Nexchain (NEX) has tech appeal, Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has the stronger ROI thesis.

PEPD is currently priced at $0.004688, with a projected launch price of $0.03695 — a potential 7x gain. With 58% of its Stage 1 presale already completed, the token is rapidly gaining momentum. The Ethereum (ETH) whale in question reportedly deployed over $50,000 into the PEPD presale in a single transaction.







Nexchain (NEX) offers an AI-powered smart contract platform focused on optimizing NFT, DeFi, and dApp experiences through machine learning. It targets developers and advanced users, promising automation, scalability, and modularity.

Despite a presale price of $0.096 and a launch forecast of $0.30, the project's biggest hurdle remains unclear usage. Multiple analysts have noted that while the AI label draws attention, it's not yet translating into ecosystem traction.

For Ethereum (ETH) whales, that signals caution — even if upside remains.







Both Nexchain (NEX) and Pepe Dollar (PEPD) have presale potential. Nexchain offers a moonshot AI play, but Pepe Dollar is winning on cultural momentum and usability. Ethereum (ETH) whales betting big on PEPD suggests that 2025's breakout may not come from high-tech — but from high-engagement.

Ethereum (ETH) whales are watching both projects, but action speaks louder than speculation. Pepe Dollar (PEPD) has earned a major vote of confidence and is quickly establishing itself as the best crypto presale for meme-driven gains. For investors who missed ETH's early days, this could be the next great opportunity.

XRP fell nearly 9% in 24 hours, driven by institutional selling, with volumes more than doubling the daily average.

The asset found short-term support at $2.75, but recovery efforts stalled below key resistance at $2.84.

Global trade tensions and macroeconomic shifts contributed to the broader sell-off, affecting risk markets.

XRP plunged nearly 9% in the 24-hour session ending August 3 at 04:00 (UTC+7), falling from $3.02 to as low as $2.75 before staging a mild recovery to $2.82. The decline was driven by heightened institutional selling pressure, with volumes during the heaviest selling window more than doubling the daily average. Price action suggests potential exhaustion near $2.75, though broader macro and liquidity risks remain elevated.

The XRP drawdown came amid widening global trade tensions and renewed tariff uncertainty that shook risk markets across the board. Meanwhile, institutional portfolios appeared to rebalance as macro conditions prompted capital rotation away from altcoins and into more liquid assets. Analysts point to ongoing adjustments by central banks and heightened geopolitical risk as catalysts for the broader sell-off.

SAP announced Friday that it has reached an agreement to acquire recruiting software company SmartRecruiters.

In a press release, the European software giant said that SmartRecruiters “powerful, user-friendly interfaces and seamless workflows” will complement SAP's existing HR tools.

Muhammad Alam, the SAP executive board member who leads product and engineering, said in a statement that with this acquisition, “Customers will be able to manage the entire candidate lifecycle — from sourcing and interviewing to onboarding and beyond — all in a single system to streamline the experience for recruiters, hiring managers and, in particular, candidates.”

The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.

SmartRecruiters' last announced round of funding was a $110 million Series E in 2021, which valued the company at $1.5 billion.

It reminds me, tangentially, of something I did a while ago. I scraped hundreds of  environment non-profits and NGO websites from around the world. Many of them are UN affiliated to some degree.I tried to find 3 things: 1) what the non-profit does, 2) what the non-profit produces, 3) what the non-profit accomplished.My ability to glean these details, by scraping and double-checking manually, had a very very low hit rate.. at least via website content. 
Organizations are oblique and very little is clear/available. [The same problem exists for websites for places (restaurants, venues, athletic events, etc). By and large, they all hide their addresses.]I'm guessing these efforts and reports would produce a similar translucency if audited from outside.

I always wondered that whenever such reports or surveys come out why don't these organisations make the whole data and methodology public? Are they afraid that if they made it public, people will know how muddy these waters are?

reply

They could be completely making up data or demonstrating the gold standard example of pristine data collection and brilliant analysis but we'd never know.. and for some reason, they don't want to tell us.

reply

It's awful. Non-profits in the US are generally just awful. It's embarrassing.

I'm not bagging on NGOs in particular. But it's also how a lot of them refer to themselves.This is more about the lack of clarity in messaging by orgs that ostensibly have a vested interest in making their progress known. At least as long as they're engaged in public outreach.

If those reports go unread and thus not acted upon they are worthless. We obviously need the details to exist but we are in a battle for hearts and minds, and the more dumbed down the message, the likelier it is to be received.

Like almost everyone, I have zero involvement in UN activities, and zero influence over them. Why would I read their reports?

reply

Who indeed matters; I'm sure for many of the reports, only several people in the world actually need to read them. I used to occasionally do research for one person to read and it was a good use of my time/salary. If it'd shared it somewhere and no one downloaded it, it would still have been worth writing for that person. However, it would've looked pathetic sitting out there with no downloads, compared to being printed and walked over. :)

reply

I feel like this is a non-issue since it's like the 'new' section on HN. Something that's important or and interesting gets picked up and spread (although only accessed once or twice) and is now a world-wide headline.

Stability issues cited as the reason.

Gigabyte has quietly removed an unofficial PCIe 5.0 option from its B650 motherboards with the latest BIOS updates. The change has sparked significant furor among enthusiasts who noticed the tweak after flashing their boards. This only affects the PCIe x16 slot reserved for GPUs, and not the x4 M.2 slots that Gen5 SSDs would use.

According to reports on Reddit and Chiphell, the removal first occurred in BIOS version F35 for models like the B650 Gaming X AX V2. Users who previously saw a “Gen 5” setting for the primary PCIe x16 slot in BIOS now found the option missing entirely, with link speeds capped at PCIe 4.0. Rolling back to BIOS F34 brings PCIe 5.0 support back, confirming this was a BIOS functionality change.

Interestingly, Gigabyte never officially advertised PCIe 5.0 support for B650 motherboards. AMD's specifications clearly limit full PCIe 5.0 capability to the B650E and X670E chipsets. However, because some B650 boards share PCB layouts with their “E” counterparts, the feature remained accessible—at least until now. Moreover, B650 boards do have 4x PCIe Gen5 lanes meant to serve an SSD but not enough for an actual Gen5 GPU.

So, why remove it? According to folks on Chiphell, enabling Gen 5 on B650 boards was causing stability issues for some GPUs. An MSI insider known as “Hugable Carrot” even suggested that other vendors may follow Gigabyte's lead, calling PCIe Gen 5 graphics cards “too troublesome” on these mid-tier chipsets.

However, the removal of this PCIe x16 slot feature wasn't listed in Gigabyte's BIOS changelog, and this lack of transparency has drawn criticism. The same Reddit user, who first reported this change, also shared benchmarks in his post showing a slight performance drop after updating to F35—losing 15 points in Steel Nomad and 3–5 FPS in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Dying Light 2. While PCIe 4.0 x16 is more than enough for modern GPUs, issues can arise when bandwidth is halved to x8, which can significantly impact performance on low-end cards like the RTX 5060 Ti.

For now, Gigabyte has already pulled BIOS F35 from its support page and replaced it with F36, which likely keeps the PCIe 5.0 option disabled. If you value that Gen 5 toggle—even if it offered no real-world gains for most people—staying on F34 might be your best bet.



As highlighted by others, removing PCIe 5.0 from B650 boards likely comes down to stability and compliance. PCIe Gen 5 signals require stricter PCB design and higher-quality components to maintain integrity, which B650 boards weren't officially validated for. Allowing users to enable Gen 5 could lead to unpredictable behavior, RMAs, and compatibility headaches—issues Gigabyte (and AMD) want to avoid.

The bigger question is whether this sets a trend. If that MSI insider is correct, more vendors could start locking down “hidden” Gen 5 support on mid-range boards, reinforcing AMD's segmentation between B650, B650E, and X670E chipsets.

Pro-focused features combine with modular design.

Gaming accessory maker Turtle Beach has announced the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, a new modular game controller under its Victrix esports brand. Successor to the original Victrix Pro BFG, the new controller builds on the design by Performance Designed Products (PDP), the manufacturer behind the original model which was acquired by Turtle Beach in 2024.

The latest Reloaded model now comes with a reconfigured Fightpad module with improved ergonomics, as well as updated Hall Effect thumb sticks and triggers. The company will be offering it in black and white color variants with a dedicated model for Xbox which is compatible with Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows. An officially licensed PlayStation version will also be available, offering compatibility with the PS5 and PS4 consoles alongside Windows, again.

The modular aspect of the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded controller allows it to adapt to various genres and play style, including fighting games, first-person shooters, and RPGs. Users can swap between three modules and 11 interchangeable components including various thumb sticks, a selection of D-pads, and thumb stick gates that can attach to the bottom of a joystick or thumb stick limiting the directions in which the stick can move.

The controller also comes with patented 5-stop hall-effect clutch triggers with a Hair-Trigger mode that allows adjustable sensitivity, which makes it suitable for FPS gamers. Additionally, there is a 6-button Fightpad module which features Kailh microswitches that are claimed to deliver tournament-level accuracy.

The included USB Type-A dongle offers low-latency and a range of up to 30-feet, while the 2,000 mAh inbuilt-battery offers up to 20-hours of backup. Alternatively, players can use the included braided USB-C cable for wired operation. There is also a 3.5mm audio jack with Sony 3D Audio support on the PlayStation variant.

The Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is on sale in the UK and EU regions starting at £179.99 and €199.99 respectively. For customers in the US, the controller is now available for pre-order on Amazon at $209.99, and will officially start shipping on September 28.

At the end of May and the start of June, Real Madrid focused heavily on incoming transfers. They signed Dean Huijsen and appointed Xabi Alonso as the new coach.

Trent Alexander-Arnold also arrived from Liverpool for £10 million - more than the club initially wanted to pay. Since then, there have been only a couple of further signings.

Franco Mastantuono joined shortly before the Club World Cup, while Álvaro Carreras signed just after the tournament ended. Since then, the focus has shifted to outgoings and contract extensions.

A few players have left Castilla for greener pastures, with more departures rumoured, while several players have also signed new contracts.

The latest is Brahim Díaz, who will remain a Real Madrid player for the next five years.

The agreement is already in place, according to a report from MARCA. He has also rejected offers from other clubs in the process.

The report states that Fenerbahce tried to sign him earlier this summer, while Benfica made a recent inquiry - both approaches were turned down by the player.

From both the player's and the club's side, it has been clear that the relationship should continue.

What makes it even better is that Brahim probably would have had a starting role at both Benfica and Fenerbahce, but he turned them down to remain a crucial squad player, as he seems to be happy with his role.

He has been impactful in that role, often used in tight games to unlock defences.

Brahim still needs to work on parts of his game, such as not holding onto the ball for too long and making the right final pass.

However, even during the Club World Cup, it was clear he was improving under Xabi Alonso in their short time together before the season began.

There is excitement about what more he can offer over the coming years.

Hopefully, Brahim Díaz continues to grow as a player, remains a key squad option, and stays at the club for as long as he remains valuable.

With a season as long as the last one, it was made clear in the worst way possible that Real Madrid always need brilliant squad players like Brahim Diaz, and he will once again be crucial for the club - there is no doubt about it.

Long Island native Ilana Sedaka, a 24-year-old former figure skater turned pilates instructor who lives in Miami, will be the show's bachelorette, with the eligible bachelors consisting of influencers, tennis superfans and social personalities. 

No specific men were named. 

“We're excited to break new ground with ‘Game, Set, Matchmaker,' at the US Open and across our channels this year,” Jonathan Zipper, senior director of social media at the USTA, said in a statement. “It's the perfect time for us to launch a fun, social-forward concept that meets the moment, engaging fans at the intersection of tennis, pop culture and entertainment.”

The first episode will be posted on the first official day of the U.S. Open — Aug. 24. The finale will be available on the same day as the women's final.

The project is a collaboration between the USTA and Fresh Tape Media, and is attempting to capitalise on the tournament's cultural impact beyond the play on the court. 

“The US Open is more than a tournament; it's a cultural stage,” said Alana Glenn Moritz, creative director for Fresh Tape Media, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

“We built this series to capture that energy in its purest form. It's unexpected, it's current, and it taps into the drama and connection that makes this event unlike anything else.”

The tennis world has been left in disbelief after an incident that had to be seen to be believed transpired at the Canadian Open.

Tennis power couples Kyrgios-Osaka and de Minaur-Boulter have been left hanging as the US Open reveals its exclusive mixed doubles line-up.

After declaring himself at his athletic peak, Alex de Minaur delivered a bold US Open statement in the DC Open final.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Naomi Osaka vs. Anastasija Sevastova: Predictions, How to Watch","https://globelynews.com/sports/naomi-osaka-vs-anastasija-sevastova-predictions-how-to-watch/","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 18:01:19 GMT","

Naomi Osaka faces Anastasija Sevastova on Centre Court at IGA Stadium in Montreal in a Canadian Open Round of 16 battle between two resurgent players.

Sevastova, a 35-year-old 386th-ranked Latvian wildcard, is chasing a return to her former heights. Once ranked as high as No. 11 in 2019, her career paused for maternity leave and a break from the tour.

Her Canadian Open run in 2025 has been phenomenal, knocking out Ajla Tomljanovic, Magda Linette, and Jessica Pegula to make her way into the fourth round.

Meanwhile, fans have seen shades of Osaka's past brilliance throughout 2025, including at the DC Open last month, where she reached the Round of 16, falling to the also-resurgent Emma Raducanu.

Osaka has dominated in two of her three matches in this tournament, and gutted out a three-set, two-and-a-half-hour win over Liudmila Samsonova in the second round.

This afternoon, two players riding waves of momentum will collide on Centre Court.

Osaka leads their head-to-head 3–2. Their most recent match, however, was when both were in peak form, back in 2019, with Osaka winning in three sets at the Australian Open.

This afternoon, the rivalry resumes — with both once again playing high-quality tennis.

Serving pressure: Osaka's experience and rising first-serve numbers — averaging 70.5% first-serve points won against Ostapenko — should put extra strain on Sevastova's return and backhand side.

Sevastova's grit: The 35-year-old is deadly in extended rallies and plays with high tactical IQ. Expect her to attack short balls early and disrupt rhythm with precision and variety.

Mental balance: May be what determines the final result. Osaka's breakthrough mentality will be tested if Sevastova hangs tight deep into rallies — she'll need to avoid chasing errors and play her forehand aggressively.

Prediction: Osaka in three sets. Osaka's clean serving and consistent form give her the edge, but Sevastova's fighting spirit will produce tight games — especially if Osaka drops serve early.

This afternoon's Round of 16 match between Naomi Osaka and Anastasija Sevastova is now expected to start at around 3:20 PM Eastern on Centre Court at IGA Stadium in Montreal, after Madison Keys's win over Karolina Muchova in three sets.

The match may air live on the Tennis Channel or its streaming-only T2 Channel, available for free on Amazon Prime Video here.

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

After dropping out in Q2 at the Hungaroring, Lewis Hamilton could not make any progress from 12th on the grid.

Lewis Hamilton's challenging weekend in Hungary continued on Sunday, with the Ferrari driver finishing the Grand Prix a lap down and outside the points-paying positions.

After a tricky first day of practice, Hamilton dropped out in the second Qualifying phase and started from 12th position – commenting afterwards that he was “absolutely useless” and Ferrari “probably need to change driver”.

Hamilton's hopes of making progress around the tight, twisty Budapest venue were low and, despite the seven-time World Champion's best efforts, he ended the 70-lap encounter where he started.

Summing up his day on F1 TV, Hamilton simply called it a “pretty bad” experience, before being asked if any progress had been possible, to which he said: “Not really, no. Just stuck where I was.”

As for his mindset going into the summer break, Hamilton stated: “Same as it was yesterday. I'm glad it's over. I'm looking forward to going away.”

In another interview with Sky Sports F1, Hamilton was asked to expand on his headline-making post-Qualifying comment that Ferrari should consider a driver change.

Pushed on whether he is finding it difficult to pick himself up, and whether he could help viewers understand his remarks, Hamilton said: “Not particularly. When you have a feeling, you have a feeling. There's a lot going on in the background that is not great.”

Meanwhile, F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali, who previously served as Ferrari's team boss, was keen to show his support for Hamilton amid the Briton's struggles.

“First of all, Lewis is a jewel, he is an incredible athlete, so no matter if it is a difficult moment, he will react, and I'm pretty sure he will show the reason why he is here,” noted Domenicali to Sky Sports F1.

“He wants to achieve his eighth title, and he will triumph again. So, stay with Lewis and he will do a great race, and be very, very strong after the summer [break].”

Hamilton's team mate, Charles Leclerc, finished Sunday's race in fourth position – the Monegasque leading away from pole position but dropping back as strategies played out and later confirming a chassis problem.

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

The Hungarian Grand Prix started in promising fashion for Charles Leclerc but ended in disappointment, the Monegasque having slipped backwards to P4.

Charles Leclerc has explained the problems behind his “extremely frustrating” drop-off in pace during the Hungarian Grand Prix, with the Monegasque – who had started from pole position – slipping backwards to fourth on a day where he had hoped to take a victory.

The race had started off well for Leclerc, having held the lead before also managing to keep McLaren's Oscar Piastri behind him during the first round of pit stops.

However, after Lando Norris put himself ahead of both via an alternative strategy, Leclerc looked to be struggling in the latter stages of the race and was soon overtaken by Piastri for second place.

The Ferrari driver then faced a challenge from George Russell in a battle for third and, as well as losing another position to the Mercedes driver, found himself with a five-second time penalty for driving erratically during the battle.

After crossing the line in P4, Leclerc cut a downbeat figure as he discussed what had happened to cause his lack of pace later on, with the issue turning out to be different to what the 27-year-old had initially thought.

“From around Lap 40 we had a problem with the chassis, so now I've had more details about it,” said Leclerc. “In the car obviously I had no idea what was going on. I mean I had an idea, but it was a wrong idea because I thought it was something that was in our control.

“Unfortunately we had an issue on the chassis, so I don't have much to add on that. It's just extremely frustrating when you are fighting for a win and when we had the pace that we had at the beginning of the race, and we lose absolutely everything later on, it's very frustrating.”

With the race bringing the first part of the season to a close, Leclerc was quizzed on what his mindset now is as the sport heads into its traditional summer break.

“Very disappointed,” he conceded. “I don't take any positives from this weekend when we ended the weekend like that.

“When we have one opportunity in a year to win a race, we need to take it and today we didn't. Now we will analyse what are the reasons why we had this problem. I don't think it's anything that we had in our control, but we'll check.”

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies has shared his reaction to the news that Max Verstappen will remain with the squad in 2026, as well as reflecting on what the plan might be for the second seat.

Laurent Mekies has shared his reaction to Max Verstappen confirming that he will remain at Red Bull in 2026, with the new Team Principal admitting that the news is “good for everyone to hear” following speculation over the Dutchman's future.

Despite holding a contract to race for the squad through to the end of 2028, Verstappen had been linked to Mercedes in recent times – rumours that were heightened when George Russell suggested that the team had been having “conversations” with the World Champion.

Verstappen was tight-lipped about the speculation when faced with questions during the British Grand Prix weekend last month – but the 27-year-old shut down any further talk on Thursday's media day in Hungary by stating: “I think it's time to basically stop all the rumours, and for me it's always been quite clear that I was staying anyway.”

Asked by Sky Sports F1 about Verstappen's decision to confirm his future, Mekies – who took over as Team Principal at Red Bull following the immediate departure of Christian Horner earlier in July – responded: “I don't think there was a real doubt, as far as the team is concerned.

“Max has been saying it over and over again, and we know what he wants – he wants the fast car. Now the fact that he said it a bit louder this time I guess is good for everyone to hear, but as far as we are concerned, he has always been a part and central to the team.”

The Hungarian Grand Prix weekend has not got off to the smoothest of starts for the Milton Keynes-based squad on the track, with Verstappen labelling Friday as “very tough” after struggling for grip at the wheel of the RB21.

Pushed on how vital Verstappen's experience is when it comes to turning the situation around during the weekend, Mekies conceded: “It is essential, I have to say.

“He knows when the car has been working, he knows when the car has not been working, and especially in a situation like that when it's not so much a balance issue, it's really like we are struggling to find the level of grip that we should be having here, and he's certainly a huge, huge help in these situations.”

While it is now clear that Verstappen will be racing for Red Bull in 2026, the identity of the team's second driver is less certain.

Yuki Tsunoda currently fills the spot after being promoted to the squad earlier in the season, but the campaign has so far been a tricky one for the Japanese driver.

When quizzed on whether he has given much thought as to who will take the second seat at the squad next year, Mekies answered: “The priority is give Yuki what he needs to perform. With regards to the second seat, that's where the priority is.

“It's what the team is concentrated on, they've been trying that for a number of races now. We are trying to find ways to make a further step. Spa was very positive, certainly from that perspective.

“Here it's a bit of a tricky weekend overall so it's probably more difficult to judge, but there is no reason why Yuki's performance cannot be what we have seen in the past and that's what we are concentrated on right now.”

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

McLaren completed a clean-sweep of fastest times in Free Practice for the Hungarian Grand Prix.

McLaren completed a clean-sweep of fastest times in Free Practice for the Hungarian Grand Prix, with Oscar Piastri heading team mate Lando Norris in Saturday's third and final session.

Piastri, who leads the Drivers' Championship by 16 points, posted a 1m 14.916s on Pirelli's soft tyre, which left him just 0.032s ahead of Norris, the Briton having topped both one-hour sessions on Friday at the Hungaroring.

The Ferrari of Charles Leclerc was third but some four tenths adrift of the leading time, ahead of team mate Lewis Hamilton and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, with reigning World Champion Max Verstappen still struggling for pace down in 12th.

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

Former title rivals Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton shared a dramatic, wheel-to-wheel moment during the Hungarian Grand Prix.

Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton came close to colliding during the Hungarian Grand Prix as the World Champions battled to better their disappointing grid positions.

On Lap 29 of Sunday's race, Verstappen got a run on Hamilton at the exit of Turn 3 and attempted a bold move down the inside of the high-speed Turn 4, where the Ferrari driver left the track and took to the run-off area.

Verstappen moved up to 11th in the process and, while the stewards noted and then investigated the incident post-race, they ultimately opted against penalising the Red Bull man, who went on to finish ninth.

“The driver of Car 1 (Verstappen) stated during the hearing that he had gained some momentum on Car 44 (Hamilton) out of Turn 3 with fresher tyres and used this momentum to make a move on the inside into Turn 4,” began the stewards' decision document.

“He further elaborated that he was in full control of his car and could have stayed further to the inside to leave space for Car 44 on the exit.

“However, he said as Car 44 had gone off track, he elected to use all of the track on the exit.

“The team representative of Car 44 confirmed that there was no contact between both cars and further stated that the driver of Car 44 chose not to attempt to remain on track.

“Taking all this into account, the stewards determine that there was no contact and that the incident does not qualify as forcing another car off track despite the ambitious nature of the overtaking attempt and take no further action.”

The rapper-singer claims he was supposed to audition for ""the second vampire"" in the Michael B. Jordan-led movie.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Machine Gun Kelly reveals he turned down his audition for Ryan Coogler's Sinners for one specific reason.


	The rapper-singer made a recent appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, where he shared that he decided not to audition for the role of “the second vampire” because he would have had to say the N-word.




	“There's been plenty of movies that come out that I was like, ah, I was supposed to be in that, or I did auditions for that. Like Sinners, I was supposed to be in that,” he explained. “The vampire, they had me set up to do the audition — it's the one that's in the house, so he's the second vampire, the one that the guy comes and eats the family. In the audition, he has to say the N-word and I wouldn't do it.”

	Kelly is likely referring to the role of Bert, a KKK member who was turned into a vampire. Peter Dreimanis ultimately played the part. Sinners, which also starred Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld and Miles Caton, became a surprise box office hit. The film follows twin brothers who return to their hometown in an attempt to leave their troubled lives behind, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting back home.


	Despite Sinners not working out for Kelly, the “Cliché” artist still has “a lot of aspirations to be in movies.” While “it just hasn't panned out that way” yet, Kelly knows he's “on universal timing. It'll align. The angels will put something in the works.”


	However, he would prefer “to be in cinema while I still look young,” quipping, “I would really like to be recruited into a movie while I still got some looks.”

	Also in the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200, TOMORROW X TOGETHER collects its seventh top 10-charted effort with the No. 3 debut of The Star Chapter: TOGETHER; YoungBoy Never Broke Again lands his sweet 16th top 10 with the No. 6 bow of MASA; and Tyler Childers achieves his highest-charted album (and third top 10) with the No. 7 launch of Snipe Hunter.

	











	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Aug. 9, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Aug. 5.

	Of I'm the Problem's 143,000 equivalent album units earned in the week ending July 31, SEA units comprise 137,000 (up 2%, equaling 180.43 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs — it leads Top Streaming Albums for a 10th nonconsecutive week), album sales comprise 5,000 (down 23% — it falls 15-16 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 30%).


	Cumulatively, Wallen's three No. 1 albums (I'm the Problem, One Thing at a Time and Dangerous: The Double Album) have spent a total of 38 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. That sum solely gives Wallen the fifth-most weeks at No. 1 among male artists in the chart's history, which dates to March 1956, when the chart began publishing on a regular weekly basis. He was previously tied with Harry Belafonte and Drake with 37 weeks each. Among male artists, the leaders are: Elvis Presley (67 weeks), Garth Brooks (52), Michael Jackson (51), Elton John (39), Wallen (38), Belafonte and  Drake (37 each). Among all artists, The Beatles have the most weeks at No. 1, with 132 across 19 No. 1 albums.


	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack returns to its peak on the Billboard 200, as it climbs 3-2 with 93,000 equivalent album units earned (up 4%) — its best week yet by units earned.


	TOMORROW X TOGETHER collects its seventh top 10-charted effort as The Star Chapter: TOGETHER debuts at No. 3. The set earned 65,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Album sales comprise 62,000 of that sum (it debuts at No. 1 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 3,000 (equaling 4.23 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The album's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across 24 CD variants (all with collectible ephemera, some randomized, inside its packaging).

	











Tyler, The Creator's DON'T TAP THE GLASS falls 1-4 in its second week on the Billboard 200, with 59,000 equivalent album units earned (down 70%). Justin Bieber's SWAG rises 6-5 (52,000, down 28%).


	YoungBoy Never Broke Again achieves his 16th top 10-charted album on the Billboard 200, as MASA enters at No. 6. The set earned 49,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with SEA units comprising 48,000 of that sum (equaling 69.15 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 4 on Top Streaming Albums). Album sales comprise a little under 1,000 (it was only available to purchase as a standard widely available digital download) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum.


	With a 16th top 10, YoungBoy Never Broke Again ties Jay-Z and Nas for the third-most top 10 albums among hip-hop artists. Only Future (with 18) and Drake (17) have more among hip-hop acts. (Among all artists, of all genres, The Rolling Stones have the most top 10s, with 38.)


	Tyler Childers scores his highest-charting album, and third top 10, on the Billboard 200 with the No. 7 launch of Snipe Hunter. The set earned 48,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Album sales comprise 27,000 of that sum (it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 20,500 (equaling 26.14 million on-demand official streams of its songs — it debuts at No. 20 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise about 500.


Snipe Hunter's first-week sales were aided by its availability across seven vinyl variants, along with a widely available standard CD and digital download.


	The album was preceded by the radio-promoted single “Nose on the Grindstone,” which climbs to No. 18 — a new peak — on the Adult Alternative Airplay chart.

	











	Rounding out the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200 are Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid (falling 5-8 with 47,000 equivalent album units, down 35%); JACKBOYS and Travis Scott's former No. 1 JACKBOYS 2 (4-9 with 46,000, down 41%); and Ozzy Osbourne's The Essential Ozzy Osbourne (7-10 with nearly 46,000, up 5%).

Refresh for latest…: There were a lot of moving parts at the global and international box office this weekend which was led for the studios by the sophomore frame of Marvel/Disney's The Fantastic Four: First Steps. 


	Amid a 54% dip from opening (-52% excluding China), the second overseas session added $39.6M for a running offshore cume of $170.3M and $368.7M worldwide. While domestic and international were essentially at parity in their weekend hauls, domestic is dominating the global total at 54%. As noted last weekend, the split is usually in the other direction, but Asia is a drag here.

	One Asian major that has been depressed for some time is seeing some specific bounce. Korea has a strong local title in the mix, but is also having a love affair with Brad Pitt-starrer F1. The Apple Original Films racing pic, via Warner Bros, continues to have mega-strong holds — increasing an incredible 36% in the 6th frame in the market. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	In total, the Joseph Kosinski-directed racing pic added $17.2M from 78 offshore markets this session (a 17% dip overall overseas versus last) to lift the overseas cume to $372.3M. Global is now $545.6M which makes F1 Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, surpassing World War Z.


	We will get into more detail on the above, but here's a quick snapshot of the other major titles in play.


	New this frame, and flying the flag for comedies, Paramount's The Naked Gun debuted to $11.5M from 46 early opening markets. This is 44% above Game Night and 36% over The Heat. The launch reps 73% of the international footprint, with 15 markets still to go including France, Brazil Australia and Spain.

	











	The Top 5 launches were the UK ($2.3M), Germany ($2.3M), Mexico ($674K), Netherlands ($590K) and Austria ($430K). 


	Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2, after debuting in just three overseas markets last weekend, expanded to 58 in this session. The frame was good for $16.3M which lifts the early overseas cume to $22.3M, and with domestic's bow, the running global total is $44.5M. 


	Note that major markets still to come include Brazil, China, Italy, Germany and Australia, as well as parts of Latin America and Asia.


	Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth, meanwhile, devoured another $16.2M in the 5th overseas frame; 35% off last weekend. That takes the offshore cume to $448.4M and global to $766M.


	Warner/DC's Superman, for its part, added $11.2M from 78 offshore markets for an overseas cume of $235M and $551.2M global.

But F1 is a flop right?
Right….
sigh…

There is a real possibility that F1 ends earning more worldwide til the end of its theatrical run then Superman and Fantastic 4… Incredible holds overseas. Well done

And still all 3 movies are flopping in theaters because of their outrageous budgets and marketing…

JW clearing 815 has to make Universal very happy. With How to Train Your Dragon, two good successes for them on their summer slate.

Superman on track for about $600 still, though maybe August doldrums help a bit. Neither a success nor a disaster but still not what they wanted.

F1 keeps on keeping on. Probably doesn't catch Superman but may actually stay close with the IMAX rerelease.

And tracking about $525 for FF? Hmmm. How do you make a sequel with that without Doomsday giving everything new life.

At least World War Z was some semblance of a box office hit.

F1 with its budget and box office isn't. Sorry to those who claim its a hit bit the math isn't mathing.

It's perhaps the comic book film genre's greatest conundrum: how do you crack the Fantastic Four? This weekend, despite positive word of mouth and a solid opening weekend haul, the quartet's latest — subtitled “First Steps” — tumbled 66% at the domestic box office. Undoubtedly, before Hollywood looks to craft the next adventure, they'll look back at what has worked before — and the most recent unequivocal success came from the simply titled “Fantastic Four” in 2005, which featured Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Iaon Gruffudd.

 










Now, “unequivocal,” to be fair, does not count reviews — “First Steps” has most certainly outpaced this older version in terms of critical reception. But the film grossed three times its budget and managed to produce a sequel in 2007 — “Rise of the Silver Surfer” — which also made money. Of course, after that, Marvel Studios became a thing, and something called the MCU happened. But at the center of it all was Gruffudd, originating the film role now played by man of the hour Pedro Pascal (if you don't count the notorious unreleased film from 1994). In a recent interview with Vulture, Gruffudd offered his fantastic wisdom, and what exactly it was like being in a comic book movie before the idea of a comic book universe was implemented.

“We couldn't have known what the future held for Marvel and the appetite for these films and the ability to make them as technology progresses,” Gruffudd said. “For us, we certainly felt that we were being true to the comic. The comics aren't as dark and violent as Blade and X-Men; they have a lighter, family feel. We believed we were a true representation of what was in Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's minds when they created it. And what's wonderful about the movie is it still resonates today amongst the tens of movies that are now in the Marvel Universe, and it holds up emotionally and technically.”

The tone — as Gruffudd notes — is a little less serious than many in the MCU, which embrace a certain level of grandeur that recalls the epics of Hollywood yore. But this is not to say that the idea of interconnectivity was not broached in 2005. One of the X-Men actually, nearly made a cameo in the movie — in a scene in which Reed was to turn into Wolverine (ala Hugh Jackman) to impress Sue Storm (Alba).

“I don't know why that didn't make it into the film. Paying homage to the great Hugh Jackman was quite a thrill because I absolutely love him as an actor and his Wolverine. I'm glad that it has a chance to exist somewhere. That was a reshoot, and I was in Vancouver on a soundstage and Jessica was in New York, so we weren't actually together, but we look perfectly in sync,” he explained.

 










As for why the series didn't continue, Gruffudd explains that “there was definitely that sort of momentum, and the plan was to do three movies, but these decisions are beyond my control.”

Perhaps in a potential sequel to this summer's hit, a recall to the Gruffudd era might conjure up the nostalgia comic book fans are craving. Certainly — as evidenced by Evans' brief return as Johnny Storm in “Deadpool vs. Wolverine” — the precedent exists to bring together those old 20th Century Fox Marvel projects together with their current incarnations (think “Spider-Man: No Way Home”).

“Fans are convinced that I'm going to be in a particular aspect of this universe that hasn't been written or filmed yet,” Gruffudd said. “But this idea of people showing up has been introduced, like Chris in ‘Deadpool'  or I think Mister Fantastic appeared in the guise of John Krasinski at one point. So, no, I haven't been approached to reprise Mister Fantastic. But you never know.”

Donald Trump‘s White House is not pursuing a campaign promise to mandate health insurance pay for in vitro fertilization (IVF), even though he pledged to do so multiple times on the 2024 campaign trail, The Washington Post reported Sunday.


	In order to mandate insurers pay for IVF treatments, it would require an act of Congress. Two sources with knowledge of internal White House discussions told the paper that the administration does not intend to ask legislators to draft a bill making IVF coverage mandatory. The paper's sources also said that forcing insurers to cover IVF is also not in the administration's plans.


	The White House's lack of action paints a stark contrast to the president's campaign promises.


	“I'm announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said on the campaign trail last August. “Because we want more babies, to put it nicely.”

	











	“We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump told NBC in an interview that same day.  “We're going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But Trump's vague campaign pledges did not include a plan for how to achieve that goal. 


	“There were no details provided by Trump during the campaign as to how this would work, who would be eligible and how it would relate to health insurance coverage,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, told The Post.

	











	Even if the Trump administration were to force insurers to pay for IVF coverage, the costs would be passed down to consumers through higher premiums. 


	“How do you do this without burdening health insurers? That's the key question they've been wrestling with,” one of the people familiar with the discussions told The Post. “It appears for now that they're not going to go there.”


	In February, Trump signed an executive order that he claimed would expand access to IVF, acknowledging that it can cost between $12,000 to $25,000 per cycle, that it may take multiple cycles to result in a pregnancy, and that only a quarter of employers and a handful of states cover it in their health insurance plans.

	The executive order requested a list of policy recommendations for “protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” But the deadline passed without such a list being made public, though it was reportedly delivered to the White House in May.


	“As exciting as the executive order was … it doesn't have any actual actions in it,” TJ Farnsworth, president of Fertility Providers Alliance and the founder of a chain of fertility clinics, told NBC News shortly after the deadline.


	For now, it looks like any actual actions to require IVF coverage are not forthcoming.

	The White House does, however, plan to redirect funds from a long-standing federal program that helps low-income women access birth control and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Instead, those funds will go to an “infertility training center” that promotes “holistic” approaches to combatting infertility, like classes teaching women about their menstrual cycles.

Donald Trump is angry and lashing out at radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God after the host spoke on Fox News about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and speculated it would cause a Republican Party “coup.”


	Trump lashed out, calling Charlamagne a “a Low IQ individual” who “has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done” in a Truth Social post very early Sunday morning.


	(In case you were wondering whether Trump is racist when slinging his “low IQ” insult, here is a list of other people he has recently called “low IQ”: Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Rep. Al Green.)


	“I think traditional conservatives are going to take the Republican Party back,” Charlamagne said in an interview with the president's daughter-in-law on her Fox News program, My View with Lara Trump. “I think there's a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren't paying attention to. I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back, I really do.

	“They know this is the issue that has gotten the base riled up,” he said. “The MAGA base isn't letting this issue go, and for the first time, they know they can probably take their party back and not piss off the MAGA base.”


	Charlamagne also told Lara Trump that he would vote again for Kamala Harris if given the chance.


	“The very wonderful and talented Lara Trump, whose show is a big ratings success, put racist sleazebag Charlamagne ‘The God' (Why is he allowed to use the word ‘GOD' when describing himself? Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname?)” Trump wrote.

	











	Trump has been in hot water with his base since the FBI and DOJ concluded in a memo last month that “no further disclosure” of the Epstein files “would be appropriate or warranted.” Trump and members of his administration had previously suggested they would release the contents of the files, including details about the billionaire sex trafficker's death by suicide in prison.

	Along with the memo, the administration released surveillance footage from outside Epstein's cell around the time of his death, but one minute was suspiciously missing.


	Since the memo's release, new details have emerged about the president's close friendship with Epstein as well as information that Trump himself is named in the files. Trump even said last week that Epstein “stole” one of his victims from Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort and spa, where she worked.


	Raising even more suspicion, the DOJ has been meeting with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and made the unprecedented move of transferring her to a minimum security facility while she serves a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Meanwhile, the Republican speaker of the house sent lawmakers home for a recess to avoid a vote on releasing the files, even though the speaker himself has called for the files to be made public. Last month, the House voted to block their release.


	Charlamagne also said that he hasn't seen significant changes for the better since Trump took office.


	“Right now people are hurting!” he said. “He campaigned on immediate change. Day one change.”

	What was meant to be Rod Stewart's in-concert tribute to Ozzy Osbourne has instead been met with criticism and ridicule after video of the tribute — featuring AI images of Osbourne and other gone-too-soon artists — emerged on social media.


	During Stewart's last handful of concerts since Osbourne's July 22 death, he has dedicated his song “Forever Young” to the Black Sabbath singer. However, what originally started as a normal tribute — with a simple image of Osbourne shown on the video screens — recently took a bizarre turn when “Forever Young” was accompanied by the AI Osbourne — in heaven with a selfie stick in hand — taking photos of himself with the likes of Freddie Mercury, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse.

A post shared by Sloane Steel (@iamsloanesteel)


	In addition to the selfies with Prince, Bob Marley, Tupac Shakur, and Whitney Houston, the perpetrator of the insensitive AI video also strangely decided to have Osbourne take photos with controversial artists like Michael Jackson and XXXtentacion.

	To add insult to the visual injury, Stewart told the Charlotte, North Carolina crowd following the “Forever Young” performance, “Very sad. A lot of those people died 'cause of drugs… I'm still here, though!,” the Charlotte Observer noted in their review of Stewart's July 29 show.

	Following news of Osbourne's death, Stewart wrote on Instagram, “Bye, bye Ozzy. Sleep well, my friend. I'll see you up there — later rather than sooner.”

WASHINGTON — Comedian Matt Rife says he is officially now the ""legal guardian"" of the allegedly haunted Annabelle doll.

The 29-year-old comedian announced on social media on Friday that he and his friend Elton Castee have purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home, along with their haunted collection. 

""If you know me, you know I'm obsessed with the paranormal and all things haunted. You also may know The Conjuring films are my favorite scary movies of all time. So I'm incredibly honored to have taken over one of the most prominent properties in paranormal history,"" Rife said. ""Ed and Lorain Warren arguably put demonology and paranormal into the mainstream and are the very heart of some of the most famous haunted stories of all time, The Conjuring House, Amityville Horror, et…"" 

The 29-year-old also revealed his future plans for the Occult Museum. 

""We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place,"" he added. 

A post shared by Matt Rife (@mattrife)

Rife said him and Castee are the ""legal guardians"" of the supposedly haunted collection for ""at least five years."" 

Castee, who is a self-proclaimed ghost hunter, teased the purchase on his social media earlier this week. 

""@mattrife & I have officially bought the world's most haunted location,"" Castee said on social media. ""We've been working on this nearly all year & it is finally happening  I am making sure this will be the best paranormal investigation location on the planet.""

Annabelle is a supposedly haunted Raggedy Ann doll which, according to rumor, became supernaturally active sometime in the 1970s. 

The Warrens, who make a living investigating paranormal phenomenon and writing about them, say they were contacted by a student nurse in 1970 about issues with the doll. 

The student was given the doll as a gift, but it quickly began acting strangely, and a psychic told her that it was inhabited by the ghost of a girl named ""Annabelle."" According to the legend, the student and her roommate tried to live with the doll's growing supernatural nature as it appeared and disappeared seemingly at random. 

Eventually, the doll began showing aggressive behavior, fixating on a friend of the roommates named Lou. Threatening notes were left to Lou on parchment, despite nobody in the house having any on hand, and on at least one occasion, Lou reported being attacked physically by the doll. It reportedly scratched him across the chest and tried to strangle him. 

The Warrens were called in and determined the doll had been demonically possessed. They then took the doll to house it safely in their paranormal museum.

Rumors began circulating in May that Annabelle had gone missing in the midst of a paranormal tour across the U.S. with some other items from the Warrens' collection. 

But video evidence shows the doll, which isn't supposed to be moved in order to avoid antagonizing the malevolent spirit inside, safely back at home behind glass at the Warrens' Occult Museum in Connecticut. 

During July, one of the lead tour guides and paranormal educators on the Annabelle doll tour passed away suddenly after bringing the doll to Pennsylvania as part of a paranormal tour series.

In a twist that sounds straight out of a horror movie—and just as much like an elaborate prank—comedian Matt Rife has officially become the “legal guardian” of paranormal's most notorious resident: the Annabelle doll. Yep, Matt Rife, the rising standup comic with a huge Gen Z following, announced this week that he's in charge of Ed and Lorraine Warren's entire mysterious haunted artifact collection, including the doll that inspired the Conjuring and Annabelle blockbuster horror flicks.

 

 

Rife broke the news on Instagram and TikTok, gleefully letting fans know that he, together with online ghost-hunter Elton Castee, purchased the legendary Connecticut home once owned by the late Warrens—real-life paranormal investigators and the inspiration behind some of pop culture's favorite horror tales.

 

But here's the kicker: while Rife and Castee own the house and can show off the chilling Occult Museum, they don't actually own the haunted artifacts inside. Instead, they're appointed as “legal guardians and caretakers” of these items for at least the next five years. That list includes over 750 spooky objects, crowned by the world-famous Annabelle doll, still locked away in a glass case (for now). Their plan? Reopen the Warren Museum—closed since Lorraine Warren's death in 2019—for overnight ghost stays and guided tours where anyone brave enough can get chills up close and personal.

 

Annabelle isn't just any doll. Her legacy began in the 1970s, when a nursing student received her as a gift and soon reported strange—and sometimes violent—phenomena. The Warrens stepped in, determined the doll housed an evil spirit, and ever since, Annabelle has been kept under tight lock and key at the Warren Museum, glowing under an ominous red light. Her creepy reputation inspired a wave of horror movies and memeable supernatural speculation—she's the ultimate pop-culture boogeyman.

 

Rife didn't waste time hyping up what's next for Annabelle and the haunted collection. In his words, “Ed and Lorraine Warren arguably put demonology and the paranormal into the mainstream…We plan to open the house for overnight stays and museum tours so you yourself can experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place”. For Rife, who has said The Conjuring is his favorite horror series, it's a dream come true—and, judging by the giddy posts, maybe the weirdest “life flex” any stand-up comic's ever bragged about.

 

There's already buzz about whether Rife can actually keep the paranormal at bay. After all, the world's most haunted objects—and Annabelle especially—might not be the best roommates for a comic who's used to slaying crowds, not slaying ghosts.

 

The Annabelle legend got an extra jolt of drama just weeks ahead of Rife's announcement. Social media was set ablaze with rumors that the doll had gone missing during a recent Louisiana paranormal tour, prompting panic and jokes alike. The frenzy escalated after well-known doll-handler Dan Rivera died suddenly on the road. Some fans even claimed the doll “vanished” from his hotel room, fueling wild speculation that Annabelle had made another escape bid.

 

But not to worry (or maybe worry more?)—live feeds and museum staff soon shared footage of Annabelle safely in her glass box in Connecticut. The notorious doll, it seems, was never far from home despite the internet's freakout.

 

The Warren Museum, once the heart of Ed and Lorraine Warren's lifelong pursuit of the paranormal, is ground zero for haunted Americana. From cursed necklaces and vampire coffins to the infamous Annabelle, the (recently closed) museum drew horror buffs and thrill-seekers from all over the world. Lorraine Warren, who passed away in April 2019, was celebrated as a true trailblazer for ghost hunters, co-authoring books and inspiring an entire genre of movies.

 

As for Rife, stepping into the Warrens' shoes puts him at the center of modern supernatural lore. Will he bring new eyes—and maybe new believers—to the spooky world of haunted collecting? Or will Annabelle start pulling any pranks of her own? For now, one thing's literally locked in: the Annabelle doll isn't going anywhere…unless she decides to.

In a groundbreaking study, scientists have simulated the harsh conditions of cryovolcanic activity found on icy moons such as Europa and Enceladus. By recreating these environments in the laboratory, researchers aim to better understand how such geological processes could potentially reveal signs of ancient microbial life. This effort is not just about understanding space phenomena but also about guiding future exploratory missions that could one day uncover life beyond Earth.

Cryovolcanism is a process where water and other volatiles erupt from beneath the surface of icy moons, reshaping them much like lava does on Earth. This type of volcanic activity is significant for planetary scientists, as it could indicate the presence of subsurface oceans that might harbor life. The research team focused on replicating these processes in a controlled environment to gain insight into their dynamics.

The Large Dirty Mars Chamber, affectionately known as ‘George,' was employed to simulate the low-pressure conditions prevalent on moons like Europa and Enceladus. By observing water behavior under these conditions, the team discovered that water can simultaneously boil and freeze due to the near-zero pressure. This duality is crucial for understanding how the moons' surfaces are continually reshaped by cryovolcanic activity.

“Nature Already Solved This” as Scientists Use Plant-Based Design to Reinvent Plastic and Fuel Fierce Clash Over Eco Hype Versus Real-World Impact



Effusive cryovolcanism, akin to lava flows on our planet, involves the gentle release of liquid water onto a moon's surface. This process has been notoriously difficult to observe directly, prompting scientists to recreate it in the laboratory. The research team's findings suggest that water, when introduced into their low-pressure chamber, begins to bubble and form vapors, leading to cooling and subsequent freezing.

The resulting ice layer, thin and fragile, is often disrupted by underlying boiling water, allowing liquid to escape through cracks. This phenomenon challenges previous studies that assumed a thick ice crust would prevent further boiling. By understanding these mechanisms, scientists can better predict where to search for signs of life on icy moons.

China Stuns the World With a “Terrifying New Weapon” That Launches Missiles at Mach 7 Using Cutting-Edge Electromagnetic Railgun Technology



Europa and Enceladus are among the most promising candidates in the quest for extraterrestrial life within our Solar System. Europa's vast subsurface ocean and Enceladus' explosive geysers make them prime targets for exploration. The presence of liquid water, a crucial ingredient for life as we know it, raises the possibility of finding microbial organisms.

The new research offers a framework for identifying ancient cryovolcanic activity, which could be a marker for life. By focusing on regions with active or past cryovolcanism, future missions could prioritize these areas, increasing the likelihood of detecting life. This study provides a vital tool for guiding those missions and refining the search parameters for extraterrestrial life.

The insights gained from simulating cryovolcanic activity have broad implications for our understanding of the Solar System. By knowing where and how cryovolcanism occurs, space agencies can design more targeted missions to icy moons. These missions could employ advanced instruments to analyze the composition of ejected materials and detect biological markers.

Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in space exploration. Combining expertise from geology, atmospheric science, and astrobiology, researchers can develop comprehensive models that enhance our understanding of extraterrestrial environments. This holistic approach is crucial as we stand on the brink of potentially discovering life beyond our planet.

As we continue to explore the mysteries of our Solar System, the question remains: How close are we to finding signs of life on these distant worlds, and what would such a discovery mean for humanity's place in the universe?

So, are we saying that boiling water on Europa might be a hot tub for aliens? 🤔

Wow, this is mind-blowing! Can't wait to see what they find. 🚀

Isn't it risky to assume life can only exist in conditions similar to Earth?

Thank you for the fascinating article! Keep up the great work, NASA. 🌌

Is the Large Dirty Mars Chamber really called ‘George'? 😂 That's hilarious!

Are there any missions planned soon to actually test these findings on Europa or Enceladus?

What if the aliens are just waiting for us to discover them? 👽

So cool! I love reading about space exploration. More articles like this, please!

What's the next step after these simulations? More lab work or actual space missions?

Is it possible for life to exist in such extreme conditions? Seems unlikely to me.

      The recent pre-publication on the research on the images from the First Palomar Sky Study contains the ”earth shadow test”. The researchers analysed 106,339 transients in the northern hemisphere, and showed that transients are far less prevalent in the earths shadow. This would mean that the transients are in fact real objects, and can only be seen when lit up by the sun.
    


      In the sampled altitude of 42,164 kilometers, the expected number was 1223 but only 349 were found. The probability of this occuring by chance is less than 1 in 1 000 000 000 000 000, one in a quadrillion. It is as certain that these things are real as it is certain that the sun will rise tomorrow, and the day after that, for a billion years.
    


      If i dropped a grain of sand on the beach and you came to pick it up the next day, the likelihood of you picking the correct one is as unlikely as these objects being plate defects.
    


      Edit: It seems that Beatrice Villarroel and colleagues have found even more evidence that there are far fewer transients in the earths shadow.

Explosions and smoke were observed today by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team at Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, stemming from a nearby auxiliary facility that the plant reported was under attack.

The Zaporizhzhia plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe and one of the 10 largest globally, has been under Russian occupation since March 2022.

The IAEA team heard the blasts and saw smoke coming from the direction of the facility, according to Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. The plant's staff informed the team that the auxiliary site was struck by shelling and drones starting around 9 a.m. local time, coinciding with military activity audible to the IAEA personnel. 

Smoke from the targeted area remained visible to the team into the afternoon, despite the facility being located 1,200 meters from the plant's site perimeter. The incident is the latest in a string of recent events highlighting the persistent nuclear safety risks stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine.

“Any attack in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant – regardless of the intended target – poses potential risks also for nuclear safety and must be avoided,” Grossi said. ""Once again, I call for maximum military restraint near nuclear facilities to prevent the continued risk of a nuclear accident.""

Meanwhile, Russia also appears to be constructing power lines in occupied southern Ukraine, a move that could link the Zaporizhzhia plant to Russia's energy grid, the New York Times reported on May 27, citing a new Greenpeace report.

Satellite imagery featured in the Greenpeace report indicates that since early February 2025, Russian forces have laid over 80 kilometers (49 miles) of high-voltage lines along the Sea of Azov coastline, connecting occupied Mariupol and Berdyansk. 

Experts from Greenpeace believe this construction aims to connect these new lines to a major substation near Mariupol, which could then be linked to the Zaporizhzhia plant, located approximately 225 kilometers (139 miles) away.

Argentine Francisco Cerundolo was forced to retire early into the second set of his night match with Alexander Zverev in Toronto Saturday night due to an abdominal strain.

The No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings began the match with kinesiology tape on his abs and was treated by the physio after the fifth game, after which he was unable to serve anywhere near top speed.








Later, in highly unusual scenes, Zverev embraced and consoled Cerundolo on the 5-4 changeover before serving out the set.

Cerundolo, who had only retired twice in his tour-level career (both times in 2023), played one additional game in the second set before stopping play.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Lajal's emotional day: Saving 5 MPs & dedicating Challenger title to late grandfather","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/lajal-challenger-2025-feature","Sun, 03 Aug 2025 19:06:23 GMT","

Mark Lajal delivered a courageous performance to dramatically fend off five championship points to win the Bloomfield Hills Challenger and capture his second title at ATP Challenger Tour level. That same day, thousands of miles away in Estonia, Lajal's grandfather, Tõnu, was laid to rest.


Lajal wrote an Instagram post, dedicating his biggest career trophy to his grandfather, who was closely following the 22-year-old's career. The Estonian received the difficult news while in Los Cabos, where he was in the qualifying draw for the ATP 250.


“Definitely the first couple of days, you think about him, you think about the fact that you're never going to talk to him again,” Lajal told ATPTour.com, speaking about the loss of his grandfather. “It's a bizarre feeling. It's something you're not really used to and you gotta learn to live with it I guess.”


One of Lajal's fondest memories with his grandfather came earlier this season, when Tõnu was able to watch Estonia win a Davis Cup tie against Venezuela. It was the final time Tõnu saw his beloved grandson compete in person, a moment now even more meaningful following Tõnu's passing.


""He came to watch that match I played in Estonia and he really enjoyed it,” Lajal said. “That was definitely a nice memory, that he was there for the win.”


As Tõnu's health declined, Lajal continued to make his grandfather — and entire family — proud by his progress on the ATP Challenger Tour. But the quick, yet inevitable, timing of his Tõnu's passing presented a challenge while on the road.


“I think I handled it quite well because we all kind of knew that it was going to happen sooner or later. He was getting old and it was unfortunate, his health was getting worse,” Lajal said. “I didn't expect it to happen this soon, but I had already accepted that the timing was coming.”




After leaving Los Cabos, Lajal travelled to the ATP Challenger Tour 100 event in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where he eventually saved five championship points — four behind his own serve — to dispatch Andres Martin 6-7(7), 7-5, 7-6(9) after a three-hour, 22-minute battle. Lajal lifted the trophy in the air and looked up to the sky.


“It was very nice to do it because they had a ‘sending away' with our family in Estonia on the day of the final,” said Lajal, now at a career-high No. 147 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “I think everything was perfect timing.”

'We risked a little bit and it worked out perfectly' - Norris surprised to win tough race

Leclerc explains 'issue with chassis' was reason for lack of pace during race

Oscar Piastri gave his reaction to missing out on pole position for the Hungarian Grand Prix to Charles Leclerc.

Formula 1 Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri admits he ""wasn't expecting to be second to a Ferrari"" in Qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, following Charles Leclerc's shock pole position.

Piastri and McLaren team mate Lando Norris had dominated all three practice sessions and the opening two segments of Qualifying on Saturday, but fell short at the very end and will start second and third respectively.

""Charles has been quick all weekend and even this morning he was closer than we expected,"" said Piastri after missing out on pole by just 0.026s.

""Things just changed a little bit and I guess he did a very good job, so well done to him. I wasn't expecting to be second to a Ferrari this weekend, but he's done a good job. It's going to be a fun race tomorrow with a bit more involved.""

The Australian failed to improve with his final effort in Q3, and along with other drivers believed the change in wind direction and track temperature played a pivotal role in the outcome of pole position.

""It always sounds so pathetic blaming things on the wind, but the wind basically did a 180 from Q2 to Q3 and just meant a lot of the corners felt completely different,"" said Piastri.

""My first lap in Q3 felt pretty terrible because I wasn't used to it, and then I thought the second lap was a lot better but it was even slower.

""Difficult to judge in those conditions and maybe not the best execution, but I was a bit surprised that we couldn't go quicker than that.""

Norris echoed the same comments as his team mate, having fallen 0.041s short of taking top spot for Sunday's 70-lap race.

""Charles did a good job on the last lap, [he] probably risked a little bit more in these conditions,"" said Norris.

""The conditions changed a lot and really seemed to punish us in a bigger way. Not too many complaints, we thought we both did some good laps at the end and we were just slow, so nothing to complain of but Charles did a good job.""

The Briton sits 16 points behind Piastri in the Drivers' Championship having finished behind him last time out in Belgium, and admitted the focus was on getting the win regardless of his starting position.

""I want to go forwards and I want to win, and if I can do that then I'll get points,"" said Norris.

""I think it's going to be an exciting race, I would expect us to have a bit more pace than Charles, so I'm looking forward to it.""

The actor and pop star recently ended their nine-year relationship.


													By
												

	Mitchell Peters



Orlando Bloom is taking things in stride amid rumors that his ex Katy Perry has moved on with former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.


	On Friday (Aug. 1), satirical news site The Onion shared a fictional article on Instagram with the headline, “Orlando Bloom Spotted at Dinner With Angela Merkel.” The post featured what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the 48-year-old English actor enjoying a candlelit dinner with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 71.


	“Just weeks after announcing his split with fiancée Katy Perry, English actor Orlando Bloom was photographed Friday dining with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,” The Onion‘s mock report read. “'Angela kept Orlando laughing all night — he couldn't keep his eyes off her!'said an insider source who spotted the pair sipping wine, slurping oysters, and splitting a decadent piece of chocolate layer cake at a Michelin-starred restaurant.”


	Bloom took the joke in good humor, responding in the comments with several clapping emojis.

	The spoof came shortly after Perry, 40, and Trudeau, 53, were spotted together on multiple occasions in late July, including dining out in Montreal and walking a dog through Mount Royal Park. Trudeau was also seen enthusiastically singing along to Perry's hit “Firework” during her Lifetimes Tour stop at Montreal's Bell Centre.




	The sightings have sparked speculation about a possible romance, especially following confirmation that Perry and Bloom have ended their relationship after nine years. The couple, who share a daughter, Daisy Dove, have pledged to remain focused on co-parenting.


	“Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting,” the pair's reps told Billboard in early July, shortly after which the exes appeared together in a photo from a family vacation with their children. “They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is — and always will be — raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.”


	Trudeau also went through a public breakup in August 2023, splitting from estranged wife Sophie Gregoire, with whom he has three kids.
