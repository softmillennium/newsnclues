                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What was meant to be Rod Stewart's in-concert tribute to Ozzy Osbourne has instead been met with criticism and ridicule after video of the tribute — featuring AI images of Osbourne and other gone-too-soon artists — emerged on social media. During Stewart's last handful of concerts since Osbourne's July 22 death, he has dedicated his song “Forever Young” to the Black Sabbath singer. However, what originally started as a normal tribute — with a simple image of Osbourne shown on the video screens — recently took a bizarre turn when “Forever Young” was accompanied by the AI Osbourne — in heaven with a selfie stick in hand — taking photos of himself with the likes of Freddie Mercury, Kurt Cobain, and Amy Winehouse. In addition to the selfies with Prince, Bob Marley, Tupac Shakur, and Whitney Houston, the perpetrator of the insensitive AI video also strangely decided to have Osbourne take photos with controversial artists like Michael Jackson and XXXtentacion. ‘Grow Up': Conservative Senators, Economists Slam Trump for Firing Labor Stats Chief Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Wilco, Lucinda Williams Storm Jones Beach at Outlaw Festival Tory Lanez Ordered to Pay Megan Thee Stallion's Legal Fees For 'Disruptive' Deposition I'll see you up there — later rather than sooner.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amid a 54% dip from opening (-52% excluding China), the second overseas session added $39.6M for a running offshore cume of $170.3M and $368.7M worldwide. While domestic and international were essentially at parity in their weekend hauls, domestic is dominating the global total at 54%. As noted last weekend, the split is usually in the other direction, but Asia is a drag here. 'Fantastic Four: First Steps' $40M 2nd Frame, 'Bad Guys 2' $22M+, 'Naked Gun' Good $17M Post Covid Comedy Opening, 'Together' $10M+ 5-day - Box Office Update Ioan Gruffudd Reflects On Third 'Fantastic Four' Movie That Never Got Made: "These Decisions Are Beyond My Control" Korea has a strong local title in the mix, but is also having a love affair with Brad Pitt-starrer F1. In total, the Joseph Kosinski-directed racing pic added $17.2M from 78 offshore markets this session (a 17% dip overall overseas versus last) to lift the overseas cume to $372.3M. Global is now $545.6M which makes F1 Brad Pitt's highest-grossing movie ever worldwide, surpassing World War Z. We will get into more detail on the above, but here's a quick snapshot of the other major titles in play. New this frame, and flying the flag for comedies, Paramount's The Naked Gun debuted to $11.5M from 46 early opening markets. This is 44% above Game Night and 36% over The Heat. The launch reps 73% of the international footprint, with 15 markets still to go including France, Brazil Australia and Spain. Universal/DreamWorks Animation's The Bad Guys 2, after debuting in just three overseas markets last weekend, expanded to 58 in this session. Note that major markets still to come include Brazil, China, Italy, Germany and Australia, as well as parts of Latin America and Asia. Universal/Amblin's Jurassic World Rebirth, meanwhile, devoured another $16.2M in the 5th overseas frame; 35% off last weekend. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. There is a real possibility that F1 ends earning more worldwide til the end of its theatrical run then Superman and Fantastic 4… Incredible holds overseas. JW clearing 815 has to make Universal very happy. With How to Train Your Dragon, two good successes for them on their summer slate. Superman on track for about $600 still, though maybe August doldrums help a bit. Probably doesn't catch Superman but may actually stay close with the IMAX rerelease. How do you make a sequel with that without Doomsday giving everything new life. At least World War Z was some semblance of a box office hit. F1 with its budget and box office isn't.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How is this for an ironic twist — as Stephen Colbert is preparing to say goodbye as the host of CBS‘ The Late Show, he also is portraying a late-night host for CBS with a guest role on the upcoming third season of the network's crime anthology Elsbeth, Deadline has confirmed. Colbert is not playing himself in the episode, which filmed this week. Each episode of Elsbeth solves a different murder; it is unclear how Bristol is connected to that case of the week. 'Big Brother' Season 27 Multiplatform Viewership Up 9% In First 2 Weeks Primetime series take months of lead time from conceiving an episode to its filming, Colbert's appearance is believed to stem from a handshake “deal” he made with Wendell Pierce during the Elsbeth star's appearance on The Late Show in February. After Colbert professed that he had long been asking CBS to play a corpse on one of the network's crime dramas, Pierce promised to help. “I can make that happen,” he said, referring to Season 3 of Elsbeth, which had just been picked up. We can get you on,” he added. The jokey exchange led to real discussions and Colbert's appearance on Elsbeth. The role of Bristol is believed to have been written for him. Elsbeth, from Robert and Michelle King and CBS Studios, is headlined by Carrie Preston reprising her role from The Good Wife. Notable guest stars over the show's first two seasons include Nathan Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick and Retta. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. This weekend, despite positive word of mouth and a solid opening weekend haul, the quartet's latest — subtitled “First Steps” — tumbled 66% at the domestic box office. Undoubtedly, before Hollywood looks to craft the next adventure, they'll look back at what has worked before — and the most recent unequivocal success came from the simply titled “Fantastic Four” in 2005, which featured Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis, and Iaon Gruffudd. Now, “unequivocal,” to be fair, does not count reviews — “First Steps” has most certainly outpaced this older version in terms of critical reception. But the film grossed three times its budget and managed to produce a sequel in 2007 — “Rise of the Silver Surfer” — which also made money. Of course, after that, Marvel Studios became a thing, and something called the MCU happened. In a recent interview with Vulture, Gruffudd offered his fantastic wisdom, and what exactly it was like being in a comic book movie before the idea of a comic book universe was implemented. Related Stories It's Time for Millennials to Make Lindsay Lohan a Movie Star Again Liam Neeson Did Not Attempt ‘Naked Gun' Leslie Nielsen Impression: ‘I Trusted the Script' We believed we were a true representation of what was in Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's minds when they created it. Paying homage to the great Hugh Jackman was quite a thrill because I absolutely love him as an actor and his Wolverine. I'm glad that it has a chance to exist somewhere. That was a reshoot, and I was in Vancouver on a soundstage and Jessica was in New York, so we weren't actually together, but we look perfectly in sync,” he explained. As for why the series didn't continue, Gruffudd explains that “there was definitely that sort of momentum, and the plan was to do three movies, but these decisions are beyond my control.” Perhaps in a potential sequel to this summer's hit, a recall to the Gruffudd era might conjure up the nostalgia comic book fans are craving. Certainly — as evidenced by Evans' brief return as Johnny Storm in “Deadpool vs. Wolverine” — the precedent exists to bring together those old 20th Century Fox Marvel projects together with their current incarnations (think “Spider-Man: No Way Home”). “Fans are convinced that I'm going to be in a particular aspect of this universe that hasn't been written or filmed yet,” Gruffudd said. “But this idea of people showing up has been introduced, like Chris in ‘Deadpool'  or I think Mister Fantastic appeared in the guise of John Krasinski at one point. So, no, I haven't been approached to reprise Mister Fantastic. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump is angry and lashing out at radio host and author Charlamagne Tha God after the host spoke on Fox News about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and speculated it would cause a Republican Party “coup.” Trump lashed out, calling Charlamagne a “a Low IQ individual” who “has no idea what words are coming out of his mouth, and knows nothing about me or what I have done” in a Truth Social post very early Sunday morning. (In case you were wondering whether Trump is racist when slinging his “low IQ” insult, here is a list of other people he has recently called “low IQ”: Vice President Kamala Harris, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Rep. Al Green.) “I think traditional conservatives are going to take the Republican Party back,” Charlamagne said in an interview with the president's daughter-in-law on her Fox News program, My View with Lara Trump. “I think there's a political coup going on right now in the Republican Party that people aren't paying attention to. I think this Epstein thing is going to be a way for traditional conservatives to take their party back, I really do. Charlamagne also told Lara Trump that he would vote again for Kamala Harris if given the chance. Can anyone imagine the uproar there would be if I used that nickname? Trump has been in hot water with his base since the FBI and DOJ concluded in a memo last month that “no further disclosure” of the Epstein files “would be appropriate or warranted.” Trump and members of his administration had previously suggested they would release the contents of the files, including details about the billionaire sex trafficker's death by suicide in prison. Raising even more suspicion, the DOJ has been meeting with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and made the unprecedented move of transferring her to a minimum security facility while she serves a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. Last month, the House voted to block their release. Charlamagne also said that he hasn't seen significant changes for the better since Trump took office. ‘Grow Up': Conservative Senators, Economists Slam Trump for Firing Labor Stats Chief Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Wilco, Lucinda Williams Storm Jones Beach at Outlaw Festival Tory Lanez Ordered to Pay Megan Thee Stallion's Legal Fees For 'Disruptive' Deposition Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Orlando Bloom is taking things in stride amid rumors that his ex Katy Perry has moved on with former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “Just weeks after announcing his split with fiancée Katy Perry, English actor Orlando Bloom was photographed Friday dining with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,” The Onion‘s mock report read. “'Angela kept Orlando laughing all night — he couldn't keep his eyes off her! The spoof came shortly after Perry, 40, and Trudeau, 53, were spotted together on multiple occasions in late July, including dining out in Montreal and walking a dog through Mount Royal Park. Trudeau was also seen enthusiastically singing along to Perry's hit “Firework” during her Lifetimes Tour stop at Montreal's Bell Centre. The couple, who share a daughter, Daisy Dove, have pledged to remain focused on co-parenting. “Orlando and Katy have been shifting their relationship over the past many months to focus on co-parenting,” the pair's reps told Billboard in early July, shortly after which the exes appeared together in a photo from a family vacation with their children. “They will continue to be seen together as a family, as their shared priority is — and always will be — raising their daughter with love, stability and mutual respect.” Trudeau also went through a public breakup in August 2023, splitting from estranged wife Sophie Gregoire, with whom he has three kids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After four years, the stars of Freeform‘s The Bold Type are itching for a Scarlet Magazine reunion. Katie Stevens, who played budding editor Jane Sloan in the Sarah Watson-created series, recently expressed her interest in reprising the role for a movie with co-stars Meghann Fahy and Aisha Dee. Me, Meghann, and Aisha, every interview we do separately, we talk about how we want to do something Bold Type-related again, to do a movie or something,” she told People. “We're all primed and ready to do it.” Stevens added, “So I'm just like, ‘We just need to get it out there that we want to do it and then have fans rally.' Because there's a lot of remakes of things happening and spinoffs of things, and I'm just like, ‘Let's just do a Bold Type Hulu original movie or something! Inspired by Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, The Bold Type ran for five seasons from 2017 to 2021, following Jane (Stevens), Kat (Aisha) and Sutton (Fahy), three work besties who juggle life, love and career while working at fictional women's magazine, Scarlet. “And it means so much to me that we are champions of one another no matter what is going on in life.” “But I think it's a privilege of having the information that you are ending…it allowed us to be intentional in real life when filming the show,” said Stevens at ATX Television Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After weeks of hinting about a big move for their family, Hallmark star Brant Daugherty revealed on August 2, 2025, that he and his wife, Kimberly, have moved from Los Angeles to Italy with their two young sons — Wilder, 4, and Aero, 1. Posting from their new upper level home in a charming Italian town, Brant wrote, “La nostra casa nuova 😍” — which, translated into English, means “Welcome to our new home.” “We spent months packing, cleaning, prepping and moving,” he continued, “but we're finally settled into our new home and let me tell you, I love this place already. And the violin player outside is a nice touch. Brant rose to fame playing Noel Kahn on “Pretty Little Liars” and has starred in multiple Hallmark movies since 2018, including 2024's “Trivia at St. Nick's.” Kimberly, meanwhile, is an actress who's written and produced Hallmark movies like 2023's “Christmas in Bethlehem, PA” and “Joyeux Noel,” which Brant co-wrote and starred in. Although Brant didn't give a reason for their family's move, he did reveal two months prior that he'd obtained dual citizenship in Italy, celebrating the milestone with his wife at a Festa della Repubblica event in Beverly Hills to commemorate the day in 1946 when Italy voted to become a republic. “Five years ago, we started a journey to seek out dual citizenship and learn more about my Italian family and heritage,” he shared on Instagram in June. “Very grateful to my lovely wife @kimdaugherty_ for spearheading this whole thing,” he continued, “and getting us in touch with a side of my family I'd never explored. I love that we get to share this with our sons.” The Daughertys have shared their love of Italy over the years, including sharing pics and videos from a trip there in July 2023 with their son Wilder. Brant teased his family's impending move on July 14, posting a time-lapse video of himself getting their Los Angeles house ready to sell. But what matters is that we're still together for the next exciting chapter ahead. On July 30, he posted a series of photos from their last days in Los Angeles and wrote, “Our last week before moving. In mid-July, Deadline reported that Brant's next project is the feature film “By the Roots,” a “queer feminist biopic” co-starring Ally Sheedy, Emily Robinson, and Margaret Cho.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump‘s White House is not pursuing a campaign promise to mandate health insurance pay for in vitro fertilization (IVF), even though he pledged to do so multiple times on the 2024 campaign trail, The Washington Post reported Sunday. In order to mandate insurers pay for IVF treatments, it would require an act of Congress. Two sources with knowledge of internal White House discussions told the paper that the administration does not intend to ask legislators to draft a bill making IVF coverage mandatory. “I'm announcing today in a major statement that under the Trump administration, your government will pay for — or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for — all costs associated with IVF treatment,” Trump said on the campaign trail last August. “We are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,” Trump told NBC in an interview that same day. But Trump's vague campaign pledges did not include a plan for how to achieve that goal. “There were no details provided by Trump during the campaign as to how this would work, who would be eligible and how it would relate to health insurance coverage,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, told The Post. “It appears for now that they're not going to go there.” The executive order requested a list of policy recommendations for “protecting IVF access and aggressively reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.” But the deadline passed without such a list being made public, though it was reportedly delivered to the White House in May. For now, it looks like any actual actions to require IVF coverage are not forthcoming. ‘Grow Up': Conservative Senators, Economists Slam Trump for Firing Labor Stats Chief Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Wilco, Lucinda Williams Storm Jones Beach at Outlaw Festival Tory Lanez Ordered to Pay Megan Thee Stallion's Legal Fees For 'Disruptive' Deposition The White House does, however, plan to redirect funds from a long-standing federal program that helps low-income women access birth control and testing for sexually transmitted infections.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marvel's The Fantastic Four: First Steps easily stayed atop the domestic box office chart in its second weekend with $40 million, but tumbled a worrisome 66 percent. That's more than anyone could have predicted after the event pic opening to $117.6 million last weekend amid stellar audience and critical reaction. And there's still a clear runway ahead before summer ends. Fantastic Four had hoped to clear $200 million domestically through Sunday, but instead is projecting a 10-day domestic tally of $198.4 million, compared to cume of $236.2 million and a drop of 53 percent for DC Studos' Superman in its second weekend (to be fair,  the Man of Steel didn't have another superpic to compete with, although Jurassic Park Rebirth had only opened a week earlier). Box Office: 'Bad Guys 2,' 'Naked Gun' Scoring Solid Openings as 'Fantastic Four' Stays No. Cinemark Sees Quarterly Revenue, Earnings Jump on Strong Summer Box Office In North America, Fantastic Four had no trouble fending off Universal/DreamWorks Animation's new family pic The Bad Guys 2 and Paramount's comedy Naked Gun, which opened in second and third place, respectively. Bad Guys 2 started off with a better-than-expected domestic opening of $22.2 million. Director Pierre Perifel and producer Damon Ross reteamed to make the sequel, which boasts both an A CinemaScore and generally strong reviews. Newcomers lending their vocal talent include Zazie Beetz, Richard Ayoade, Alex Borstein and Lilly Singh. In the sequel, the animal crew is trying their best to be good, but plans go awry when they come out of retirement to stop one more heist and encounter a new trio of masterminds known as “The Bad Girls,” who are voiced by Danielle Brooks, Maria Bakalova and Natasha Lyonne. Paramount's acclaimed The Naked Gun revival — starring Liam Neeson opposite Pamela Anderson — also opened on the high end of expectations, with a North America launch of $17 million and $28.5 million globally. Affable movie studio chief Brian Robbins — who has also been serving as one of the three interim CEOs of Paramount Global since sale talks began last year — intends to step down once Ellison takes control of the entertainment conglomerate and installs his executive team both in the C-suite and at Paramount Pictures, according to sources. The Naked Gun revival, produced by Seth MacFarlane, stars Neeson in his first leading comedic role opposite Pamela Anderson. The new pic boasts an A-CinemaScore from audiences and strong PostTrak exits. Paul Walter Hauser, CCH Pounder, Kevin Durand, Cody Rhodes, Liza Koshy, Eddie Yu and Danny Huston also star. One fun fact: Anderson is on double duty this weekend between Bad Guys 2 and Naked Gun. Last week, it became the first DC title in years to cross the $300 million mark in North America in a major win for the new leadership at DC, James Gunn — also the director of Superman — and Peter Safran (DC has struggled far more than Marvel in modern times). The weekend's other new offering is Neon's buzzy horror-comedy Together, starring Alison Brie and Dave Franco. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Multiple stars of “The Voice,” including coach Reba McEntire, are mourning the death of country music icon Jeannie Sealy at age 85. Sealy, who won a Grammy for her 1966 song “Don't Touch Me,” was a legend at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, where she performed more than any other artist in history, the venue revealed on August 1, 2025. McEntire was among many country artists and “The Voice” stars who have paid tribute to Sealy in the days since her death. In an Instagram post on August 1, McEntire shared a photo of herself with Sealy and fellow country icon Dolly Parton, and wrote, “I've always loved this woman! Parton, who served as an advisor on “The Voice” in 2015 and 2016, also paid tribute to Sealy on social media, calling her one of her “dearest friends.” Parton wrote, “I have known Jeannie Seely since we were early on in Nashville. Season 22 winner of “The Voice” Bryce Leatherwood also paid tribute in his Instagram Stories with two photos of Sealy, including one of them together, and wrote, “Rest in Peace…from the first time I met Jeannie at the Bluebird Cafe, she said ‘we have to get you to the Opry…I just love that voice.' Leatherwood also commented on the Opry's announcement of Sealy's passing, “She was so kind to me … so sad to hear this. Her health had been failing since the fall of 2024, the outlet reported, including multiple back surgeries and two emergency abdominal surgeries. After moving to California, per Billboard, she made her name as a songwriter, earned a record deal, and appeared with Glen Campbell on the TV show “Hollywood Jamboree.” In 1964, the Country and Western Academy — now known as the Academy of Country Music — named her “the most promising female artist.” After moving to Nashville, Sealy was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in September 1967 and became the first woman to regularly host Opry segments, per Billboard.</p>

But for Gen Xers and Boomers, it was the ultimate spoof franchise, starring the king of deadpan Leslie Nielsen. But excitement has been building across all demographics for the this year's reboot (evidenced in the film‘s youth-heavy opening weekend numbers), as ad after ad has built upon action star Liam Neeson‘s new, bumbling persona. And, in turn, audiences have revisited the original “Naked Gun” trilogy in preparation (or at least, that's how things were going down with my Letterboxd follows). Neeson, however, is not to be counted among the rewatchers. In fact, the actor made a point of not revisiting the original films, which also starred Priscilla Presley (who you might just spot in the new movie) — though he did see them when they originally hit cinema screens (“They were a good giggle, he said. Related Stories Tom Holland Unveils New Spider-Man Suit for 2026's ‘Brand New Day' ‘The Sound of Music' Airs on TCM for the Very First Time, Uncut and Commercial Free “I just trusted the script,” Neeson told Variety. [Director Akiva Schaffer] was the co-writer but there was always another writer on set — a friend of Akiva's, obviously — and they would supply alternate endings to scenes. As for whether or not he attempted to emulate Nielsen in his delivery, Neeson said, “No, those sort of notes I wouldn't have accepted. Neeson has indeed done over 100 movies — 106 with “Naked Gun” to be exact — but he had never before done an out-and-out farce. On set, though, the “Taken” actor stuck to business as usual. You know, that's very important,” he explained. Working with co-star Pamela Anderson — whom he's now reportedly dating — Neeson described as a wholly pleasant experience. She's just a lovely human being,” he said. Neeson is Nielsen's son in the new “Naked Gun” timeline — an interesting choice considering the 72-year-old Neeson is roughly 40 years older than the son that was born to Nielsen and Presley's characters in “The Naked Gun 33 1/2: The Final Insult.” But putting aside that math, Neeson was happy to be associated with the “Airplane!” star… though he did have one condition in which he would definitely not have succeeded him. “But if the producers had said I must bleach my hair for the role, there's no way I would have done that,” Neeson shared.

TMZ reports that “she dabbed her eyes with a tissue,” while they chatted “The two seem deep in a difficult conversation … with Healy appearing animated at one point while his mom was shedding tears,” the outlet wrote, further reporting that Healy was comforting his mom over a family matter. Healy's mom, Denise Welch, appeared on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen” on Thursday, July 24, and the Bravo host asked her about her son's relationship with Swift, along with her album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is rumored to include songs about Swift and Healy's relationship. According to US Weekly, the songs that were rumored to be about her relationship with Healy are “But Daddy I Love Him,” “Down Bad,” “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can),” “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,” “Guilty as Sin?,' “The Tortured Poets Department,” and “Fortnight.” Rumors that the two had a fling date back to 2014 when Swift met Healy backstage at one of his concerts. However, Healy denied the rumors shortly after, emphasizing that they had just met and formed a friendship. Things started back up again in May 2023 when Healy was spotted at one of Swift's Eras Tour shows. Shortly after, the two were seen in New York City together. However, in June 2023, multiple outlets reported that the two broke up. “Taylor's friends want what's best for her and aren't shocked that their relationship fizzled out, since she recently got out of a long-term relationship.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After starring in 1998's The Parent Trap when she was 12, Lohan's career skyrocketed. She went on to appear in many more beloved projects, including Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, and she is next up set to reprise her role in the former film with the 2025 followup Freakier Friday. In a Saturday profile with The Times U.K., Lohan admitted that she “wanted to take a minute” to herself, which saw her shy away from leading roles from 2013 until 2022. Anthony Anderson "Regrets" If 2003 Lindsay Lohan Interview "Intended as Comedy" Was in "Poor Taste" “I was so thrilled to work on A Prairie Home Companion, and yet even today I have to fight for stuff that is like that, which is frustrating. And in due time, if Martin Scorsese reaches out, I'm not going to say no.” At the Los Angeles premiere of Freakier Friday, Lohan told The Hollywood Reporter that moving forward in her career, she would “​​like to take on some more serious, dramatic roles,” further noting that she felt a bit of pressure to stick to the rom-com genre. Just really show people a different side of me,” she added. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
