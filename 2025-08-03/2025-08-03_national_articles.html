                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister of national security in Benjamin Netanyahu's new government, attends a weekly cabinet meeting on Jan. 3, 2023, in Jerusalem. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, center, flanked by his security detail, approach the entrance to Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site in the Old City, on Aug. 13, 2024. Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrives to attend the weekly cabinet meeting at the prime minister's office in Jerusalem, Israel, on July 9, 2023. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel's far-right national security minister led prayers on Sunday at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, drawing international condemnation and escalating tensions as Israel faces strong criticism over the war in Gaza. Since Israel captured the site in 1967, Jews have been allowed to visit but not pray there. Palestinians consider the mosque a national symbol and view visits by Jewish leaders as provocative and as a potential precursor to Israel seizing control over the compound. Most rabbis forbid Jews from praying on the site, but there has been a growing movement in recent years of Jews who support worship there. Ben-Gvir has long called for greater Jewish access to the holy site. Ben-Gvir was visiting to mark the Jewish holiday of Tisha B'Av, a day of mourning and repentance when Jews reflect on the destruction of the First and Second Temples, key events in Jewish history. Ben-Gvir also called for Israel to conquer and declare sovereignty over all of the Gaza Strip and encourage “voluntary” migration from Gaza in order to end the war and bring the hostages back. Palestinians say the migration plan is a disguise for forced expulsions. In response to Ben-Gvir's visit, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the status quo at the site had not changed and would not change to allow Jewish prayer. Ben-Gvir has been convicted eight times for offenses that include racism and supporting a terrorist organization. The army banned him from compulsory military service when he was a teen, deeming his views too extreme. Ben-Gvir gained notoriety in his youth as a follower of the late radical rabbi Meir Kahane. He first became a national figure when he broke a hood ornament off then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's car in 1995. “We got to his car, and we'll get to him too,” he said, just weeks before Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist opposed to his peace efforts with the Palestinians. Two years later, Ben-Gvir took responsibility for orchestrating a campaign of protests, including death threats, that forced Irish singer Sinead O'Connor to cancel a concert for peace in Jerusalem. But it also reflected a rightward shift in the Israeli electorate that brought his religious, ultranationalist ideology into the mainstream and diminished hopes for Palestinian independence. Ben-Gvir is trained as a lawyer and gained recognition as a successful defense attorney for extremist Jews accused of violence against Palestinians. With a quick wit and cheerful demeanor, the outspoken Ben-Gvir also became a popular fixture in the media, paving his way to enter politics. Ben-Gvir has called for deporting his political opponents. In his Cabinet post, Ben-Gvir oversaw the country's police force. As national security minister, he has encouraged police to take a tough line against anti-government protesters. Ben-Gvir secured his Cabinet post after 2022 elections that put Netanyahu and his far-right partners, including Ben-Gvir's Jewish Power party, into power. “Over the last year I've been on a mission to save Israel,” Ben-Gvir told reporters before that election. “Millions of citizens are waiting for a real right-wing government. The time has come to give them one.” Ben-Gvir has been a magnet of controversy throughout his tenure — encouraging the mass distribution of handguns to Jewish citizens, backing Netanyahu's contentious attempt to overhaul the country's legal system and frequently lashing out at U.S. leaders for perceived slights against Israel. Ben-Gvir temporarily resigned from Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet earlier this year to express his disapproval of the Gaza ceasefire deal. Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in return for nearly 1,800 Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences for deadly attacks. Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway imposed financial sanctions on the two men last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli forces on Sunday killed at least 27 Palestinians seeking food at different aid distribution sites in Gaza after opening fire on the hungry crowds, according to reports. U.N. officials claim Israel deliberately created Gaza's hunger crisis by blocking humanitarian aid to the territory. “I couldn't stop and help them because of the bullets,” said a man named Yousef Abed, who was traveling to a distribution site with crowds of people. “Troops were trying to prevent people from advancing. Some people were shot,” said Hamza Matter, a Palestinian eyewitness seeking aid at another location. Hospital officials also commented on the news, with southern Gaza's Nasser Hospital saying it retrieved multiple bodies from routes near distribution points in Khan Younis and Rafah. It said more were killed by Israeli troops near the Morag Corridor in southern Gaza. Others were killed near a site close to the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza, according to the nearby Al Awda Hospital. The reported gunfire occurred near food sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which took over Gaza aid distribution in May. The organization has faced international criticism over recent outbreaks of deadly violence at its distribution points. Israel has carried out similar gunfire in recent days, leading to dozens more deaths at these sites. The death toll figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Late last week, the Trump administration sent special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. The pair's visit came days after Trump said the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza to address “real starvation.” Trump's comments contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insisted there was no starvation in Gaza happening at the hands of Israel.</p>

Kamala Harris and Stephen Colbert discuss what they claim is a "broken" political system on "The Late Show." Former Vice President Kamala Harris is back in the national spotlight with her forthcoming book about her short-lived 2024 White House campaign, and she is generating a buzz about whether she'll try again in 2028. While politicos are keenly watching Harris for her next moves, she's also being eyed by House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., who is investigating whether top Biden administration officials covered up evidence of a mental decline in former President Joe Biden. Comer all but guaranteed his committee would be contacting Harris during an appearance on "The Ingraham Angle" last week. He joined Fox News Channel just after Harris announced she would not be running for governor of California, as some have speculated, and will instead embark on a listening tour to hear from Americans and try to boost fellow Democrats across the country. "I think that that's another great thing about Kamala Harris not running for governor – she's gonna have more time to come before the House Oversight Committee and testify about Joe Biden's cognitive decline," Comer said. "So I think that the odds of Kamala Harris getting a subpoena are very high." Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris stand together at the White House ahead of the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on January 20, 2025, in Washington. During a recent appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," Harris distanced herself from any immediate electoral ambitions. She emphasized she wanted to hear from all voters, however, not necessarily ruling out a future presidential run. And I think right now that, they're not as strong as they need to be," Harris said. "And I just don't want to for now, I don't want to go back in the system. Jonathan Turley, a Fox News contributor and professor at George Washington University Law School, told Fox News Digital the optics of a congressional subpoena would be less than ideal for a potential 2028 candidate. "This is a tough question for Harris, who clearly has aspirations to run again," Turley said when asked if he would advise Harris to appear. "The committee can compel her to appear. However, the optics of forcing a subpoena are not exactly optimal for someone who wants to run again for this office." He added, however, that Harris would be a "natural" target for Comer's probe. But both he and former House Oversight Committee ChairTrey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News Channel host, were doubtful that bringing Harris in would yield much new information. Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., chair of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, is overseeing a probe into the Biden White House. The former South Carolina congressman, who also served as a federal prosecutor, predicted that Harris' lawyers would seek to bury any potential appearance in a quagmire of legal proceedings stemming from executive and/or presidential privilege claims. "That privilege has been invoked by both parties repeatedly during congressional investigations," Gowdy said. "Leaving the names out of it, just for the sake of an analogy, I can't think of an advisor that would be closer to a president than his or her vice president. So, by the time you're litigating the issue of whether or not you can compel a vice president to talk about conversations that he or she had with a chief of staff, with a spouse, with the president, with the president's physician – you'll be as old as I am by the time that's litigated." Turley said House investigators would have to be armed with "specific" questions to avoid someone like Harris being able to answer with "a matter of opinion." Gowdy agreed Harris was a "legitimate" witness to bring in and that the issue of Biden's autopen use, particularly for pardons, "warrants further scrutiny." Trey Gowdy, a former congressman and current Fox News host, said Harris would be a "legitimate" witness. He warned, however, that a potent subpoena comes with consequences for noncompliance. "Prosecutors can send cops and have [people] brought in. Congress can't do that," Gowdy said. A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on Comer's subpoena threat when reached by Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo XIV remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine who could not join their celebration in his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth on Sunday. ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV on Sunday told more than a million Catholic youths at a closing Mass for a weeklong encounter with the next generation of faithful that they are “the sign that a different world is possible” where conflicts can be resolved with dialogue, not weapons. In his closing blessing for the Jubilee of Youth, Leo remembered the young people of Gaza and Ukraine and other countries at war who could not join their celebration. “We are closer than ever to young people who suffer the most serious evils, which are caused by other human beings,” Leo said. “We are with the young people of Gaza. We are with the young people of Ukraine, with those of every land bloodied by war.” “My young brothers and sisters, you are the sign that a different world is possible. The young people camped out in sprawling fields southeast of Rome overnight after attending a vigil service on Saturday, also presided by Leo who has been ferried from Vatican City by helicopter. The Vatican said more than 1 million young people were present, along with 7,000 priests and 450 bishops. A faithful throws a keffiyeh as Pope Leo XIV arrives for a Mass with young people participating in the Youths Jubilee at the Tor Vergata field in Rome, Sunday, Aug. 3, 2025. Leo reminded the crowd that their next encounter will be during World Youth Day, set for Aug. 3-8, 2027, in Seoul, South Korea. The week has been a joyous gathering marked by bands of youths singing hymns as they move down cobblestoned streets, praying the Rosary in piazzas and standing for hours at the Circus Maximus to confess their sins to priests offering the sacrament in a dozen languages. Leo also shared some tragic news on Saturday: two young people who had made the pilgrimage to Rome had died, one reportedly of cardiac arrest, while a third was hospitalized. Rain overnight awakened the faithful but didn't dampen their spirits. It was cold, but we woke up to a beautiful sun and view,” said Soemil Rios, 20, from Puerto Rico. “Despite the difficulties, it was very nice and very special to have been part of this historic moment.” Sister Giulia De Luca, from Rome, acknowledged that “waking up was a bit tough,” but that she was looking forward to seeing the pope again. Definitely a lot of fun, but also very challenging in many ways,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asserted his belief that Joe Biden “was not running things” by citing the former president's lack of communication. Biden's former chief of staff, aides, and White House physician have taken turns testifying to the House Oversight Committee regarding Biden's cognitive acuity. The former president is fighting off allegations that he experienced a cognitive decline during his term, while his witnesses have pleaded the Fifth Amendment during questioning. Cruz appeared on Fox News's My View with Lara Trump on Saturday to lament that little is still known about Biden's term. “The single most frequent question I would get: Who's running things? Here's the terrifying answer: I don't really know,” Cruz said. “I can tell you: in four years that Joe Biden was president, you know how many times I spoke with him? Even as two senators left the party to become independents, they often still caucused with the Democrats, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris's tiebreaking vote ensured wins for Biden's party. “Joe Biden was not running things that I know,” Cruz said. The former president set a record in presidential pardons, commutations, and clemencies for over 4,200 people. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) suggested he might subpoena Biden, former first lady Jill Biden, and former chief of staff Ron Klain as part of the investigation into the former president's autopenned orders after the committee hears from more aides.</p>

I think about the future my grandson will inherit, especially when it comes to something as urgent and deeply personal as organ donation or transplant. If he or someone he loves needs an organ transplant, I want him to know the system is safe, fair and worthy of his trust. We found numerous cases of medical providers starting the organ donation process on living patients. In response, we have threatened to shut down a large organ procurement organization unless it implements our corrective action requirements. We have also imposed strict reporting protocols for the organ transplant system and required that families and hospitals receive clear, complete information about the donation process. How did the organ transplant system fail to protect some of our most vulnerable Americans? It operated behind closed doors for decades, dominated by a single private contractor. Too many patients waited for answers that never came, and families whose loved ones' organs were pursued while still alive were left with nowhere to turn when such atrocities occurred. That ended thanks to the leadership of President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. For far too long, patients, hospital staff or grieving families were forced to report serious safety concerns and misconduct to the very contractor managing the system. Now, under our new reforms, those concerns can come directly to the regulator HRSA. We brought federal oversight into the heart of the process, making it clear there will be no compromise on safety and accountability. We've also proposed new data requirements for organ procurement organizations (OPOs), requiring full documentation of every step in the donation process, from contact with hospitals to interactions with donor families. They're about restoring safety and dignity to a system that lost sight of both. And when horrifying failures come to light, like the shocking case in Kentucky in which organ procurement was nearly performed on a patient who showed signs of life, we act immediately. For the first time, HRSA issued a corrective action plan to an OPO, and we will not hesitate to do it again. No American should ever have to wonder whether their life will be treated with reverence at the hospital. A man was wheeled into surgery to harvest his organs. We ended a monopoly that suppressed innovation, enabled conflicts of interest and delayed reform. HRSA conducted a historic national election to establish an independent OPTN Board of Directors. This new board includes transplant surgeons, living donors, organ recipients and advocates, bringing a range of expertise and experience to the forefront of reform. With bipartisan support, HRSA now has the authority to directly collect OPTN registration fees from transplant hospitals, helping sustain long-term reforms and reduce reliance on any single contractor. Our work is informed by conversations with transplant surgeons, patients, donor families, advocates and hospital staff. These voices have made one thing abundantly clear: Change cannot wait. Secretary Kennedy has demanded accountability across HHS, and President Trump has shown unwavering commitment to ending complacency in systems that cost lives. We are building a system that is ethical, transparent and centered on the sacred sanctity of life. We will not rest until every registered organ donor, patient and family have confidence in our nation's transplant system.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European countries hoping to mirror Italy's controversial practice of sending some asylum seekers rescued at sea to overseas deportation centers have been dealt a setback by Europe's top court. On Friday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that while Italy could still utilize the centers it runs in the Albanian cities of Shengiin and Gjader, who can be sent there must be more closely examined to ensure that asylum seekers aren't being sent back to dangerous situations in their home countries. The court said that a country of origin can only be considered “safe” after it has been “subject to effective judicial review,” and that a country must be demonstrably safe for all its population, including vulnerable or marginalized groups. The EU's own list, meant to be a guide, includes Bangladesh, Columbia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia, despite human rights campaigners warning that those countries aren't safe for all who live there. “The proposed EU list of ‘safe countries of origin' deems certain countries, from which 20% or fewer applicants are granted international protection in the EU, to be safe,” Amnesty International said in a July statement. “However, the fact that up to 20% of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all,” it added. The ECJ ruling – which was based on two Bangladeshi asylum seekers who were detained in Albania but argued returning to Bangladesh was unsafe – comes as several European countries have expressed interest in developing their own deportation schemes like the Italian-Albanian partnership. While that partnership, a multi-million-euro investment of detention centers and “return hubs” in a non-EU country, has been viewed by some countries as a potential blueprint for success, a recent study by the University of Bari found that the Italian scheme has, so far, cost the country more than €74.2 million (approximately $86 million). Still, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and then European Council president Charles Michel lauded Italy's 2023 landmark agreement, and in May 2024, the EU established a set of reforms designed to streamline Europe's approach to managing migration and asylum, particularly around migrants from so-called “safe” countries. Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the court's decision as short sighted, saying that it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and protect national borders.” “This is a development that should concern everyone – including the political forces rejoicing today over the ruling – because it further reduces the already limited scope for governments and parliaments to regulate and administer migration,” she said.</p>

Three years after leaving a sleepy Seattle suburb to run the school district in Fairfax County, Va., outside the nation's capital, Michelle Reid earns more money than the U.S. president and gets a car allowance. 25212BR on BrassRing, an online recruitment platform, the Fairfax County public schools superintendent is advertising for an "Executive Protection Agent," based at the school district's C-suite headquarters on Gatehouse Road in Falls Church, Va. Fairfax County Public Schools Division Superintendent Michelle Reid. The new position comes at a time when public school officials, like Reid, are facing heightened accountability in the post-COVID era over curriculum, contracts, budgets and "diversity, equity and inclusion" policies. In 2021, the Biden administration targeted parents for charges of alleged "domestic terrorism" for raising concerns at school board meetings, but new email records have revealed the allegations were overblown and politicized. Since taking over on July 1, 2022, Reid has come under fire for allegedly covering up scandals over improprieties in football recruiting, the withholding of National Merit awards from students and, most recently, defying Department of Education orders regarding Title IX protections for girls in sports and schools. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights just announced that Fairfax County Public Schools and four other northern Virginia school districts, including Loudoun County Public Schools, violated TItle IX protections by discriminating against students on the basis of sex. Last November, the all-Democratic school board voted unanimously to renew Reid's four-year contract and increased her annual salary to $424,146 from $380,000, more than the salary of New York City's education chancellor. Board members also gave her a $12,000 annual car allowance. Over her tenure, Reid has been notoriously suspect of leaks, which occurred this week with frustrated school district personnel anonymously raising the alarm bell over the new bodyguard position. The job description notes three times that applicants must demonstrate "discretion," noting in one mention that applicants "must demonstrate a high level of discretion and maintain strict confidentiality in all aspects of the role." Meanwhile, the third-largest school district in the country, Chicago Public Schools, is about double the size as Fairfax County Public Schools, serving 322,809 students in 643 schools, according to the latest data, and its superintendent, also called its chief executive officer, doesn't have a personal bodyguard. School district spokeswoman Mary Ann Ferguson said, "Chicago Public Schools does not employ a personal bodyguard position for our superintendent/CEO." Talk of the new job has angered local parents and school district staffers. "Queen Reid demands all the luxuries suitable to her station. It's all 'equity for thee, but not for me,'" said Stephanie Lundquist-Arora, a local mother who has challenged Reid on numerous district policies. "They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent," and that "is not a normal or customary position." - Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services The ad notes: "Must be available for irregular hours, including early mornings, evenings, weekends, holidays, travel, and extended on-call duty." The job requires "knowledge of protective intelligence, behavioral analysis, and threat mitigation strategies," not to mention "skill in surveillance detection, open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools, and incident reporting." Reid has a few other requirements that frame the job as a clear bodyguard detail: "Ability to remain calm and make sound decisions under pressure, especially in sensitive or high-risk situations." Steven Brasley, media outreach specialist in the district's Office of Communications, insisted nothing was out of the ordinary. "Fairfax County Public Schools has long provided a security presence for the superintendent at public‑facing events, as part of the broader safety framework implemented by the Office of Safety and Security," Brasley said. The Office of Human Resources, led by William Solomon, and Chief of Safety and Security Brian Lambert, recently "collaborated" on a "new Executive Protection Agent position description," Brasley added. Brasley said the role "formalizes responsibility for executive protection — including personal security for the superintendent during various activities — while also supporting a wider array of responsibilities within the Office of Safety and Security that support the entire school division." The school district's official explanation didn't include any reference to specific threats Reid faces. Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, based in Cleveland, Ohio, said, "They are basically asking for a personal bodyguard for the superintendent," and that "is not a normal or customary position." He noted, "The job description is one of the shortest I have ever seen for any school security department job," adding the job boils down to a "one-liner," looking for "executive protection" at work, public events, travel and "private residences." Trump said, "It does not reference other duties which one would expect if, indeed, the job extends to other tasks. Brasley said the new job "is designed to bolster FCPS's work," "identifying, assessing and mitigating risks of targeted violence against students, staff and schools." There is no mention of "students, staff and schools" in the job description. There is also no mention of a "new emergency response system or weapons screening" in the job posting.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A driver was killed and a passenger in his car injured after hitting a moose near the entrance to Alaska's Denali National Park and Preserve. The vehicle's collision with the moose occurred around 1 a.m. Friday, just south of the entrance to the Denali Park Road near Mile 235 of the George Parks Highway, also referred to as the Parks Highway, the park said in a statement. The 24-year-old male driver, who was from Bulgaria, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 24-year-old female passenger, who is from North Macedonia, was taken to a Fairbanks hospital. The National Park Service is investigating the incident and working with the Bulgarian Embassy to notify the driver's family. “The collision serves as a sobering reminder of the hazards of wildlife along Alaska's roadways,” the park said. “Moose, caribou, and other large animals are often active at dawn, dusk, and nighttime hours, and can be difficult to see.” The park urged drivers to slow down in dark conditions and use high-beam headlights.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pop singer Justin Timberlake announced that he has been struggling with Lyme disease, bringing attention to a growing public health threat. Timberlake, 44, said in an Instagram post Thursday that he was “shocked for sure” by his diagnosis after he had been “battling some health issues” and feeling unwell during his Forget Tomorrow World Tour. The singer said confirming the diagnosis at least helped him “understand why I would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.” Other early symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes, making it difficult to distinguish from other illnesses. In 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just shy of 16,500 cases of Lyme disease in the U.S. By 2023, cases had shot up to nearly 89,500 nationwide. But it's not just a U.S. problem; cases are rising across Europe as well. A 2019 study estimated that over 1,000,000 people worldwide are affected by Lyme disease each year, with roughly a quarter of cases occurring in Europe. While greater awareness of the disease among doctors and the general public has contributed somewhat to the rising number of Lyme disease cases, climate change also plays a significant role because it has created conducive conditions for a rising tick population. A 2024 report from the Environmental Protection Agency found that rising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere have given ticks more habitats and improved breeding conditions. Richard Marconi, a tick-borne disease researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, told the Washington Examiner that the tick population has been rising for several decades in North America and Europe because winters are getting milder. “Specifically, if we're not having truly hard-freeze winters with multiple days of a very hard freeze, the tick population manages to survive pretty well. And as a result, in the spring, when the adult ticks lay eggs, those eggs are able to hatch,” Marconi said. There is no currently approved vaccine to treat humans with Lyme disease in the U.S., but Pfizer is in the midst of stage 3 clinical trials, the last stage before a drug can come to market. The VCU team is working on a competing vaccine that will provide effective immunity without as many booster shots. Marconi predicted that Pfizer's Lyme disease vaccine will likely be on the market by 2027, but he said he's concerned that the vaccine skepticism of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others in the Trump administration could delay vaccine development. “Vaccines are the most cost-effective way to deal with infectious diseases,” said Marconi, adding, “It's really a really unfortunate situation that there is this anti-vaccination movement occurring both in the government as well as in the public.” Timberlake wrote in his Instagram announcement that we need “to be more transparent about my struggles so that they aren't misinterpreted.” Timberlake postponed a show in New Jersey by one week and canceled two performances in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Columbus, Ohio. Hosts of other celebrities disclosed Lyme disease diagnoses in recent years, including Ben Stiller, Shania Twain, Justin Bieber, Avril Lavigne, and Amy Schumer. Marconi said celebrities bringing attention to the disease is good, but the most important thing is to be informed about whether you live in a high-risk area. “Until vaccination is firmly in place, it's really important for people to be aware of the risks that are around them,” he said. Experts recommend so-called “tick checks,” which involve thoroughly examining your body after spending time outside. “I also suggest saving the tick because there are many places that will identify the tick for you and tell you whether it's even the right type of tick that can transmit Lyme disease.” It is possible to treat clothing and outdoor equipment with insect repellent containing 0.5% permethrin, but cat owners should avoid these products because the chemical is toxic to felines.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) mocked President Donald Trump after he held up most of the president's remaining nominees for at least another month. After Trump signaled that was a nonstarter and accused Schumer of “political extortion,” senators departed the capital for their August recess without a deal and with only a few more nominees confirmed. In a separate post, Schumer laid out his justification for blocking the nominees, who he claimed were “historically unqualified.” “Let me clear what happened: Donald Trump attempted to steamroll the Senate to put in place his historically unqualified nominees. Senate Republicans sought to counter that claim on Saturday, with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) arguing the nominees were “noncontroversial” and accusing the Democrats of playing “partisan games.” Others posted a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term, which they said is “unprecedented.” Senate Democrats are literally holding the federal government hostage. They are harming the country by refusing to allow any of @POTUS' nominees through by voice vote or unanimous consent. Senate Republicans managed to push through a few more nominees before departing, most notably Jeanine Pirro as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Schumer's resistance follows him previously caving on a separate battle with Republicans back in March over a potential government shutdown. After he helped advance a House-passed stopgap measure to fund the government, Schumer faced intense backlash from within his own party, leading to primary threats and calls for new leadership.</p>

Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss the Senate's progress on confirming President Donald Trump's nominees after the delay of August recess. Hours of tense negotiations to strike a deal on President Donald Trump's nominees blew up Saturday night, and now lawmakers are headed home. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he arrives at Glasgow Prestwick Airport on July 25, 2025 in Prestwick, Scotland (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) In a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump accused Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., of "demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees." It is political extortion, by any other name," Trump said. "Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!" U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) walks to speak at a news conference following the weekly Senate Democratic policy luncheon at the U.S. Capitol on June 17, 2025 in Washington, DC. Instead of finding a pathway to vote on as many as 60 of the president's nominees, all of which moved through committee with bipartisan support, lawmakers rapid-fire voted on seven before leaving Washington until September. But Schumer treated Trump's move as a victory for Senate Democrats. He countered that it was the president who gave up on negotiations while he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., worked to find a bipartisan solution, "provided the White House and Senate Republicans met our demands." "He took his ball, he went home, leaving Democrats and Republicans alike wondering what the hell happened," Schumer said, standing next to a poster-sized version of the president's post. "In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating." But prior to the president's edict, both sides of the aisle believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough to both meet Trump's desire to see his nominees confirmed and leave Washington. "There were several different times where I think either or both sides maybe thought there was a deal in the end," he said. Senate Democrats wanted the White House to unfreeze billions in National Institute of Health and foreign aid funding, in addition to a future agreement that no more clawback packages would come from the White House. In exchange, they would greenlight several of Trump's non-controversial nominees. WASHINGTON, DC - JULY 1: (EDITOR'S NOTE: Alternative Crop) Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) pauses while speaking to reporters off the Senate floor after the Senate passes President Donald Trump's so-called "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," Act at the U.S. Capitol Building on July 1, 2025 in Washington, DC. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., accused Schumer of going "too far" by upping the price tag on his demands. "We've had three different deals since last night," he said. He said that Republicans weren't caught off guard by Trump's call to halt talks, and noted that the White House had been heavily involved in negotiations. "They want to go out and say the President's being unrealistic, and because he can't answer to his base to make a deal like we have in every other president in history." Now, Republicans won't pursue recess appointments, but Mullin noted that moving ahead with a rule change to the confirmation process when lawmakers return in September was going to happen in response. "The asks evolved on both sides quite a bit over time," Thune said. "But in the end, we never got to a place where we had both sides agree to lock it in." Senate Democrats, on the other hand, countered that their offer never changed, and that Republicans kept increasing the number of nominees they wanted across the line, and attempted to include more controversial, partisan picks. Schumer wouldn't reveal the details of his demands, but charged that any changes to Senate rules would be a "huge mistake," and urged Trump to work with Senate Democrats moving forward, particularly as Congress hurtles toward yet another deadline to fund the government in September. "If they want to do what's good for the American people, they shouldn't be in blind obeisance to Donald Trump." Alex Miller is a writer for Fox News Digital covering the U.S. Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump directed his ire at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on Saturday as Democrats continue to delay the confirmation of the president's remaining civilian nominees. As progress has reportedly not been made on a deal to fast-track the nominations, Trump, who is in New Jersey for the rest of the day, took to Truth Social to call out Schumer for an “egregious and unprecedented” demand that the White House release funding in exchange for the swift confirmations, going so far as to accuse him of “political extortion.” “Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer is demanding over One Billion Dollars in order to approve a small number of our highly qualified nominees, who should right now be helping to run our Country. It is political extortion, by any other name,” Trump posted. “Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Trump's post follows frustration from Senate Republicans over Schumer's blockade, which they have called “unprecedented” and a “national embarrassment.” Tom Cotton (R-AR), Tim Scott (R-SC), Tommy Tuberville (R-AL), Eric Schmitt (R-MO), Katie Britt (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and others all took to X to blast Schumer's tactics, with some sharing a graphic showing that thus far, no civilian nominees have been confirmed by voice vote or unanimous consent since the start of Trump's second term. Senate Democrats are literally holding the federal government hostage. They are harming the country by refusing to allow any of @POTUS' nominees through by voice vote or unanimous consent. Schumer has claimed that the nominees are “flawed,” “compromised,” and “unqualified” and deserve more scrutiny in his justification for delaying the confirmation proceedings.</p>

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis, file) Over three days of sometimes contentious hearings this week, the National Transportation Safety Board interrogated Federal Aviation Administration and Army officials about a list of things that went wrong and contributed to a Black Hawk helicopter and a passenger jet colliding over Washington, D.C., killing 67 people. At one point NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy scolded the FAA for not addressing safety concerns. Victims of the January crash included a group of elite young figure skaters, their parents and coaches and four union steamfitters from the Washington area. Here is a look at the major takeaways from the hearings about the collision, which alarmed travelers before a string of other crashes and close calls this year added to their worries about flying: A piece of wreckage is lifted from the water onto a salvage vessel near the site in the Potomac River of a mid-air collision between an American Airlines jet and a Black Hawk helicopter, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Feb. 4, 2025, in Arlington, Va. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, file) National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy presides over the NTSB fact-finding hearing on the DCA midair collision accident, at the National Transportation and Safety Board boardroom, Wednesday, July 30, 2025, in Washington. An expert with Sikorsky, which makes the Black Hawks, said the one that crashed was an older model that lacked the air data computers that make for more accurate altitude readings in newer versions. Army Chief Warrant Officer Kylene Lewis told the board that an 80- to 100-foot (24- to 30-meter) discrepancy between the different altimeters on a helicopter would not be alarming, because at lower altitudes she would be relying more on the radar altimeter than the barometric altimeter. Plus Army pilots strive to stay within 100 feet (30 meters) of target altitude on flights, so they could still do that even with their altimeters that far off. But Rick Dressler of medevac operator Metro Aviation told the NTSB that imprecision would not fly with his helicopters. When a helicopter route like the one the Black Hawk was flying that night includes an altitude limit, Dressler said, his pilots consider that a hard ceiling. Both tried to deflect responsibility for the crash, but the testimony highlighted plenty of things that might have been done differently. The NTSB's final report will be done next year, but there likely will not be one single cause identified for the crash. “I think it was a week of reckoning for the FAA and the U.S. Army in this accident,” aviation safety consultant and former crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said. Army officials said the greater concern is that the FAA approved routes around Ronald Reagan International Airport with separation distances as small as 75 feet (23 meters) between helicopters and planes when planes are landing on a certain runway at Reagan. Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten said he was surprised the air traffic controller let the helicopter proceed while the airliner was circling to land at Reagan's secondary runway, which is used when traffic for the main runway stacks up and accounts for about 5% of flights. Van Vechten said he was never allowed to fly under a landing plane as the Black Hawk did, but only a handful of the hundreds of times he flew that route involved planes landing on that runway. Other pilots in the unit told crash investigators it was routine to be directed to fly under landing planes, and they believed that was safe if they stuck to the approved route.

The NTSB said controllers repeatedly said they would just “make it work.” They sometimes used “squeeze plays” to land planes with minimal separation. An FAA working group tried to get a warning added to helicopter charts back in 2022 urging pilots to use caution whenever the secondary runway was in use, but the agency refused. The working group said “helicopter operations are occurring in a proximity that has triggered safety events. And a manager at a regional radar facility in the area urged the FAA in writing to reduce the number of planes taking off and landing at Reagan because of safety concerns. “What you did is you transferred people out instead of taking ownership over the fact that everybody in FAA in the tower was saying there was a problem,” Homendy said. “But you guys are pointing out, ‘Welp, our bureaucratic process. Somebody should have brought it up at some other symposium.</p>
