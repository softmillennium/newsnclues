                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have uncovered multiple new genes and genetic pathways that could lead to repurposing hundreds of existing drugs for osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis. The research, which analyzed data from nearly 2 million people in diverse populations worldwide, was recently published in Nature. It represents an extensive genetic exploration of osteoarthritis, a condition affecting over 600 million people globally. Conducted by an international team led by Helmholtz Munich in collaboration with Rush University Medical Center and 125 top academic institutions worldwide, this initiative is the largest genetic investigation into osteoarthritis conducted and the largest musculoskeletal study. The study uncovered 962 genetic variants associated with the disease and spotlighted 69 key genes whose protein products are already targeted by 473 approved drugs - many of which could be redirected to manage osteoarthritis more effectively. "This study takes a leap forward in offering tailored therapies for osteoarthritis patients, many of whom have long awaited disease-modifying options," said Dino Samartzis, DSc, co-author, professor and director of the international spine research and innovation initiative of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Rush. "This research is a beacon of hope. By leveraging human genetics, we can now reimagine much more effectively as to how we treat this widespread condition." It differs from rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, and is a leading cause of pain, reduced mobility and disability - projected to affect 1 billion people by 2050. As orthopedic specialists, we see firsthand how osteoarthritis affects quality of life. This study takes us closer to developing targeted biologics that not only alleviate symptoms but also slow disease progression and, ideally, restore joint health." Brian Cole, MD, professor of orthopedics at Rush "This is precision medicine at work - offering new hope to millions." Traditionally, osteoarthritis has been managed with pain relievers and mobility aids, but no disease-modifying therapies exist to date. This study not only redefines our genetic understanding of the disease but also provides a path toward repurposing safe, approved drugs, potentially slashing the time and cost to bring effective treatments to market. The team stresses the need for more genetically diverse studies and functional genomics data from global populations to further refine their findings. By integrating genetics with tissue-level molecular insights, the pathway to new, effective and personalized treatments for osteoarthritis becomes increasingly attainable. "Researchers and clinicians from across the globe united with a singular goal - to change the trajectory of osteoarthritis care for generations to come."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two months after launching the Arc Virtual Cell Atlas comprising over 300 million cells, the initiative is now benefiting from new partnerships with 10x Genomics and Ultima Genomics, industry leaders in advanced tools that make collecting single cell data faster, more scalable, and more affordable for scientists working to improve human health. "By combining Arc's expertise with 10x and Ultima's cutting-edge technologies, we will be able to generate high-quality, perturbational single-cell data at scale," said Arc Executive Director, Co-Founder, and Core Investigator Silvana Konermann. "We're excited to make this resource available to the scientific community so that these datasets can inform the most accurate models possible." Leveraging 10x's high-resolution single-cell analysis platforms, particularly its Chromium Flex technology, Arc researchers will be able to generate perturbational data at unprecedented scale and quality. "GEM-X Flex was built to meet the demands of today's most ambitious biological questions-delivering high-quality single-cell data at scale and at a cost that makes large-scale exploration feasible," said Serge Saxonov, CEO of 10x Genomics. "We are excited to enable the creation of increasingly powerful AI models in biology to accelerate scientific discovery and transform drug development." Arc will leverage Ultima's UG 100 sequencing system and its recently launched Solaris chemistry to scale up its next phase of data generation and Atlas expansion. Ultima's unique wafer-based sequencing architecture and novel chemistry will enable Arc researchers to generate significantly more data and at lower cost than alternative approaches. The UG 100 platform has been validated by Arc to work seamlessly, and generate high-quality data at scale when used in combination with 10x's GEM-X Flex. Furthermore, Arc researchers will gain access and utilize UG 100 Solaris Boost, a new high-throughput operating mode currently available in Early Access, to further increase data output. "Our unique sequencing technology was designed to scale far beyond conventional approaches to lower the cost of genomic information and enable data generation at scale," said Gilad Almogy, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Ultima Genomics. "Emerging AI/ML applications such as large-scale perturbation data sets and virtual cells atlases highlight the enabling benefits of our technology and low-cost sequencing. The goal is to provide a long-standing resource for machine learning efforts transforming biology. At Arc, we're developing tools that can predict which perturbations would be effective to return a diseased cell to a healthy state.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) tend to have higher average ferritin levels compared to control subjects, but this does not seem to have a significant impact on their fertility or metabolic health. These findings are based on a study conducted at the University of Oulu, Finland, which investigated the relevance of ferritin levels to the health of women with PCOS. Factors influencing ferritin levels included irregular menstruation, menstrual bleeding volume, and elevated insulin levels—features closely associated with the syndrome. Although high ferritin has previously been linked to poorer metabolic health, this association was weaker among the PCOS group than among the control group. Based on the findings, iron deficiency does not seem to be a cause of infertility, although adequate iron stores remain important for the health of both pregnant women and their developing babies. The study utilized data collected as part of the Women's Health Study (WENDY), conducted between 2020 and 2022, which focused on the health of Finnish women aged 34-36. In addition to polycystic ovaries, disrupted menstrual cycles, and elevated androgen levels, the condition is often associated with metabolic disturbances and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Ferritin is a protein that primarily stores iron in the body. Blood ferritin levels serve as an indicator of the body's overall iron status. In interpreting ferritin levels, inflammation markers must also be considered, as ferritin levels can rise significantly in response to inflammation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The HER2-targeted therapy zongertinib demonstrated clinical benefits for previously treated patients with advanced HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer – particularly those with specific HER2 mutations – with manageable side effects, according to results from the Phase Ia/Ib Beamion LUNG-1 trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Updated data from the trial were presented today by principal investigator John Heymach, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025 and were published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine. The trial previously reported a 71% objective response rate (ORR) – indicating tumor shrinkage – in 75 patients from the first cohort, but newly presented data include a median duration of response (DOR) of 14.1 months and progression free survival (PFS) of 12.4 months. A 71% response rate is unprecedented in this cancer subtype, and not only is the data strong in showing that this treatment works, but zongertinib has the added convenience of being a once-daily oral therapy. When you also consider the improved safety profile compared to less selective inhibitors, this suggests a promising approach for patients in need of new treatments. That's exciting because just a few years ago these patients had no effective targeted therapies." The Beamion LUNG-1 trial is investigating zongertinib as a monotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring HER2 mutations. The only currently approved treatment for this patient population is the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which is delivered intravenously and has been linked to instances of interstitial lung disease. Zongertinib is an oral inhibitor that, unlike previous tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested in this setting, selectively targets HER2 and spares EGFR, resulting in a significant reduction of adverse effects. Grade three or higher adverse events occurred in 17% of patients and mostly included diarrhea and rash, with no instances of interstitial lung disease. Outcomes are summarized below, although DOR and PFS data is not yet mature for cohort 3. "This new data is particularly encouraging for patients who had disease progression after prior therapies, because it indicates that the resistance mechanisms to those therapies does not necessarily confer cross-resistance to zongertinib," Heymach said. Zongertinib was granted a breakthrough therapy designation and a priority review by the FDA earlier this year based on interim data from this study presented at the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer. A clinical trial investigating zongertinib as a first-line treatment is underway (Beamion LUNG-2), and Heymach and colleagues are planning additional studies to investigate the drug's potential in combination treatments in other tumor types harboring HER2 mutations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have found that individuals with colon cancer and a documented history of high cannabis use were more than 20 times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis compared to those without such a history. This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that heavy cannabis use may have underrecognized impacts on the immune system, mental health and treatment behaviors - all of which could influence cancer outcomes." The research team drew on electronic health records from more than 1,000 colon cancer patients treated across the University of California Health system between 2012 and 2024. They evaluated how cancer outcomes differed based on patients' documented cannabis use before diagnosis, controlling for age, sex and indicators of disease severity such as tumor staging and cancer biomarkers. While some laboratory studies have shown anti-tumor effects from certain cannabis compounds, the authors note that real-world use is more complex. Given the increasing prevalence and social acceptance of cannabis use, they also emphasize the need to further investigate its long-term effects in medically vulnerable populations. "High cannabis use is often associated with depression, anxiety and other challenges that may compromise a patient's ability to engage fully with cancer treatment," said Cuomo, who is also a member of UC San Diego Moore's Cancer Center. "However, this isn't about vilifying cannabis. It's about understanding the full range of its impacts, especially for people facing serious illnesses. We hope these findings encourage more research - and more nuanced conversations - about how cannabis interacts with cancer biology and care."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have uncovered a unique ability of a special subtype of natural killer cells in the immune system, called adaptive NK cells, to remember ovarian tumors and effectively attack them. The discovery, published in Cancer Immunology Research, could pave the way for new, more powerful immunotherapies for difficult-to-treat cancers. Adaptive NK cells, aNK cells, are a subset of NK cells that can remember past infections or tumors and react more strongly the next time they encounter the same threat. This ability makes them particularly promising for cancer treatment. The study shows that aNK cells can remember tumor-specific signals, infiltrate and fight cancer cells, and cooperate with other immune cells to become even more effective, making them particularly attractive for cancer treatment. "Our results demonstrate that aNK cells have great potential for treating cancer, especially for patients with difficult-to-treat ovarian cancer," says Dhifaf Sarhan, senior lecturer at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research. "The study also challenges previous perceptions of NK cells, which have historically been considered only innate immune cells with no memory function against cancer," she continues. "This opens new opportunities for the development of innovative immunotherapies." The study involved comprehensive analyses of human immune cells and ovarian tumor tissues, utilising advanced RNA and gene expression mapping techniques at the single-cell level. The next step in our research is to develop methods that increase the number and activity of aNK cells in patients, followed by clinical trials to evaluate their effect on patient survival rates."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a common misconception that fluids with different flow rate requirements always need separate pumps. When working with two fluids that require different flow rates, there are alternative solutions worth considering. In some situations, using a single pump can improve efficiency and reduce costs. This article explores practical options for handling different fluids with varying flow rates. Some application examples may warrant the use of separate pumps for working with different fluids, but there are other options. These ‘2-for-1' pumps feature a single drive motor, despite being able to drive two different pump heads with two different mix ratios. These types of pumps are extremely beneficial to users looking to simplify their operations and save space within the lab environment. The need for separate pumps or a single pump option depends largely on a specific application's needs, but a duplex pump can often be used to process different fluids at different flow rates. If your application allows you to meter multiple fluids using a single pump, there are several potential benefits to consider. Here are some of the key advantages: Two pumps necessitate the use of multiple motor controllers to operate at independent speeds, adding to the system's complexity in terms of integration. Using a single pump instead of two saves space within both the lab environment and within the instrument itself. As well as its reduced space requirements, this can help improve reliability, reduce maintenance requirements, and reduce downtime, effectively streamlining overall operations. Using a single pump should also reduce its overall cost, especially when leveraging a single duplex pump rather than acquiring multiple units. Despite its versatility, the duplex pump will often cost less to manufacture than two standard pumps. Applications requiring flow outputs in multiples of two may not be adequately served by a single pump. Fluid Metering, Inc. offers a range of duplex pump options able to accommodate applications where it is beneficial to use a single pump for processing different fluids at different flow rates. Various models with dual shaft or dual head options are available, from stepper base options to the QB series of pumps. It is advisable to contact Fluid Metering prior to purchasing a pump solution to ensure the best combination of pump head and calibration is provided for the specific application. It is important to note, however, that while this article primarily discussed the duplex pump, many other products in Fluid Metering's portfolio can be used for the same purpose. Fluid Metering, Inc. (FMI) is a worldwide leader in life science pumps and dispensers, having pioneered the first valve-less piston pump over 64 years ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Ho Sang Jung and his research team from the Advanced Bio and Healthcare Materials Research Division at the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), in collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, have developed a technology that enables the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes using synovial fluid. This marks the first such achievement in Korea. According to some studies, over 50% of the population aged 65 and older experience symptoms of osteoarthritis, while rheumatoid arthritis is known to be a serious chronic disease that affects approximately 1 in 100 people over the course of their lifetime. Although osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis may appear similar, they differ in both their causes and treatments, making accurate differentiation at the early diagnosis stage critically important. Until now, diagnosis has relied on X-rays, MRI scans, and blood tests, which are time-consuming, costly, and limited in accuracy. By analyzing these metabolic differences, they developed a technology capable of distinguishing between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes, as well as assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. The research team utilized Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, a phenomenon in which the optical signals of molecules are amplified by several million times. This technology amplifies signals from trace molecules present in synovial fluid and, through a combination of AI-based analysis and mathematical algorithms, detects minute substances responsible for arthritis. In collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, the research team conducted tests using this technology on 120 patients. The results showed that osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis could be diagnosed and distinguished with an accuracy of over 94%. These findings demonstrate that the technology not only significantly reduces the time and cost of arthritis diagnosis but also ensures a high level of diagnostic accuracy. If this technology is commercialized, it will not only aid in diagnosis but also be highly useful in monitoring treatment progress. We also plan to continue expanding our research to cover a wider range of diseases in the future."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAN DIEGO — A 20-year initiative by Kaiser Permanente Northern California that assessed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening status and offered flexible options for screening has made a huge difference in CRC incidence, deaths, and racial disparities, an analysis showed. “The program promptly doubled the proportion of people up to date with screening,” reported lead investigator Douglas A. Corley, MD, PhD, a research scientist with Kaiser's Division of Research, at a press briefing held on April 24, ahead of a presentation at the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025. Additionally, within about 10 years, cancer rates were cut by a third, deaths were halved for the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and the differences that had previously been seen by race or ethnicity were largely eliminated, he said. “Ten years ago, there were big gaps in cancer risk and death, especially among our Black patients. A systematic CRC screening program was implemented across Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Screening rates via FIT, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy more than doubled after starting the program, from about 37% in the early years to about 80% within a few years, and it stayed that high through 2019, Corley reported. “Importantly, these large increases occurred across the whole population with only small differences,” he said. “This shows that systematic, comparable outreach can provide a level playing field for completion of preventive care,” Corley said. CRC deaths also fell by about 50% across all groups, with the largest decline among Black members, Corley noted. Offering outreach and equal access to screening in the Kaiser program erased those long-standing disparities. “It's remarkable that some of these large differences in mortality by race and ethnicity that we saw two decades ago, and which are found throughout the United States, are now similar to small chance variation in the population,” Corley said. Flexibility was key to getting more people screened, he noted. “It's about reaching people at their homes and offering a choice to patients. It's important to note that these findings stem from a large, integrated healthcare system, which may differ from other settings, although similar outreach strategies have succeeded in safety net clinics and smaller practices, Corley added. “It shows that if health systems institute programmatic screening for all their covered individuals, they could markedly increase screening, said Laine, who also served as moderator of the press briefing. “Most importantly, of course, [screening] was associated with a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and deaths,” he said. Laine's disclosures included consulting and/or relationships with Medtronic, Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven, Celgene, Intercept, Merck, and Pfizer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The legacy of discriminatory housing policies continues to shape both economic and health outcomes. These delays impact both individual health and broader public health efforts to prevent HIV transmission, said senior author Scott Batey, PhD, a professor at Tulane's School of Social Work, New Orleans. “The association between redlining and health outcomes is not a new concept, but applying this lens specifically to HIV was novel,” Batey noted. This financial exclusion led to lasting disparities in healthcare access, education, and household income. “This suggests that historical systemic barriers continue to have lingering effects, even across generations.” Although New Orleans has a Black majority population, the study revealed a higher concentration of Black individuals in redlined areas than in non-redlined ones. “Our study reinforced existing research that links social determinants of health — such as poverty, depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence — to HIV outcomes,” he added. “However, structural determinants of health remain less explored, making our findings particularly compelling.” Factors like limited healthcare access, financial insecurity, transportation barriers, and medical mistrust further delay treatment, Batey said. Limited health literacy and stigma further complicate access to timely care. “Stigma remains a major barrier — people may avoid seeking care due to fear of discrimination.” This region accounts for over half of new HIV cases in the United States, Batey said. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to addressing HIV treatment adherence, added Shobha Swaminathan, MD, FIDSA, professor of medicine and director of HIV services at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “This foundational motivation is a powerful asset in addressing the complexities of HIV treatment adherence.” By collaborating with mental health and substance use disorder clinicians, community health workers, and case managers, providers can deliver patient-centered care while increasing education on HIV treatment effectiveness. Encouraging the use of long-acting injectable medications can also help address adherence challenges, Swaminathan said. Integrated care models that address HIV alongside mental health and substance use concerns can improve retention, with local services easing access to multiple types of care. “By approaching HIV care with a comprehensive, empathetic, and advocacy-driven mindset, we can be catalysts for change in the fight against HIV, improving both individual and community health outcomes.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INCHEON, South Korea — The diabetes drug metformin may reduce the pain of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients with overweight or obese, independent of weight loss, according to results from a randomized placebo-controlled study presented at the World Congress on Osteoarthritis (OARSI) 2025 Annual Meeting. The double-blind trial, which was simultaneously published on April 24, 2025, in JAMA, involved 107 patients with symptomatic radiologic knee OA and a body mass index > 25, who were randomly assigned to receive either 2000 mg/d metformin or a placebo for 6 months. This treatment was associated with a mean change in the visual analog scale for pain of −31.3 mm in the treatment group compared with −18.9 mm in the placebo group at 6 months, which represented a significant adjusted between-group difference of −11.4 mm (P = .01). The study also found significant differences in favor of metformin in the secondary outcomes of improvements in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores for pain (−113.9 with metformin vs −68.2 with placebo), stiffness (−56.9 vs −26.7), and function (−426.1 vs −221.7). These analyses used imputed data to address missing primary and secondary outcomes for the 18% of patients in the trial who were lost to follow-up and did not provide data at 6 months. “I think this provides a different approach that has the potential to slow this rapid move towards knee replacements for early OA,” Cicuttini said. An earlier systematic review, which Cicuttini co-authored, found consistent preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting metformin had chondroprotective, immunomodulatory, and pain-reducing effects in knee OA. “What's also attractive about metformin is it doesn't cause hypoglycemia; you can use it in normal healthy people, you don't have to monitor their blood sugar.” Rheumatologist Anita Wluka, MBBS, PhD, of the Alfred Hospital and Monash University — who was also a co-author on the study — said to Medscape Medical News that “metformin ticks all the metabolic boxes, and it's cheap as chips.” Commenting on the findings, physiotherapist Brooke Patterson, PhD, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said there are numerous trials looking for medications to help with OA, but it is challenging to find effects because of the nature of the disease. “You've got all these different subgroups within the 50 participants that are getting the intervention, but only a small proportion of those might respond to one treatment,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals that ultra-processed foods account for nearly half of US household grocery purchases, with lower-income and less-educated families bearing the brunt, underscoring the need for urgent national policy reform. In a recent article published in the journal Public Health Nutrition, researchers analyzed purchases of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) by American households, examining differences based on education levels, household income, and race and ethnicity. They found that almost half of all food purchases and more than one-third of beverages were UPFs; snacks, soft drinks, and mixed dishes accounted for the highest proportions of UPFs. Purchases of UPFs were more common in households with lower incomes and members with lower levels of education, as well as in non-Hispanic white households. The study included a nationally representative sample of 59,939 US households, analyzing over 33 million purchased products during 2020. Statistical analyses used a significance threshold of p < 0.0001 to determine meaningful differences between groups. UPFs are highly engineered products made with additives and ingredients derived from food and are becoming increasingly dominant in American diets. These foods have been linked to several chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, depression, sleep issues, and even premature death. UPFs are identified not only by their high processing but also by the use of certain additives rarely found in home cooking. Current estimates show that approximately half of American beverage and food purchases are ultra-processed. Nutrition-related health problems, including obesity, also show significant disparities across ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups. Past research undertaken from 2007 to 2012 revealed that more educated individuals consume fewer UPFs, while white and Black adolescents consume the most. Income and age were inversely related to UPF intake. While purchase data provide a clearer picture than dietary surveys, earlier findings indicated that Black households bought more processed drinks but fewer processed foods. In a quickly changing food market, researchers sought to update research on UPF purchasing patterns, exploring how race, income, education, and family structure intersect with food purchasing. The study utilized data from a consumer panel survey of 59,939 American households, drawn from a nationally representative sample of approximately 35,000 to 60,000 households per year, conducted in 2020. Income was divided into three levels based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), namely <185%, 185–350%, and >350%. Households were also classified based on whether they included children. Using commercial databases, each product was matched with nutrient labels and ingredient data. Items without nutrition labels or barcodes (like fresh produce and meats) were excluded. Products were grouped into nine food and eleven beverage categories. UPFs were identified by checking for substances not typically used in home kitchens, including flavor enhancers and sweeteners. If items originally classified as UPFs were found to contain none of the NOVA markers or additives, the product was reclassified as processed foods rather than UPFs. The authors used statistical tests to compare the purchase volumes of UPFs across demographic sub-groups, applying Bonferroni adjustments to account for multiple comparisons. Proportion of (A) foods and (B) beverages purchased by US households by both level of processing and food category In contrast, fruits, vegetables, fats, nuts, and oils had virtually no UPFs. Importantly, although these minimally processed categories had almost no UPFs, they made up only a small fraction (12%) of total purchases, compared to the top three UPF categories (carbonated soft drinks, sweets and snacks, and mixed dishes/soups), which together comprised 36% of all purchases. Non-Hispanic white households had the highest percentage of UPF purchases (49%), followed by non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (46%), and other ethnic groups (43%). These patterns held across racial-ethnic groups even when stratified by income. Differences were observed across food categories, with non-Hispanic white households purchasing more carbonated UPF drinks, and non-Hispanic Black households purchasing more UPF dairy beverages and fruit juices. Grain products and fruit/vegetable juices showed the greatest variability by group, with at least a 10% difference between the lowest and highest proportions of UPFs purchased. It is important to note that this study measured only in-home purchases. Previous research has shown that non-Hispanic Black households are more likely than other race-ethnic groups to purchase sugar-sweetened beverages outside the home, which was not captured in this dataset. Therefore, the observed lower in-home beverage UPF purchases among non-Hispanic Black households may not reflect their total beverage consumption. This study confirms the dominance of UPFs in American household food purchases, consistent with previous research. Notably, non-Hispanic whites now purchase more ultra-processed beverages than other groups, differing from earlier findings. One possible explanation for this shift is purchasing behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have disproportionately affected minority groups and altered patterns of food insecurity and at-home purchasing. Additionally, the limitation of only capturing in-home purchases may confound observed racial and ethnic differences in UPF beverage purchasing patterns. Despite using a nationally representative sample and full-year data collection, limitations include reliance on purchase (rather than consumption) data, potential underestimation due to food waste, exclusion of restaurant purchases, possible misclassification using the NOVA classification system, and pandemic-related purchasing shifts. Despite these, scan-based data likely ensures reasonable accuracy. The findings emphasize the urgent need for American policy initiatives addressing UPF consumption to enhance diet quality and mitigate chronic disease risks, particularly given the absence of federal regulations compared to other countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A century after early warnings, researchers now fear that yellow fever could erupt beyond its historical strongholds, posing an unprecedented threat to billions in the Asia-Pacific and beyond. Study: Yellow Jack: a modern threat to Asia-Pacific countries? Early 20th-century quarantine efforts in Hawai'i successfully halted YFV outbreaks after infected ships arrived from South America, demonstrating the effectiveness of preemptive public health measures. YF, caused by YFV, is an acute viral illness in humans and several nonhuman primates. Unlike other mosquito-borne diseases, humans infected with YFV exhibit heightened viremia and are efficient amplifying hosts, allowing for inter-human transmission by mosquitoes. This makes YFV particularly capable of sparking urban epidemics, as infected people can efficiently infect mosquitoes that bite them. During the colonial era in North America, Caribbean trading vessels imported yellow fever (YF) mosquitoes to coastal port cities in the eastern United States (US). Once an area was infested with YF mosquitoes, YFV infection followed soon, resulting in epidemics over the past three centuries. Nevertheless, enzootic cycles in nonhuman primates and sylvatic mosquitoes continued in the forest canopies of the American tropics and Sub-Saharan Africa. Further, human-amplified urban YF epidemics have occurred recently in Africa. The reasons for the reemergence of YF epidemics are unclear but are believed to be due to various factors, including human population expansion, inadequate vaccine coverage, and a lack of effective mosquito control. The study notes that, for example, recent years (2016–2023) have seen an increase in YF spillover from sylvatic cycles in both Africa and the Americas, raising alarms about further geographic spread. Historic U.S. epidemics, such as Philadelphia's 1793 outbreak that claimed 10% of the population, permanently altered societal behaviors, influencing urban planning and disease response strategies. Carter's original warning about yellow fever's potential to invade the Asia-Pacific region, and the authors stress that many of Carter's concerns are now more pressing than ever. Notably, YFV has not been transmitted in Asia so far. However, studies suggest a possibility of YFV expansion to the Asia Pacific region. The paper emphasizes that over two billion susceptible people in the Asia-Pacific region live in areas infested by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, with no natural herd immunity to YFV. This was recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries but deemed unlikely due to logistical barriers. Nevertheless, the threat of YFV spread to Asia was underscored once Aedes aegypti was identified as a YFV vector in 1903. The YF mosquito eradication program was initiated in the United States in 1962 and was abandoned seven years later due to repeated importations from countries without similar policies. Meanwhile, the persistence of YF mosquitoes in limited refugia has gradually led to reinfestation across the Americas, which continues to this day. Yellow fever's “extrinsic incubation” period, the 10-day delay between a mosquito biting an infected host and transmitting the virus, was first documented in 1898, reshaping outbreak containment protocols. For instance, it was estimated that over four billion people traveled internationally by airplane in 2019, and a 2016 study found that 60 million unvaccinated people traveled to or from YF-endemic countries to areas infested with yellow fever mosquitoes. Travel by unvaccinated individuals from or to YF-endemic areas increases the probability of the introduction of YFV to non-endemic countries infested with Aedes aegypti. Besides, if YFV is introduced in a permissive country, the disease could first be misdiagnosed as dengue. This risk is heightened because early or mild YF cases can closely resemble other flavivirus infections, and cross-reactive immunity complicates laboratory diagnosis. However, some mitigating factors reduce the risk of YFV transmission, such as the World Health Organization's (WHO) “Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics” program, which aims to increase YF vaccine access and coverage. Besides, travel history raises suspicion about YF, and imported cases are likely to be recognized early. Nonetheless, the study warns that most countries infested with YF mosquitoes lack the public health infrastructure to effectively control mosquitoes, rapidly distribute vaccines, or manage a surge of clinical cases. The paper warns explicitly that the combination of high case–fatality ratio, hemorrhagic symptoms, and inadequate vaccine supply could rapidly overwhelm public health systems. The fundamental question is why no YF epidemic has occurred in permissive urban centers of Asia-Pacific or tropical America. Moreover, recent pandemics of chikungunya, Zika virus disease, and dengue suggest ideal epidemiological conditions for the global and regional transmission of YFV. The article frames this as an “enigma,” noting that unraveling why YF has not yet spread in these regions can help in designing effective preventive measures. Possible explanations for the lack of YF spread include cross-protective immunity from Zika, dengue, and other orthoflavivirus, demographic and geographic obstacles, non-adaptation of YFV lineages to the YF mosquito-human urban cycle, effective mosquito control in at-risk areas, good surveillance and rapid response containment, variable YF mosquito densities, variable host-vector competence, and plain old luck, among others. In particular, the article highlights that areas endemic for dengue and other flaviviruses may have populations with cross-reactive immunity, which could either reduce disease severity or suppress transmission, though this remains to be confirmed in humans. Brazil's 1938 eradication of Aedes aegypti, achieved through door-to-door insecticide campaigns, collapsed by the 1970s due to funding cuts, allowing the mosquito to resurge globally. Although a highly effective and safe YF vaccine is available, its supply is limited, and significant upscaling will be necessary for widespread use. The study notes that current egg-based vaccine production is difficult to rapidly scale up in emergencies, contributing to shortages during outbreaks. Further, while new mosquito control tools in the pipeline appear promising, none provide effective emergency and long-term control at the required scale. Moreover, public health infrastructure should be built to address Aedes-linked viral diseases. The article emphasizes the urgent need for research into new vaccine platforms, sustainable mosquito control strategies, antivirals, improved surveillance, and integration of vaccination with vector control. Thus, successful YF containment requires extensive capacity-building and research in most tropical urban centers. In summary, the concern that YFV will spread to the Asia Pacific region, which was raised a century ago, remains equally pressing today, and the odds of such a catastrophe may be even higher now. The authors explicitly warn that if a yellow fever pandemic were to occur in today's world, its much higher lethality could make the COVID-19 pandemic pale by comparison, resulting in a devastating global public health crisis.
