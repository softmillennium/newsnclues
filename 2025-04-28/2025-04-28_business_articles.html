                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China on Monday once again denied that it is in talks to resolve its tariff war with the United States, after a series of statements by President Donald Trump and his aides suggesting trade negotiations were underway. "Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference. Guo also appeared to reject Trump's claim, in an interview with TIME last week, that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. The latest blanket denial was in line with Beijing's hardline stance against Trump's massive 145% tariffs on imports from China, a top supplier of U.S. goods. Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, insist that the U.S. is better positioned to win a trade war than China is. But American business owners and analysts are raising alarms that the effective trade embargo with China could soon result in major economic consequences, including higher prices, product shortages and store closures. Against that backdrop — and Trump's recent claim that his administration will be finished crafting new trade deals with numerous countries in as little as three or four weeks — some U.S. officials have expressed more openness toward a dialogue with Beijing. "Every day we are in conversation with China," Trump's Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, said Sunday on CNN. When told that the Chinese deny this, Rollins said, "Well, according to our team in Washington, the conversations are ongoing regarding multiples of trade, multiples of the trade goods that are coming out and going in." Asked on Sunday why China would deny that negotiations are underway, Bessent said, "Well, I think they're playing to a different audience." Pressed to explain whether the talks are actually happening, he said, "We have a process in place. And again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable." Bessent predicted last week that a "de-escalation" with China was coming in the "very near future." On Monday morning, he pointed to that prospective de-escalation to help explain why he was not yet concerned that U.S. consumers could soon face empty store shelves. "Not at present," Bessent said on Fox News, when asked if he was concerned about "empty shelves." In a separate interview Monday morning on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Bessent put the onus for that de-escalation on China, before saying he would not negotiate through the press. China has consistently demanded that Trump, who has held up tariffs as both a powerful negotiating tool and way to rake in government revenue, scrap his sweeping import taxes. That statement, translated from Mandarin by CNBC, was itself a response to Trump's claim on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials "had a meeting this morning." A day earlier, Trump said that U.S. officials were "actively" talking with China. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk may skirt more than $2 billion in possible financial liabilities by exercising his influence over the federal government, a new report from Senate Democratic committee staffers out Monday alleges. Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' has brought sweeping changes to Washington with its slash-and-burn campaign to gut agencies and purge the federal workforce. President Donald Trump has avidly supported Musk's cuts. As he appears poised to step back from his DOGE work in the coming weeks, Democrats are accusing the world's richest person of using his influence to "evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses—on his terms and at his command." The report, compiled by Democratic staff of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), found that on the day of Trump's inauguration, Musk and his companies were facing at least 65 "actual or potential" regulatory or enforcement actions from 11 federal agencies. These actions totaled at least $2.37 billion in potential liability, the senators wrote. According to the 44-page memo, the potential liabilities included $1.19 billion at Tesla for allegedly making misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features. Neuralink faced $281 million in possible liability for allegedly making false statements about risks from its product, per the memo. Additionally, the company could have been forced to pay $1.59 million in civil and criminal penalties for alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act. "The through line connecting many of Mr. Musk's decisions appears to be self-enrichment and avoiding what he perceives as obstacles to advancing his interests," reads the memo. CNBC has reached out to the companies for comment. The letters also requests a rundown of the steps each company has taken to keep Musk's government work separate from those probes. Blumenthal asks the companies to respond by May 11. The White House sharply rejected any suggestion that Musk has used his role in government for "personal or financial gain," saying "any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory." Blumenthal "is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable [sic] case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has wilted his brain," White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called "Liberation Day." Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US. "April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again," Trump said during his remarks. Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce. "The tariffs are larger than forecasters expected, certainly larger than we expected in our upside case," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. "Our role is to make sure this will be a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process." Beginning at the end of 2024, some companies warned that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up." "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025," Shein's statement said. Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping. In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole. Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs. Ford, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates "the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production." Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now. Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products. Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico. It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains "volatile" and changes hourly. According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports. Kjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive officer, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices. "Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex," Barry said. "We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely." Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce. "Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days," Cornell said. Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: "Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months." Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating "a variety of different scenarios" to plan for new tariffs under Trump. "And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market," Allan said, adding that "there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price." Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on November 19 that the company will likely raise prices if Trump's tariff proposals are implemented. "We never want to raise prices," he said. The company's CEO, Doug McMillan, said during a February earnings call that "tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that." He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, "trade wars are not good and not easy to win." He later said in a February interview with CNBC that "we need some surety about what is going to happen" before making price changes. P&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products. CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC price hikes are "likely." "We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L," P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters. Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2. While Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console won't see a price hike over tariffs, Nintendo said accessories for the Switch 2 "will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions."</p>

JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s trading desk is turning tactically bullish on US equities, predicting that tailwinds including Big Tech earnings and trade deal announcements will continue to lift stocks after the recent rout.

Still, the bank was quick to emphasize in a note to clients Monday that the rally's momentum could fade within weeks, with the negative impacts of US tariffs poised to begin dragging on the economy in the months ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors have continued to pull money from so-called ESG funds in early 2025 amid an "intensifying" backlash fueled by President Trump's "anti-climate agenda" and his administration's policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a new Morningstar report. Also known as socially responsible, sustainable, impact or values-based investing, "environmental, social and governance" funds let people invest according to certain values like climate change or corporate diversity. Investors withdrew $6.1 billion from ESG funds in the first three months of 2025, after yanking out $4.3 billion in Q4 2024, according to Morningstar. More from Personal Finance:Consumers are spending as trade wars raise recession riskWhere young adults are most likely to live with parentsConsumers making financial changes in response to tariffs "The continued loss of appetite among US investors for sustainable funds can be partly attributed to an anti-ESG backlash, which has intensified since the return of President Trump to the White House," according to the report. Even before Trump took office, persistently high interest rates weighed on performance in segments of the ESG market, like clean energy and other "green" stocks, according to Morningstar. Within days of his inauguration, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris agreement, blocked subsidies for electric vehicles, pushed for more fossil-fuel production and started a "huge pushback" against DEI policies, Diana Iovanel, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note in March. In late March, the Republican-led Securities and Exchange Commission stopped defending a climate-change disclosure rule in court. There's also uncertainty about the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic climate change mitigation law signed by President Joe Biden. Even before Trump's second term began, at least 18 Republican-led states had adopted "anti-ESG legislation," prompting some large asset managers to "pare back" their ESG efforts, Iovanel wrote. Trump also signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI-related mandates and programs within the federal government, prompting major corporations like Walmart (WMT), Lowe's (LOW) and Meta (META) to begin "scaling back their DEI commitments," Morningstar wrote. Despite the headwinds, Trump's agenda "isn't 'game over' for ESG investing," Iovanel wrote. Demand for ESG investments "is here to stay" even in the face of political pressure, she wrote. States such as California have implemented pro-ESG regulations, and surveys indicate most large asset managers (including ones in the U.S.) invest in ESG assets despite the apparent controversy, she wrote. About 84% of individual investors in the U.S. are interested in sustainable investing, according to a 2024 Morgan Stanley survey. Roughly two thirds, 65%, of respondents said their interest had increased in the prior two years. While critics deride it as "woke" capitalism, advocates say there's a strong investment thesis for ESG. Specifically, they argue that ESG investing positions investors for higher long-term returns because companies that adopt such practices are poised to be more resilient, and therefore more successful, than peers.

Cryptocurrency investors waded back into the market last week, riding a surge in Bitcoin. 

Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin and Ether attracted more than $3.2 billion last week, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) alone seeing a nearly $1.5 billion inflow — the most this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Other Bitcoin-focused funds also saw meaningful infusions, with investors adding more than $620 million to the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and roughly $574 million into the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chinese e-tailer Temu has started adding "import charges" of about 145% in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs. A child's bathing suit priced at $12.44 will cost shoppers $31.12 when the $18.68 import charge is taken into account, a staggering 150% fee. A handheld vacuum cleaner listed at $16.93 now costs $40.11 when factoring in an import charge of $21.68, which is a roughly 137% markup. "Items imported into the U.S. may be subject to import charges. These charges cover all customs-related processes and costs, including import fees paid to customs authorities on your behalf," Temu explains on its website. Representatives from Temu didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Rival discount retailer Shein has also hiked prices on its site, but it doesn't appear to be implementing import charges. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery." The moves come after Temu and Shein warned earlier this month that they would raise their prices after Trump slapped a 145% tariff on many imports from China and vowed to end the de minimis exemption on May 2. "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up," Temu said on its site earlier this month. "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025." Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has skyrocketed in popularity in the U.S. since its launch in 2022 by blanketing the internet with ads proclaiming users can "Shop like a billionaire." Temu allowed cash-strapped consumers struggling to afford essentials like groceries and housing to splurge on nice-to-have items like new clothes or home decor without the steep price tag. Now, the prices of many of its products will be more aligned with U.S. competitors like Amazon, Walmart and Target, but could still take more than a week to arrive. Temu has sharply slashed its online ad spending in the U.S. since Trump announced sweeping tariffs. Temu's ranking in Apple's app store has since plummeted to No. 73, after consistently ranking in the top 10, according to Sensor Tower data. Shein is currently at 54, down from 15 last month. Temu, it was nice while it lasted," a user wrote that the price of items "went flying up" on Friday. Macinzi Morris, a Temu customer who lives in southeastern Missouri, said she ordered a set of succulent pots for $12.25 before the company began raising prices. By Friday, the pots went up to $30, she said. Morris buys yoga supplies, clothing and a variety of other products from the site "a couple times a month," but she expects to shop elsewhere now that Temu items are more expensive. "There's no point in paying a 140% upcharge when I can get the same thing on Amazon for the same price and usually get it a little faster," Morris said. Some news outlets and consumers have tracked modest price increases on individual items sold on Temu — before the import charges. It appears the new fees are only being tacked on to products that aren't sold from local warehouses in the U.S. Over the last year, Temu has worked to build out U.S.-based distribution centers to shield itself from trade tensions and has reportedly pushed some sellers to store inventory in the U.S. That trend has only ramped up as the company hikes prices and adds extra fees. For example, a scan of Temu's "lightning deals" page on Monday showed more than 75% of the products offered had a "local" tag on them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>IBM on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers. "We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities," IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a release. The company's announcement comes weeks after President Donald Trump unveiled a far-reaching and aggressive "reciprocal" tariff policy to boost manufacturing in the U.S. As of late April, Trump has exempted chips, as well as smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components, from the tariffs. IBM said its investment will help accelerate America's role as a global leader in computing and fuel the economy. Nvidia plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. via its manufacturing partnerships over the next four years. Last week, IBM reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. IBM's net income fell to $1.06 billion, or $1.12 per share, from $1.61 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. IBM's infrastructure division, which includes mainframe computers, posted $2.89 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating expectations of $2.76 billion. The company announced a new z17 AI mainframe earlier this month. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shareholder activists say Meta isn't doing enough to combat hate speech. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Jewish investor network JLens are calling on Meta investors to back a new proposal demanding greater transparency into how the company handles antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-disability hate speech. The campaign comes amid rising concern over Meta's rollback of moderation policies and signals that investor scrutiny of the company's approach to safety has intensified. The shareholder proposal, known as Proposal 8, calls on Meta to publish a public report detailing how it identifies, moderates, and addresses hate speech across its platforms. The report would include data tracking the prevalence of hate speech on Meta's platforms, broken down by the communities targeted, and an analysis of whether such content has increased or decreased under updated policy guidelines. It would also disclose any new policies or product interventions Meta has introduced or is developing to address hate targeting marginalized groups. Even if outside investors broadly support the proposal, it is almost certain to fail without Zuckerberg's backing. Meta's board has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, saying the company already has comprehensive content moderation systems and transparency reports and that an additional report would not provide meaningful new information. ADL and JLens argue that forcing the issue into public view and onto the ballot is an important step toward holding Meta accountable. "This is not a one-time effort, but part of a broader push to ensure Meta takes meaningful responsibility for the harmful content that appears on its platforms," Ari Hoffnung, managing director of JLens, told Business Insider. In addition to concerns about user safety, JLens also framed hate speech as a financial risk for Meta's shareholders. Hoffnung said harmful content on Meta could expose the company to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks and threaten relationships with advertisers. "Meta is the platform where we've consistently identified as having one of the highest volumes of antisemitic and other hateful content, making it a priority for investor engagement," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, told BI. "Meta also is a public company, and so as shareholders, we have a formal mechanism to push for transparency and accountability through resolutions like Proposal 8, which we believe is the most constructive way to drive lasting change from within the company." JLens manages investments in major public companies, including Meta, through funds aligned with Jewish values and has stakes in most large public companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta. While the ADL does not directly own Meta stock, its acquisition of JLens enables it to influence corporate governance through shareholder proposals. "We've previously attempted to engage the company directly without success," Hoffnung said. "This year, we felt it was time to escalate our concerns through a shareholder proposal." Shareholder proposals are a common tool during "proxy season," the period in spring when public companies hold annual meetings and shareholders vote on issues ranging from executive compensation to corporate social responsibility. In a statement last week, the board criticized Meta's recent rollback of its moderation policies and warned that the changes could undermine user safety and brand trust. "We strongly believe in the importance of free expression, but it cannot come at the expense of safety," he said. Greenblatt pointed to Reddit's transparency report, which tracked incidents of Holocaust denial and other hate targeting specific groups, as a model for the kind of reporting they hope Meta will adopt if Proposal 8 is successful. Proposal 8 is one of several measures investors will consider at Meta's annual meeting. Other shareholder proposals to be voted on include calls for greater transparency around child safety risks, oversight of Meta's use of artificial intelligence, and enhanced reporting on how the company's data collection practices affect user privacy. During the 2024 proxy season, JLens and the ADL campaigned at dozens of companies to push for stronger action against antisemitism and other forms of hate.</p>
