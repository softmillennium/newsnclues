                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if faced with 'unfriendly actions,' Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu claimed in an interview with TASS state news agency on April 24. "In case foreign states commit unfriendly actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, our country considers it legitimate to take symmetrical and asymmetrical measures necessary to suppress such actions and prevent their recurrence," he said. "Nuclear deterrence is carried out against states and military coalitions that regard Russia as a potential adversary, possess weapons of mass destruction, or have significant combat capabilities of general-purpose forces," he added. Shoigu also said that any European future peacekeeping forces deployed to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire would also be seen by the Kremlin as a provocation. "Sensible politicians in Europe understand that the implementation of such a scenario could lead to a direct clash between NATO and Russia and subsequently to World War III," he said. In November 2024, Russia updated its official nuclear deterrence policy. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal. The statement came as U.S. Vice President JD Vance repeated warnings that the U.S. might drop its peace efforts if both sides refuse to accept a "very explicit proposal," which includes recognizing temporarily occupied territories as Russian. The Budapest Memorandum has been sharply criticized by today's Ukrainian leadership over its lack of strong security guarantees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Revealed: Sources say bosses at R&A, which organises the annual golf tournament, were quizzed about 2028 event Senior Whitehall officials have asked golf bosses whether they can host the 2028 Open championship at Donald Trump's Turnberry course after repeated requests from the US president, sources have said. One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.” Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment. The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive, said last week he would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road. Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We're doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.” One minister told the Financial Times earlier this year the venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Host Scott Pelley explained that corporate influence on the show's editorial direction led to Bill Owens's resignation. Any merger deal that Paramount makes with Skydance will have to be approved by the Trump administration. Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,' right for the audience…. Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward. Staff were reportedly saddened over Owens's departure and the reason behind it. And now, a note on Bill Owens who, until this past week, was the executive producer of 60 Minutes. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes. Without directly rebuking Paramount, Pelley made it clear that the parent company was using its corporate influence to threaten the program's journalistic integrity. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead “60 Minutes” all along. As CBS News and other corporate news media have taken steps to limit their reporting on the Trump administration, independent media has become more important than ever in combating attacks on democracy and the rise of fascism, Truthout's board president and editor-at-large Maya Schenwar, editor-in-chief Negin Owliaei, and executive director Ziggy West Jeffery wrote in an op-ed earlier this year. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency. Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.” Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Section is responsible for enforcing laws designed to prevent voter discrimination, raised alarm about voting rights enforcement In an unusual move, Dhillon sent out new “mission statements” to the department's sections that made it clear the civil rights division was shifting its focus from protecting the civil rights of marginalized people to supporting Trump's priorities. The voting section had seven managers in January overseeing around 30 attorneys. Of the two other managers, one retired and another was detailed to work on an antisemitism task force. Political appointees have also instructed career employees to dismiss all of their active cases without meeting with them and offering a rationale – a significant break with the department's practices and norms. The justice department did not return a request for comment. Taken together, the changes have raised significant alarm about what the future of voting rights enforcement will look like for the federal government at a moment when states continue to pass restrictive voting measures. It also raises concern about future political interference. The justice department's civil rights division has long had resources and a credibility that private plaintiffs can't match. “The career managers established norms and standards and made sure that the section spoke consistently, over time, with one voice,” said a former justice department employee. “That is destroyed by gutting all the career managers.” (The department technically has one voting case that is still active, but a judge paused the case this week). Several other components of the division, including the special litigation section, have also been hit with significant losses in personnel. “This is what you do when you don't really know what the section does and just want to create chaos in the simplest way possible that doesn't involve you reading anything,” said one former voting section attorney. And the effect will be that absolutely nothing gets done.” Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his effort to try and overturn the 2020 election, has called for mass firings in the civil rights division. They are not supportive of Pres Trump or MAGA. These are leftwing activists who have come from and should return to their leftwing organizations,” she wrote in a post on X shortly after the election. The American Accountability Foundation, a dark money group that created a “DEI watch list” of federal employees, also sent a letter to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, last year urging her to fire certain lawyers in the voting section. In addition to having decades of experience, they act as a buffer between the political attorneys in a section's front office and the apolitical career line attorneys. While there's currently a hiring freeze, removing the career managers could pave the way for politicized hiring and a “partisan and ideological capture” of an agency that is supposed to be non-partisan, a former department employee said. Since the start of the Trump administration, the justice department has dismissed big cases challenging a sweeping voting law in Georgia and a major case challenging electoral districts drawn in Texas. It has also dismissed cases in Virginia and Alabama that sought to stop the states from being too aggressive in removing people from their voter rolls. Before the Texas redistricting case was dismissed, there was a perfunctory meeting between political appointees and career staff in which political appointees had not bothered to read materials in advance, according to the former department employee. They have refused meetings to discuss dismissals since, the person said, and political appointees have not even bothered to learn the names of career attorneys. “Even if you don't think that some claims should have been brought, it's not plausible that every case in the hopper is unmerited, by any interpretation of the rules,” said Justin Levitt, a former top official in the civil rights division during the Obama administration. “Dropping those cases without explanation is simply arbitrary – and ‘arbitrary' is exactly what you don't want from the country's lead agency of law enforcement,” he added. In some cases, justice department leadership has publicly antagonized the work of career personnel. Even though the voting section's work slowed considerably during Trump's first term, and it switched positions in some major cases, there was a general respect and collegiality for the career employees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional Republicans on Sunday released legislation that would pump an additional $150 billion into the Pentagon — a morass of waste and profiteering — over the next decade as part of a sweeping reconciliation package that's also expected to include deep cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthy. The bill, which is scheduled for a committee markup on Tuesday, also includes $4.5 billion to speed production of the B-21 stealth bomber, a Northrop Grumman-made aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons. William Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said Sunday that the GOP's proposed Pentagon spending increase is “a glaring example of misplaced priorities.” “Any additional money pumped into this system is likely to be wasted. “Given that the Pentagon and its contractor network are having a hard time spending existing funds well,” Hartung added, “Congress should think twice before sending more taxpayer money their way.” Earlier this month, as Common Dreams reported, Hegseth endorsed Trump's push for a $1 trillion U.S. military budget, which would mark the highest level of spending since the Second World War. We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Be among the first to get it. Ukraine seized a foreign vessel allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on April 25. Russia had looted millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied territories, with at least 180,000 tons stolen through Mariupol alone, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Oct. 8, 2024. According to the SBU statement, the ship, allegedly part of Russia's so-called "shadow fleet," was detained in Ukraine's internal Black Sea waters. Investigators said the vessel had loaded around 5,000 tons of stolen Ukrainian wheat from the Russian-occupied port city of Sevastopol in late 2024 and attempted to disguise its operations by sailing under the flag of an Asian country. The ship and its crew have been detained, and an investigation is underway to identify all parties involved, according to the statement. Russia's theft of Ukrainian grain and repeated attacks on agricultural infrastructure have caused severe damage to Ukraine's farming industry, once among the world's top wheat producers. The situation worsened after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July 2023, although Ukraine later established a new maritime trade corridor. Evidence collected by human rights investigators also suggests that the Kremlin planned to weaponize food supplies and disrupt Ukraine's agricultural output months before launching the full-scale invasion. Despite the losses, Ukraine managed to export nearly 100 million tons of goods from January to September 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USMCA currently obliges Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to give one another three months' notice before starting free-trade talks with a 'non-market country.' U.S. President Donald Trump will seek even more restrictions on Canada's ability to sign trade agreements with China when Washington and Ottawa start renegotiations on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, an international trade expert predicts. David Collins, who specializes in international trade and investment law at City St. George's, University of London, says he expects the United States will seek to toughen up Article 32.10 in the next United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. That is going to be beefed up,” he said of a renegotiated deal. Under the existing article, Canada or other partners must also disclose to other USMCA signatories “as much information as possible” on objectives for their negotiations with a country deemed to have a non-market economy. This U.S. policy makes it easier for American trade regulators to find Chinese companies guilty of dumping goods. Finally, Washington or other partners can withdraw from the trilateral North American pact within six months of one of them inking a deal with a non-market economy. In March, China's ambassador to Canada told The Globe and Mail his country is open to negotiating a free-trade agreement with Ottawa and co-operating on a research station in the Arctic – extending an invitation to repair strained ties as Canada's relations with the United States worsen. Prime Minister Mark Carney, running as Liberal Leader in Monday's federal election, announced last month that Mr. Trump had agreed to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship after the federal election with whoever is prime minster. Mr. Carney said his preference would be a renegotiation of the USMCA. The United States, currently in a trade war with China, is conducting trade negotiations with allies such as Japan, South Korea and India as these countries seek to resolve tariff threats from Washington. The U.S. is looking for allies in its dispute over what it considers China's unfair trading practices, and is seeking to isolate Beijing. China, separately, has been warning other countries it will retaliate against them if they align with the United States against Chinese interests. Lawrence Herman, a Toronto-based international trade lawyer, said he expects Canadian negotiations with Mr. Trump's administration will be difficult. “The U.S. is going to demand certain things from its trading partners, including Canada.

NEW YORK, April 27. /TASS/. Sodium perchlorate used in solid rocket fuel could be the cause of an explosion at Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, The New York Times reported, citing a source in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC, the elite unit of Iran's armed forces).

However, the source did not specify what might have caused the substance to explode.

On Saturday morning, a powerful explosion occurred in Iran's Shahid Rajaee port on the Persian Gulf coast. According to the latest reports, at least eight people were killed and more than 750 injured. Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni arrived at the scene. The cause of the explosion has not yet been officially announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yemen's Houthi rebels on Monday alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others. The US military had no immediate comment. It also likely will renew questions from activists about the American campaign, known as “Operation Rough Rider,” which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program. The US military's Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,” Central Command said. It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press about the alleged strike in Saada. Graphic footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the site. The rebels' Civil Defense organization said at least 68 people had been killed and 47 others wounded in the attack. Footage from the site analyzed by the AP suggested some kind of explosion took place there, with its cement walls seemingly peppered by debris fragments and the wounds suffered by those there. A woman's voice, soft in the footage, can be heard repeating the start of a prayer in Arabic: “In the name of God.” An occasional gunshot rang out as medics sought to help those wounded. Ethiopians and other African migrants for years have landed in Yemen, braving the war-torn nation to try and reach Saudi Arabia for work. The Houthi rebels allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border. Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. An Oct. 3, 2022, letter to the kingdom from the U.N. said its investigators “received concerning allegations of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire allegedly by Saudi security forces, causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants.” Meanwhile, US airstrikes overnight targeting Yemen's capital killed at least eight people, the Houthis said. The American military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in their monthlong campaign. The overnight statement from Central Command also said “Operation Rough Rider” had “killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,” including those associated with its missile and drone program. It did not identify any of those officials. The Houthis are also the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel. On April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port. Related article Yemen's Houthis vow to continue attacks after more than 70 killed in US airstrikes on port “US strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel, which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,” it said. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should “quickly hand over” the devices to authorities. “A field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,” the Houthis warned. Starlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. JUZEL LLOYD is an energy and environmental technology researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The world is witnessing a new kind of global race—not for authority in space but for control over the global nuclear energy market. Nuclear power had long been considered risky owing to major accidents and budget overruns, hampering its large-scale adoption. China and Russia are seizing the lead, expanding their domestic capacities as well as exporting nuclear technology and constructing nuclear power plants across a variety of emerging economies. Russia now leads the world in nuclear power plant construction. Over the past ten years, meanwhile, China has inked contracts to help construct nine reactors in four countries while maintaining an unparalleled rate of expansion in its domestic nuclear industry. Both countries have been particularly quick to grasp the potential of small modular reactors, which typically can generate up to a third of the power produced by conventional nuclear plants. Compared with traditional large reactors, SMRs can be deployed quickly to areas that lack resilient electric-grid capacity, and their modular designs make them more affordable. Global electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of around four percent over the next several years, and developing countries will account for an estimated 85 percent of that new demand. Among the major powers, China and Russia have been by far the most proactive in recognizing this need and responding to it with nuclear power exports. But since around the 1970s, it has ceded this leadership because of public opposition, rising costs, and regulatory challenges. The surging need for electricity to power AI, coupled with developing countries' desire for energy access, means that countries capable of exporting SMRs quickly and affordably will become increasingly influential partners to other nations. To prevent authoritarian regimes from commanding the future nuclear energy market, the United States must continue updating its regulatory framework that governs reactor licensing and redirect federal investment toward its own SMR industry. Only a collaborative effort—ideally, in the form of a multilateral nuclear energy organization—can offer emerging economies competitive funding packages that rival those proffered by China and Russia. If Western countries do not urgently rethink their international nuclear energy strategies, autocratic regimes may well use nuclear power to steer the trajectory of the world's economy and politics before democracies realize it is too late to catch up. China's and Russia's appetites for exporting nuclear energy are growing fast. This month, Rosatom began the preparatory site work to construct a nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan, which will be the first nuclear reactor in Central Asia and Russia's first SMR export. China, for its part, has in the past 15 years signed nuclear energy agreements with Argentina, Hungary, Nigeria, and Pakistan. China's high-temperature gas-cooled modular pebble-bed reactor, which began operating in 2023, is the first of its kind. Other countries are attempting to get into the game. China's nuclear industry is powered by thousands of highly skilled staff members operating with remarkable speed. These efficiencies are not simply a byproduct of authoritarian control: they are the result of deliberate choices by Beijing and Moscow to elevate nuclear energy to a national priority. Both nations have made licensing processes to construct reactors more efficient without compromising safety. To accomplish Beijing's nuclear goals, the Energy Research Institute at China's National Development and Reform Commission has estimated that China must—and can—make over $1.3 trillion worth of investments by 2050. Russia has committed more than $26 billion to domestic nuclear projects and offers multibillion-dollar export financing packages. Other countries also have state-backed nuclear institutions, but none are yet attempting to match the scale of China's and Russia's export drives. Both China National Nuclear Corporation and Rosatom often cover as much as 85 percent of an overseas project's costs in the form of loans with favorable interest rates. And both offer “build-own-operate” contracts, or agreements that allow them to own the reactors they construct abroad for a set period, thereby reducing burdens—such as managing spent nuclear fuel—for buyer nations. CNNC also provides foreign buyers with comprehensive services including the design, construction, and operation of its nuclear plants. SMR technology was initially developed in the 1950s, primarily for military applications. Unlike conventional large reactors, SMRs' diverse sizes and forms offer greater flexibility, allowing them to meet smaller energy demands and more specialized applications in a wider variety of geographical locations. SMRs' streamlined manufacturing processes and shorter construction timelines could also allow buyer nations to bypass many of the daunting financial and logistical challenges inherent in building conventional nuclear power plants. Experts have estimated that SMR projects could take three to six years compared with the ten or more years it takes to deploy conventional reactors. If the SMR projects already underway in China and Russia succeed at expanding nuclear energy access at a lower cost, that may increase SMRs' appeal to emerging economies aiming to break into energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and data centers. Certain advanced designs can achieve higher operating temperatures, enabling them to generate process heat for industrial applications such as steelmaking and producing ammonia for fertilizer. These uses are critical: in 2022, the industrial sector accounted for approximately 37 percent of global energy consumption. But China and Russia believe they will transform the energy market: with huge investments, by 2030, China hopes to export 30 reactors to its Belt and Road Initiative partner countries, and Russia aims to capture 20 percent of the global SMR market. But these agreements also risk creating long-term dependence, ensuring that buyer countries remain indebted to China and Russia and reliant on their operational expertise for decades. Despite this threat of dependence, emerging economies—as well as developed countries that want to generate more nuclear power—have few compelling alternatives to Chinese and Russian nuclear energy. Another American company, Westinghouse, is helping Poland build its first nuclear power plant. But these efforts lag far behind those made by Beijing and Moscow. Although some unique efficiencies help centralized, statist governments fast-track nuclear energy projects, there is no inherent reason why the United States and its allies cannot support the development, production, and export of reactors at a rate that competes with their authoritarian counterparts. China's and Russia's ambitious, state-backed funding models, however, have edged out U.S. companies. U.S. government policy bears some responsibility: export laws have erected onerous barriers to countries interested in purchasing U.S. reactors. Before the United States transfers nuclear technologies and materials to another country, it demands that the partner country sign a peaceful nuclear energy cooperation agreement, referred to as a 123 agreement. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission often takes five years or more to approve a reactor project and imposes burdensome fee structures on applicants. Kairos Power's Hermes reactor is the only licensed SMR actively under construction in the United States; this slow pursuit of SMRs reflects long-standing institutional challenges at the NRC, including an internal culture that has struggled to align with innovation. The race to provide advanced nuclear power is not simply a symbolic technological competition. Beijing and Moscow will steadily gain more soft power as the countries with which they have nuclear energy deals are incentivized to align with their economic ambitions and political ideals. This is happening already: for instance, Rosatom is expanding Hungary's nuclear power capacity; nuclear energy now generates about 44 percent of the country's electricity. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban vehemently opposed including Russian nuclear power in the EU's sanctions on Russian nuclear energy, achieving an exemption. In 2014, Russia shut off its gas supplies to Ukraine for months after annexing the Crimean Peninsula, causing economic and social disruption. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity cannot be stockpiled, making the shutdown of a nuclear power plant devastating for a nation's power grid and economic stability. Other major powers with advanced nuclear industries have not done enough to offer the accessible financing and turnkey project models that developing countries need. Maintaining geopolitical balance in the nuclear energy market requires the United States and its allies to adopt more competitive strategies, particularly when it comes to SMRs. It requires the NRC to update its regulatory framework and authorizes funding for these goals. The act is a good start, and Congress should use its provisions to maximize efforts directed toward SMR development. It should also consider adopting greater flexibility in how it negotiates enrichment and reprocessing terms: rather than insisting partners fully renounce these capabilities, Washington could allow them under strict oversight, balancing nonproliferation objectives with the need to compete in the nuclear export market. The main problem for Western countries is how to equal or better the efficient construction and funding that China and Russia now offer. A separate proposed initiative to make nuclear energy financing more accessible and competitive, the International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure, began too broadly by asking 50 countries to create an entirely new financial institution and has now stalled. A similar kind of collaboration is urgently needed for power plant construction. This cooperation could be coordinated by a new agency or a dedicated arm of an established institution such as the International Atomic Energy Agency; it should leverage each country's strengths, such as Canada's preeminence in uranium mining and the United States' extensive reactor design portfolio. A cooperative could also boost each member country's domestic nuclear industry—including its ability to develop SMRs—by encouraging the sharing of expertise and infrastructure. And it would afford its members leverage to reform development finance frameworks that exclude nuclear power projects from consideration. By pooling their strengths, democracies can help address emerging economies' rising demand for power while enhancing their own energy security and diplomatic independence. They could offer developing countries a greater stake in operating their reactors, including by investing more resources in training the local workforce and helping buyer countries establish strong nuclear energy regulatory frameworks. A cooperative could also strengthen public-private partnerships, bolstering support for private advanced nuclear technology companies to accelerate economies of scale and resulting cost declines. And a nuclear energy cooperative would provide the West with a crucial platform to continue influencing nonproliferation safeguards by creating better balanced technology export standards that maintain nuclear safety without deterring buyers. Developing nations may nonetheless decide to source nuclear energy technologies from China and Russia. The United States and its allies still have a chance to counterbalance China's and Russia's expanding influence over the nuclear energy sector.

TOKYO, April 28. /TASS/. Kim Jong Un believes that North Korean forces' participation in the operation to liberate Russia's Kursk Region from Ukrainian troops was "a sacred mission" aimed at strengthening friendship with Moscow, the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea said in a statement.

"Kim Jong Un determined that the participation of our armed forces in the war was a sacred mission aimed at cementing the traditional friendship and solidarity between the two countries, guaranteeing the development and prosperity of both countries and protecting North Korea's honor," the statement reads, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Kim decided that the situation required the enactment of Article 4 of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between North Korea and Russia and ordered the forces of the Korean People's Army "to defeat and eliminate Ukrainian neo-Nazi invaders and liberate certain areas of the Kursk Region in coordination with the Russian Armed Forces."

According to the KCNA, Kim hails North Korean troops that took part in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region as heroes who fought for justice. He announced that a memorial to the North Korean soldiers who participated in the operation would soon be established in Pyongyang.

On April 26, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Army General Valery Gerasimov reported to President Vladimir Putin that the operation to liberate the Kursk Region from the Ukrainian forces that had invaded the region in August 2024 was over. Gerasimov particularly highlighted the role of North Korean soldiers.

Article 4 of the Russia-North Korea Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership says that if one of the parties comes under armed attack by another country or group of countries, the other party will immediately provide it with military and other assistance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vancouver's acting police chief said that Saturday was the city's darkest day. It was also the darkest for Canada's dynamic and growing Filipino community. The vehicle attack that killed 11 people at a street festival Saturday night left its roughly one million members reeling. “We will feel this for a long time,” said RJ Aquino, chair of Filipino B.C. His voice broke as he described how panicked messages and calls poured into his phone after the attack on the festival, Lapu-Lapu Day. MLA Mable Elmore spoke of the “mad scramble” that followed. “Even in the face of sorrow, our community's spirit remains unshaken. We will continue to celebrate our culture, not just as a tradition, but as a powerful expression of resistance, pride, and hope,” said Marites de Jesus, director of National Filipino Heritage Canada, in an e-mail message. Filipino and Canadian flags are seen with other items at a memorial site in Vancouver.David Ryder/Reuters Police tape stretches across artwork on a utility box near the vehicle attack in Vancouver.David Ryder/Reuters Across social media, Filipinos rallied to raise awareness about blood donations in the Vancouver area. One of the victims was Rizza Azzir, according to online posts. Ms. Azzir was identified in Facebook posts and a GoFundMe campaign started by her cousin, Shelby Pacumio. Sydney Roa, who was at the festival but left before the attack, set up a GoFundMe page on behalf of a Vancouver-based organization that she runs, Tadhana Toys, which provides clothes, books and games to children in hospitals, low-income families and new immigrants. Mable Elmore (right), a member of the British Columbia Legislative Assembly, and RJ Aquino, is embraced at the end of a news conference the day after a man drove a vehicle into pedestrians at the annual Lapu-Lapu festival celebrating Filipino culture, in Vancouver, on April 27.NAV RAHI/AFP/Getty Images British Columbia Premier David Eby pointed out there were probably few in the province who were not touched by care given by a Filipino, whether it is in long-term-care homes, hospitals, child care or schools. In a statement in June marking a month-long celebration of Filipino heritage, Diversity Minister Kamal Khera said that “due to their recognized expertise in nursing and health care,” Filipino Canadians were “strengthening Canada's health care system and supporting the well-being of Canadian families.” Thousands of Filipinas came under the government's live-in caregiver program, often working long hours so they could send money home to their families. By the 2021 census, 957,355 people reported being of Filipino ethnic origin. Greater Toronto had the biggest community, at 272,470, followed by Vancouver (141,230), Calgary (83,815), Winnipeg (81,140), Edmonton (77,085) and Montreal (39,020). A Statistics Canada report from 2023 said that “over one-third of Canadians reporting Filipino roots living in Canada in 2021 arrived within the previous decade.” Father Joseph D'Souza asked for a moment of silence in recognition of what he called the “tragic incident” on Saturday night. After the service, Angelo and Jennifer Tuazon reflected on what had happened. It was the second year for that festival and instead of joy, now it's going to be remembered differently,” Mr. Tuazon said as the couple and their 13-year-daughter and five-year-old son left the church. Mohamad Sariman, a food truck operator at the Filipino festival that was attacked on Saturday night, says he initially thought the incident which left 11 dead was an explosion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They see wealth inequality in a reduced economy leading to possible mass social disorder and spreading mental health challenges as people sink into despair. Hardly anyone believes that they can build a better life for themselves, or their children, through their own efforts.” The prognostications are dire, and it's tempting to dismiss them as exaggerations from pessimistic researchers rather than accept the possibility of such a bleak future. The wealth gap is quickly widening while frustrated young Canadians are abandoning hope of home ownership or prosperity in their future. To turn Canada from its trajectory, the government must shrink and deregulate to draw both human capital and foreign investment into the nation. The government must take on trade unions, crony capitalists, and environmental activists to facilitate broad economic development. Those sorts of policy proposals, however, send chills down the spines of political strategists who want anything but conflict with the aforementioned groups during an election campaign. So we are left hoping that whoever forms the next government has a hidden agenda of reform, which will be quickly implemented upon assuming power. The report predicts existing homeowners could become future aristocrats as they expand property holdings to hand down to their children, while an underclass locked in the world of renting can't get ahead. Canada could devolve into a class-based society with “social siloing,” separating citizens based on their economic standing. Social division and a shrinking economy with wealth concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of people could start a chain reaction as skilled and ambitious people emigrate to jurisdictions offering better opportunities for upward social mobility. The demographic balance of the nation could tilt, leaving older Canadians cash-rich but resource-poor due to overburdened health and senior care resources. Those remaining in the country could find themselves seeking alternative ways to meet their needs. People could form housing, health, and food production cooperatives to make ends meet. While that may be effective, it also would lead to a form of tribalism and social introversion for large groups of people. People may take out their ire upon scapegoats such as immigrants or other identifiable groups if they aren't blaming the government itself. The potential for social conflicts will grow and could blossom into general violence. While the world envisioned within the report may hold appeal for hardcore ideological libertarians, it would be a rough and miserable place in reality. If current trends continue, the predictions could become reality in short order. Because if they stay on the current trajectory, our future looks dark indeed.</p>
