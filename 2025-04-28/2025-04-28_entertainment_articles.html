                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To open the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame-themed live episode of ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù on April 27, 2025, Carrie Underwood wowed viewers with an updated rendition of the rock song she sang 20 years earlier as a contestant on the show. In April 2005, the country singer ‚Äî who was 21 at the time ‚Äî broke out of her shell to sing Heart's ‚ÄúAlone‚Äù and blew away judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul. Underwood first performed Heart's ‚ÄúAlone‚Äù on ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù in April 2005. Twenty years later, she revisited that performance in her ‚ÄúIdol to Icon‚Äù web series, sharing how nervous she was to appear with teased hair and sing something different than the judges were used to. But she did so well that Cowell made the now-infamous prediction that she'd not only win the competition, but ‚Äúsell more records than any other previous Idol‚Äù ‚Äî a vision that did come true. For her 2025 rendition of the classic Heart song, Underwood was full of confidence and displayed her impressive vocal range on the tune, stunning fans who flooded social media with reactions. Former ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù contestant and rising country star Grace Leer wrote on Instagram, ‚ÄúINSANE!!!!' Another fan on Instagram wrote, ‚ÄúConfirming we made the right choice 20 years ago üî•üëè‚Äù During her ‚ÄúIdol to Icon‚Äù episode on April 24 about performing ‚ÄúAlone‚Äù in 2005, Underwood reflected, ‚ÄúSong choice is so difficult when you are doing something like this, because just as much as people are listening to you sing it, they're thinking about the original song. And it's like, ‚ÄòWell, does that matter if I do a good job? And I think I even remember, like, writing in my journal how much they were not gonna like me singing this song and being not so much worried. I was like, ‚ÄòThey're gonna hate it, (but) whatever. Just gotta do the best you can.‚Äù Although Underwood is one of the top country music artists on the planet, she is also a huge rock n' roll fan, so she relished watching the remaining top 14 contestants perform tunes made popular by Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees. Explaining her outfit to host Ryan Seacrest, she said, she had to represent ‚Äúthe greatest band of all time with the greatest front man of all time,‚Äù Axl Rose. In May 2023, she told Howard Stern that she's been a Guns ‚Äòn Roses fan ‚Äúsince birth‚Äù and joined the rock band for multiple concert dates that year, even serving as their unlikely opening act for three concerts in Canada. Two years earlier, during a 2021 interview on ‚ÄúCBS Sunday Morning,‚Äù Underwood revealed that her workout playlists mainly consist of ‚Äúmetal or super-hard rock music‚Äù and said that I Prevail's hardcore ‚ÄúTrauma‚Äù was among her favorites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: How is this for continuity ‚Äî as the last of the current series created/co-created by Greg Berlanti, You, is topping Netflix's charts with its just-released final season, he is readying his next series ‚Äî next three, that is, including Stillwater, which has been picked up by Amazon. Focusing on development and returning to writing over the past several months, Berlanti has set up the three high-profile new projects ‚Äî all co-written by him ‚Äî through Berlanti Prods. In a bidding war, Amazon has landed mind-bending horror thriller Stillwater, based on the Skybound comic book series by Chip Zdarsky and Ramon K. Perez, with a series order. Berlanti and Carly Wray (Watchmen) are adapting, with Skybound Entertainment (The Walking Dead) producing. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Hulu had bought spec script Foster Dade, written by Berlanti and Bash Doran (Life After Life), which is being fast-tracked for a pilot order, sources said. It is based on the 2023 novel Foster Dade Explores the Cosmos by Nash Jenkins, a mystery set in a boarding school. Details are sketchy on the third project, which is still in negotiations at Max, I hear. It is believed to be a family drama, which is intended to follow the 15 episodes a year at a reasonable budget model established by another WBTV drama series for the streamer, The Pitt. The new slate spans the gamut of genres that have signified Berlanti's writing career, from coming-of-age and family dramas that marked his early breakthrough on Dawson's Creek and first two series as creator, Everwood and Jack & Bobby, to comic book adaptations that highlighted the decade he spent building the CW's DC Arrowverse, to mysteries/thrillers with shows like You. His Berlanti Productions, which he runs with longtime producing partner, the company's Chairwoman Sarah Schechter, has remained very active, launching half a dozen series over the past three years, including NBC dramas Found and Brilliant Minds, which are awaiting renewal news alongside Berlanti Prods.' The company also recently got a greenlight at Netflix for a high-profile Scooby-Doo live-action series and sold Dilettante, starring Jeff Daniels, to Apple TV+. In Stillwater, penned by Berlanti and Wray based on Skybound's comic, when ex-con Daniel West receives a mysterious letter promising answers about his past and a substantial inheritance in the small town of Stillwater, he discovers a community where nothing ever ages, no one ever dies, and nobody ever gets out. Executive producing for Skybound Entertainment are founders Robert Kirkman and. David Alpert, Rick Jacobs, Head of TV Glenn Geller and Chip Zdarsky. Also executive producing the project are Wray, who is under an overall deal at WBTV, Robbie Rogers and former Berlanti Prods. Geller took the Stillwater comic book to Berlanti almost two years ago. Redman and Geller also had worked together as executives at CBS. Written by Berlanti and Doran based on Jenkins' debut novel, Foster Dade is a mystery set at an East Coast boarding school that explores privilege, power, sexuality, and masculinity in the age of the Internet, anxiety and pharmaceuticals. Berlanti, Schechter, and Redman executive produce alongside Doran, Jenkins, Rogers as well as Donald De Line of De Line Pictures who has developed a movie with Doran. She is repped by Untitled, WME and Johnson Shapiro Sleweet & Kole. In addition to The Walking Dead franchise on AMC, Skybound Entertainment is behind the hit Amazon adult-animation series Invincible, created by Kirkman. The company is in post production on two international series, Swedish-language disaster thriller Vaka for Prime Video Nordics and Spanish language series Dime Tu Nombre for Prime Video Spain. Doran recently created and executive produced the four-part BBC series Life After Life, based on the novel by Kate Atkinson, which is available on Prime Video. Doran's movie Henry, financed by Studio Canal, will shoot in 2026 with Ralph Fiennes starring. She is writing an adaptation of Witness For the Prosecution for Twentieth Century Fox and developing TV projects with Anne Hathaway at Amazon and with Playtone at Apple TV+. Berlanti has served as a creator or executive producer on over 45 television series, including 9 that have hit the 100-episode mark. In addition to his TV Academy Governors' Award, he received the PGA's Norman Lear Achievement Award and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on Sunday, Shaun Gray says he penned key scenes for the film after screenwriter Eric Warren Singer and director Joseph Kosinski enlisted his help to craft the story behind the blockbuster sequel. Paramount Co-CEOs Earned More Than $61M Combined in 2024, Bob Bakish Severance Revealed In a statement, Paramount Pictures said this lawsuit, ‚Äúlike the one previously brought by Mr. Toberoff in an attempt to benefit off of the success of Top Gun: Maverick, is completely without merit.‚Äù It added, ‚ÄúWe are confident that a court will reject this claim as well.‚Äù His credits show that he was a staff writer on an episode of Shantaram and was Singer's writer's assistant for The International. Over the next five months, he actively participated in story meetings and ‚Äúwrote key scenes‚Äù for vital action sequences, the lawsuit says. This includes the opening scene in which Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, pushes a high-tech prototype fighter jet past its limits, breaking speed records before the aircraft fails, and another sequence in which he repeatedly outmaneuvers elite pilots during a training exercise, culminating in a dogfight with a trainee. The lawsuit seeks a court order for Gray to receive a ‚Äúscreenplay by‚Äù credit moving forward, for Paramount to include him in future marketing efforts and works related to the movie and a cut of profit. If the court declines to issue such an order, he brings a claim for copyright infringement and seeks unspecified damages. In a statement, Toberoff said the lawsuit has ‚Äúabsolutely nothing to do with the priorTop Gun suit currently up on appeal.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúParamount can deny and deflect all they want‚Äù but that an exhibit included in the complaint documents ‚ÄúShaun Gray's very significant joint-authorship of the Top Gun: Maverick screenplay with detailed citations to Gray's time-stamped files and time-stamped emails conveying to Eric Singer the numerous pivotal scenes Gray authored and, at times, to the film's director, Joe Kosinski as well.‚Äù Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

The single, whose title honors late R&B great Luther Vandross, who is sampled on it, became Lamar's sixth No. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career Hot 100 reigns with the song. 1s (46 of 1,179, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start) have ruled for double-digit weeks. Of those, ‚ÄúLuther‚Äù is the first by a solo man and woman and no accompanying acts ‚Äì surpassing the nine-week reign of Diana Ross and Lionel Richie's ‚ÄúEndless Love‚Äù in 1981.

Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 3, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, April 29. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. ‚ÄúLuther,‚Äù on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 68.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1% week-over-week), 21.9 million official streams (down 13%) and 2,000 sold (down 14%) in the U.S. April 18-24. ‚ÄúLuther‚Äù leads Radio Songs for a fourth week and dips to No. ‚ÄúLuther‚Äù concurrently collects an 18th week at No. Two weeks after ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù became Alex Warren's first Hot 100 top 10, the song pushes 5-3 for a new best. It concurrently crowns Streaming Songs for the first time, with 21 million streams (up 3%). (While the song's sum of raw streams is the week's second-highest, after ‚ÄúLuther,‚Äù ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù tops Streaming Songs due to the application of weighting to all titles' paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streams and programmed/radio streams.) A week earlier, ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù became Warren's first No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, where it descends to No. Morgan Wallen and Post Malone's ‚ÄúI Ain't Coming Back‚Äù bows at No. Here's a recap of the collection's top 10s to date: (Previously, Post Malone's Hollywood's Bleeding, in 2019, and Taylor Swift's Red, in 2012, each generated four Hot 100 top 10s before debuting, each at No. Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' ‚ÄúDie With a Smile‚Äù keeps at No. Drake's ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù drops 3-4 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. Shaboozey's ‚ÄúA Bar Song (Tipsy)‚Äù rebounds 5-4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. It adds a 42nd week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.

While little is known about Cregger's latest horror/thriller, New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner described the film as being ‚Äúbatshit insane.‚Äù Cregger agrees with that categorization, saying that the mystery of missing kids will ‚Äúpropel you through at least half of the movie, but that is not the movie.‚Äù He teased, ‚ÄúThe movie will fork and change and reinvent and go in new places. By the midpoint, we've moved on to way crazier shit than that.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople might think from the outside looking in that I was flinging dollar bills in the air and calling enemies and saying, ‚ÄòFuck you.' The truth of the matter was it's a very high-pressure thing, and people were getting pissed and it was stressful. I didn't totally get to unclench and appreciate what happened until maybe a week later when the dust settled and the adrenaline subsided.‚Äù He continued that compared to ‚ÄúBarbarian,‚Äù ‚ÄúWeapons‚Äù is ‚Äúmore ambitious in almost every way.‚Äù I have way more actors to fit into this thing. It's just a bigger, weirder movie than ‚ÄòBarbarian' is.‚Äù ‚ÄúWeapons‚Äù premieres August 8 in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

Episode 2 of ‚ÄúThe Rehearsal‚Äù Season 2 saw Nathan Fielder engaging in the kind of elaborate simulation of a social interaction that has become his trademark in recent years. But rather than a bar trivia dispute or an uncomfortable cockpit moment, this rehearsal saw the comedian prepare to tackle a real problem from his own professional life: the removal of the Summit Ice episode of ‚ÄúNathan for You‚Äù from Paramount+. Officially titled ‚ÄúHorseback Riding/Man Zone,‚Äù Season 3, Episode 2 of ‚ÄúNathan for You‚Äù saw Fielder use his outlandish tactics to solve a variety of small business problems. The most notable storyline from the episode involved Fielder learning that the brand Taiga had published a tribute to a Holocaust denier, prompting him to start his own outerwear brand, Summit Ice, which placed Holocaust remembrance front and center. While the episode found humor in Fielder convincing a sporting goods store owner to let him build an elaborate display of information about Hitler's atrocities next to the jackets, Summit Ice has continued to operate as a real brand that donates all of its proceeds to Holocaust remembrance organizations.

Fielder used the episode's removal to make a broader point about the availability of Jewish content on Paramount+. Fielder admitted that he was in an awkward situation. ‚ÄúHorseback Riding/Man Zone‚Äù is currently streaming on Max along with all episodes of ‚ÄúNathan for You.‚Äù A Paramount+ spokesperson confirmed to IndieWire ‚Äî following The Hollywood Reporter ‚Äî that the ‚ÄúNathan for You‚Äù episode was removed from the streaming service following a ‚Äústandards review.‚Äù IndieWire has reached out for additional comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drag entertainer and ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race‚Äù alumni Jiggly Caliente, also known as Bianca Castro-Arebejo, passed away on Sunday, April 27, following a ‚Äúserious health set back‚Äù that led to the amputation of her right leg. Since Jiggly's passing was announced by her family on Instagram, ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race‚Äù stars from around the world have paid tribute to the late queen's legacy. ‚ÄúIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Bianca Castro-Arebejo, known to the world and cherished by many as Jiggly Caliente,‚Äù wrote her family in a private statement, adding that ‚ÄúBiance passed away peacefully on April 27, 2025 at 4:42 am, surrounded by her loving family and close friends. ‚ÄúA luminous presence in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, Jiggly Caliente was celebrated for her infectious energy, fierce wit, and unwavering authenticity,‚Äù the statement continued. Ginger Minj, who competed alongside Jiggly on ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 6,‚Äù responded to the news on Instagram, writing, ‚ÄúJiggly was one of the fiercest, funniest, most loyal friends I've ever had. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high.‚Äù Jiggly originally appeared on Season 4 of ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race‚Äù in 2012 where she placed 8th. The queen later returned to compete on ‚ÄúAll Stars 6‚Äù in 2021, where she placed 12th. ‚ÄúDrag Race Philippines‚Äù judge Kalad Karen similarly paid tribute to Jiggly following her passing, writing, ‚ÄúThank you for everything my dearest sister. ‚ÄòDrag Race Philippines' wouldn't be the same without you. The news of Jiggly's passing comes just days after her family shared a devastating health update, telling fans that ‚Äúdue to a severe infection, she was hospitalized and, as a result, has undergone the loss of most of her right leg,‚Äù adding that the 44-year-old queen's recovery would be ‚Äúextensive.‚Äù In addition to her appearances on ‚ÄúDrag Race,‚Äù Jiggly has also had roles in series like ‚ÄúBroad City‚Äù and ‚ÄúPose‚Äù as well as co-hosting ‚ÄúTranslation,‚Äù the first major talk show on a major network (Out TV) hosted by an all-transgender cast. Jiggly co-hosted the show with fellow trans ‚ÄúDrag Race‚Äù contestants Carmen Carerra, Peppermint, and Kylie Sonique Love. Jiggly Caliente, 44, is the second ‚ÄúDrag Race‚Äù queen to pass away in 2025, following  ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race UK‚Äù Season 1 winner The Vivienne, who passed away in January following a cardiac arrest that resulted from a ketamine overdose.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúThese remarkable nominees have each created their own musical style and attitude impacting generations of music lovers,‚Äù he wrote. Carey appeared on this year's ballot alongside Phish, Outkast, Oasis, Billy Idol, Cyndi Lauper, Joy Division/New Order, Soundgarden, the White Stripes, Joe Cocker, Bad Company, Black Crowes, Chubby Checker, and Man√°. That time, she appeared alongside Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, Oasis, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Dave Matthews Band, Eric B. In fact, it barely took a decade after the release of her debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990 for her influence to begin crafting a new generation of pop divas who would take charge arranging their own vocals in the studio with the same authority they'd wield onstage. With each passing year, the legacy Carey has crafted only becomes more indisputable. What else does the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame want from her? ‚ÄúEverybody was calling me going, ‚ÄòI think you're getting in!' and so I was excited about it,‚Äù she told the Los Angeles Times. ‚ÄúBut then it didn't happen.‚Äù She felt a similar sense of inevitability when her 1995 opus Daydream racked up six nominations at the Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. ‚ÄúOne Sweet Day,‚Äù ‚ÄúAlways Be My Baby,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFantasy‚Äù ‚Äî all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 ‚Äî were up for awards. ‚ÄúAll those songs in a row ended up being so big,‚Äù she said, surely at least one would win, right? Those three songs make up only a fraction of the 19 Number One singles Carey has earned in the past 35 years, 18 of which she is credited with co-writing. By 1998, she had enough hit singles to release her first greatest-hits compilation, Number 1's, featuring the 13 she had accumulated in only eight years. It gave us ‚ÄúWe Belong Together,‚Äù ‚ÄúShake It Off,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon't Forget About Us,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt's Like That,‚Äù small pieces of what Carey told Rolling Stone in 2024 became ‚Äúmy favorite body of work that I've done.‚Äù In the history of the Hall, some artists, like Patti Smith and Solomon Burke, were nominated between seven and nine times before being inducted. Chic has been nominated 11 times and has yet to be inducted (though Nile Rodgers was inducted into the Hall in 2017, receiving the Award for Musical Excellence). It took Janet Jackson and Joni Mitchell three nominations in three years long after their eligibility periods began to make it in. Even Brenda Lee, whose ‚ÄúRockin' Around the Christmas Tree‚Äù goes head-to-head on the charts with ‚ÄúAll I Want for Christmas Is You‚Äù each year, wasn't inducted until 2002, after three nominations. Like many of these artists, Carey should never have needed more than one.

Her speech played up the dramatics that she's known for, but it also emphasized the years she spent ‚Äúwalking by myself and coming up with melodies and writing words in a book.‚Äù That accolade in particular meant a lot. ‚ÄúThat's the power of success, especially at Mariah Carey's level,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbecause you can be overlooked in certain respects and people will forget that you are an artist. People forget, and suddenly you just become the product.‚Äù There's always been a prominent thread of resilience woven throughout Carey's career. She's encountered her share of both real and contrived rivalries ‚Äî par for the course for most pop stars ‚Äî but never anything explosive enough to disrupt her unbothered aura of tranquility. She's released 15 studio albums and won six of her 34 career Grammy Award nominations. Mariah is in the same vein as Janet and Whitney. ‚ÄúI don't want to just be categorized as ‚Äòof this era.' My goal is to have a career that stands. ‚Äú[Sony] would put out like only four singles from one of my albums,‚Äù Carey said. But with me it was like, ‚ÄòGet in the studio!

The Hall selection criteria is meant to take into account an artist's impact on music culture, like Carey's trailblazing success as a female pop producer and songwriter in the face of corporate misogyny. It's also the influence an artist has had on other musicians, like Latto repurposing ‚ÄúFantasy‚Äù into a hit for the 2020s with ‚ÄúBig Energy,‚Äù or Megan Thee Stallion boasting, ‚ÄúI feel like Mariah Carey/Got these niggas so obsessed‚Äù on her Number One single ‚ÄúHiss.‚Äù The Hall also values range and longevity as they relate to both an artist's career and their body of work, reflected in Carey's positioning at the intersection between pop, R&B, and hip-hop (she even has a secret alt-rock/grunge album sitting in a vault somewhere).

In a statement, singer-guitarist Elizabeth Stokes said ‚ÄúMetal‚Äù is about living in a human body and her personal ‚Äúhealth journey‚Äù as of late: ‚ÄúFor parts of the last few years, I kind of felt like my body was a vehicle that had carried me pretty well thus far but was breaking down, something I had little to no control over. And despite all the ways that my body feels like a broken machine, I still marvel at the complexity of such a machine.‚Äù She continued: ‚ÄúI can hold that knowledge in one hand, and yet with the other hand I can point to my reflection and just be like ‚Äòyou are shit.'

It is a state that has been crushed in terms of its economy. ‚ÄúTake a state like Alabama, a deep red state, I don't think people would realize that the largest employer in the state of Alabama is the University of Alabama, which is obviously tied to their hospital system,‚Äù Ruhle adds. ‚ÄúIt's why you've got Republican senator Katie Britt in Alabama urging the President not to have these sweeping cuts, because when you take cuts like that, you're going to impact millions and millions and millions of potential lives if we're cutting off medical research.‚Äù For Ruhle, who frequently covers business and economics given her background as a financial reporter, the cuts are part and parcel of the sweeping tariffs announced earlier this month as part of an effort to reshape the economy. Though she notes that many Americans do want to shake up what had been the status quo. But there is some boldness to it if you want to shake up the status quo, and most people would argue they have some appetite for shaking up status quo, right?‚Äù Ruhle says. There's a large gap between that and where we are right now. ‚ÄúWhen people think about federal workers, they just think bloated D.C. And you know, there is a big positive appetite for the idea of DOGE,‚Äù Ruhle says. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
