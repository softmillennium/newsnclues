                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Bitcoin price highs could be driven by activity in US Treasurys and central banks boosting exposure to gold. Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%. The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion—the highest since March 2023. The 30-year US Treasury yield fell by 30 basis points from its April peak, indicating a rise in bond prices as investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the safety of these bonds. This surge in demand for Treasurys as a safe-haven asset boosts market liquidity and stability while lowering US borrowing costs. However, foreign central banks have pivoted, cutting Treasury holdings to 23% of US government debt, a 22-year low. During the 2020 pandemic, when US Treasury inflows spiked amid COVID-19 uncertainty, Bitcoin soared from $9,000 to nearly $60,000 by early 2021, with gold's share of global reserves rising by 14.5% in 18 months. However, Bitcoin's bullish narrative could falter if global markets enter a recession in 2025. This is due to investors' decision to prioritize liquidity and traditional safe-haven assets like cash or US Treasurys during economic downturns, as noted last week, over speculative assets like Bitcoin. Anonymous global markets researcher Capital Flows noted that macroeconomic liquidity and positioning factors drive Bitcoin's bullish price trajectory. The analyst highlighted BTC's impulse strength in a directional probability skew chart, suggesting that it is poised for an upward movement. This aligned with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley's observation that Google searches for "Bitcoin" are near long-term lows, suggesting the rally is fueled by institutions, advisers, corporations, and nations rather than retail investors. The lack of retail-driven search interest contrasts with historical trends where Bitcoin search volume strongly correlated with its price in the previous cycle (r=91%, per SEMrush data), indicating a shift in market dynamics where institutional adoption is fueling demand.</p>

The suit was filed Friday in a Brooklyn federal court with Australian resident Jadeep Cheema leading the group of aggrieved customers for Nike's digital sneakers. Nike acquired RTFKT in 2021, a year after the sneaker NFT studio was founded, and began releasing Swoosh-branded digital collectables. Nike would profit in its initial sale of tokens and would also get its cut any time one of its NFTs were bought or sold on the secondary market.

These “forging” events were particularly important for driving the value of the tokens, with one such occasion October 23 leading to a 600 percent rise in prices. Amid a wider landscape of suits seeking to determine the legal status of NFTs, Cheema is joining the side arguing they should be considered as securities. Cheema is seeking damages of at least $5 million, as well as the disgorgement of RTFKT profits and injunctive relief to prevent Nike from offering additional unregistered securities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mastercard is moving deeper into the digital asset economy by launching new global capabilities to support stablecoin payments across its vast merchant network, the company announced Monday. The payments giant is working with crypto exchange OKX to roll out the "OKX Card," aimed at linking crypto trading and Web3 activities with everyday spending. Meanwhile, merchants will soon be able to settle transactions directly in stablecoins such as Circle's USDC, thanks to collaborations with Nuvei and Circle. Paxos will help extend this functionality to other supported stablecoins like USDP. “When it comes to blockchain and digital assets, the benefits for mainstream use cases are clear,” Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard, said in a statement. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have been gradually moving beyond trading venues into mainstream payments. Mastercard's initiative covers the full range of stablecoin use cases, from wallet enablement and card issuance to merchant settlement and on-chain remittances. The company has previously partnered with crypto exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Crypto.com to allow users to pay with stablecoins via traditional cards. Last year, it rolled out Mastercard Crypto Credential, a service designed to simplify sending digital assets across borders using verified usernames rather than complex wallet addresses. In 2023, Mastercard launched its Multi-Token Network (MTN) which is being leveraged to facilitate real-time settlements and redemptions of tokenized assets.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months. In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders. Although this goes against Bitcoin's decentralization ethos, it's undeniably bullish for its price. Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin's market cap to $200T. Some critics warn that Strategy's debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency's protocol. Bitcoin's hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case. If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin's scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin's growth. What's more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin's price increases by $25K. The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on. Don't miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they've taken off is an uphill task. $MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone's opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode. Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI's newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves. It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come. Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity. They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity's popularity. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now. With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC. However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns. Finally, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A cryptocurrency exchange reached an agreement with cybercriminals who hacked into millions, marking increased security issues in the digital currency industry. Loopscale revealed on April 28 that the attackers involved in a recent $5.8 million heist committed to returning the majority of the stolen money in return for a reward payment. As reported in posts posted on X (formerly Twitter), Loopscale was able to negotiate successfully with the attacker who had compromised their system on April 26. This amounts to around 3,947 SOL (Solana tokens) for the attacker, and 35,527 SOL returns to Loopscale. At 3:52PM ET today, we received a response from the exploiter. They have indicated a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty. We appreciate their engagement so far and we are actively working to reach an amicable resolution. Reports indicate the hack was not a straightforward break-in but rather sophisticated manipulation of Loopscale's pricing mechanism. The attacker manipulated the RateX PT token pricing mechanism, enabling them to withdraw around $5.7 million in USD Coin and 1,200 Solana tokens from platform vaults. Upon finding the breach, Loopscale immediately suspended all withdrawals on their vaults and halted trading on their markets. The firm clarified that only users who had deposited funds in their USDC and SOL vaults were impacted by the attack, not the overall RateX collateral system. How safe is actually all this defi? We are chasing yield, but hack-adjusted is it actually better than just holding bonds? Tim Haldorsson, founder of Lunar Strategy, voiced serious concerns about whether potential returns in decentralized finance justify the mounting security risks investors face. Security insiders say that more than $1.6 billion was stolen as a result of crypto hacks between the first three months of 2025, the worst quarterly period for security breaches in history. The trend is that as the value and usage of cryptocurrency grow, platforms have more difficulty protecting user funds from increasingly sophisticated attacks. For some firms, direct negotiation with hackers has become a pragmatic, if contentious, way to recover stolen assets when conventional law enforcement approaches might be too slow or ineffectual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nuvve Launches New Subsidiary to Capitalize on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Opportunities The new entity, Nuvve-DigitalAssets, will build a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio designed to generate long-term growth and maximize shareholder value. As part of this initiative, Nuvve has announced an initial participation in Bitcoin through ETF based on cash surplus and is now actively pursuing additional opportunities in cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms, and fintech mergers and acquisitions. It is an unstoppable force, and we will not sit on the sidelines while the next financial revolution unfolds,” said Gregory Poilasne, cofounder and CEO of Nuvve. Anchoring our portfolio with Bitcoin gives us a solid foundation, but we're moving beyond that, investing opportunistically into a new wave of digital assets with massive upside potential that represent the future of global financial markets. The Company's crypto portfolio strategy will be anchored with at least a 50% allocation to Bitcoin, while the remaining 50% will be allocated to other leading digital assets such as Ethereum, Solana, Aave, Chainlink, Avalanche, and other select cryptocurrencies. Future holdings and updates will be made publicly available for transparency. Nuvve's Board of Directors and management team unanimously approved the move, aligning with the company's evolving growth strategy to embrace emerging digital financial assets and blockchain innovation. Nuvve Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: NVVE) is a global leader accelerating the electrification of transportation through its proprietary vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology. Nuvve's platform enables electric vehicles to store and discharge energy, transforming EVs into mobile energy resources and helping to stabilize the grid. Nuvve's mission is to lower the cost of EV ownership while supporting the transition to a cleaner, more resilient energy infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Imagine putting $1,000 into something today, and in a few years, it's grown so much that you never have to work for money again. That's the dream many people had when they bought Bitcoin early. Solana has made a name for itself by doing one thing incredibly well — speed. With the ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, it leaves most other blockchains in the dust. But here's the problem: fast doesn't always mean strong. And that's where many users begin to worry. You can't build wealth on a platform that breaks under pressure. Solana is great, but it's not complete on its own. This structure allows BTC-S to stay safe while moving quickly — something very few coins have achieved. Not everyone has thousands of dollars to buy mining equipment. This opens the door for everyday people to earn BTC-S, grow their assets, and become part of a rising financial system. Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is in its presale phase, offering a chance for early buyers to enter before the token becomes widely available. Phase One Has Begun—Secure BTC-S at the Starting Line A $1,000 investment doesn't usually change your life—unless it's timed right and placed in something with real potential. Now, Bitcoin Solaris might be that next rare opportunity. By combining Solana's ultra-fast speed with the scarcity and security of Bitcoin, BTC-S is giving crypto investors a platform that doesn't cut corners. Whether you're new to crypto or looking for the next breakthrough, this is your chance to act early, think long-term, and maybe turn that $1,000 into something life-changing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's potential 100x gas limit growth over four years prompts calls for a cautious implementation approach. On April 27, Feist submitted Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698, suggesting that Ethereum's gas limit should grow 100 times over the next four years through automated client-side settings. “The current gas limit mechanism relies on miner/operator voting, which lacks coordination and predictability. While flexible, this approach can lead to stagnation or overly cautious increases. Ethereum community member Fabda.eth explained that Feist's plan would result in a 100-fold increase that would push the network's capacity to around 3.6 billion gas, supporting approximately 2,000 transactions per second and 6,000 transactions per block. This would significantly increase the network's current gas limit of approximately 36 million. Notably, Feist's proposal aligns a similar suggestion by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In February, Buterin advocated for a tenfold gas limit increase, arguing that it would support transaction inclusion and application development on the base layer, despite growing reliance on Layer 2 solutions. While many within the community see potential benefits of expanding the blockchain network's gas limit, several developers voiced caution about Feist's proposal aggressive growth pace. Lukasz Rozmej, an Ethereum core developer, cautioned that any expansion should either be manually agreed upon or kept gradual to avoid unexpected network strain. He warned that targeting a 100x increase within four years could prove too aggressive. “Let's do this in steps before we have the majority of the nodes committed to this 100x increase in 4 years schedule and we will have a problem when we find out the limit is getting too high (then we thus need to coordinate with all nodes to opt-out and shut it down again).” He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Follow us on X for your essential dose of daily crypto news and deep dives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance's chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell's relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales' (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In addition to digital anonymity, decentralization, and borderless transactions, cybercriminals are taking advantage of many juicy opportunities to scam people out of their hard-earned money. Scammers now have prime opportunities to launder funds through mixers, split assets across multiple wallets, and even exploit exchanges with weak Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. As crypto fraud becomes more common, investigative firms like CNC Intelligence confront fraudsters with advanced technology, law enforcement partnerships, and deep cyber intelligence. Every year, billions are lost to crypto fraud as criminals continuously refine their methods. Whether it's rug pulls, phishing schemes, or fake investment platforms, these scams are getting increasingly sophisticated, making justice a hard-won outcome. So, how do these scammers get away with crypto fraud? Sketchy online grifters can also utilize privacy coins like Monera, which are nearly untraceable. Of course, several criminals also exploit lax regulations in certain jurisdictions with limited KYC enforcement. This allows scammers to cash out anonymously and disappear just as quickly. Just because stopping crypto scammers is challenging doesn't mean it's impossible. CNC Intelligence doesn't take these threats lightly, employing the most sophisticated cyber and crypto investigation solutions. These solutions offer blockchain analysis, darknet intelligence, and AI-driven fraud detection to hit the criminals with everything they've got. CNC Intelligence is about more than algorithms and digital forensics, which sets it apart from the competition. The firm employs a team of certified cryptocurrency investigators™ who are well-versed in digital asset tracking. The team's investigative work, including successful recovery efforts in high-profile cases, speaks for itself. Their work helps individuals and businesses pursue legal action to recoup stolen crypto. With a unique combination of AI-powered analytics and good old-fashioned detective work, CNC Intelligence is unveiling the digital masks worn by scammers—goodbye anonymity and hello accountability. Luckily, CNC Intelligence works with agencies across multiple jurisdictions to offer law enforcement assistance services that strengthen international investigations into crypto crime. Given the amount of red tape civilians will likely contend with, that's certainly a weight off their shoulders. Of course, given their rampant nature, most government agencies don't have the resources to pursue every crypto fraud case and track complex blockchain transactions. That's why firms like CNC Intelligence must stay on top of these shifts and use developing tech to fight the good fight to protect investors and businesses. It takes the right technology, intelligence, and global partnership cocktail to crack down on crypto crime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's largest sportswear brand, Nike, was sued on Friday with a $5 million proposed class action, accusing the company of abandoning NFT investors by abruptly shutting down its RTFKT subsidiary and abandoning its sneaker-themed digital assets. In a lawsuit filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs allege that Nike used its iconic brand to hype digital collectibles tied to its digital fashion and technology company RTFKT, then executed a "soft rug pull," leaving investors with devalued and illiquid NFTs. The complaint also accuses Nike of promoting unregistered securities in violation of U.S. law, enticing buyers with “marketing prowess” to “hype, promote, and prop up” sneaker-themed NFTs, only to withdraw support once profits were made. The lawsuit comes as regulators reconsider how NFTs should be treated under U.S. securities laws. Just last month, SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce suggested that certain NFT projects could soon be formally exempted from securities classification. In December 2024, RTFKT abruptly announced via social media that it was “winding down” operations, sending secondary market prices for Nike NFTs plunging, prices that have yet to recover. Even if the NFTs are not considered securities, the lawsuit alleges, Nike's "deceptive acts”-building an ecosystem of rewards to boost NFT demand and then pulling support - violated consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon. They also claim “unjust enrichment,” noting how Nike profited from primary and secondary NFT sales while leaving retail investors to bear the losses. Meanwhile, last week, RTFKT's NFTs, including its flagship Clone X collection co-created with artist Takashi Murakami, briefly disappeared from display due to a Cloudflare hosting issue. Images stored off-chain were replaced by a black screen displaying “This content has been restricted” after Cloudflare prematurely downgraded RTFKT's account to a free tier, according to RTFKT's head of technology, Samuel Cardillo.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get quality reporting directly into your inbox, every week By submitting your email address you agree to OCCRP's Privacy Policy Once a darling of Lithuania's cryptocurrency scene, the Bankera digital coin raised tens of millions but has since collapsed in value. The project's co-founders bought a portfolio of luxury real estate using loans from a bank they owned apparently backed by funds from the crypto coin sales. In early 2018, near the tail end of a major cryptocurrency boom, a Lithuanian start-up called Bankera announced that it had managed to raise over 100 million euros in just six months by selling its own digital coin. The company said the funds would be used to fashion a “bank for the blockchain era” — a fully fledged retail and investment institution, holding and exchanging most cryptocurrencies and competing with existing banks “as an equal.” More than 100,000 people had bought tokens in an “initial coin offering,” or ICO — a type of cryptocurrency fundraiser — and had started receiving weekly payments drawn from a share of the fees generated when others bought and sold the coin. But seven years after the ICO, the token has collapsed in value, leaving many investors disappointed, and the Bankera project still hasn't achieved one of its self-proclaimed core objectives: acquiring a European Union banking license. Reporters found evidence that a portion of the funds raised in the ICO appears to have been funneled into a sprawling real estate portfolio — including a villa on the French Riviera and high-end property in Lithuania — via a bank thousands of miles away in the Pacific nation of Vanuatu. Leaked company records and bank statements show the funds were used to underwrite loans to other companies owned by the same three men, which then purchased high-end real estate. Millions more, also backed by ICO funds, were loaned directly to the three co-founders themselves, often labeled as “personal use.” “To extract funds and seemingly use them to finance personal spending raises suspicions that investors have been misled and [the co-founders] have profited personally,” she said. “Fundamentally this seems to be about misrepresentation of what the [ICO] funds were going to be used for, which raises the question of whether this was a fraud.” Lawyers for PPB declined to comment on the transactions revealed in the leaked banking materials, citing Vanuatu's banking secrecy law. PPB's managing director, Eimantas Kazlauskas, said the bank complied with all Vanuatu banking laws and regulations. And PPB's resident director, Martin St. Hilaire, said: “The goal of acquiring Pacific Private Bank by Bankera was to transform it into a modern digital bank for the blockchain era, which is being successfully done one step at a time.” The Central Bank of Lithuania told OCCRP it had contacted law enforcement regarding the Bankera ICO, but said it could not “disclose any details” due to legal restrictions. Mockevičius' father is a civil judge and his mother worked in school administration. A fourth man, Ugnius Šimelionis, was a co-founder of multiple “Bankera ecosystem” companies, but sold his stakes in them to Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius in October 2017, shortly before the launch of the ICO. Šimelionis told OCCRP he sold his shares because his and the other founders' “long-term visions for the company's direction didn't fully align,” and said he had no involvement in the ICO or any other Bankera activities since. By the time of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius had already established multiple digital financial service companies serving hundreds of thousands of customers, according to a white paper published by Bankera in 2017. These included three companies that would play key roles in the Bankera ICO: Pervesk UAB and Spectro Finance UAB, both registered in Lithuania, and Finalify Ltd., which was registered in the British Virgin Islands. Finalify issued the BNK tokens, and Spectro Finance operated the “virtual currency exchange” — an online platform to trade digital currencies — where people could buy Bankera's tokens using either traditional “fiat” currency or other cryptocurrencies. Potential investors had to set up a wallet for their tokens with SpectroCoin, owned by Spectro Finance, and they sent payments for BNK to an account at Pervesk, according to payment documents from multiple investors seen by reporters. Pervesk is an “electronic money institution” — a company licensed to issue electronic money and process digital payments — which Spectro Finance used to handle proceeds from the ICO. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB told OCCRP it was incorrect to characterize the “ICO as being akin to the raising of equity.”) Token holders would be entitled to discounted rates for Bankera services and products. Each week, Bankera would collect fees on transactions — and then, after deducting costs, it would put aside 20 percent of the remaining amount and distribute it to BNK holders in proportion to the share of the tokens they held. Bankera's resume was bolstered by the backing of prominent political and business figures. Antanas Guoga – Former member of European Parliament (2014–2019), businessman, and well-known poker player. Modestas Kaseliauskas – Former director of Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate (2005-2014). He said he did not take part in the “implementation stage” of the Bankera project and so could not comment on it. Pre-sales of the currency appeared to be a hit. On August 28, 2017, Bankera tweeted: “Please lower your orders so everyone could get some tokens!” The following month, the company announced that it had reached its initial target of 25 million euros nine days ahead of schedule. Andreas Horb, a German financial advisor, told OCCRP that the prospect of weekly payouts was a “key selling point” and helped convince him to buy about 2,000 euros worth of BNK. As BNK's value collapsed, so did the payments to coin-holders. “Things started to change in 2018, a few months after the ICO launched,” Horb said. As weekly earnings from the revenue sharing scheme dropped, Horb said he and his friends tried to contact Bankera's founders and managers: “We had regular conversations with them at first, but eventually they stopped responding after a wave of investor complaints.” But, he added, “it quickly became clear that the token had lost all its value when they stopped paying the weekly returns.” “Investing in cryptocurrency at that time was like buying magic beans,” said Ray Blake, a financial crime expert and director of the Dark Money Files. In January 2018, in the middle of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were also buying a bricks and mortar bank half a world away. Pacific Private Bank Ltd., known as PPB, is a boutique financial institution in Vanuatu, a Pacific nation inhabited by around 300,000 people that has been criticized for facilitating international tax avoidance and providing “golden passports” to people with questionable backgrounds. On its website, PPB describes its mission as serving “wealthy, private clients from around the world” with a focus on wealth and asset management and offering “tailored investment solutions.” “We accommodate to [sic] the individual objectives of every customer by providing personalized private banking services.” The month after the trio bought PPB, millions of euros started moving from Spectro Finance's account at Pervesk — where BNK purchasers had sent their payments for tokens — into an account also held by Spectro Finance at PPB, leaked records from the Vanuatu bank show. The leaked bank records give no purpose for the transfers, which are listed only as “transfer between own accounts.” An additional 15 million euros were sent in other transfers between August 2020 and September 2021. Lawyers for Bankera UAB said it was “not disputed that funds were moved into accounts with Pacific Private Bank,” but added that there is no “obligation to publicly set out the use of all the funds raised by the ICO.” In November 2019, 25 million euros were sent from Spectro Finance's PPB account to another PPB account held by Finalify, the British Virgin Islands company that issued the Bankera tokens. In April 2021, the same Spectro Finance account also transferred 20 million euros to a PPB account held by Spectro Finance Systems Ltd., another firm registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2019 by Mockevičius, one of Bankera's founders. All three PPB accounts — Spectro Finance's, Finalify's, and Spectro Finance Systems' — pledged funds to back loans by PPB to Bankera's three young co-founders or their companies. Before the acquisition of PPB was announced, Bankera built up an air of suspense by promising “a very big announcement” was on the way. On October 10, 2019, Spectro Finance's PPB account was debited 1.7 million euros for “B2B purposes,” a leaked bank statement shows. The same day, PPB disbursed a loan for an identical amount to a Monaco-based company called Azur Estates (SCI), registered by two of Bankera's founders, Karalevičius and Mockevičius, the previous August. Less than two weeks later, on October 22, Azur sent the 1.7 million euros to an account it held in Lithuania. Then, six days after that, the company bought a four-bedroom villa in Èze, a seaside village between Monaco and Nice, for 1.1 million euros. Azur paid for the house in full using corporate funds, according to French property records seen by OCCRP. (It is not clear whether other loans were eventually fully paid back.) Experts said the use of such “back-to-back” loans offered potential advantages, by creating paperwork to support property purchases and helping to keep the bank's books balanced. “The bank that is receiving funds for the French property would want to check the source of funds,” said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a Florida company specializing in compliance and financial crime litigation. “If you have a pledge from a company that appears to be a separate entity, and has money in its account, then it doesn't then appear to be simply taking money out of the bank,” said RUSI's Westmore. “The opaque way these transactions were structured also raises questions about [their] legitimacy.” A bird's-eye view of the four-bedroom villa in Èze, France.

Reporters sent detailed questions to Finalify, Spectro Finance, and Mockevičius, who is named as the representative for Azur, but did not receive any responses. Lawyers for Azur did not respond to questions by the time this article was published. Azur took another three loans from PPB amounting to 800,000 euros between August 2021 and July 2022, leaked statements show. But for the third loan, he signed on behalf of Finalify while acting as a director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., which bought Finalify in March 2020. In 2023, Kazlauskas also signed a term deposit and a pledge agreement with himself to guarantee a loan of 100,000 euros to Mockevičius — the documents show his signature on both sides, as PPB's managing director as well as the director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd, which represented Finalify. Contacted by OCCRP, Kazlauskas said he lives in one of the three houses at Villa 25 and is "able to fix and or replace items if needed to maintain the value of the property," but did not comment on specific transactions. On December 15, 2020, for instance, Finalify's PPB account was debited for 360,000 euros in relation to a pledge agreement, according to the bank statement. Two days later, Mockevičius transferred 329,604 euros to yet another PPB account, this one held by a Liechtenstein-registered foundation, Eternity Ventures Foundation, which company documents show was set up by two of Bankera's co-founders and whose 2020 bylaws named family members of each of Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius as beneficiaries. On December 18, Eternity paid the exact amount to buy a plot of land in the Old Town of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. Another 300,000 euros were debited from Finalify's account on November 10, 2021, for a pledge agreement. Two days later, Eternity paid out just under 290,000 euros for more real estate in Lithuania. Including those transactions and others, Eternity received a total of just under 1.8 million euros from Mockevičius and Dobiliauskas between the summer of 2019 and the end of 2021, according to Eternity's leaked PPB bank statements. Over the same period, it bought a total of five properties in Lithuania for more than 1.3 million euros. In mid-2018, shortly after the end of the ICO, a Vanuatu-based company called Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., then owned by PPB, bought another local company — called Beachfront Properties — which in turn owned Villa 25, a luxury resort in a secluded seaside district just outside the capital, Port Vila, according to registry documents from the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission. The villa, which boasts a private pool and beach, promises “barefoot luxury by the sea,” and can be rented for up to 125,000 Vanuatu vatu (about $1,000) a night during peak season. Lawyers for Bankera UAB declined to comment on the transactions involving Eternity. They said the Vanuatu villa “is owned by Pacific Private Bank, and has historically been let out to guests and used by/for staff (including management). We understand that it is currently being used as an office due to damage caused elsewhere by the Port Vila earthquake. Between May 2019 and May 2023, PPB also loaned Mockevičius a total of 5.4 million euros and Dobiliauskas 3 million euros — 4.2 million euros of which were explicitly listed as being “for personal use,” leaked bank statements show. Karalevičius was loaned 5.2 million euros, which the statements say are for “investment.” These amounts were almost all guaranteed by Finalify, Spectro Finance Systems, or Spectro Finance. In 2021, a dispute with Lithuanian tax authorities revealed that Mockevičius earned millions from the Bankera ICO before it had even begun. In August 2017, Mockevičius signed a contract with Finalify Ltd. — which he himself represented as director — to provide “advertising and marketing services” for the Bankera ICO, according to a decision by Lithuania's Supreme Administrative Court. He was paid 750 Bitcoins, worth more than 2.5 million euros at the time. When Mockevičius sold the Bitcoins, in late 2017, they were worth 6 million euros. The tax authorities ruled that Mockevičius had misclassified the income and fined him over 32,000 euros for underpaying personal income taxes. The three Bankera co-founders did not respond to reporters' requests for comment. But Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate confirmed the fines had been paid. As for Bankera itself, the website remains active, and purports to provide “a modern bank account alternative for individuals and businesses,” though it has yet to receive an EU banking license. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB said ICO proceeds were used to secure an “electronic money institution license within the EU” for Pervesk, the e-money company involved in the Bankera ICO which lawyers described as “a Bankera ecosystem company.”) And Spectro Finance's virtual currency exchange, which claimed to serve 300,000 customers at the time of the ICO, now says it helps more than one million users “buy, sell and exchange popular cryptocurrencies.” In 2018, Lithuania's central bank fined Pervesk 700,000 euros for violations of Lithuanian banking laws.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple (XRP) price also rallied 8.3% and closed above its key resistance level last week, indicating an uptrend ahead. Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and declined slightly over the next two days. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $93,500. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 65 after being rejected around its overbought level of 70 on Saturday, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Bitcoin's price could experience a sharp decline. However, if BTC continues its upward momentum and closes above $95,000, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000. Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on Tuesday and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. If ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Ethereum's price could experience a sharp decline. Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000. XRP price continued to trade above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average at $1.98 last week, rallied over 8%, and closed above the daily resistance level at $2.23 on Sunday. Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions. Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

XRP climbs over 3% on Monday, hovering around $2.33 at the time of writing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. Bitcoin continues to assert its leadership across the digital asset market, with Bitcoin Dominance climbing to a new local high of 64% as of April 22. This metric, which tracks Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap, highlights a clear and growing shift in capital toward BTC as the asset rallies past $90,000, currently trading at $92,700. With Bitcoin now just 18% off its all-time highs, the asset's performance becomes even more impressive when stacked against traditional markets. This comparison reinforces Bitcoin's relative strength and increasing appeal as a macro asset—especially in a market where liquidity remains tight and investors are gravitating toward quality. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? This resurgence in BTC dominance comes at a time when ETF inflows are once again picking up steam, fueling renewed institutional interest. The regulatory landscape, while still evolving, appears to be stabilizing in Bitcoin's favor, especially when compared to the murky and often unpredictable regulatory path facing many altcoins. Outside of isolated daily pumps, most of the altcoin market remains in a downtrend or in accumulation phases far from previous highs. Many lack the institutional interest, product-market fit, or meaningful on-chain activity to justify significant upside in the current environment. That said, some names did show strength. Despite the bounce, it remains more than 100% away from its all-time high, reminding investors how deep the bear market drawdowns have been for many newer Layer 1s and speculative projects. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. This growing disparity underscores more than just price action—it highlights a changing narrative. Bitcoin is being recognized not only as a risk asset but increasingly as a long-term store of value, particularly in uncertain times. The rise in BTC dominance is a reflection of capital rotating into perceived safety, and away from speculative ventures with shaky fundamentals. But it does show how hard it is to consistently “beat the market” when Bitcoin is the market. As BTC.D continues to climb, it sends a clear and resounding message: in crypto, strength leads. And right now, Bitcoin is doing just that. Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?
