                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev has long thrived at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he has earned two of his seven ATP Masters 1000 titles. ATPTour.com caught up with Zverev to learn how it all adds up for the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion. 2 played in the PIF ATP Rankings discussed his favourite Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalries, why Madrid is his favourite tournament to play, which player knows him best and more. What is your favourite tournament to play and why? The most special tournament is to play the [Nitto ATP] Finals, because you know that you qualify for it as one of the best eight players in the world, so that's very special always. But my favourite tournament to play is probably in Madrid. What is your favourite tennis rivalry? All time, I like the Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi rivalry. Obviously loved the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic rivalry, those three all together. I don't necessarily think we played the biggest matches [with] each other in our careers, not the most important matches. I think the most important matches in my career [I] have played against Novak, Carlos, Jannik. But me and Medvedev, we played the most against each other. Is it almost weird when you know somebody so well and know what they're going to do? And it's funny, when we play each other, he knows where I'm going to serve. I know where he's going to hit his forehand. So, it's basically like ping pong tennis, in a way, sometimes. But it's different when you're playing someone for the first time, you're trying to get a feel for each other. When you're playing somebody for 15 years, you kind of know every single shot they're going to do. What has a unique moment of your career been? Just a moment that stands out when you think about your career. First ATP title, I will always remember in St. Petersburg, it was against Stan. He [had] just won the US Open a few weeks before that. It's difficult to pick, but I think the most special one so far is Tokyo. What is the biggest thing you've been chasing? That's the most obvious answer for me right now. I would love to stop chasing, get one rather sooner than later. It is just the way my path has been. Been in a few finals already, lost some tough battles. Is there anything you've gotten to do because you're a tennis player that's been a super cool thing off the court? I think if you're a top tennis player, top athlete in general, we do get maybe a few more privileges than someone else. We get invited to some courtsides at games. So those things, they're special and I know that I only get them through tennis. ¬© Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚ÄúIt was 15-40 on my serve,‚Äù Andreeva later told reporters. ‚ÄúI was like, `Oh, Mirra, please -- please -- do everything in your power to take this game and finish the match. Coco Gauff had already closed out Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-2 and was in the midst of her on-court interview when the microphone died. Security quickly ushered her back to the players' lounge. ‚ÄúI thought it was just us and then I realized it was the whole country -- that's just insane.‚Äù They will play each other later in the week. ‚ÄúLast time I faced her on clay was Roland Garros 2023,‚Äù Andreeva said. But it was two years ago, so I'm just super excited to not take revenge but to see how different I play. I think it's going to be an entertaining match.‚Äù Said Gauff, ‚ÄúI was literally thinking the same thing. Most of the time we're trying to prepare for our matches, everyone's zoned in and we all understand that, I was talking to Frances [Tiafoe], talking to Mirra, too, Diana [Shnaider], Maddy [Keys]. ‚ÄúThis is the type of situation, it's light-hearted, nobody knows when they're going to go on.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is my first blackout,‚Äù said Andreeva, who was happy to have a book and some Uno cards to pass the time. ‚ÄúIt's actually kind of exciting because I've never experienced anything like this. ‚ÄúBut I don't want to spend the night here and sleep in the gym, but we're going to see what they tell us and just go from there.‚Äù Grigor Dimitrov was serving for the match in Manolo Santana Stadium against qualifier Jacob Fearnley when play was suspended. ‚ÄúI feel like at this point this is only a situation you can laugh at if I was on court. Because it's probably not going to happen ever again and we'll always remember the day the power went out at Madrid Open.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I'm glad that request didn't go through,‚Äù she said, laughing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz received flak from his agent, Albert Molina, and psychotherapist Juanjo Moreno for taking a trip to Ibiza midway through last season. Alcaraz felt the need for a little breather after a heartbreaking loss to Novak Djokovic in the French Open 2024 semi-final. Subsequently, he went to Ibiza, a well-renowned place for partying and nightlife. Also Read | Controversy erupts in Madrid Open as Alexander Zverev gets booed by fans after his recent victory On the occasion of the release of "Carlos Alcaraz: My Way", a Netflix docuseries of the tennis sensation, his agent revealed what he suggested to his client back then. "I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had a tournament at Queen's the following week and Wimbledon after that," Albert Molina told Netflix. "I remember looking at Carlos and saying, 'Carlos, now's not the time. You're being selfish in the present with your future self.' And coming from Ibiza, he hadn't had enough time to prepare for Queen's to really guarantee a win," Juanjo Moreno said while echoing Molina's complaint. And at Roland Garros, I lost to Djokovic in the semifinals. And I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends," Carlos Alcaraz said in his Netflix docuseries. And I believe if things are going well, you have to keep at it. I had to do it again this year." Carlos Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles till now, which is a towering feat at 21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stretching several ATP and WTA tournaments across a fortnight has caused some controversy - and it's debatable how successful the move has been. According to ATP and WTA bosses, that meant increased financial opportunities for more players. Another benefit would be players having days off between matches, allowing for better recovery and, in theory, more high-quality matches. Fans, in turn, would be more engaged and media coverage would increase, creating a buzz around them like the existing four majors. For many, it has not panned out like that. In Madrid, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek both responded positively when asked what they preferred. Others further down the chain have voiced concerns. The recent lawsuit lodged by the Professional Tennis Players' Association - which claimed to be on "behalf of the entire player population" - said that "instead of providing professional tennis players more rest between tournaments to endure a longer season, the ATP and WTA have given them less". It was also telling that Novak Djokovic, who co-founded the PTPA, gave a lengthy answer about the subject in his pre-Madrid news conference. The first week of the combined Madrid Open - a mixture of qualifying and main-draw matches -  felt like a slow burner. For many of those further afar, the disjointed scheduling can seem illogical and difficult to follow. Emma Raducanu again had Mark Petchey in her coaching box at the Madrid Open. Will Carlos Alcaraz be fit enough to defend his French Open men's singles title? The injured Spaniard hopes so, but is unsure whether he will be able to play beforehand after pulling out of Madrid. The 37-year-old says losing his opening match of a tournament for the second time in a row is his "new reality". Attention will also increase over the coming days on another big story - Jannik Sinner's comeback. Sinner, the men's world number one, is set to make his return from a three-month doping ban at next week's Italian Open. Cameron Norrie has found a timely return to form after winning his first ATP main-draw matches since Indian Wells, while Jacob Fearnley - playing only his second tour-level clay-court event - came through qualifying. Francesca Jones fought through qualifying to reach the first round where - playing for the third straight day - she lost a tight battle to 2024 Australian Open semi-finalist Dayana Yastremska. Boulter, playing alongside Daria Kasatkina, lost in the doubles first round, as did Olivia Nicholls with partner Tereza Mihalikova. With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Casper Ruud is being tipped to win the French Open this year, but he is first eyeing success at the Madrid Open this week. Carlos Alcaraz is capable of shining on clay in the absence of Rafael Nadal, although worryingly he was forced to withdraw from Madrid due to injury. Nadal once dominated the clay courts, having won a record 14 French Open titles, with Alcaraz now aiming to take over from his idol. Novak Djokovic meanwhile is still chasing an elusive 25th Grand Slam title on the ATP Tour, but his current form means that is unlikely to arrive at Roland Garros. Djokovic suffered another early exit in his latest tournament in Madrid, with his struggles certainly suggesting that the changing of the guard is very much underway. His fellow legends Nadal and Roger Federer have already retired, while the likes of young stars Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been enjoying huge success in recent seasons.

But it seems that fans must now accept that the past is the past and the new generation have officially arrived, without even mentioning future superstars Joao Fonseca, Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien and Alex Michelsen among others.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton took out a chunk of the electronic advertising board at the Madrid Open during his clash with Jakub Mensik. Play was momentarily stopped as it emerged that the small individual panel that Shelton hit had been damaged, displaying a black screen rather than the advertisement. Play soon resumed but Shelton, the world No. 13, had little joy and succumbed to defeat against Mensik. The Czech teenager is enjoying a breakthrough campaign, having beaten Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open final last month. He was able to continue, improving his form in the second, but ultimately could not compete with another heavy-hitting server in Mensik. ‚ÄúI know Ben can serve much better, but in this high altitude, it's always tough to break him. ‚ÄúI knew that he was not feeling very well, me neither. But I still tried to reach my best level and that was the key. Mensik dropped just two of 28 points behind his first delivery and will next face Alexander Bublik in the last 16. While Shelton should be sticking around in the Spanish capital as he is due to play doubles with Rohan Bopanna. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Mensik is on an eight-match winning run at ATP Masters 1000s, having claimed his first title on tour in Miami. He could crack the top 20 this week with a positive run and will be buoyed by his 67-minute win over Shelton, improving to 6-1 against top 20 players this year. I'm trying to improve myself every week, the journey is still long and my goals are even further.‚Äù Monday, 28th April 2025See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former world number one Andre Agassi is set to make his professional debut in the booming world of pickleball next week, teaming up with top-ranked star Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles event at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships. Pickleball is an exciting paddle sport cum tennis-badminton fusion created in the year 1965 by a group of Americans. Played on smaller courts, using a perforated plastic ball, it has rapidly gained popularity across America and beyond. Anna Leigh Waters, who was projected to earn over $3 million last year as a professional pickleball player, found herself in need of a mixed doubles partner for this year's U.S. Open, which kicks off Saturday in Naples, Florida. She added, ‚ÄúI thought if we partnered together, this would be a really awesome way to grow the sport." Despite his legendary tennis credentials ‚Äî eight Grand Slam titles and 60 ATP Tour victories ‚Äî Agassi joked about his new role alongside Waters. ‚ÄúShe's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play," Agassi quipped during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. While fans may be excited to see Agassi in pickleball, the 54-year-old clarified that he doesn't intend to pursue a professional pickleball career beyond this event. ‚ÄúIf I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. I'm in a different season now," Agassi said, acknowledging that his life priorities have shifted.</p>
