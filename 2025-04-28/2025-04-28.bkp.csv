            Chinese leader Xi Jinping has not spoken to US President Donald Trump on the phone recently, Beijing said Monday, reiterating that no talks are taking place between the two countries to resolve their tariff war.
    


            The statement from a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson is an outright rejection of Trump's claim in an interview with Time magazine last week that Xi had called him, as the world's two largest economies remain locked in a dispute over sky-high trade levies.
    


            “As far as I know, there has been no recent phone call between the two heads of state,” Guo Jiakun told a regular news conference. “I want to reiterate that China and the United States are not engaged in consultations or negotiations on the tariff issue.”
    


            China has maintained its tough public stance on the trade war even as Trump softened his tone last week, saying that astronomical US tariffs on Chinese goods will “come down substantially” and promising to be “very nice” at the negotiating table as he attempts to get Xi to initiate talks.
    


            “He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf,” Trump said, referring to Xi, in the Time interview published on Friday.
    


            Trump, who has repeatedly referred to Xi as a “friend,” did not offer specifics in the Time interview on the content of the purported call with the Chinese leader or when it took place – nor did he elaborate when pressed by CNN on Friday.
    


            “I don't want to comment on that, but I've spoken to him many times,” Trump said in response to CNN's Alayna Treene when leaving the South Lawn at the White House.
    


            According to publicly available records, the last time the two leaders spoke by phone was on January 17, days before Trump's inauguration for his second term.
    


            Since last week, Trump has repeatedly said that his administration is talking with Chinese officials to strike a trade deal – only to be met with flat denials from Beijing each time.
    


            On Friday, hours before Trump's interview with Time was published, China's Foreign Ministry urged the US not to “mislead the public” on trade negotiations between the two sides.
    


            Trump's apparent willingness to deescalate the trade war has been brushed off by Beijing, which has instead demanded the US remove all tariffs on China.
    


            Since returning to the White House, Trump has imposed levies of 145% on Chinese goods, though he exempted imports of electronics such as smartphones and computers from his so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.
    


            China has raised tariffs on US imports to 125%, but it has also quietly rolled back the levies on some semiconductors made in the United States, according to import agencies, as Beijing tries to soften the blow of the trade war on its all-important tech industry.

            Yemen's Houthi rebels on Monday alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others. The US military had no immediate comment.
    


            The strike in Yemen's Saada governorate, a stronghold for the Houthis, is the latest incident in the country's decadelong war to kill African migrants from Ethiopia and other nations who risk crossing the nation for a chance to work in neighboring Saudi Arabia.
    


            It also likely will renew questions from activists about the American campaign, known as “Operation Rough Rider,” which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.
    


            The US military's Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. The strikes have drawn controversy in America over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.
    


            “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,” Central Command said. “We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we've done or what we will do.”
    


            It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press about the alleged strike in Saada.
    


            Graphic footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the site. The Houthi-run Interior Ministry said some 115 migrants had been detained at the site.
    


            The rebels' Civil Defense organization said at least 68 people had been killed and 47 others wounded in the attack.
    


            Footage from the site analyzed by the AP suggested some kind of explosion took place there, with its cement walls seemingly peppered by debris fragments and the wounds suffered by those there.
    


            A woman's voice, soft in the footage, can be heard repeating the start of a prayer in Arabic: “In the name of God.” An occasional gunshot rang out as medics sought to help those wounded.
    


            Ethiopians and other African migrants for years have landed in Yemen, braving the war-torn nation to try and reach Saudi Arabia for work. The Houthi rebels allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border.
    


            Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. An Oct. 3, 2022, letter to the kingdom from the U.N. said its investigators “received concerning allegations of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire allegedly by Saudi security forces, causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants.”
    


            Saudi Arabia has denied killing migrants.
    


            Monday's alleged strike recalled a similar strike by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis back in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a United Nations report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the U.N. said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the U.N. said it was known to be a detention facility.
    


            “The coalition should have avoided any attack on that facility,” the U.N. report added.
    


            That 2022 attack was one of the deadliest single attacks in the years long war between the coalition and the Houthi rebels and came after the Houthis struck inside the UAE twice with missiles and drones, killing three in a strike near Abu Dhabi's international airport.
    


            Meanwhile, US airstrikes overnight targeting Yemen's capital killed at least eight people, the Houthis said. The American military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in their monthlong campaign.
    


            The overnight statement from Central Command also said “Operation Rough Rider” had “killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,” including those associated with its missile and drone program. It did not identify any of those officials.
    


            “Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis,” the statement said. “The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime.”
    


            “We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,” it added.
    


            The US is targeting the Houthis because of the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are also the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.
    


            The US is conducting strikes on Yemen from its two aircraft carriers in the region — the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea.
    


            On April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port.

            “US strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel, which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,” it said.
    


            Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly sought to control the flow of information from the territory they hold to the outside world. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should “quickly hand over” the devices to authorities.
    


            “A field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,” the Houthis warned.
    


            Starlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.

British troops would help “rebuild” the Ukrainian armed forces under a potential deployment to the country following a ceasefire with Russia, UK Defense Secretary John Healey has said, according to The Telegraph.

The UK and France have led discussions in recent weeks among several European NATO member states about sending military personnel to Ukraine as part of a so-called “coalition of the willing,” once Kiev and Moscow have agreed a ceasefire. Russia has strongly objected to Western troops being deployed to Ukraine under any pretext.

In an article on Sunday, The Telegraph cited a letter reportedly sent last week by Healey to Shadow Defense Secretary James Cartlidge. In it, the British defense chief is said to have written that “we expect those objectives to focus on rebuilding a modern and capable armed forces of Ukraine, rather than delivering combat operations.”

According to the newspaper, Healey defined the potential British contingent's goal as helping Kiev “regenerate an armed forces capable of deterring future Russian aggression.” UK military personnel would likely be stationed in Western Ukraine, away from the front line, The Telegraph claimed.

In addition, the British Royal Air Force and Navy would reportedly be on standby to cover Ukraine's air space and territorial waters, if necessary.

The Telegraph cited Healey as claiming that the coalition's actions would be in line with US President Donald Trump's effort to establish a “just and lasting peace” between Ukraine and Russia.

Last Thursday, The Times, citing anonymous sources, reported that the UK had ditched plans to deploy a military contingent to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire as the “risks are too high and the forces inadequate” for such an undertaking.

The newspaper claimed that in a marked departure from the previous vision, involving coalition forces guarding key Ukrainian cities, ports, and nuclear power plants, the Western grouping now favored a training mission that would “‘reassure' by being there but aren't a deterrence or protection force.”

In an interview with TASS published last Thursday, Sergey Shoigu, secretary of Russia's National Security Council, warned that the presence of Western troops in Ukraine could lead to a direct confrontation between Moscow and NATO, potentially escalating into a third world war. Shoigu, who previously served as Russia's defense minister, emphasized that Moscow could use nuclear weapons “in the event of aggression,” conventional or otherwise.

Ukraine has criticized Russia's announcement of a three-day ceasefire in May timed to coincide with the celebration of the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazism.

Earlier on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a 72-hour ceasefire which will last from midnight on May 7-8 to midnight on May 10-11. It follows a similar unilateral pause during the Easter weekend.

“If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga responded on X. He claimed that the Russian move was not “real” but rather “just for a parade.”

“Ukraine is ready to support a lasting, durable, and full ceasefire. And this is what we are constantly proposing, for at least 30 days,” he added.

The Russian military previously observed a 30-day moratorium on strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure, which US President Donald Trump had proposed to Putin. According to Moscow, Kiev did not reciprocate despite publicly claiming support for the initiative.

The Easter ceasefire announced by Moscow was only partially successful, according to the Russian Defense Ministry, which said there was a decrease in the intensity of Ukrainian attacks but not a full lull. When Putin ordered the measure, he instructed Russian forces only to engage Ukrainian troops in retaliation.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has claimed that Russia's failure to meet his demand for an unconditional 30-day truce proves that it does not want peace. Putin has pointed out that Kiev could use such a pause for rearmament and reinforcement rather than to engage in serious negotiations.

Earlier on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted that direct talks between Moscow and Kiev currently remain impossible due to a legal ban on such engagements issued by Zelensky in 2022.

TOKYO, April 28. /TASS/. Kim Jong Un believes that North Korean forces' participation in the operation to liberate Russia's Kursk Region from Ukrainian troops was ""a sacred mission"" aimed at strengthening friendship with Moscow, the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea said in a statement.

""Kim Jong Un determined that the participation of our armed forces in the war was a sacred mission aimed at cementing the traditional friendship and solidarity between the two countries, guaranteeing the development and prosperity of both countries and protecting North Korea's honor,"" the statement reads, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Kim decided that the situation required the enactment of Article 4 of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between North Korea and Russia and ordered the forces of the Korean People's Army ""to defeat and eliminate Ukrainian neo-Nazi invaders and liberate certain areas of the Kursk Region in coordination with the Russian Armed Forces.""

According to the KCNA, Kim hails North Korean troops that took part in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region as heroes who fought for justice. He announced that a memorial to the North Korean soldiers who participated in the operation would soon be established in Pyongyang.

On April 26, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Army General Valery Gerasimov reported to President Vladimir Putin that the operation to liberate the Kursk Region from the Ukrainian forces that had invaded the region in August 2024 was over. Gerasimov particularly highlighted the role of North Korean soldiers.

Democratic governor of Illinois declares Republicans ‘cannot know a moment of peace' in New Hampshire speech

Illinois's Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, scorched Donald Trump's administration on Sunday night, calling for “mass protests” and declaring that Republicans “cannot know a moment of peace” during a fiery speech in New Hampshire that immediately sparked presidential speculation.

“It's time to fight everywhere and all at once,” Pritzker said to a ballroom filled with Democratic activists, officials and donors. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now.”

The billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune addressed more than 800 people at the New Hampshire Democratic party's annual McIntyre-Shaheen dinner – a state traditionally crucial to the early cycle of presidential primaries and a launching pad for anyone with White House ambitions.

“These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” Pritzker said. “They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have.”

Pritzker's appearance marked the first major foray by a potential 2028 presidential contender into an early primary state, though Pritzker insisted he remains focused on 2026 midterm elections.

Unlike some other Democratic governors who have adopted more piecemeal approaches toward Trump, Pritzker is now positioning himself as the standard-bearer for unflinching opposition, calling out both the president and fellow Democrats who advise moderation.

Many Democratic activists appear to align more with the Pritzker approach, as more than 1,000 protests across the US and Europe hit the streets at the beginning of the month specifically focused on calling out Trump. Protesters have been estimated to number in the tens of thousands in Washington alone.

Trump is now also sitting through cratering polls ahead of his 100 days in office benchmark tomorrow – the lowest approval rating for a new president in that time period over the last 80 years.

“Fellow Democrats, for far too long we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell us that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames are licking their faces,” he said. “We need to knock off the rust of poll-tested language, decades of stale decorum.”

The Illinois governor saved his sharpest attacks for Trump's cabinet, describing the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, as “a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car” and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as “a washed-up Fox TV commentator”.

“Stop thinking we can reason or negotiate with a madman,” Pritzker told the crowd, adding that Republicans enabling Trump should “feel in their bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American history” their portraits will be relegated “to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors”.

Pritzker's confrontational stance contrasts with potential rivals like the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, who have advocated for bipartisan collaboration with Trump while representing pivotal swing states. Whitmer was photographed in the White House earlier this month, at one point hiding her face from the cameras.

His speech also comes as Democrats nationwide search for new leadership after Kamala Harris's defeat in November, as it is still not clear if Harris will run again. Anne Caprara, Pritzker's longtime chief of staff, told the New York Times that his approach stems from family history – his ancestors fled pogroms in Ukraine.

“What we're seeing right now is 1930s Germany,” Caprara said. “The only way to actually stop that from happening is to be very loud and vocal about the pushback.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Section is responsible for enforcing laws designed to prevent voter discrimination, raised alarm about voting rights enforcement

Donald Trump's appointees at the Department of Justice have removed all of the senior civil servants working as managers in the department's voting section and directed attorneys to dismiss all active cases, according to people familiar with the matter, part of a broader attack on the department's civil rights division.

The moves come less than a month after Trump ally Harmeet Dhillon was confirmed to lead the civil rights division, created in 1957 and referred to as the “crown jewel” of the justice department. In an unusual move, Dhillon sent out new “mission statements” to the department's sections that made it clear the civil rights division was shifting its focus from protecting the civil rights of marginalized people to supporting Trump's priorities.

Tamar Hagler, the chief of the voting section, which is responsible for enforcing federal laws designed to prevent voter discrimination, and five top career managers were all reassigned last week to the complaint adjudication office, a little-known part of the department that handles employee complaints, according to people familiar with the matter. A career line attorney in the section has also been reassigned to the complaint adjudication office.

The voting section had seven managers in January overseeing around 30 attorneys. Of the two other managers, one retired and another was detailed to work on an antisemitism task force.

Political appointees have also instructed career employees to dismiss all of their active cases without meeting with them and offering a rationale – a significant break with the department's practices and norms.

The justice department did not return a request for comment.

Taken together, the changes have raised significant alarm about what the future of voting rights enforcement will look like for the federal government at a moment when states continue to pass restrictive voting measures.

It also raises concern about future political interference. The justice department's civil rights division has long had resources and a credibility that private plaintiffs can't match. And much of that reputation is driven by the fact that the day-to-day work is carried out by non-political, career staff, whose work is supposed to be apolitical.

“The career managers established norms and standards and made sure that the section spoke consistently, over time, with one voice,” said a former justice department employee. “That is destroyed by gutting all the career managers.”

The voting section dismissed its last active case on Monday – a challenge under the Voting Rights Act to how the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, elects its city council. In March, it also dismissed a similar case in Houston county, Georgia. (The department technically has one voting case that is still active, but a judge paused the case this week).

The changes are part of a larger wave of about a dozen reassignments of senior personnel in the civil rights division this week. Several other components of the division, including the special litigation section, have also been hit with significant losses in personnel. The moves came a week ahead of a 28 April deadline for employees to decide whether to accept a deferred resignation offer.

Reassigning the most experienced managers to low-level duties appears to be an overt push to crush morale, make it clear management is not going to bring civil rights enforcement cases, and get lawyers to accept the offer to leave the department, department veterans say. Many of the division's lawyers are expected to accept the offer.

“This is what you do when you don't really know what the section does and just want to create chaos in the simplest way possible that doesn't involve you reading anything,” said one former voting section attorney. “It is extremely clear that the intent is to get absolutely nothing done. And the effect will be that absolutely nothing gets done.”

Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his effort to try and overturn the 2020 election, has called for mass firings in the civil rights division. “Every lawyer in the Voting Section and likely in the Civil Rights Division needs to be terminated. They are not supportive of Pres Trump or MAGA. There has to be a reckoning. These are leftwing activists who have come from and should return to their leftwing organizations,” she wrote in a post on X shortly after the election.

The American Accountability Foundation, a dark money group that created a “DEI watch list” of federal employees, also sent a letter to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, last year urging her to fire certain lawyers in the voting section.

Removing the career managers is hugely consequential in the justice department. In addition to having decades of experience, they act as a buffer between the political attorneys in a section's front office and the apolitical career line attorneys. They review investigations and justification memos arguing for bringing cases or not, and present them to the political appointees.

They also handle hiring. While there's currently a hiring freeze, removing the career managers could pave the way for politicized hiring and a “partisan and ideological capture” of an agency that is supposed to be non-partisan, a former department employee said.

“Demolishing the line between career and political employees is very possible, because the people who run the hiring process are normally the career managers, but if you replace all the career managers and then have new political people they could staff up very differently,” the former department employee said.

Since the start of the Trump administration, the justice department has dismissed big cases challenging a sweeping voting law in Georgia and a major case challenging electoral districts drawn in Texas. It has also dismissed cases in Virginia and Alabama that sought to stop the states from being too aggressive in removing people from their voter rolls.

Before the Texas redistricting case was dismissed, there was a perfunctory meeting between political appointees and career staff in which political appointees had not bothered to read materials in advance, according to the former department employee. They have refused meetings to discuss dismissals since, the person said, and political appointees have not even bothered to learn the names of career attorneys.

“Even if you don't think that some claims should have been brought, it's not plausible that every case in the hopper is unmerited, by any interpretation of the rules,” said Justin Levitt, a former top official in the civil rights division during the Obama administration. “An instruction to drop a case without an explanation of why is just a decision to refuse to enforce the law.”

“Dropping those cases without explanation is simply arbitrary – and ‘arbitrary' is exactly what you don't want from the country's lead agency of law enforcement,” he added.

In some cases, justice department leadership has publicly antagonized the work of career personnel. On 31 March, Bondi issued a press release announcing she had ordered the department to dismiss its challenge to the Georgia voting law, saying the Biden administration had “fabricated a narrative”. Chad Mizelle, the department's chief of staff, called the suit a “disgrace”.

People familiar with the voting section emphasized that the administration's approach is significantly different from the way the section was run during the first Trump term. Even though the voting section's work slowed considerably during Trump's first term, and it switched positions in some major cases, there was a general respect and collegiality for the career employees. Eric Dreiband, who led the civil rights division from 2018 to 2021, resigned after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Using fitness and sports as entry points into neo-Nazi ideologies, ‘youth club' chapters are proliferating across US

A national network of American neofascist fight clubs is endorsing youth-oriented offshoots aimed at grooming the next generation of racist activists.

So-called “active clubs” have proliferated across the US and are a combination of fitness and mixed martial arts groups that often espouse neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies, openly taking their historical cues from the Third Reich's obsession with machismo and European soccer hooliganism.

Active clubs have emerged as perhaps the most dangerous form of far-right political organizing today. With links to other militant organizations, including Patriot Front, they encourage a seemingly mainstream version of masculinity, layered with ideologies promoting a US race war and using the popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as a gateway to recruiting.

Earlier this month, their main Telegram account, endorsed “youth clubs”, which are chapters beginning to spring up online across the country, showing pictures of 18-year-olds and under engaging in mixed martial arts, racist meme-ing, and posts referencing genocidal and bigoted literature.

“Youth clubs are for those under 18 that still want to get active,” said the recent active club post with thousands of views, linking to the central account of all youth clubs.

By all appearances, these youth clubs are proliferating. On Telegram alone, there are accounts showing nationwide chapters with photos of teens between the ages of 16 to 18 in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, the New England states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Washington DC, lowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan, among others.

The chapters have close to a thousand followers in total and in some cases list the same recruitment contact, suggesting a certain level of national coordination and vetting – an important aspect of far-right recruiting done to prevent against police or antifascist infiltration.

“Unapologetically Pro White”, posted one of the youth clubs, adding they were also “American Nationalist”.

Combined with the massive popularity among teen boys of the Tate brothers, mixed martial arts enthusiasts in their own right, young men and boys have emerged as the prime targets for far-right recruitment in recent years.

“The youth clubs are part of the same concept of active clubs' white supremacism ‘3.0' strategy: a decentralized movement focused on combat sports, fitness, propaganda activities, and building local groups,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst of the American far right who has documented its rise for nearly 10 years.

“The youth clubs are self-described white nationalist activist groups for young men 18 and younger who train in combat sports and participate in extreme right propaganda activities.”

Their direct links to active clubs aren't a secret or hidden, either.

Fisher-Birch continued: “Several youth club Telegram channels have also shared posts from active club-affiliated accounts. Additionally, youth club chapter logos are modeled on active club symbols. The logos are nearly identical in some cases.”

The network of active clubs' original founder, Robert Rundo, pleaded guilty in 2024 to conspiracy to riot at 2017 political rallies in California. During that period, he was the leader of the Rise Above Movement, a violent neo-Nazi gang that promoted combat sports and physical assault of perceived enemies. Four of its members were charged for their part in the infamous 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Rundo and other members of the active clubs network made it clear in the past that they saw young men and boys as the next and important frontier for building the new American fascist movement.

Writing in a 2022 post on one of its main websites Rundo and others described how their “tools of persuasion” can draw underage boys to join them. Along with flyers and stickers of local areas with their Nazi propaganda they told followers to “target boxing and MMA tournaments, gyms, and motocross courses”, but then went further.

“Ground-level intelligence collection might then inform that same activist crew that changing demographics at a local high school have led to gang-beatings of minority White youth,” they said. “The cunning and resourceful activists see this news as [an] opportunity for a campaign focusing on the importance of a Brotherhood of young White men having each other's backs.”

During the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler made it a staple of his regime to create the Hitler Youth organization for minors to learn combat and survivalism skills under the guise of self-improvement and nationalist pride. Ever since, modern neofascists and Nazis like active clubs, have always placed particular emphasis on securing the next generation of white supremacy.

“You will grow up to be men,” Hitler once said at one of his German rallies for his young acolytes.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Beauty and daily merchandise retailer Poya International Co (寶雅國際) yesterday reported better-than-expected net income in the first quarter, as revenue and profit margins improved significantly from a year earlier.

The company posted net profit of NT$784.59 million (US$24.17 million) for the January-to-March quarter, up 11.84 percent from NT$701.52 million a year earlier, it said in a regulatory filing.

That translated into earnings per share of NT$7.48, the highest for a single quarter in the company's history and up from NT$6.71 the previous year.

Gross margin was also better than expected at 44.45 percent, up 0.19 percentage points from a year earlier, while operating margin rose 0.24 percentage points to 15.29 percent after consolidated sales climbed 7.2 percent year-on-year to a record NT$6.3 billion, company data showed.

Poya is one of the nation's major retailers of cosmetic and skincare products. As of the end of last month, it operated 419 namesake stores, including “Poya Beauty” flagship stores, standard Poya stores and “shop-in-shop” concept stores.

The “shop-in-shop” concept refers to a separate shopping area within a larger store that features products from a specific brand, with Poya and the brands benefiting from cost and product arrangements.

Poya plans to continue opening new stores, and accelerate beauty store and shop-in-shop store deployments this year to increase its penetration across Taiwan, it said.

During its last earnings conference in February, the company told investors that it expected to achieve double-digit growth in the number of store openings this year, with a net increase of more than 50 stores.

At the same time, Poya plans to invest more in digitalization and closely target female customers to optimize its product portfolio and offer a better consumer experience, it said.

In addition, the company plans to introduce more own-brand products this year to enhance its brand value and contribute to earnings growth, it said. 

Own-brand products, which offer higher profit margins, accounted for 2.9 percent of its total sales in February, company data showed.



                                                                                Intel Corp chief executive officer Lip-Bu Tan (陳立武) is expected to meet with Taiwanese suppliers next month in conjunction with the opening of the Computex Taipei trade show, supply chain sources said on Monday.
The visit, the first for Tan to Taiwan since assuming his new post last month, would be aimed at enhancing Intel's ties with suppliers in Taiwan as he attempts to help turn around the struggling US chipmaker, the sources said.
Tan is to hold a banquet to celebrate Intel's 40-year presence in Taiwan before Computex opens on May 20 and invite dozens of Taiwanese suppliers to exchange views                                    



                                                                                Application-specific integrated circuit designer Faraday Technology Corp (智原) yesterday said that although revenue this quarter would decline 30 percent from last quarter, it retained its full-year forecast of revenue growth of 100 percent.
The company attributed the quarterly drop to a slowdown in customers' production of chips using Faraday's advanced packaging technology.
The company is still confident about its revenue growth this year, given its strong “design-win” — or the projects it won to help customers design their chips, Faraday president Steve Wang (王國雍) told an online earnings conference.
“The design-win this year is better than we expected. We believe we will win                                    



                                                                                Quanta Computer Inc (廣達) chairman Barry Lam (林百里) is expected to share his views about the artificial intelligence (AI) industry's prospects during his speech at the company's 37th anniversary ceremony, as AI servers have become a new growth engine for the equipment manufacturing service provider.
Lam's speech is much anticipated, as Quanta has risen as one of the world's major AI server suppliers. The company reported a 30 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated revenue to NT$1.41 trillion (US$43.35 billion) last year, thanks to fast-growing demand for servers, especially those with AI capabilities. The company told investors in November last year that                                    



                                                                                Power supply and electronic components maker Delta Electronics Inc (台達電) yesterday said it plans to ship its new 1 megawatt charging systems for electric trucks and buses in the first half of next year at the earliest.
The new charging piles, which deliver up to 1 megawatt of charging power, are designed for heavy-duty electric vehicles, and support a maximum current of 1,500 amperes and output of 1,250 volts, Delta said in a news release.
“If everything goes smoothly, we could begin shipping those new charging systems as early as in the first half of next year,” a company official said.

Ukraine seized a foreign vessel allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on April 25.

Russia had looted millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied territories, with at least 180,000 tons stolen through Mariupol alone, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Oct. 8, 2024.

According to the SBU statement, the ship, allegedly part of Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet,"" was detained in Ukraine's internal Black Sea waters. 

Investigators said the vessel had loaded around 5,000 tons of stolen Ukrainian wheat from the Russian-occupied port city of Sevastopol in late 2024 and attempted to disguise its operations by sailing under the flag of an Asian country.

During the search, authorities discovered documents, navigation equipment, and other evidence allegedly confirming the ship's role in smuggling Ukrainian agricultural products, the SBU said.

The ship and its crew have been detained, and an investigation is underway to identify all parties involved, according to the statement.

The operation was carried out by the SBU in cooperation with Ukraine's Navy and maritime border units, under the supervision of the Prosecutor's Office for Crimea and Sevastopol.

Russia's theft of Ukrainian grain and repeated attacks on agricultural infrastructure have caused severe damage to Ukraine's farming industry, once among the world's top wheat producers. The situation worsened after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July 2023, although Ukraine later established a new maritime trade corridor.

Evidence collected by human rights investigators also suggests that the Kremlin planned to weaponize food supplies and disrupt Ukraine's agricultural output months before launching the full-scale invasion.

Despite the losses, Ukraine managed to export nearly 100 million tons of goods from January to September 2024.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Russia insists on the international recognition of its hold over Crimea, as well as the entirety of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as a condition for peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Brazilian news outlet O Globo published on April 28.

This demand, reinforced last week by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, underscores how Russia continues to push its maximalist demands despite the U.S. efforts to broker a peace deal.

Russia illegally declared the four Ukrainian oblasts as annexed in 2022 following widely condemned sham referenda, but it does not fully control the territories. Crimea, occupied by Russia since 2014, was also included in Moscow's territorial claims.

The U.S. is reportedly considering a de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea as part of a potential peace deal and de facto control over other occupied territories. At the same time, U.S. officials are said to have rejected a demand for Ukraine's complete withdrawal from the other four regions.

Asked about Russia's conditions to enter peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also named a ban on Ukraine's entry into NATO, the country's demilitarization, and changes to Ukraine's legislation that would restore the position of the Russian language, culture, and religious organizations.

These conditions are effectively the same as the initial demands raised by Moscow at the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Lavrov also said that Ukraine's ban on direct negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin must be lifted. Previously, the Kremlin said that Putin would be ready to enter talks with Kyiv without ""any preconditions"" once this restriction was removed, seemingly contradicting Lavrov's later statements.

Ukraine has ruled out ceding its territory as part of any peace agreement, and both Kyiv and its allies have rejected demands for a reduction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 

""All of Kyiv's commitments must be legally guaranteed, have enforcement mechanisms, and be permanent,"" Lavrov said, adding that Russia also demands the lifting of Western sanctions, the abolition of international lawsuits and arrest warrants against Russian officials, and the return of frozen Russian assets.

Western governments have already begun using money linked to those assets to support Ukraine. In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) approved nearly $50 billion in loans for Kyiv, to be repaid using interest earned on frozen Russian funds.

Additionally, Lavrov said Moscow would demand ""reliable security guarantees"" from NATO, the European Union, and their member states against supposed future threats on Russia's western borders.

Lavrov said Russia remains open to negotiations but claimed ""the ball is not on our side,"" accusing Kyiv of lacking ""political will for peace."" He also said that the U.S. ""has begun to better understand"" Russia's positions, hinting at the foreign policy shift brought about by U.S. President Donald Trump.

It has been more than 45 days since Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire first introduced in March. Moscow rejected the plan, demanding a complete halt to Western military aid to Ukraine.

Despite claiming to support de-escalation, Russia has continued offensive operations along the front lines. Moscow has also intensified its attacks on civilian infrastructure, most recently killing 13 people in an attack on Kyiv on April 24.

Meanwhile, a separate partial ceasefire covering Ukraine's energy infrastructure, brokered during talks in Saudi Arabia in late March, has also been repeatedly violated.

According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Russia has breached the energy truce more than 30 times since it came into effect on March 25, targeting critical power infrastructure across the country.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The USMCA currently obliges Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to give one another three months' notice before starting free-trade talks with a 'non-market country.' U.S. President Donald Trump, right, and first lady Melania Trump arrive in Newark, N.J., on April 26.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump will seek even more restrictions on Canada's ability to sign trade agreements with China when Washington and Ottawa start renegotiations on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, an international trade expert predicts.

David Collins, who specializes in international trade and investment law at City St. George's, University of London, says he expects the United States will seek to toughen up Article 32.10 in the next United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

This unusual feature of the USMCA obliges Canada, the United States and Mexico to give one another three months' notice before starting free-trade talks with a “non-market country.” The United States has refused to recognize China as a market economy even 23 years after the Asian country joined the World Trade Organization.

Prof. Collins said the United States and China are trying to force countries to pick sides in the Washington-Beijing trade war and the Trump administration can be expected to extend this to trade agreements.

“The China clause of the USMCA is going to be even stricter. That is going to be beefed up,” he said of a renegotiated deal.

Under the existing article, Canada or other partners must also disclose to other USMCA signatories “as much information as possible” on objectives for their negotiations with a country deemed to have a non-market economy. Washington argues the Chinese economy is too distorted by state subsidies to be considered a market economy. This U.S. policy makes it easier for American trade regulators to find Chinese companies guilty of dumping goods.

The article says USMCA signatories must give each other 30 days' notice before signing a deal with a non-market economy. Finally, Washington or other partners can withdraw from the trilateral North American pact within six months of one of them inking a deal with a non-market economy.

In March, China's ambassador to Canada told The Globe and Mail his country is open to negotiating a free-trade agreement with Ottawa and co-operating on a research station in the Arctic – extending an invitation to repair strained ties as Canada's relations with the United States worsen.

Prime Minister Mark Carney, running as Liberal Leader in Monday's federal election, announced last month that Mr. Trump had agreed to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship after the federal election with whoever is prime minster. Mr. Carney said his preference would be a renegotiation of the USMCA.

The United States, currently in a trade war with China, is conducting trade negotiations with allies such as Japan, South Korea and India as these countries seek to resolve tariff threats from Washington. The U.S. is looking for allies in its dispute over what it considers China's unfair trading practices, and is seeking to isolate Beijing. “Everyone is coming to the table, and basically, China, is surrounded,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News earlier this month.

China, separately, has been warning other countries it will retaliate against them if they align with the United States against Chinese interests.

“The U.S. and China are jockeying to bring countries in their sphere of influence by intimidating countries not to deal with the other party - so the world is cleaving down the middle,” Prof. Collins said.

Lawrence Herman, a Toronto-based international trade lawyer, said he expects Canadian negotiations with Mr. Trump's administration will be difficult. He said Ottawa cannot agree to any U.S. request to restrict Canada's future trading relationships with a third country.

“The U.S. is going to demand certain things from its trading partners, including Canada. They're going to put on the table what we could call a diktat: ‘Here's what we want, and we expect you to agree to it,'” Mr. Herman predicted.

“Frankly, any demand that we cannot negotiate trade agreements with any other country is unacceptable to Canada.”

Vancouver's acting police chief said that Saturday was the city's darkest day. It was also the darkest for Canada's dynamic and growing Filipino community.

The vehicle attack that killed 11 people at a street festival Saturday night left its roughly one million members reeling. 

“We will feel this for a long time,” said RJ Aquino, chair of Filipino B.C. His voice broke as he described how panicked messages and calls poured into his phone after the attack on the festival, Lapu-Lapu Day.

Sitting next to him at a press conference, B.C. MLA Mable Elmore spoke of the “mad scramble” that followed. Before that, “it was a sunny day, it was a beautiful day for a celebration. Everyone was happy.”

She, too, was in tears as she described the aftermath for survivors and for the broader community. “We are in incredible pain,” she said.

But she also spoke of the community's resilience. So did others. “Even in the face of sorrow, our community's spirit remains unshaken. We will continue to celebrate our culture, not just as a tradition, but as a powerful expression of resistance, pride, and hope,” said Marites de Jesus, director of National Filipino Heritage Canada, in an e-mail message. 

Mr. Aquino of Filipino B.C. referred to the “bayanihan spirit,” a willingness to pull together in times of trouble.

By Sunday, groups across the country were already starting online campaigns to raise money for the victims' families. Across social media, Filipinos rallied to raise awareness about blood donations in the Vancouver area. 

One of the victims was Rizza Azzir, according to online posts. Police are not identifying the others yet, though they said the victims ranged in age from 5 to 65. 

Ms. Azzir was identified in Facebook posts and a GoFundMe campaign started by her cousin, Shelby Pacumio.

Ms. Azzir and her husband moved from the Philippines to Winnipeg “in search of a better life,” the GoFundMe page says.

Sydney Roa, who was at the festival but left before the attack, set up a GoFundMe page on behalf of a Vancouver-based organization that she runs, Tadhana Toys, which provides clothes, books and games to children in hospitals, low-income families and new immigrants.

“Filipinos like to help each other,” she said. “You know, you see a Filipino, I don't know, at the mall, and you say ‘hi,' they're more than happy to say ‘hi' back. There's this universal connection. “

Others spoke of the community's contribution to Canada. British Columbia Premier David Eby pointed out there were probably few in the province who were not touched by care given by a Filipino, whether it is in long-term-care homes, hospitals, child care or schools.

In a statement in June marking a month-long celebration of Filipino heritage, Diversity Minister Kamal Khera said that “due to their recognized expertise in nursing and health care,” Filipino Canadians were “strengthening Canada's health care system and supporting the well-being of Canadian families.”

Filipinos began arriving in Canada in large numbers in the 1960s. Thousands of Filipinas came under the government's live-in caregiver program, often working long hours so they could send money home to their families.

By the 2021 census, 957,355 people reported being of Filipino ethnic origin. Greater Toronto had the biggest community, at 272,470, followed by Vancouver (141,230), Calgary (83,815), Winnipeg (81,140), Edmonton (77,085) and Montreal (39,020).

The community continues to boom. A Statistics Canada report from 2023 said that “over one-third of Canadians reporting Filipino roots living in Canada in 2021 arrived within the previous decade.”

Most are Roman Catholics. On Sunday, flags at St. Mary's Parish in Vancouver flew at half-mast as the largely Filipino congregation filled the church.

Father Joseph D'Souza asked for a moment of silence in recognition of what he called the “tragic incident” on Saturday night. After the service, Angelo and Jennifer Tuazon reflected on what had happened.

“It's a sad day. It was the second year for that festival and instead of joy, now it's going to be remembered differently,” Mr. Tuazon said as the couple and their 13-year-daughter and five-year-old son left the church.

Mohamad Sariman, a food truck operator at the Filipino festival that was attacked on Saturday night, says he initially thought the incident which left 11 dead was an explosion.

China's Wang Yi has backed Pakistan's call for an independent probe into the recent attack in Kashmir. Meanwhile, India said troops from both sides exchanged fire for the fourth night in a row. DW rounds up the latest.

Here is a roundup of the latest developments in the region on Monday, April 28: 

India should be careful not to alienate Kashmiris in its hunt for militants who killed 26 people last week,  the region's chief minister has said. 

Omar Abdullah said this was particularly important given that people in the Muslim-majority Himalayan region have staged protests against that attack, its chief minister said on Monday.

""We should not do anything to alienate the people after their spontaneous reaction [against the attack],"" Abdullah, chief minister of the Indian federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir, told the local assembly house.

""Guns can only control militancy, not finish it. It will only end when the people are with us. It seems people are now reaching that stage.""

Indiabanned sixteen Pakistani YouTube accounts for allegedly spreading ""provocative"" content following the Kashmir attack.

Among the banned accounts are those of Pakistani media outlets Dawn, Samaa TV, ARY News and others.

When users in India try to access the accounts, they receive a message which reads they are blocked due to an ""order from the government related to national security or public order.""

The Kashmirattack, which claimed the lives of 26 people, was the worst on civilians in the contested region.

On Sunday, Pakistan security forces said it killed 54 militants in an overnight operation in the North Waziristan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province close to the Afghanistan border. It followed the militants' attempt to cross into the country, marking one of the deadliest of such killings in recent years.

In a statement, the military said that intelligence reports indicated the killed militants were ""Khwarij,"" a term used by the government for Pakistani Taliban.

In another overnight operation on Monday, the Pakistani army said its troops killed 17 more militants trying to cross the border, bringing the total of insurgents killed to 71 in the past three days.

India has threatened to suspend the Indus Water Treaty, which governs how water in the Indus basin is being shared between India and Pakistan.

That could wreak havoc on Pakistan's agriculture and economy.

China's Foreign Ministry on Monday made a statement asking India and Pakistan to exercise restraint.

""China hopes that the two sides will exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.

Beijing gave its support on Sunday to Pakistan's calls for an independent investigation into the recent attack on tourists in the Indian-administered part of Kashmir.

The ""denial of Kashmiri self-determination"" lies at the core of the conflict between India and Pakistan, Natasha Raheja, a political anthropologist at Cornell University told DW.

""At the core of this dispute is an ongoing struggle and denial of Kashmiri self-determination. This is a region that has been besieged by a history of colonial borders that were drawn in haste as well as hasty princely state accessions,"" she said, adding that there was an escalation of a ""nationalist rhetoric"" this time.

According to Raheja, both countries ""have a history of leveraging their minoritized populations against each other.""

""Kashmiri people are suffering and their voices are being overshadowed by the military showmanship at the border.""

As for a solution to the conflict, Raheja believes it will be the people's own questioning of their borders which could lead to progress.

""People across borders must work together and they must question the work that these borders do.""

The Indian Army said in a statement their soldiers exchanged gunfire for the fourth night in a row on Monday as tensions remained high between New Delhi and Islamabad. No deaths were reported.

""During the night of April 27-28... Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control. Indian troops responded swiftly and effectively,"" the Indian army said in a statement. 

Pakistan has not yet confirmed the gunfire.

Kashmir is a disputed territory administered by India, Pakistan and China.
 
India and Pakistan both claim sovereignty over the whole region. A 1972 agreement established a so-called ""Line of Control (LoC)"" that divides the Indian and Pakistan-administered parts.

India accused Pakistan of supporting militancy in the region after the Pahalgam attack. Pakistan has denied the claims, and called for an independent probe.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday, expressing his support for an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack. 

""China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,"" Wang told Dar, reported China's Xinhua news agency.

He added that he hoped both sides would show restraint and work to de-escalate the situation.

Wang also spoke to UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy about ""India's false accusations, baseless propaganda and unilateral measures,"" said Pakistani newspaper Dawn.

He told Lammy that Pakistan was dedicated to promoting peace in the region.

The US State Department on Sunday said it was in touch with India and Pakistan, and wanted them to work towards a ""responsible solution"" as tensions stayed high between the two neighbors after the recent attack in Kashmir.

""This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels. The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,"" a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters news agency.

The US has expressed its support to India after the attack, which New Delhi blames on Pakistan. Islamabad has denied any responsibility and called for a neutral investigation.

India and Pakistan are both important strategic partners for the US amid China's rising influence.

Welcome to DW's coverage of events in Kashmir and the wider region on Monday, April 28, 2025.

On April 22, 26 people, most of whom were tourists, were killed by gunmen near a resort close to the mountain town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir. 

The attack prompted New Delhi to downgrade its diplomatic ties with Islamabad the following day, including the suspension of a key water-sharing treaty and closure of its main land border crossing with Pakistan.

In response, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian flights. Both sides have expelled each others' diplomats and canceled or curtailed visa durations.

Since then, tensions have prevailed with cross-border firing from both sides for the last four days. ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

Red Electrica said that work to restore electricity was progressing in 10 regions in Spain.

The power provider said there was electricity again in areas of Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country, Galicia, Asturias, Navarre, Castile and Leon, Extremadura and Andalusia, it said.

The update follows a previous statement in which Red Electrica said that power supply had been restored in parts of the north, south and west of the Iberian Peninsula.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the aim was to have restored power nationwide ""soon.""

Sanchez said in a televised address that connections with France and Morocco had been partially restored and that the ""combined cycles and hydroelectric plants throughout the country have also been reactivated, which should allow us to recover the supply across Spain soon.""

The cause of the outage was still to be determined, the prime minister stressed.

""We still do not have conclusive information about the reasons for this outage... It's better not to speculate, we will know the causes, we do not rule out any hypothesis,"" Sanchez said.

Hey called on his country to show ""responsibility and civility"" to help authorities manage a sweeping power outage

Sanchez said interconnections with neighboring France and Morocco, which were also hit, have already partially restored supply to Spain and thanked the governments of both countries.

Meanwhile, ""combined cycles and hydroelectric plants throughout the country have also been reactivated, which should allow us to recover the supply across Spain soon,"" Sanchez added in a televised address

The minister of transport in Spain has said it won't be possible to have inter-city train services up and running again on Monday.

""Today it is not expected that the circulation of medium and long-distance trains will be restored... We are working so that, once the electricity supply is restored, we can resume those services which will no longer be possible today,"" Oscar Puente wrote on X.

The minister said it would take time to restore control systems once power was back, and that systems guaranteeing safety would need to be rebooted.

Puente also said that air traffic at airports was operating normally except for a 20% reduction ""due to telecommunications security precautions.""

Spain's nuclear power plants reported that they were in the process of restoring external power supply and were preparing for ""possible reconnection"" to the national grid.

Spain's Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) said the plants automatically shut down due to the power outage and then shifted to backup diesel generators which kept the plants in ""safe working order.""

The CSN said that the outage ""has had no impact on workers, the public, or the environment.""

Spain's power provider, Red Electrica, issued an update on the work being done to restore power to the grid following a major power outage that has impacted Spain and Portugal.

The company said that power had been restored at substations in several areas of the Iberian Peninsula and that consumers in these parts were being supplied.

The power provider said that the work being done would gradually allow electricity to be restored throughout the peninsula.

Earlier the company said that it could take between six to eight hours for power to be restored.

Portuguese grid operator REN said it was ""still impossible"" to know when the power grid could be fully restored. 

The power operator said it suspects a fault in the Spanish electricity grid caused by extreme temperature variations in the country's interior. These likely caused unusual fluctuations in extremely high-voltage lines, it said.

President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said there were no signs yet of a cyberattack following the major power outage impacting Spain and Portugal.

""Grid operators in both countries are working on finding the cause, and on restoring the electricity supply,"" Costa, who heads the European Council representing EU member states, wrote on X,  after being in touch with leaders in Spain and Portugal.

""At this point, there are no indications of any cyber attack,"" Costa said. 

The major power outage gripping Spain and Portugal caused travel chaos with no electricity to traffic lights and rail operations causing gridlock.

Spanish airports had to resort to backup electricity generators as the outage caused flights to be delayed.

""Due to the power outage, some incidents are occurring at the airports. Contingency generators are active. Please check with your airline, as there may be disruptions to access and ground transportation,"" airport operator Aena said on its website.

In Lisbon, terminals were closed and large amounts of travelers waited outside for news about their flights.

Ukraine's Energy Minister, German Galuschenko, said his country was on hand to help restore power if needed following the major power outage impacting Spain and Portugal.

""We are ready to share the knowledge and experience, including those gained during the systematic Russian attacks on the energy infrastructure,"" Galuschenko said in a post on X. 

Ukraine's critical infrastructure has repeatedly been targeted by attacks during Russia's continued invasion.

Authorities in Spain and Portugal are scrambling to identify what caused a widespread power outage that hit large parts of the two European countries.

""The government is working to determine the origin and impact of this incident and is dedicating all resources to resolve it as soon as possible,"" the Spanish government said.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is hosting an ""extraordinary"" meeting of Spain's national security council to discuss the issue. Spanish power distributor Red Electrica would not speculate on the causes of the blackout.

Meanwhile, the Portuguese Cabinet has also convened an emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence.

Officials said that a possible cyberattack has not been ruled out, but investigations are ongoing.

The European Commission said it is in contact with the authorities in Spain and Portugal and the European network of transmission system operators (ENTSO-E) to try to establish the cause of the outage.

European Commission Vice President Teresa Ribera told the EFE news agency there was nothing to suggest the outage was caused by ""anything intentional.""

Restoring Spain's power grid could take between six and 10 hours, the country's power provider Red Electrica said.

The Reuters news agency cited the head of operations at the power company, Eduardo Prieto, with information of the expected timeline.

Prieto told journalists that the massive outage was unprecedented and called the event ""exceptional and extraordinary.""

The company declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout at this stage.

The Spanish and Portuguese governments have convened emergency Cabinet meetings to discuss and respond Monday's outage.

Officials said that a possible cyberattack has not been ruled out, but investigations were ongoing.

It is rare to have such a widespread outage across the Iberian Peninsula.

The main Spanish national art museum in Madrid, the Museo del Prado, posted up pictures of empty hallways and exhibits in relative darkness, with none of the usual bustling crowds present.

""This is the state of the museum's galleries after the coordinated evacuation, in which all visitors to the Prado kindly collaborated,"" the museum posted on social media platform X.

""Due to the persistence of the situation, the Prado Museum will remain closed all day,"" the museum added in a follow up post.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'dw.com'}","world"

One person has died and several others have been injured after a boat struck a passenger ferry in Florida and fled the scene.

Police and fire services declared a “mass casualty incident” in Clearwater on Sunday night.

All of those injured were aboard the ferry, which was carrying 45 people near the city's Memorial Causeway Bridge.

Six patients were declared as “trauma alerts”, including two with serious injuries, which were taken to hospital by helicopter.

No information about the fatality has been released.

Police said the boat that fled the scene had been identified by another law enforcement agency and an investigation was underway.

“All of the injuries are from the ferry. The boat that struck the ferry fled the scene,” Clearwater police said on social media.

“The ferry came to rest on a sandbar just south of the Memorial Causeway Bridge. All patients and passengers have been removed,” it added.

“All local hospitals have been notified. Multiple trauma alerts have been called with helicopters transporting two of the more seriously injured.”

The accident happened at the end of a 17-day sand sculpture festival on Sunday night and many people were taking the ferry back and forth, according to media reports.

The US coast guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission will investigate the crash.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration pursues a $1 trillion military budget for the next fiscal year.

Congressional Republicans on Sunday released legislation that would pump an additional $150 billion into the Pentagon — a morass of waste and profiteering — over the next decade as part of a sweeping reconciliation package that's also expected to include deep cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthy.

The House Armed Services Committee, a major target of weapons industry lobbying, unveiled the plan for what it called “a historic investment of $150 billion to restore America's military capabilities and strengthen our national defense.” The panel said the legislation was developed “in close conjunction” with Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump, who is separately pursuing a $1 trillion U.S. military budget for the next fiscal year.

The legislation would direct the new Pentagon funding toward a number of initiatives backed by the president, including a “Golden Dome” missile defense system that experts have called a massive boondoggle that could benefit Elon Musk.

The bill, which is scheduled for a committee markup on Tuesday, also includes $4.5 billion to speed production of the B-21 stealth bomber, a Northrop Grumman-made aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

William Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said Sunday that the GOP's proposed Pentagon spending increase is “a glaring example of misplaced priorities.”

“This is no time to throw more money at a weapons manufacturing base that is already maxed out,” said Hartung. “Any additional money pumped into this system is likely to be wasted. The only beneficiaries will be weapons contractors, who will be glad to accept the new funds whether they can use them effectively or not.”

“Given that the Pentagon and its contractor network are having a hard time spending existing funds well,” Hartung added, “Congress should think twice before sending more taxpayer money their way.”

The Republican push for additional Pentagon funding comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing calls to resign for sharing plans for a U.S. military attack on Yemen in at least two private group chats.

Earlier this month, as Common Dreams reported, Hegseth endorsed Trump's push for a $1 trillion U.S. military budget, which would mark the highest level of spending since the Second World War.



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Widespread blackouts have plunged large swaths of Spain and Portugal, and even parts of France, into darkness, leaving potentially millions without electricity.

So far, the causes of the blackouts remain unknown.

The Spanish government made its first comment just after 2 pm, saying that Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will chair an emergency meeting at 3 pm today.

The Portuguese Cabinet has also convened an emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence.

Speaking to RTP 3, when asked about the possibility of it being a cyber attack, Manuel Castro Almeida said that “there is this possibility, but it is not confirmed.”

“I know that it covers several countries of Europe—Portugal, Spain, France, and Germany, and I believe Morocco as well,” Castro Almeida said.

“But it's unconfirmed information.”

Spain's national electricity transmission system operator, Red Eléctrica, confirmed power outages across the country.

Red Eléctrica said that the power outage in Spain is “exceptional and extraordinary” and will take “up to 10 hours to repair.”

Spanish oil refiner Petronor said all units at its Bilbao oil refinery were shut due to the power blackout in the country, according to a statement on their website on Monday.

“The plant has been shut down, fully ensuring safety conditions, and all emergency systems are operating correctly,” the company said.

The countries have a combined population of more than 50 million people.

It was not immediately clear how many were affected, but there are continuous reports that subway networks, phone lines, and traffic lights are not working.

People have been unable to withdraw cash from ATMs, and stores selling generators have sold out as customers lined up to buy them.

It was not possible to make calls on mobile phone networks in Portugal, though some apps were working.

Portuguese airport operator ANA said airports activated emergency generators, which, for now, allows essential airport operations to be maintained at Porto and Faro airports.

“In Lisbon, operations are ongoing but with limitations. So far, there have been no impacts on Madeira and Azores airports,” it said.

Power outages on this scale are rare in Europe.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

They see wealth inequality in a reduced economy leading to possible mass social disorder and spreading mental health challenges as people sink into despair.

In the report's words: “In 2040, upward social mobility is almost unheard of in Canada. Hardly anyone believes that they can build a better life for themselves, or their children, through their own efforts.”

The prognostications are dire, and it's tempting to dismiss them as exaggerations from pessimistic researchers rather than accept the possibility of such a bleak future. In reading the report, it's evident that the prophecies are based on visible socioeconomic trends. The wealth gap is quickly widening while frustrated young Canadians are abandoning hope of home ownership or prosperity in their future.

The top two parties in contention for the leadership of Canada aren't proposing the kind of radical policy changes required to head off the grim conjectures of Policy Horizons. To turn Canada from its trajectory, the government must shrink and deregulate to draw both human capital and foreign investment into the nation. The government must take on trade unions, crony capitalists, and environmental activists to facilitate broad economic development.

Those sorts of policy proposals, however, send chills down the spines of political strategists who want anything but conflict with the aforementioned groups during an election campaign. So we are left hoping that whoever forms the next government has a hidden agenda of reform, which will be quickly implemented upon assuming power.

Housing is a most basic need. Especially in a climate as harsh as Canada. Despite years of promises and countless government-sponsored programs, home ownership remains out of reach for a growing number of Canadians, while low housing supplies lead to rising rent. The report predicts existing homeowners could become future aristocrats as they expand property holdings to hand down to their children, while an underclass locked in the world of renting can't get ahead. Canada could devolve into a class-based society with “social siloing,” separating citizens based on their economic standing.

Social division and a shrinking economy with wealth concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of people could start a chain reaction as skilled and ambitious people emigrate to jurisdictions offering better opportunities for upward social mobility. If younger people flee, the social systems caring for the older population will become further strained. The demographic balance of the nation could tilt, leaving older Canadians cash-rich but resource-poor due to overburdened health and senior care resources.

Those remaining in the country could find themselves seeking alternative ways to meet their needs. People could form housing, health, and food production cooperatives to make ends meet. While that may be effective, it also would lead to a form of tribalism and social introversion for large groups of people. These groups would be distanced from government influence and likely would harbour strong distrust of state institutions. They could become hubs of dangerous discontent.

People may take out their ire upon scapegoats such as immigrants or other identifiable groups if they aren't blaming the government itself. The potential for social conflicts will grow and could blossom into general violence.

While the world envisioned within the report may hold appeal for hardcore ideological libertarians, it would be a rough and miserable place in reality.

Almost all the frightening scenarios packed within the report are already happening. It's just a matter of degree. If current trends continue, the predictions could become reality in short order.

Ironically, this is one of the few times we can hope the parties vying to run in the election are being disingenuous as they offer grander versions of the current government path. Perhaps they understand the gravity of the situation and the report, but don't feel they can effectively campaign on the solutions.

Just this once, let's hope they are blowing smoke while they maintain a hidden agenda of reform. Because if they stay on the current trajectory, our future looks dark indeed.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

In December 2024, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's radiological, chemical, and biological defense forces, was assassinated in Moscow. The Ukrainian government had accused Kirillov of war crimes related to the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine, and Russian officials immediately blamed Kyiv for his death. Anonymous Ukrainian intelligence officials even admitted to journalists that Kyiv was behind the assassination, but Ukraine did not officially confirm responsibility. It was the latest in a series of attacks on Russian soil that Kyiv was suspected of carrying out but on which it offered no comment.

Ukraine is not alone in refusing to acknowledge responsibility for such actions. Russia often denies hostile moves that it perpetrates against other states, even in the face of substantial evidence. When Russian troops began operating in the separatist regions of Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin initially denied their presence. In 2018, it denied involvement in the attempted assassinations, in the United Kingdom, of the Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter using a Russian nerve agent. And since 2017, Moscow has denied attempts to influence elections in the United States, despite U.S. intelligence that indicates otherwise.

Other countries behave similarly. When a Chinese balloon drifted across the United States in 2023, Beijing said it was a weather monitor that had drifted off course, even as experts asserted that its design was consistent with a spy balloon. Pakistan has routinely hidden the involvement of its armed forces in conflicts with India over Kashmir. Israel has a long-standing policy of neither confirming nor denying assassinations. And the United States refused for years to acknowledge the thousands of drone strikes it carried out in northwestern Pakistan targeting al-Qaeda members, despite widespread media reporting on the campaign.

It might seem that an attacker would gain little from concealing the truth or that refusing to admit the obvious could further antagonize the country it attacked. Yet there is an upside to obfuscation. Our recently published survey research shows that denying responsibility for a hostile action, however implausible the denial may be, reduces public demand in the target state for an escalatory response. It also shows that in the presence of denials, a target state's citizens perceive hostile actions as less insulting and damaging to their country's reputation and become less certain about what entity is responsible.

Our findings suggest that when both sides in a conflict seek to avoid escalation, one side's denial can reduce public pressure on the other to respond forcefully. Therefore, denials can actually help keep conflicts from intensifying. On the other hand, a government may sometimes want to respond strongly to hostile acts, perhaps to deter future ones; in such situations, denials by the attacker state can frustrate those aims. In the worst case, the effectiveness of denials can embolden hostile states to act with greater impunity. For a target state to stand up for itself, it may first have to overcome the all-too-persuasive denials of its attacker. Fortunately, our findings point to a possible solution. The efficacy of denials is reduced in the face of overwhelming evidence—suggesting that the way to counter ambiguity may be to produce unambiguous proof.

Understanding how the public thinks about implausible denials is important because that opinion can limit how a target state's policymakers can respond to an attack. We conducted three surveys of representative samples of the U.S. public that ranged in size from 477 to 954 respondents. In each, we presented respondents with a hypothetical scenario in which a foreign navy attacks U.S.-flagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Sometimes, we identified the attacker as Iran, a U.S. adversary; other times, we identified the attacker as Qatar, a more neutral state and thus a less plausible attacker. We also varied the strength of the evidence of responsibility. In all three surveys, we randomly divided respondents into two groups. The first read that the accused country admitted responsibility and the second read that the country denied it. After reading about the scenario, all respondents answered questions about their perceptions of the attack and how they would prefer the United States to react.

We found that denials consistently reduced public support for escalatory reactions. When the scenario offered only moderate evidence of Iranian responsibility, a denial by Iran reduced the number of respondents supporting the United States' use of force (via an airstrike or invasion) from 50 percent to 27 percent. When the scenario offered moderate evidence of Qatari responsibility, a denial by Qatar lowered support for the use of force from 49 percent to 21 percent. When we provided respondents with overwhelming evidence of Iranian responsibility, however, an Iranian denial reduced support for the use of force only from 55 percent to 53 percent—a difference small enough that it could be due to random chance. Therefore, the results show that denying responsibility was at least somewhat helpful to the attacker in all cases but that a de-escalatory effect is much stronger when the evidence seems less overwhelming or the attacker less plausible.

Why are denials effective even in the presence of contrary evidence? Across all three surveys, respondents who read that the attacker state denied involvement expressed less concern that a nonresponse would augur future military challenges for the United States. In two out of the three experiments, they also reported feeling less insulted as American citizens. This suggests that denials can be face saving, interpreted by the target state as somehow more respectful. In turn, individuals in the target state are less likely to believe that retaliation is necessary to restore their country's status and reputation.



But we also found an even bigger reason why denials work: a portion of the public truly believes them, regardless of contrary evidence. Among respondents presented with a Qatari attack, the proportion of those who thought Qatar was responsible dropped from 96 percent to 76 percent when Qatar denied responsibility. This suggests that Qatar is viewed by the American public as relatively trustworthy. But even Iranian denials influenced beliefs. Among respondents given the scenario with moderate evidence of Iranian responsibility, the proportion of respondents who ultimately held Iran responsible fell from 99 percent to 84 percent when Iran denied involvement. Even among those presented with overwhelming evidence, an Iranian denial brought the number down from 99 percent to 94 percent—an effect that is relatively small but still statistically significant, meaning it is highly unlikely that the difference is due to random chance. Of course, a majority of people across the surveys did not give credence to the denials, but a significant number did, thus reducing the overall support for escalation.

Although we surveyed the public, it is plausible that denials could directly influence the thinking of foreign policy decision-makers, too. Policymakers might be less likely to believe denials because of their greater access to information, but they are even more likely to be invested in their country's reputation. The face-saving effect of ambiguity can therefore be expected to lessen policymakers' appetite for an escalatory response.

We ran our surveys only in the United States, but within that population, we did not find that the responses to the scenarios we posed were heavily influenced by respondents' personality or demographic traits. This suggests that denials are likely to have a similar effect on the people and, potentially, the governments of other countries, too.

If a thin veneer of refutability can reduce the danger of reprisals, then denials of hostile actions can be a powerful tool for managing the fallout not only of covert operations carried out by intelligence or special forces but also of some conventional military actions, such as sending military advisers to a conflict zone or launching airstrikes. Still, there is a limit to what countries can effectively deny. For example, denials of major conventional military operations are unlikely to benefit the attacker country at all. This may explain why Russia did not deny its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, even as it dispensed false information to rationalize the invasion to the Russian public and downplayed the scope of its military operations domestically.

Despite their advantages, false denials pose a problem for democracies. In a world in which information flows readily across borders, it is impossible for any government to lie to foreign audiences without deceiving its domestic public, and democratic governments may be less willing or able to deliberately mislead their citizens. For this reason, democratic countries that do not acknowledge responsibility for some hostile actions, among them Israel and the United States, are less likely to issue explicit denials and more likely to refrain from commenting or, if they do comment, choose to “neither confirm nor deny.” This middle-road approach can have de-escalatory benefits, as it offers some measure of doubt that could help the target save face. But it sows less doubt than denial, meaning that the United States and other democratic states that rely on ambiguity may be at a disadvantage compared with nondemocratic countries, such as Russia, that are more comfortable with outright lies.

In some cases, both sides of a conflict may welcome the de-escalatory qualities of denial. As the political scientist Austin Carson wrote in Foreign Affairs in 2022, adversaries sometimes jointly seek to avoid escalation; in such cases, one side declining to acknowledge responsibility for an attack can help keep a conflict at a low level by reducing pressure on the other side to escalate. This tempering effect can allow both sides to pursue their objectives in a less risky manner and potentially reduce a conflict's human costs.



Yet the willingness of some members of the American public to believe a foreign adversary's denials can be a problem for the U.S. government, particularly if a denied action crosses a redline and Washington seeks to mount a strong response that will deter similar future activity. Convincing people to believe their denials can allow adversaries to divide public opinion in the United States and potentially cause government officials to fear a domestic backlash against a forceful reaction. Even debate over responsibility can itself distract from formulating an appropriate response.

Unfortunately, this problem is likely to get worse. One might think it would be harder today for perpetrators to hide from responsibility given the nature of people's connectivity and the prevalence of live recordings of events. But an increase in the availability of information has been accompanied by plummeting trust in that information. In the United States and many other countries, media fragmentation and political polarization have led to a situation in which no information source is widely trusted by individuals across the political spectrum. Even if the U.S. government and the mainstream media report convincing evidence of a foreign country's responsibility for an attack, not everyone will believe it, and conspiracy theories can flourish on social media.

Given the power of denial and ambiguity to muddy perceptions of responsibility for hostile actions, the United States—and other countries around the world—should treat the adoption of these positions as serious geopolitical and military tools. Policymakers must be prepared not only to obfuscate when it makes de-escalation possible but also to counter an adversary's obfuscation when it may have more harmful effects. Political polarization and media fragmentation defy easy answers, and better equipping the public to reject dubious claims will likely require long-term educational investments in media literacy and critical thinking skills. Yet our research shows that even in the current environment, evidence has some power to influence beliefs. This suggests that a viable short-term solution is to make an attacker country's denial as implausible as possible. To do this, governments must be prepared to share more evidence with the public in an understandable way and manage the tradeoff between reaping the benefits of greater openness and protecting intelligence sources. For now, perhaps the best option is to fight lies with the truth.

The world is witnessing a new kind of global race—not for authority in space but for control over the global nuclear energy market. Nuclear power had long been considered risky owing to major accidents and budget overruns, hampering its large-scale adoption. But within the past decade, nuclear energy has been making a comeback thanks to the development of small modular reactors. China and Russia are seizing the lead, expanding their domestic capacities as well as exporting nuclear technology and constructing nuclear power plants across a variety of emerging economies.

Russia now leads the world in nuclear power plant construction. Its state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, is constructing six new domestic reactors and is helping build 19 reactors in six foreign countries. Over the past ten years, meanwhile, China has inked contracts to help construct nine reactors in four countries while maintaining an unparalleled rate of expansion in its domestic nuclear industry. Both countries have been particularly quick to grasp the potential of small modular reactors, which typically can generate up to a third of the power produced by conventional nuclear plants. Compared with traditional large reactors, SMRs can be deployed quickly to areas that lack resilient electric-grid capacity, and their modular designs make them more affordable.

The need for affordable new power sources is growing as the world rapidly electrifies. Global electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of around four percent over the next several years, and developing countries will account for an estimated 85 percent of that new demand. Among the major powers, China and Russia have been by far the most proactive in recognizing this need and responding to it with nuclear power exports. Both nations are actively targeting developing countries.

That effort, in turn, may well transform the global energy landscape and shift the balance of geopolitical power. The United States once dominated nuclear technology development. But since around the 1970s, it has ceded this leadership because of public opposition, rising costs, and regulatory challenges. Now, it is paying the price. The surging need for electricity to power AI, coupled with developing countries' desire for energy access, means that countries capable of exporting SMRs quickly and affordably will become increasingly influential partners to other nations. China and Russia are already leveraging their nuclear energy investments abroad to deepen their economic and political influence over the countries buying their technology.

To prevent authoritarian regimes from commanding the future nuclear energy market, the United States must continue updating its regulatory framework that governs reactor licensing and redirect federal investment toward its own SMR industry. It will also need to coordinate with democratic allies in Europe and Asia to diversify the advanced nuclear energy market. Only a collaborative effort—ideally, in the form of a multilateral nuclear energy organization—can offer emerging economies competitive funding packages that rival those proffered by China and Russia. If Western countries do not urgently rethink their international nuclear energy strategies, autocratic regimes may well use nuclear power to steer the trajectory of the world's economy and politics before democracies realize it is too late to catch up.

China's and Russia's appetites for exporting nuclear energy are growing fast. In July of last year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia to explore peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and Uganda is considering partnering with Russia to build its first nuclear power plant. This month, Rosatom began the preparatory site work to construct a nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan, which will be the first nuclear reactor in Central Asia and Russia's first SMR export. The nuclear agency is also at work on a nuclear project in Bangladesh. China, for its part, has in the past 15 years signed nuclear energy agreements with Argentina, Hungary, Nigeria, and Pakistan. And each country is specifically investing in SMRs: Russia deployed the world's first commercial SMR in 2020. China's high-temperature gas-cooled modular pebble-bed reactor, which began operating in 2023, is the first of its kind.

Other countries are attempting to get into the game. But unlike the private companies now working on nuclear power, Beijing's China National Nuclear Corporation and Moscow's Rosatom are both state-owned and benefit from a supply chain that integrates manufacturing, construction, and fueling, as well as more streamlined decision-making and operations. These efficiencies allow China and Russia to build reactors fast and at relatively low costs. China's nuclear industry is powered by thousands of highly skilled staff members operating with remarkable speed. These efficiencies are not simply a byproduct of authoritarian control: they are the result of deliberate choices by Beijing and Moscow to elevate nuclear energy to a national priority. Both nations have made licensing processes to construct reactors more efficient without compromising safety.

China and Russia have also elected to provide abundant and strategic state financing for nuclear energy. To accomplish Beijing's nuclear goals, the Energy Research Institute at China's National Development and Reform Commission has estimated that China must—and can—make over $1.3 trillion worth of investments by 2050. Typically, most Chinese projects are backed by state loans at interest rates as low as 1.4 percent, significantly lower than global averages. Russia has committed more than $26 billion to domestic nuclear projects and offers multibillion-dollar export financing packages. Other countries also have state-backed nuclear institutions, but none are yet attempting to match the scale of China's and Russia's export drives.

Both China National Nuclear Corporation and Rosatom often cover as much as 85 percent of an overseas project's costs in the form of loans with favorable interest rates. And both offer “build-own-operate” contracts, or agreements that allow them to own the reactors they construct abroad for a set period, thereby reducing burdens—such as managing spent nuclear fuel—for buyer nations. CNNC also provides foreign buyers with comprehensive services including the design, construction, and operation of its nuclear plants. By working closely with engineers and scientists in buyer countries, Beijing invests in developing peer-to-peer relationships that cement its bilateral ties.

Emerging economies are thus turning to China and Russia for their power needs, especially for assistance in deploying SMRs. SMR technology was initially developed in the 1950s, primarily for military applications. For decades, SMRs were viewed as niche technologies. But advances in design and more supportive government policies—coupled with the ballooning need for electricity around the world—has elevated their profile. Unlike conventional large reactors, SMRs' diverse sizes and forms offer greater flexibility, allowing them to meet smaller energy demands and more specialized applications in a wider variety of geographical locations.

SMRs' streamlined manufacturing processes and shorter construction timelines could also allow buyer nations to bypass many of the daunting financial and logistical challenges inherent in building conventional nuclear power plants. Experts have estimated that SMR projects could take three to six years compared with the ten or more years it takes to deploy conventional reactors. If the SMR projects already underway in China and Russia succeed at expanding nuclear energy access at a lower cost, that may increase SMRs' appeal to emerging economies aiming to break into energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and data centers.

Additionally, SMRs can do things that conventional nuclear plants cannot. Certain advanced designs can achieve higher operating temperatures, enabling them to generate process heat for industrial applications such as steelmaking and producing ammonia for fertilizer. These uses are critical: in 2022, the industrial sector accounted for approximately 37 percent of global energy consumption.

Some analysts remain skeptical of SMRs' novelty and point to the history of expensive, over-budget conventional nuclear projects. But China and Russia believe they will transform the energy market: with huge investments, by 2030, China hopes to export 30 reactors to its Belt and Road Initiative partner countries, and Russia aims to capture 20 percent of the global SMR market. As the world's electricity demand rises, so will the strategic value of nuclear energy, which offers far greater power density than other sources: just one uranium fuel pellet produces as much energy as a ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas.

The comprehensive financing packages and efficient production that Beijing and Moscow are offering make nuclear power much more accessible for developing nations. But these agreements also risk creating long-term dependence, ensuring that buyer countries remain indebted to China and Russia and reliant on their operational expertise for decades. Despite this threat of dependence, emerging economies—as well as developed countries that want to generate more nuclear power—have few compelling alternatives to Chinese and Russian nuclear energy. The American company NuScale Power has signed agreements to deploy SMRs in Ghana and Romania, but the projects remain in the planning phases. Another American company, Westinghouse, is helping Poland build its first nuclear power plant. But these efforts lag far behind those made by Beijing and Moscow.

Although some unique efficiencies help centralized, statist governments fast-track nuclear energy projects, there is no inherent reason why the United States and its allies cannot support the development, production, and export of reactors at a rate that competes with their authoritarian counterparts. From the 1960s through the 1990s, the United States supplied much of the world's nuclear manufacturing, reactor designs, and supply chain expertise. China's and Russia's ambitious, state-backed funding models, however, have edged out U.S. companies. U.S. government policy bears some responsibility: export laws have erected onerous barriers to countries interested in purchasing U.S. reactors. Before the United States transfers nuclear technologies and materials to another country, it demands that the partner country sign a peaceful nuclear energy cooperation agreement, referred to as a 123 agreement. Such agreements adhere to strict nonproliferation safeguards, but Washington often seeks additional commitments—such as requiring partners to forgo enriching their own uranium or reprocessing spent fuel that can make U.S. technology less attractive to potential buyers.

Furthermore, U.S. regulatory inefficiencies act as a bottleneck to progress. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission often takes five years or more to approve a reactor project and imposes burdensome fee structures on applicants. Kairos Power's Hermes reactor is the only licensed SMR actively under construction in the United States; this slow pursuit of SMRs reflects long-standing institutional challenges at the NRC, including an internal culture that has struggled to align with innovation.



The race to provide advanced nuclear power is not simply a symbolic technological competition. It is a geopolitical struggle for influence and economic competitiveness in a rapidly electrifying world. Beijing and Moscow will steadily gain more soft power as the countries with which they have nuclear energy deals are incentivized to align with their economic ambitions and political ideals. This is happening already: for instance, Rosatom is expanding Hungary's nuclear power capacity; nuclear energy now generates about 44 percent of the country's electricity. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban vehemently opposed including Russian nuclear power in the EU's sanctions on Russian nuclear energy, achieving an exemption.

In the future, countries could even use their leverage over the reactors they build to coerce or punish buyer nations by turning the reactors off or seizing them. Such a threat is hardly without precedent. In 2014, Russia shut off its gas supplies to Ukraine for months after annexing the Crimean Peninsula, causing economic and social disruption. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity cannot be stockpiled, making the shutdown of a nuclear power plant devastating for a nation's power grid and economic stability.

The United States is not the only country falling behind. Other major powers with advanced nuclear industries have not done enough to offer the accessible financing and turnkey project models that developing countries need. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development requires its member states to impose higher interest rates and longer repayment durations for nuclear projects than China and Russia do. And most multilateral development finance institutions, such as the World Bank, refuse to help fund the construction of nuclear plants. All these barriers force developing nations to turn to Chinese and Russian nuclear export programs.

Maintaining geopolitical balance in the nuclear energy market requires the United States and its allies to adopt more competitive strategies, particularly when it comes to SMRs. In July 2024, the U.S. Congress passed the ADVANCE Act, which aims to modernize nuclear regulation, accelerate licensing, and support advanced reactor deployment. It requires the NRC to update its regulatory framework and authorizes funding for these goals. The act is a good start, and Congress should use its provisions to maximize efforts directed toward SMR development. It should also consider adopting greater flexibility in how it negotiates enrichment and reprocessing terms: rather than insisting partners fully renounce these capabilities, Washington could allow them under strict oversight, balancing nonproliferation objectives with the need to compete in the nuclear export market.

These steps, however, will not be enough. The main problem for Western countries is how to equal or better the efficient construction and funding that China and Russia now offer. Last year, the energy analyst and former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state Todd Moss proposed that the World Bank hire experts who can evaluate nuclear energy within recipient countries' energy mix, but the idea will likely still face opposition from the bank's antinuclear shareholders. A separate proposed initiative to make nuclear energy financing more accessible and competitive, the International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure, began too broadly by asking 50 countries to create an entirely new financial institution and has now stalled.

It would be more promising to establish a global nuclear energy cooperative that, to start, coordinates policies between a small and politically aligned group of pro-nuclear nations committed to accelerating strategic nuclear power exports. Existing partnerships such as the Sapporo 5—composed of Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have already begun to strengthen and diversify the world's nuclear fuel supply chain. A similar kind of collaboration is urgently needed for power plant construction. This cooperation could be coordinated by a new agency or a dedicated arm of an established institution such as the International Atomic Energy Agency; it should leverage each country's strengths, such as Canada's preeminence in uranium mining and the United States' extensive reactor design portfolio. A cooperative could also boost each member country's domestic nuclear industry—including its ability to develop SMRs—by encouraging the sharing of expertise and infrastructure. And it would afford its members leverage to reform development finance frameworks that exclude nuclear power projects from consideration.

Such an organization could offer competitive funding and technologies tailored to developing nations, rivaling Chinese and Russian deals. By pooling their strengths, democracies can help address emerging economies' rising demand for power while enhancing their own energy security and diplomatic independence. The nuclear power contracts arranged by such an organization could even best those offered by China and Russia. They could offer developing countries a greater stake in operating their reactors, including by investing more resources in training the local workforce and helping buyer countries establish strong nuclear energy regulatory frameworks. A cooperative could also strengthen public-private partnerships, bolstering support for private advanced nuclear technology companies to accelerate economies of scale and resulting cost declines. And a nuclear energy cooperative would provide the West with a crucial platform to continue influencing nonproliferation safeguards by creating better balanced technology export standards that maintain nuclear safety without deterring buyers.

Developing nations may nonetheless decide to source nuclear energy technologies from China and Russia. But they need to be able to make a real choice. The United States and its allies still have a chance to counterbalance China's and Russia's expanding influence over the nuclear energy sector. The stakes are rising daily: the decisions that Washington and its allies make now, in the early days of a new nuclear age, will dictate the direction of energy security, the global economy, and the shape of power for decades to come.

Live Updates


• Massive power outage: Large parts of Spain and Portugal experienced major power outages, shutting off traffic lights and causing chaos at travel hubs. In Spain, all rail traffic has come to a halt and in Portugal, authorities are warning against any unnecessary travel due to the risk of traffic lights failing.
    


            • Restoration efforts underway: Spanish power grid operator Red Electrica said power is starting to return to some parts of the country. Earlier, it said restoring power could take between six and 10 hours.
    


            • Cause of outage: It's not clear what caused the sudden blackout, but “all resources are being dedicated to solving it,” the national power grid operator in Spain said.
    


            The supply of electricity has been restored to parts of Spain and Portugal, the countries' grid operators said in an update Monday evening, hours after a massive and unexplained power outage sent the entire Iberian Peninsula into darkness.
    


            Portugal's grid operator, Rene Electrica Nacional (REN), said production has been restored at the Castelo de Bode hydroelectric power station and the Tapada de Outeiro thermoelectric plant.
    


            With those stations now active, energy consumption is gradually resuming in Portugal — first in the areas surrounding those power plants and progressively farther away, REN said.
    


            Meanwhile, Red Electrica (REE), Spain's grid operator, said electricity has been restored in several regions, including Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque country and Andalucia.
    


            There is no conclusive information on what caused the power outage that has affected Spain, Portugal and parts of France, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Monday.
    


            He said officials were trying to determine the cause and had not yet ruled out any theories, but he urged the public to avoid speculation.
    


            Power has already been restored in parts of the north and south, he said, adding that the blackout has not resulted in any security problems.
    


            Sánchez urged people to use phones “responsibly,” meaning making calls only when necessary and to keeping them brief to ease strain on the system.
    


            “The government is working, and will continue to work, to learn the cause of this power outage. Right now, the priority is to work to restore normality as soon as possible,” he said.
    


            Large swaths of Spain and Portugal are still in the dark after a blackout on Monday.
    


            Flights at major airports and trains in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, and even some sporting events were impacted. Tennis fans at the Madrid Open filed out of courts after the outage caused play to be suspended.
    


            Here's what it looked like across the region:
    


            Although the cause of the massive power outage in Spain and Portugal is not yet clear, there are “no indications” of a cyberattack, said Antonio Costa, president of the European Council.
    


            Costa, who was prime minister of Portugal between 2015 and 2024, said he spoke today with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro.
    


            “Grid operators in both countries are working on finding the cause, and on restoring the electricity supply,” Costa wrote on X.
    


            “At this point, there are no indications of any cyberattack,” he added.
    


            Spanish electricity provider Red Electrica said power is returning to some parts of the country.
    


                    “There is already electricity supply in areas of Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country, Galicia, Asturias, Navarre, Castile and Leon, Extremadura and Andalusia,” it said in a statement.
                





Metro system: Separately, Spain's transportation minister Oscar Puente said medium- and long-distance trains will likely not resume service until tomorrow.
    


            He said trains will need to be serviced to ensure they are safe to operate after the blackout in a post on social media.



            Some Madrid residents are flocking to grocery stores to stock up on essential supplies, as a power outage has left millions without electricity across the Iberian Peninsula.
    


            In a video from Reuters, people can be seen stocking up on vital items, such as milk and toilet paper. A number of shelves appear to have been completely cleared.
    


            One shopper, butcher Oliver Ortiz, told Reuters that he was buying non-perishable items.
    


            “Things that won't expire, canned goods, a little bit, just in case,” he added.
    


            It is not yet clear when power will be restored. Spanish electricity provider, Red Electrica told broadcaster La Sexta on Monday that it could take anywhere between six and 10 hours.
    


            “I don't know, we've been without electricity for a while now,” student Luis Miguel Arroyo told Reuters.
    


                    “We don't know how long it's going to be, so we are buying what's possible to buy for the moment.”
                





            Madrid's firefighters have carried out 174 “elevator interventions” across the city on Monday, its Emergency Information Office said in a post on X, as swathes of Spain and Portugal lost power amid a major electricity outage.
    


            Municipal workers are taking on double shifts to help those affected by the blackout, the office said, bringing fuel to “critical centers” and working in day care centers and senior care homes.
    


            Separately, Madrid's bus system remains operational, the Spanish capital's Emergency Information Office said in a post on X Monday afternoon.
    


            The city's tunnels will be closed to the public throughout the day, the emergency office said, but will remain open for emergency services.
    


            Spain's nuclear sites are safe amid a major power outage across large parts of the Iberian Peninsula on Monday, according to the country's nuclear energy agency, the Nuclear Safety Council (CSN).
    


            Nuclear power plants shut down as they are designed to do when they lose power, CSN said, adding that “backup diesel generators fired up and are maintaining safe conditions for the reactors.”
    


            Spain has seven operational nuclear reactors across five different sites, according to CSN.
    


            All Spanish train services are suspended until further notice, the country's Railway Infrastructure and Traffic Department (Adif) said Monday, hours into the power outage that has hit much of the country.
    


                    “Passengers with planned journeys are asked not to go to the stations. We will continue to provide updates,” the department said in a post on X.
                





            The power outage that left millions without electricity across the Iberian Peninsula likely originated in Spain, the Portuguese prime minister said.
    


            Luis Montenegro said the government did not yet know what caused the power outage, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” the problem originated in Spain.
    


            “We have our intelligence services also trying to get to the bottom of what may have been at the root of the incident.”
    


            When asked if it could have been a cyberattack, the prime minister said “nothing is off the table,” but said there was “no indication pointing in that direction.”
    


            Spanish authorities have not yet said what caused the blackout or where it originated.
    


            Traffic in Lisbon is “overall chaotic” after a major power outage on Monday, a local resident in Portugal's capital told CNN.
    


            Speaking to CNN's Becky Anderson, Madalena Malveiro described how the city has been affected by the lack of power, with many supermarkets closing and traffic lining the streets.
    


            Traffic lights in Lisbon have ceased to operate, Malveiro said, and commuters are consequently getting stuck in traffic as a result. “People are kind of confused, (wondering) how long this is going to last,” she said, adding that people are also more “agitated” than normal.
    


            Power has been partially restored across Spain but experts are still responding to Monday's massive power outage, the national grid operator said.
    


            “Voltage has now been restored at substations in several areas in the north, south, and west of the peninsula,” Red Electrica said in a statement.
    


                    “We continue to work with all resources to restore power as soon as possible throughout the entire territory. The main objective of the restoration work in this phase is to restore power to the generating units.”
                





            Meanwhile, Madrid's Mayor Isabel Díaz Ayuso urged the national government to deploy the army to help deal with the outage.
    


            Díaz Ayuso said the local government had deployed “all resources available to address the ongoing emergency situation” and requested the Spanish government activate the army “to cooperate in this crisis.”
    


            Barcelona's El Prat Airport, Catalonia's primary international airport, is “operating correctly with self-service,” according to the Government of Catalonia, the body that manages the autonomous region within Spain.
    


            Most scheduled flights at Barcelona El Prat Airport (BCN) appear to be departing as normal or with minor delays, according to the airport's official website.
    


            The Catalonia government also said nearby chemical industries in Tarragona are safe, hospitals and primary care centers are open, and schools and educational centers are operating as normal.
    


            Power is out across large parts of Spain and Portugal, and already misinformation is spreading as to what caused the outage.
    


            Some outlets are reporting a fire in the southwest of France is to blame, but French electricity providers have denied the claim. Portugal's National Cybersecurity Center also said there was no evidence of a cyberattack being behind the power outages, state news agency LUSA reported.
    


            While the exact cause remains unclear, governments have convened emergency meetings and electricity providers are working to restore power as soon as possible.
    


Here's what we know so far: 



            Electricity supplies could take anywhere between six to 10 hours to restore, Spanish electricity provider Red Electrica told broadcaster La Sexta Monday.
    


                    “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process, the total reestablishment of the electrical supply, will take several hours, we could be talking about six to 10 hours, if everything goes well, until we reestablish supply to every last customer,” Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Spain's Red Eléctrica said.
                





            As officials work to restore power to large parts of Spain affected by the massive outage, Spanish electricity provider Red Electrica is offering real-time data on the country's electricity supply.
    


            In this graph, the yellow line appears to shows a massive drop off at about 12:30 p.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET) when power went out across the country.
    


            Spain's “entire national electricity grid was cut off” at 12:30 p.m. local time (6:30 a.m. ET), national railway company Renfe said on X, causing its trains to stop and not depart from any stations.
    


            Renfe runs more than 1,000 trains per day, transporting 1.3 million passengers across 5,000 journeys, according to its website.
    


            Renfe's trains include public rail services “that the state considers essential,” with a travel fleet that includes AVE (high-speed), Avlo, Alvia, Euromed and Intercity trains.
    


            Parts of France's Basque Country, in the southwest of the country, were briefly impacted by a “small power cut,” a spokesperson for France's electricity transmission operator RTE told CNN Monday.
    


            “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” said Emilie Grandidier.
    


            “We are now focusing our efforts on helping Spain restore its power,” she added.
    


            Spain's hospitals have backup power systems to ensure the flow of power, according to the country's health ministry, which said it was monitoring the situation and ready to respond to any incident.
    


            Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian peninsula, and in parts of France, late on Monday morning.
    


            Spanish power grid operator Red Electrica said it was working with energy companies to restore power, only some of which had been regained in the north and south by the afternoon. “The causes are being analyzed and all resources are being dedicated to solving it,” it said.
    


CNN's Rob Picheta contributed reporting to this post. 



            Severe power outages have affected the Spanish capital, Madrid, as well as other major cities across the country, including Barcelona, Seville and Valencia.
    


            Speaking on state television, Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services in the case of extreme emergencies. He also urged people to stay clear of the roads for emergency workers.
    


            Madrid's Metro said in a statement that all service had been interrupted due to a “lack of electric supply.”
    


            Local media reported that parts of the metro had been evacuated.
    


            Meanwhile, Madrid's Barajas Airport, the main international airport serving the capital, is reportedly dealing with a blackout, according to local media, with flight tracker services showing flight cancellations and delays.
    


            “Power has not yet been restored to Barajas Airport,” according to El Mundo, Spain's second-largest daily newspaper.
    


            Play has been suspended at the 2025 Mutua Madrid Tennis tournament after the Spanish capital was hit by a major power outage on Monday.
    


            “We are working to restore normality as soon as possible,” the tournament wrote in a post on social media.



            Grigor Dmitrov and opponent Jacob Fearnley were forced off the court mid-game after overhead cameras lost power and the scoreboard went dark, Reuters reported Monday.
    


            The Madrid Open, a clay court event, uses electronic line calling instead of linespeople.
    


            Among other players expected to take the court at the tournament today is women's world number one player Aryna Sabalenka from Belarus.
    


            Of the eight women's singles matches scheduled Monday, two of those were completed before the outage. On the men's side, two singles matches and one doubles match were underway when the power went out. The ATP Tour said the outage happened at 12:34 p.m. local time.
    


This post has been updated with more details about the Madrid Open.



            A power outage hit the entire Iberian peninsula at around 11.33 a.m. local time (6:33 a.m. ET) Monday, Portuguese national electricity grid Rede Electrica Nacional (REN) confirmed.
    


                    “All plans to restore the energy supply in stages are being activated, in coordination with European energy producers and operators,” the grid said, adding that the “possible causes of this incident are being assessed.”
                





            The Iberian peninsula is in southwestern Europe, and REN says some parts of France are also affected by the outage.
    


            CNN is reaching out to authorities in France for more information.
    


            In Madrid, traffic piled up on the roads after the lights went out due to a massive power outage that affected parts of Spain and Portugal.
    


            “I was driving and suddenly there was no traffic lights … It was a bit of a jungle,” Luis Ibáñez Jiménez told CNN from Madrid, Spain.
    


            “I saw a massive bus coming, and I had to accelerate a lot to go past it.”
    


            Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon airport, in Portugal, says hundreds of people are stood in the dark in queues after power went out inside the Humberto Delgado airport.
    


            There's no running water from sinks in bathrooms or water bottle stations inside the airport, the air conditioning has gone out and shops inside are only accepting cash, she told CNN.
    


            Portugal's police force warned that traffic lights and street lighting are at risk of failing as power is cut.
    


                    “Reduce your speed and pay extra attention,” they said, instructing people to avoid unnecessary journeys. “Prioritise safe driving: your calmness saves lives,” their statement added.
                





            A massive power outage has knocked out electricity across parts of Spain and Portugal, shutting off traffic lights and causing chaos at airports, train stations and on the roads.
    


            Spanish power grid operator Red Electrica said it was working with energy companies to restore power. “The causes are being analyzed and all resources are being dedicated to solving it,” it said. “We will continue to inform you.”

            Spain and Portugal are racing the setting sun as they respond to a massive, unexplained power outage that knocked out traffic lights, caused chaos on roads and in airports, and threatened to plunge tens of millions of people into darkness on Monday.
    


            Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian Peninsula, and in parts of France, shortly after midday. It could be several hours until power is fully restored, Spain's grid operator said, meaning families and businesses around the country could be without energy come nightfall.
    


            The outage took out lighting and power sockets, and caused subway systems to suddenly fail. Some power began to trickle back across Spain hours later, but efforts to fully revive the grid and to identify the cause have not yet been successful.
    


            In Madrid, traffic piled up on the roads after the lights went out. “I was driving and suddenly there was no traffic lights… It was a bit of a jungle,” Luis Ibáñez Jiménez told CNN. “I saw a massive bus coming, and I had to accelerate a lot to go past it.”
    


            The cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs were shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of around 60 million people, hastily arranged emergency meetings to co-ordinate a response.
    


            Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to clear the roads for emergency workers. Later in the day, Madrid's emergency services provider urged the country's government to declare a national emergency, and local leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso asked the country to deploy the army.
    


            Portugal's grid operator said restoring power was a “complex operation.” By Monday evening, both Portugal's and Spain's grid operators said the supply of energy was gradually being restored in pockets of both countries.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said authorities are still not sure what caused the power outage. Earlier, Antonio Costa – president of the European Council and Portugal's former prime minister – said although the cause of the outage is not clear, there are “no indications” of a cyberattack.
    


            Efforts could stretch into the night. “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process – the total reestablishment of the electrical supply – will take several hours, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red Eléctrica, Spain's national grid operator, told broadcaster La Sexta.
    


            “We could be talking about six to 10 hours, if everything goes well, until we reestablish supply to every last customer,” said Prieto, who was speaking in the early afternoon.
    


            Portugal's Prime Minister blamed his neighboring nation for the scenes. Luis Montenegro said his government did not yet know what caused the cut, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” that the problem started in Spain.
    


            Monday's blackout hit a huge and busy swathe of southern Europe. Dozens of Iberian cities, like Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia, are major hubs for transport, finance and tourism. Two of the five busiest airports in the European Union in 2023 were Madrid's and Barcelona's, according to EU data.
    


            For a few hours, modern routines were suspended: cash replaced card payments, police officers used arm signals to direct traffic, and restaurants, supermarkets and stores closed their doors. Madrid's firefighters carried out 174 “elevator interventions” across the city on Monday, its Emergency Information Office said, and some shoppers stocked up on essentials and on canned goods.
    


            The worst-case scenarios appear to have been averted, at least in the first hours of the blackout. Spain's nuclear sites were declared operational and safe, while Portugal's National Institute for Medical Emergencies said it had “activated its contingency plan,” running its telephone and IT systems through a back-up generator. Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there.
    


            But travel was hit harder. Flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Portugal's flag carrier TAP Air Portugal told people not to travel to the airport until further notice.
    


            Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in lines, with no air conditioning or running water. Shops were only accepting cash, she told CNN.
    


            Trains were also suspended in Spain. And darkness suddenly descended in subway tunnels; video posted on social media showed blackened subway cars stuck in standstill on platforms in Madrid, where the metro was suspended and entrances to stations were taped off.
    


            Sporting events were impacted too. Tennis fans at the Madrid Open filed out of courts after the outage caused play to be suspended.
    


            Some parts of southern France, near the Spanish border, felt a more sporadic impact.
    


            Emilie Grandidie, a spokeswoman for France's electricity transmission operator RTE, told CNN there was “a small power cut” in the French Basque Country; “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” she said.
    


            For several hours on Monday, tens of millions of people were asking each other when power would return, and why it was knocked out in the first place.
    


            Neither question was easy to answer. But once power returns, it could still take days to untangle the damage caused by Monday's worrying blackout.
    


            Spain's transportation minister said medium and long-distance trains won't resume service until at least Tuesday, and the impact of a huge backlog in flights could stretch throughout the week.

Princeton senior Danielle Shapiro joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss how anti-Israel protesters disrupted a campus lecture by a former Israeli prime minister, shouting anti-Semitic chants and targeting students. 

EXCLUSIVE – Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called on his alma mater, Princeton University, to dismiss a former high-level Iranian regime official because he is allegedly making students feel unsafe amid recent outbreaks of antisemitism at the New Jersey university.

The ex-official for the Islamic Republic of Iran, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, who is a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at the university, is under pressure on many fronts from congressional representatives, Princeton students and experts on antisemitism. 

""Mousavian is closely linked to the Iranian regime and to the regime's campaigns of terrorism and murder. His presence at Princeton makes students feel justifiably afraid for their safety. Princeton's decision to keep employing him shows they care less about their students, and more about providing a platform for pro-regime and anti-American propaganda. That kind of reckless institutional ideological bias is exactly why the Trump administration is reassessing federal funding for Princeton,"" Cruz told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement.

ACTIVIST SPEAKS OUT AFTER IRAN TRIES TO KILL HER

Fox News Digital previously reported that Mousavian expressed support for the U.S.-designated terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, and appeared to pay tribute to the global Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani in 2020 when he attended his funeral. 

President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike to eliminate Soleimani in January 2020 for his role in the murders of over 600 American military personnel in the Middle East and his planning of new terrorist attacks.

Mousavian has declined to renounce his support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran's fatwa (religious decree) to assassinate the British-American writer Salman Rushdie. 

A Hezbollah flag was on display during a Princeton student protest encampment against Israel last year. The Iran-backed Hezbollah was responsible for a 1983 bombing that murdered 241 U.S. military members in Beirut.

Maximillian Meyer, president of Princeton Tigers for Israel, and an undergraduate at the university, told Fox News Digital, ""I commend Sen. Cruz for raising urgent concerns about Princeton's employment of Mousavian, whose career has been defined by shilling for the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Credible reports linking Mousavian to the oversight of Iranian dissident assassinations in Europe – alongside his endorsement of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie – are deeply alarming.""

INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GIVEN NEW BLUEPRINT ON WAYS TO WEAKEN IRAN: 'UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY'

Fox News Digital first reported in November 2023 that the House Committee on Education and the Workforce launched an investigation into Mousavian's role in advancing the interests of the clerical regime in Tehran.

During Mousavian's tenure as Iran's ambassador to Germany, he was in charge of the embassy that a German court found ""served as the ‘headquarters' for the planning of the 1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents at the Greek restaurant Mykonos in Berlin.""

However, the former Iranian ambassador previously told Fox News Digital that ""This accusation is a big lie,"" and ""The 398-page verdict is published, and everyone can have access to it. The Berlin court verdict does not contain any direct or indirect allegations against me. German authorities never forced me to leave the country.… I have been a frequent visitor to Germany.""

Yet, Iranian dissidents and human rights experts uncovered testimony from Abolghasem Mesbahi, a former senior-level Iranian intelligence official, who told the Berlin court during the Mykonos trial, ""Mousavian participated in most of the [Iranian regime's] crimes that took place in Europe.""

Mousavian did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries, WhatsApp messages and telephone calls for this article.

Meyer, the Princeton undergraduate student, said, ""Anyone who has served in senior roles for the repressive Islamic Republic of Iran poses a clear threat to American national security. His continued employment at Princeton is a damning indictment of the anti-Americanism festering within so-called ‘elite' institutions.""

Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber, who recently said he would defy Trump's efforts to stop antisemitism via federal funding cuts to the wealthy university, did not respond to Fox News Digital email press queries and telephone calls about Mousavian.

Fox News Digital recently reported that pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian agitators stormed a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at Princeton, sparking criticism from Jewish students at Princeton.

In a statement to Fox News Digital over the incident, Eisgruber said he was ""appalled"" at reports of antisemitic language used during Bennett's visit. He added, ""Such behavior is reprehensible and intolerable. The University is investigating and will pursue disciplinary measures as appropriate, to the extent any members of the Princeton University community are implicated.""

It is unclear if Eisgruber suspended or expelled students who prevented Bennett from speaking. Mousavian has faced criticism for stoking antisemitism since Hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans. Eisgruber has gone silent about Mousavian's actions.

A Fox News Digital examination of Mousavian's X account shows a high number of Persian and English posts attacking the Jewish state, including comparing Israel with Nazi Germany. The comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany is classified as modern antisemitism, according to the widely accepted definition formulated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. 

IRAN'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TEHRAN'S ADVANCING NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the former chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, asked Eisgruber in a statement to Fox News Digital: Why does the university continue to protect Mousavian at a time of raging antisemitism and what is he still doing there? 

Cooper further asked, in the context of the reported antisemitic mob attack on Bennett and Mousavian's alleged ties to the murders carried out by Iran's regime, why can't ""the President of Princeton connect the dots""?

Cooper said on Eisgruber's watch ""It is a shameful chapter that must end the right way."" Cooper accused Eisgruber of ""stoic silence or indifference to antisemitism"" and ""stonewalling"" efforts to hold Mousavian accountable for his alleged crimes and antisemitism. Cooper continued that Eisgruber owes it to Jewish students and faculty, Iranian-Americans, and Iranian dissidents to answer basic questions about Mousavian.

Eisgruber has not obstructed any law enforcement efforts to investigate Mousavian's alleged crimes.

Cooper also called on Princeton and Mousavian to submit his Ph.D. for examination. Fox News Digital has learned that neither Princeton University nor the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, where Mousavian allegedly obtained his Ph.D. in 2002, were willing to produce a copy of his dissertation. 

Mousavian was the head of the Foreign Relations Committee of Iran's National Security Council (1997-2005), according to his Princeton webpage.

Gary Hughes, a spokesman for the University of Kent, told Fox News Digital, ""Data protection principle also means that neither myself nor any other colleague across the University can disclose personal data about this or any other current or former student."" 

He said the university's Freedom of Information (FOI) office can answer the request. The FOI office denied a request and later said after Fox News Digital appealed that, ""We are currently conducting an internal review in relation to your request."" 

A British-Iranian man sought to obtain Mousavian's Ph.D. in January, according to email correspondence obtained by Fox News Digital. Kent University's Open Research team wrote in one email, ""I am afraid we have no record of Mr. Seyed Hossein Mousavian's thesis in the library catalogue."" Fox News Digital searches for Mousavian's Ph.D. in American, British and German academic databases showed no results. 

The Swedish-Iranian author Iraj Mesdaghi told Fox News Digital that he sought to obtain Mousavian's Ph.D. in 2013. The University of Kent declined to produce it. Mesdaghi wrote about the great lengths he went to in order to secure access to Mousavian's alleged Ph.D. on his website, including contact with the FOI office. 

Shirley M. Tilghman, the former president of Princeton University when Mousavian was hired in 2009, declined to answer a press query about whether she vetted Mousavian and his alleged Ph.D.

While Heather Graham feels confident in the choices she's made over the last 55 years of her life, she often wonders what life would've been like had she taken a different path. 

In a new interview, the ""Austin Powers"" star opens up about her conscious decision not to have children and admitted that she sometimes questions her choice. 

""I think I've had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid? I guess I would say 80% of the time I feel glad I don't have kids, and I feel free and really good about it, and maybe 20% of the time I wonder what would it be like. You just have to appreciate the life you have,"" she told The Guardian.

""I do think it's awesome now that more women are expressing their desire to not have kids,"" the actress and director added. ""Again, she says, it is almost people pleasing on a big scale. The culture says: ‘You need to have kids.' But why? If you're not being a people pleaser, what do you really want?""

""I think I've had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid?""

This isn't the first time Graham has expressed her feelings about not pursuing parenthood. 

""I think we all have different paths,"" she told People magazine in 2023. ""You just have to embrace the one that you're on. If, somehow, I had had kids, I'm sure that would've been cool. But at the moment, not having kids, I do feel free. And I get a lot of sleep. That is pretty great.""

""I do feel like, as a woman, culturally, you're not allowed to say, 'I didn't want to have kids.' Because it's like, 'What's wrong with you?'"" she explained. ""I think as a man it's like, 'Oh yeah, cool, you didn't want to have kids.' Now, women are getting more free to just make their own choices.""

These days, Graham – whose new movie ""Chosen Family"" premiered last year – said she's learned the importance of dropping the ""people-pleaser"" label. 

""I realized, no, actually I can just ask myself, ‘What do I want?' and make myself happy,"" she told The Guardian. ""I wish I could have had this when I was 20 or 15. If I wasn't trying to please other people, what would I have done? There were moments where I feel like I could have stood up for myself more,"" she said.

""It didn't feel like a healthy dynamic. I stopped talking to them and, I have to say, that was a huge relief,"" she told the outlet. ""I felt like, at that moment, my life opened up with a freedom. I didn't need to please them.""

""I feel like I wasn't brought up to have a deep sense of self-esteem, and I think as I detached from my family, I built my own sense of self-esteem,"" she added. ""Sort of like a detective, I went through my past and looked at how I developed certain ways of thinking that weren't the healthiest, and basically just went on a journey to be happier.""

""Before, I was more: ‘What do other people think?'"" she said. ""Now I'm just like, f--- it.""

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gives retirement announcement from home in Springfield where he announced his first Senate bid.

Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton picked up an endorsement from Sen. Tammy Duckworth in the primary to succeed the retiring Sen. Dick Durbin. 

Stratton launched her campaign last week after Durbin, an 80-year-old who was first elected to the Senate in 1996, announced he would not seek re-election in 2026. She was endorsed last week by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

""Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor -- she's demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people,"" Duckworth, who represented Illinois, told Politico.

""I'd be honored to have her by my side in the Senate as we work to deliver real results for Illinoisans, and I'm proud to endorse her campaign,"" she added.

In her campaign launch video, Stratton said, ""Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trying to distract us to create such a mess that we don't even know where to start. But in Washington, they're still doing the same old things they've always done, and that old playbook isn't working."" 

Stratton described herself as the daughter of a teacher and Navy veteran from the South Side of Chicago, and a mother of four. 

She told Politico that she was ""honored"" by Duckworth's endorsement and that ""Tammy is a true leader for Illinois who doesn't back down from a challenge.""

The outlet also reported that Stratton had previously appeared alongside Duckworth to support the Asian American community during Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Last Wednesday, Durbin said, ""The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy."" 

""I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch. So, I am announcing today that I will not be seeking re-election at the end of my term,"" he added.

Durbin becomes the fourth Democrat in the Senate whose term is up at the end of next year who decided against seeking re-election in the 2026 midterms, joining Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Tina Smith of Minnesota.

Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, shares why a low-glycemic index diet is essential for healthy glucose levels and reduced inflammation.

As Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications continue to grow in popularity for weight loss, a concoction dubbed ""oatzempic"" is trending.

The blended beverage, which consists of oats, lime juice, water and sometimes cinnamon, has been described on social media as a ""weight-loss drink.""

Some TikTok users have shared their own experiences with oatzempic.

POPULAR COFFEE ALTERNATIVE MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER, SAY EXPERTS

After 24 days of consistently drinking the beverage, TikTok user @fred_ddy92 reported that it's ""definitely working"" in terms of helping him lose weight.

The content creator stressed that it's ""not a meal replacement"" — but said it does make him feel full.

Registered dietitian Sara Riehm, a certified specialist in obesity and weight management at Orlando Health Center for Health Improvement, shared her thoughts in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""While it's not likely to yield much weight loss on its own, it could be a helpful tool as part of a larger, more comprehensive weight-loss plan,"" she said.

CHICK-FIL-A FOOD AND EMPLOYEES HELPED MAN LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE HIS LIFE

Oatzempic is not likely to be effective as a solo tool for weight loss, Riehm reiterated, but it could be part of a healthy diet and exercise program. 

""Oatzempic only becomes dangerous when you consume it as your sole source of nutrition,"" she said. ""It should be added as a supplement to your intake, not a substitute.""

Oats are full of soluble fiber, the dietitian noted, which slows digestion and ""keeps us feeling fuller for longer.""

""Starting your day with a soluble fiber food source (or drink like this) could help you stay satiated and make it easier to make healthier choices throughout the day,"" Riehm said. 

""The cinnamon adds some nice flavor, but I'd say it's OK to skip the lime juice.""

DUBAI CHOCOLATE SOLD AT COSTCO SPARKS POTENTIAL PISTACHIO SHORTAGE

While some experts claim that lime juice can speed up metabolism, Riehm said there ""isn't much scientific evidence to support this claim — especially in the amount recommended for this drink.""

She would consider adding an oatzempic-inspired drink to breakfast if there isn't already enough soluble fiber, like whole grains or fruit, the expert said. 

A dietitian called oatzempic ""a good, quick option"" for those who don't eat breakfast. (iStock)

""If you aren't consuming breakfast at all, this is also a good, quick option,"" she said. 

""It's hard to make good decisions when we're hungry, so this is a great way to set yourself up for success with your nutrition choices throughout the rest of the day.""

RESTAURANT OFFERS FOOD DISCOUNT TO  'SKINNY' CUSTOMERS WHO CAN SQUEEZE THROUGH BARS

Robin DeCicco, a certified holistic nutritionist in New York, told Fox News Digital that she's more skeptical of the trend as a form of weight loss.

""This is not a healthy way to promote weight loss.""

""People will do anything for a quick fix and to avoid doing the work of actually changing behaviors and learning how to eat for individual health,"" she said.

""This is not a healthy way to promote weight loss,"" she asserted. ""It's another way to avoid learning how to eat nutritionally dense foods consistently, move more and sit less, and focus on making healthier lifestyle choices.""

While she agreed that oats contain fiber, which promotes satiety and blood sugar control and can ward off cravings for starchy and sugary foods, DeCicco said that isn't enough to warrant the use of the drink for weight loss.

""Maybe this is helping certain people prevent sugar cravings and eat less because they were previously not including any fiber in their diet, but I think it's a big reach to say that half a cup of oats is the reason people are losing weight,"" she said.

""If the American public started to eat more fiber, they would absolutely feel fuller, snack less, weigh less and prevent more disease."" (iStock)

She does recommend increasing fiber intake, however.

""If the American public started to eat more fiber, they would absolutely feel fuller, snack less, weigh less and prevent more disease,"" DeCicco said.

If oatzempic does have any effect on weight loss, it could be because it simply has fewer calories than a ""regular"" meal, DeCicco suggested.

""If you reduce calories from even one meal a day, you're more likely to lose weight,"" she said.

""However, this is not a long-term solution to weight loss. It's not sustainable to drink liquid meals for long periods of time, so most [people] will gain the weight back.""

""It's not sustainable to drink liquid meals for long periods of time, so most [people] will gain the weight back,"" one expert said. (iStock)

The drink also ""falls short in many areas, such as not including antioxidants from vegetables or fruit or any good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids.""

""Long-term weight loss is individually based,"" DeCicco said.

It requires ""consistency and a change in habits and behaviors.""

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday thanked North Korea for sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Moscow's war against Ukraine and vowed not to forget their sacrifices.

Putin's comments came just hours after North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed troops to fight Ukrainian forces.

Russia said two days earlier that its troops had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized last year. Ukrainian officials have denied Russia's claim and said that the operation in certain areas of Kursk is ongoing.

In a statement, Putin praised North Korean troops who he said fought ""shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters, defended our Motherland as their own.""

""The Russian people will never forget the heroism of the DPRK special forces,"" Putin said. ""We will always honor the heroes who gave their lives for Russia, for our common freedom, fighting side by side with their Russian brothers in arms.""

Earlier Monday, North Korea's Central Military Commission said the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, had sent troops to Russia to ""annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces."" North Korean troops eventually made ""an important contribution"" to Russia seizing the border territory, the commission said.

While this was North Korea's first official confirmation that its troops were deployed to Russia, it has repeatedly expressed its unwavering support of Russia's war against Ukraine.

U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence officials have said North Korea deployed 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall in its first involvement in a major armed conflict since the Korean War in the early 1950s.

Putin and Kim said the deployment of North Korean troops was made under a mutual defense treaty signed in June 2024 that requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked.

The two U.S. adversaries have moved significantly closer to each other in recent years.

In addition to its deployment of troops, North Korea has been supplying a large number of conventional weapons to Russia. South Korea and the U.S. are concerned that Russia could reward North Korea with military and economic assistance, including by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can bolster its nuclear weapons program.

Kim citing North Korea's role in Russia regaining control of the Kursk region suggests his urgent desire to receive what he wants from Russia, including its sensitive military technologies and a solid security commitment to North Korea, according to Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia could provide military assistance to North Korea if necessary in accordance with the defense treaty, Russian state media reported.

North Korea and Russia did not disclose how many North Korean soldiers were sent to Russia or how many casualties they suffered. But last month, South Korea's military assessed that roughly 4,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in the Russia-Ukraine war. The South Korean military also said North Korea sent about 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year.

South Korea's Unification Ministry on Monday called on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Russia immediately, arguing that the North's support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine poses a grave provocation to international security. Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoungsam also called the North's deployment of troops ""an act against humanity.""

If Russia's retaking of Kursk is confirmed, it would deprive Ukraine of key leverage in U.S.-brokered efforts to negotiate an end to the war by exchanging its gains for some Russia-occupied land in Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he doubts Putin wants to end the war. Just a day before, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were ""very close to a deal.""

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) will not seek reelection in 2026 and will step down from his position as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee due to a recurrence of cancer.

Connolly, 75, announced in November last year that he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. He said in a statement after “grueling treatments” that the cancer has returned.

“The sun is setting on my time in public service, and this will be my last term in Congress,” Connolly said Monday. “I will be stepping back as Ranking Member of the Oversight Committee soon. With no rancor and a full heart, I move into this final chapter full of pride in what we've accomplished together over 30 years.”

Connolly defeated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in December last year for the ranking membership. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, had been one of several younger Democrats seeking a generational shift in leadership following losses in the 2024 election. However, the Democrats' steering committee selected Connolly, who had the backing of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

The Washington Examiner reached out to Ocasio-Cortez for comment.

Virginia's 11th District has remained in Democratic hands since Connolly's win in 2008, which flipped the seat from red to blue. He won reelection in 2024 with 66.7% of the vote.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, is stepping into the national spotlight this week as a key figure in a landmark Supreme Court battle over religious liberty and public education.

But it's not the kind of attention most Republicans would seek out in the deeply red state, which is also part of the colloquially named Bible Belt.

Drummond, a declared candidate for governor, is seeking to block the creation of the nation's first taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school when justices hear oral arguments on April 30. The consolidated cases before the Supreme Court involve the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, with Drummond urging the justices to uphold a state Supreme Court decision that found the publicly funded school unconstitutional.

While national conservative leaders and school choice advocates rally behind the Catholic virtual school, Drummond has emerged as its fiercest opponent. One of his most discussed talking points opposing the school rests on a slippery slope argument, claiming that if the state allows a Catholic charter school to open, it would be forced to fund “Sharia law or even Satanism.”

If the religious charter school is allowed to proceed in the state, Drummond contends that “the inevitable result will be taxpayer-funded public schools teaching Sharia law, Wicca — even the Church of Satan,” he said in a March 31 post on X.

Drummond's arguments have attempted to appeal to the state's evangelical base, even as Gov. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) has maintained a friendly posture toward religious freedom in the state.

But religious freedom experts who are critical of Drummond's approach say it reeks of fearmongering and hypocrisy, pointing out that Catholic organizations already receive public funds in Oklahoma for hospitals, foster care, and other services. 

“Religious freedom is for everyone. … Charter schools are schools of choice,” said Nicole Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School whose research focuses on education law and religious liberty. “They are designed to give parents options, and the option of a religious education is attractive to many parents.”

Earlier this month, Stitt, who is unable to seek reelection after his second term ends next year, issued an executive order directing state agencies to “root out” laws and regulations that exclude religious individuals or institutions from public programs, funds, and benefits.

Drummond's opposition also puts him sharply at odds with Republican senators such as Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and James Lankford (R-OK) — powerful figures whose endorsements he would likely court in his gubernatorial bid. All three joined a Senate amicus brief urging the court to side against Drummond, arguing that excluding religious organizations from public charter school eligibility “would set a dangerous precedent.”

“Upholding the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act with the included exclusion of religious organizations would set a dangerous precedent, signaling that religious organizations are not welcome in public projects,” the senators wrote in an amicus brief to the high court. “This would not only violate the First Amendment, but it would also deprive society of the valuable contributions that these organizations make.”

Drummond's posture in the case has raised eyebrows in GOP circles, not just for its substance but also its timing as he makes his bid for higher office. Just three weeks ago, Drummond posted a photo at the White House on April 8 after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House.

“The President's decisive leadership on border security and illegal immigration is restoring America's safety, sovereignty, and strength,” Drummond wrote on X.

In Oklahoma, where Trump won every county in the 2024 election, Drummond's break from a conservative consensus is risky both legally and politically.

Religious charter schools have become a top priority for Republicans nationwide, fueled by court victories for religious freedom activists that have chipped away at 20th-century court interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause and free exercise clause.

One area of great consistency among the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority has been cases involving conflicts to the free exercise of religious freedoms.

One of the most prominent recent cases cited in support of St. Isidore is the 2022 case Carson v. Makin, a landmark decision that determined the free exercise clause of the First Amendment did not comport with Maine's “nonsectarian” requirement that barred the use of public vouchers to pay for tuition at religious-based private schools. Carson was one of the cases Stitt ordered Oklahoma agencies to ensure their laws and statutes adhere to throughout the state government.

Thomas Fisher, executive vice president and litigation director for EdChoice, told the Washington Examiner he believes one of St. Isidore and the charter school board's main legal pitches is that “this case is materially indistinguishable from Carson.”

Another argument from Drummond is that charter schools are inherently governmental actors because they receive public funds and are supervised by state regulators. But experts like Garnett, who has advised the St. Isidore organizers, said that places the “educational pluralism” of all charter schools in peril if the attorney general is right.

“A decision suggesting that states can transform private actors into governmental ones by slapping the label ‘public' on them would also threaten the autonomy and religious liberty of private organizations that receive government funds to advance a range of public goals, including poverty alleviation, social services, healthcare and many others,” Garnett wrote for the Wall Street Journal. “Either charter schools are government actors or they aren't.”

When asked whether Fisher had any concerns about possible applications for extremists, such as Drummond's concerns, he noted there would still be a high bar to obtain a religious charter that would likely deter any of his hypothetical dilemmas concerning satanic schools.

“It takes too much money to pull together what you need to have a successful application,” Fisher said.

“States have very rigorous requirements, and they can still have all those rigorous requirements and quality controls and insistence on demonstrations of the ability to deliver quality education, and somebody who's just trying to pull a stunt with some offensive sounding scary type of charter school is not going to have the resources for that sort of thing,” Fisher added.

More than 50 elected officials, scholars, and advocacy groups have backed the school's creation. In a joint statement organized by Stitt, they argue that denying a religious charter school is itself discriminatory and violates the free exercise clause.

Drummond's stance is so unusual for the Trump era of conservatism that he also finds himself aligned with progressive groups, such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which also filed suit against the school.

Oklahoma's top education official since 2023, Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, defended against Drummond's efforts to stymie his own work reinterpreting the state's role in public education.

“I've been really disappointed in the attorney general's position on this,” Walters told the Washington Examiner. “I was elected by the people of Oklahoma, and I'm saying they are crystal clear that they want their religious liberties respected.

Walters's work has focused primarily on addressing the state's historically troublesome quality in public education, defending rights to present Christian values in schools, and implementing Trump's education agenda on the state level.

While Walters has not made any declaration for a governorship, he has long been rumored to announce a run, which would raise the stakes of this court hearing as the justices determine which side has correctly interpreted the law.

Oklahomans “understand that the Bible, Christian father, play a major role in American history and they think America should go back to protecting their communities, to go back to not running Christians out of education, out of our schools,” Walters said, noting he believes “you're seeing an AG out of step with conservatives and Oklahomans.”

At the heart of the case is the age-old tension between the First Amendment's two religion clauses — the establishment clause, which bars government from endorsing religion, and the free exercise clause, which protects individuals and groups from being excluded because of their faith.

“The U.S. Constitution protects St. Isidore's freedom to participate in Oklahoma's charter-school program, and it supports the board's decision to provide more high-quality, no-cost educational options for Oklahoma families,” said Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which defended the board as Drummond attempted to cancel the school's contract in court.

The justices could use the Oklahoma case to clarify how far states can go in excluding religious entities from public programs. 

However, with Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused — likely due to past ties to Notre Dame and personal connections to lawyers in the case — it's not out of the realm of possibility that the justices could rule in a 4-4 split, which could jeopardize the petitioners' chances to see St. Isidore's charter plan through or leave the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling in Drummond's favor intact.

100-DAY REPORT CARD: TRUMP TORNADO SHOCKED AMERICA — AND THE WORLD

For Drummond, the fight is one that he sees as an important line in the sand for the separation of church and state. But that line is one that advocates of recent shifts in religious freedom interpretations at the high court say has long been used as an exclusionary device against people of all religious backgrounds.

President Donald Trump revealed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked him for more weapons during their meeting in the Vatican before Pope Francis's funeral.

“[Zelensky] told me that he needs more weapons, but he's been saying that for three years. He needs more weapons and we're going to see what happens. I want to see what happens with respect to Russia,” Trump told reporters on Sunday night.

Trump added that he is “very disappointed” with Russia, particularly its recent drone attacks on Ukraine that were launched hours after his meeting with Zelensky. Six regions of Ukraine recorded damage from the strikes.

The U.S. president urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to “stop shooting, sit down, and sign a deal.” Trump said the United States and Ukraine have the “confines” of a deal drafted.

Trump's meeting with Zelensky just minutes before the start of the funeral on Saturday was the first face-to-face discussion between the two leaders after their fiery clash in the Oval Office earlier this year. In a now-viral photo, Trump and Zelensky were seen huddled together inside the surroundings of the Vatican.

On Sunday, Trump characterized the meeting as “good” before commenting on the backdrop, which he called “beautiful” and quipped was the “nicest office” he'd ever seen.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar says television networks reporting outside the White House should “blur” the faces of illegal immigrants showcased on lawn signs, which were placed on Sunday evening.

The 100 lawn signs showcase mug shots of illegal immigrants who have been detained, along with the alleged crime listed below their photo, with an MSNBC anchor noting that the signs were set up “directly behind the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn.” In reacting to this predicament given to the press, Kumar argued “we don't know” if the illegal immigrants were given due process, and suggested the faces on these signs should be censored.

“The press right now, we are absolutely under attack,” Kumar stated. “Our job is always to have our true north, to make sure that we're presenting balanced news, and making sure that we are not putting folks that are potentially in danger and having that representation of those pictures in the background, we can't allow that to basically for us to carry the water of potentially innocent people.”

Kumar acknowledged that “live shots are tough” but still pressed for the faces on the illegal immigrant signs to be censored, concluding that “we know better.”

The White House has promoted its new lawn signs on X, with the administration's Rapid Response account stating that the “scumbags” were being shown on the signs “for the world to see.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a video showcasing the many signs.

“We will hunt you down,” the White House's X account wrote. “You will face justice. You will be deported — and you will never set foot on American soil again. Oh, and your mug shot may just end up on a yard sign at the White House.”

One man is dead and six others were wounded after gunfire erupted early Sunday morning on the campus of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. 

The small historically black university was celebrating its annual “Viking Fest” when the shooting happened, according to reports. It was the last day of the weeklong celebration at the college, and the shooting occurred around 12:30 a.m. A 24-year-old man was killed, and six others were wounded. 

Three of the injured were university students, according to reports. The deceased victim was not a student at the university. Law enforcement agencies were investigating the shooting on Sunday, and the school instituted a campus lockdown that lasted most of Sunday before being lifted.

Elizabeth City State University issued a press release on Sunday about the shooting.

“The incident took place following Yard Fest, part of the Viking Fest events held in the quad area,” the university's release reads. “Six individuals were injured during the incident. Four sustained gunshot wounds, including three ECSU students. Additionally, two other ECSU students were injured during the subsequent commotion. Fortunately, none of the injuries are considered life-threatening, and all the injured were transported to a local hospital for treatment.” 

“A 24-year-old man, who was not an ECSU student, was pronounced deceased,” the release notes. “His identity is being withheld pending notification of his next of kin.”

Several students described what happened as the shooting occurred.

“We were just having fun,” one student told a local media outlet. “They were playing music, everybody was dancing. And then a short moment after that, there were pops happening, and everybody started running in the same direction.”

“I heard the gunshots through my window and through the walls,” student Mark Hurlbut told WITN. “Campus honestly didn't send out any alerts of any kind until maybe 20-30 minutes after it happened. I didn't think nothing of it, but then it finally clicked. This happened right outside my door.”

GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF GENERATION Z

Elizabeth City State University is a small college located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, about 50 miles south of Norfolk, Virginia, according to reports. There are approximately 2,500 students enrolled at the college, and it is part of the University of North Carolina system. 

“ECSU extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragic event and remains committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of the Viking community,” the university said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Donald Trump believes he's invincible. But the cracks are beginning to show.

B

efore we begin, a primer on the science of arranging an interview with a sitting American president:

In ordinary times, reporters seeking an on-the-record encounter with the commander in chief first write an elaborate proposal. The proposal details the goals of the interview, the broad areas of concern, and the many reasons the president must, for his own good, talk to these particular reporters and not other, perfectly adequate but still lesser reporters. This pitch is then sent to White House officials. If the universe bends favorably, negotiations ensue. If the staff feel reasonably confident that the interview will somehow help their cause, they will ask the president—with trepidation, at times—to sit for the interview. Sometimes, the president will agree.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Such is what happened recently to us. We went through this process in the course of reporting the story you are reading. We made our pitch, which went like this: President Donald Trump, by virtue of winning a second term and so dramatically reshaping the country and the world, can now be considered the most consequential American leader of the 21st century, and we want to describe, in detail, how this came to be. Just four years ago, after the violent insurrection he fomented, Trump appeared to be finished. Social-media companies had banned or suspended him, and he had been repudiated by corporate donors. Republicans had denounced him, and the country was moving on to the fresh start of Joe Biden's presidency. Then came further blows—the indictments, the civil judgments, and the endless disavowals by people who once worked for him.

And yet, here we are, months into a second Trump term. We wanted to hear, in his own words, how he'd pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in political history, and what lessons, if any, he'd internalized along the way.

Trump agreed to see us. We were tentatively promised a meeting and a photo shoot—likely in the Oval Office, though possibly the Lincoln Bedroom. But then, as is so often the case with this White House, everything went sideways.

The week our interview was supposed to occur, Trump posted a vituperative message on Truth Social, attacking us by name. “Ashley Parker is not capable of doing a fair and unbiased interview. She is a Radical Left Lunatic, and has been as terrible as is possible for as long as I have known her,” he wrote. “To this date, she doesn't even know that I won the Presidency THREE times.” (That last sentence is true—Ashley Parker does not know that Trump won the presidency three times.) “Likewise, Michael Scherer has never written a fair story about me, only negative, and virtually always LIES.”

Apparently, as word of our meeting spread through Trump's inner circle, someone had reminded him of some of the things we (specifically Ashley) had said and written that he didn't like. We still don't know who it was—but we immediately understood the consequences: no photo shoot, no tour of the newly redecorated Oval Office or the Lincoln Bedroom, and definitely no interview.

But we've both covered Trump long enough to know that his first word is rarely his final one. So at 10:45 on a Saturday morning in late March, we called him on his cellphone. (Don't ask how we got his number. All we can say is that the White House staff have imperfect control over Trump's personal communication devices.) The president was at the country club he owns in Bedminster, New Jersey. The number that flashed on his screen was an unfamiliar one, but he answered anyway. “Who's calling?” he asked.

Despite his attacks on us a few days earlier, the president, evidently feeling buoyed by a week of successes, was eager to talk about his accomplishments. As we spoke, the sounds of another conversation, perhaps from a television, hummed in the background.

The president seemed exhilarated by everything he had managed to do in the first two months of his second term: He had begun a purge of diversity efforts from the federal government; granted clemency to nearly 1,600 supporters who had participated in the invasion of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, including those caught beating police officers on camera; and signed 98 executive orders and counting (26 of them on his first day in office). He had fired independent regulators; gutted entire agencies; laid off great swaths of the federal workforce; and invoked 18th-century wartime powers to use against a criminal gang from Venezuela. He had adjusted tariffs like a DJ spinning knobs in the booth, upsetting the rhythms of global trade and inducing vertigo in the financial markets. He had raged at the leader of Ukraine, a democratic ally repelling an imperialist invasion, for not being “thankful”—and praised the leader of the invading country, Russia, as “very smart,” reversing in an instant 80 years of U.S. foreign-policy doctrine, and prompting the countries of NATO to prepare for their own defense, without the protective umbrella of American power, for the first time since 1945.

He had empowered one of his top political donors, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, to slice away at the federal government and take control of its operating systems. He had disemboweled ethics and anti-corruption architecture installed after Watergate, and had declared that he, not the attorney general, was the nation's chief law-enforcement officer. He had revoked Secret Service protection and security clearances from political opponents, including some facing Iranian death threats for carrying out actions Trump himself had ordered in his first term. He had announced plans to pave over part of the Rose Garden, and he had redecorated the Oval Office—gold trim and gold trophies and gold frames to go with an array of past presidential portraits, making the room look like a Palm Beach approximation of an 18th-century royal court.

Old foes were pleading for his grace. Meta—whose founder, Mark Zuckerberg, had become an enthusiastic supplicant—had paid $25 million to settle a civil lawsuit with Trump that many experts believed was meritless. Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, announced that he was banning his opinion writers from holding certain opinions—and then joined Trump for dinner the same night at the White House.

“He's 100 percent. He's been great,” the president told us, referring to Bezos. “Zuckerberg's been great.”

We asked Trump why he thought the billionaire class was prostrating itself before him.

“It's just a higher level of respect. I don't know,” Trump said. “Maybe they didn't know me at the beginning, and they know me now.”

“I mean, you saw yesterday with the law firm,” he said. He was referring to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, one of the nation's most prestigious firms, whose leader had come to the Oval Office days earlier to beg for relief from an executive order that could have crippled its business. Trump had issued the order at least partially because a former partner at the firm had in 2021 gone to work for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, where he was part of an investigation of the Trump Organization's business practices. Also that week, an Ivy League institution, threatened with the cancellation of $400 million in federal funding, had agreed to overhaul its Middle Eastern–studies programs at the Trump administration's request, while also acceding to other significant demands. “You saw yesterday with Columbia University. What do you think of the law firm? Were you shocked at that?” Trump asked us.

Yes—all of it was shocking, much of it without precedent. Legal scholars were drawing comparisons to Franklin D. Roosevelt and the early stages of the New Deal, when Congress had allowed FDR to demolish norms and greatly expand the powers of the presidency.

As ever, Trump was on the hunt for a deal. If he liked the story we wrote, he said, he might even speak with us again.

“Tell the people at The Atlantic, if they'd write good stories and truthful stories, the magazine would be hot,” he said. Perhaps the magazine can risk forgoing hotness, he suggested, because it is owned by Laurene Powell Jobs, which buffers it, he implied, from commercial imperatives. But that doesn't guarantee anything, he warned. “You know at some point, they give up,” he said, referring to media owners generally and—we suspected—Bezos specifically. “At some point they say, No más, no más.” He laughed quietly.

Media owners weren't the only ones on his mind. He also seemed to be referring to law firms, universities, broadcast networks, tech titans, artists, research scientists, military commanders, civil servants, moderate Republicans—all the people and institutions he expected to eventually, inevitably, submit to his will.

We asked the president if his second term felt different from his first. He said it did. “The first time, I had two things to do—run the country and survive; I had all these crooked guys,” he said. “And the second time, I run the country and the world.”

For weeks, we'd been hearing from both inside and outside the White House that the president was having more fun than he'd had in his first term. “The first time, the first weeks, it was just ‘Let's blow this place up,' ” Brian Ballard, a lobbyist and an ally of the president's, had told us. “This time, he's blowing it up with a twinkle in his eye.”

When we put this observation to Trump over the phone, he agreed. “I'm having a lot of fun, considering what I do,” he said. “You know, what I do is such serious stuff.”

That Trump now finds himself once again in a position to blow things up is astonishing, considering the depth of his fall. So much has happened so fast that the improbability of his comeback gets obscured. Perhaps no one in American history has had a political resurrection as remarkable as Donald Trump's.

In the waning days of his first term, his approval rating stood at a pallid 34 percent. A few weeks earlier, he had watched on television while an insurrection he incited overran the Capitol; polls showed that a clear majority of Americans believed he bore responsibility for the attack. The House of Representatives had just impeached him for the second time—making him the only president to ever achieve that ignominy. And although the Senate failed to reach the two-thirds majority required for conviction, seven Republican senators voted to convict—the most members of a president's own party to vote for an impeachment conviction in history.

Twitter and Facebook, his favorite social-media platforms, had banned or effectively silenced him, along with Instagram and YouTube. To try to reestablish direct connection with his followers, he would launch a blog, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.” But it gained little traction and was abandoned within weeks.

Major corporations announced that they were cutting off political contributions to officials who had supported Trump's election lies. Deutsche Bank and Signature Bank decided to stop doing business with Trump and his companies. Perhaps most painful to the president, the PGA of America yanked its scheduled 2022 championship tournament from Trump's Bedminster golf course. Former members of his own Cabinet and staff—people he had hired—would declare him, or had already declared him, “a moron” (Rex Tillerson, secretary of state), “more dangerous than anyone could ever imagine” (James Mattis, secretary of defense), “the most flawed person I have ever met” (John Kelly, chief of staff), and “a laughing fool” (John Bolton, national security adviser). And now longtime allies were abandoning him. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority leader, had discussed pushing Trump to resign from office. On the evening of the insurrection, Senator Lindsey Graham, a compass reliably magnetized toward wherever power in the Republican Party lies, pointed away from Trump for the first time in four years. “Count me out,” Graham had declared on the Senate floor. “Enough is enough.” Rupert Murdoch, then the chairman of Fox Corporation, sent an email to a former Fox Broadcasting executive in which he declared, “We want to make Trump a non person.” Coming from Murdoch himself, the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told us recently, “that's a papal bull.”

On the morning of Joe Biden's inauguration, Trump was a dozen miles southeast of the festivities, at Joint Base Andrews, preparing to depart for Florida. (Trump was the first president since Andrew Johnson, in 1869, to boycott the swearing-in of his successor.) Standing before a modest crowd, his dark overcoat a meager bulwark against the cold, the soon-to-be-former president cut a diminished figure.

Just before boarding Air Force One for the final time, to head to Mar-a-Lago, Trump spoke to those gathered to bid him farewell. “We will be back in some form,” he said, a notably modest framing from such a formerly oversize figure.

Few believed him. It didn't even sound like he believed it himself. The Trump era was over.

Almost as soon as Trump arrived at his gilded Elba, he began plotting his return. He missed the press pool—the gaggle of reporters that tails every president—and once tried to summon it, only to be told that no such pool still existed. But it would turn out that the lack of attention in those first months—and the lack of access to social-media platforms—was a blessing. Enforced obscurity gave him the time and clarity he needed to plan his comeback.

To understand how Trump rose from the political dead, and how he set himself up to wield power in his second term, we spoke with dozens of top advisers, senior aides, allies, adversaries, and confidants. Many who talked with us did so only on the condition of anonymity, in order to be more candid or to avoid angering the president. The story they told us revealed that Trump's time in the political wilderness is crucial to understanding the way he's exercising power now.

He had been in Palm Beach a week when an opportunity presented itself. Trump heard that Kevin McCarthy would be in South Florida for fundraisers. Though the two men had clashed after the Capitol riot, Trump invited McCarthy to Mar-a-Lago. Even before the meeting happened, news of it leaked to The New York Times, shaking the political universe: Were Republican leaders, who had seemed so intent on purging Trump, embracing him again? When Trump and McCarthy met in person, the former president asked the minority leader who had tipped off the Times.

“I know who leaked it—you did,” McCarthy replied, multiple people briefed on the exchange told us.

“It's good for both of us,” Trump shot back.

Both men were right. McCarthy had already concluded that the path back to Republican control of the House in the 2022 midterms—and his own path to the speakership—required a unified party, one that included Trump and his MAGA base. After the meeting, each man separately released the same photo: the two of them grinning amid the ostentatious splendor of Mar-a-Lago. Trump had taken his first step toward political redemption.

It is a truism that Trump has never felt governed by the traditional rules of politics. And he has always been convinced of his own genius, his pure gut instincts. But never more so than today. The past four years have turned him into a Nietzschean cliché. Banishment, multiple indictments, a 34-count felony conviction, repeated brushes with assassins—all have combined to convince him that he is impervious to challenges that would destroy others. Those years also strengthened in him the salesman's instinct that he can bend reality to his will—turn facts into “fake news,” make the inconceivable not just conceivable but actual, transform the Gulf of Mexico into the Gulf of America, make people believe what he's selling in defiance of what they see with their own eyes. This is the core lesson that Trump and his acolytes internalized from the 2020 election and January 6. The real-estate mogul who branded buildings with his name everywhere from Turkey to Uruguay, who sold the “world's greatest steaks” and the “finest” wine and “fantastic” mattresses, had mastered the alchemy of perception. Reality, to Trump, is fungible. While reporting on Trump over the past four years, we were repeatedly struck that, in failing to drive a stake directly through his heart, all of the would-be vampire slayers—Democrats, Never Trumpers, Republican-primary opponents, prosecutors, judges, media critics—only strengthened him. Which brings us to a second lesson: Trump and his team realized that they could behave with near impunity by embracing controversies and scandals that would have taken down just about any other president—as long as they showed no weakness.

Even now, Trump—who described himself to us as “a very positive thinker”—struggles to admit that his return to power was a comeback. To concede that he'd had to come back would be to admit that he had fallen in the first place.

Early in our reporting for this article, we asked the Trump loyalist and former Breitbart News editor Raheem Kassam to explain how the president had been able to bend the country, and the world, to his will. Over a meal of oysters brûlées, duck confit, and fries cooked in beef tallow at Butterworth's, the new MAGA haunt on Capitol Hill, he responded crudely, if vividly. “He didn't bend them to his will,” Kassam said. “He bent them over.”

When we spoke with Trump in late March, his approval ratings seemed steady, his political base apparently unshakable. Institution after institution was submitting to him—“obeying in advance,” as the historian of authoritarianism Timothy Snyder has put it. Trump was carrying out his agenda with surprisingly little resistance, even from Democrats. But in the days and weeks that followed, the patina of infallibility began to crack. At the instigation of Elon Musk's DOGE team, critical workers had been getting fired—and then hired back. An embarrassing (and possibly illegal) operations-security snafu, in which the editor of this magazine was included on a Signal group chat that discussed imminent attack plans on Houthi targets in Yemen, made the administration look incompetent, in a fashion reminiscent of the clown-car chaos of Trump 1.0. The president's tariff rollout was shambolic, tanking the stock market and causing even some loyalists to question him publicly. His approval rating on the economy, long a buttress of his polling support, went negative. Was this what happens when a feeling of indomitability curdles into hubris? Or was this just the next setback for Trump—some combination of Houdini and Lazarus—to recover from?

Trump advisers like to tell a story from November 5, 2024, Election Night, just before the networks called Wisconsin, and thus the election, in his favor. He and his aides were preparing to head to the West Palm Beach convention center, where he would deliver his victory speech. His whole senior team was crowded into his private office at Mar-a-Lago. Addressing no one in particular, as though just musing aloud, Trump spoke.

“You know, they made a big mistake,” he said. “They could have been getting rid of us by now. But actually, we're just beginning.”

He had almost been destroyed before. After a real-estate downturn in the early 1990s, Trump found himself on the brink of financial ruin. His near bankruptcy and recovery led to his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback. For his political advisers in exile, this book became essential reading.

The first pages list Trump's “Top Ten Comeback Tips.” When we met one of his advisers recently, this person recounted from memory some of the rules on the list. “Rule 1 is: Play golf,” this adviser told us. “Rule 9 is: Get even.” (Rule 10, “Always have a prenuptial agreement,” seemed less applicable to politics.)

To stage a comeback, Trump would need the right staff. He had realized, in his exile, that at nearly every turn in his first term, someone on his own team—Reince Priebus, John Kelly, James Mattis, Bill Barr, Gary Cohn—had blocked him. He needed smart people who would figure out how to let him do everything that he wanted to do, in whatever way he wanted to do it. His first key hire was a political operative who had impressed the former president with her retrospective analysis of the 2020 election. Biden had won the election that year by flipping back into the Democratic column five key states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin (along with a lone congressional district in Nebraska). One of the few bright spots for Trump in 2020 had been Florida, where he had increased his winning margin from 2016. What, Trump began asking his allies after the election, had he done right in Florida that he hadn't done in the rest of the country?

The answer, in large part, boiled down to Susie Wiles, who had run Trump's 2016 and 2020 campaigns in the state. Wiles, the daughter of the legendary NFL announcer Pat Summerall, is an experienced campaign operative (she was a scheduler for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign), who over the past three decades had developed deep Florida ties. After every campaign she runs, Wiles writes an “after action” report, documenting what worked and what didn't. Over dinner with Trump on the patio at Mar-a-Lago in early 2021, she delivered “the Florida memo.” Soon after, he hired her to run his political operation, which eventually became his 2024 campaign.

Wiles saw that one thing that had held Trump back in 2020 was that he had not finished taking over the Republican Party during his first term. Part of Trump's leverage had been his ability to endorse in Republican primaries—influence he was eager to reprise. “When I endorse somebody, they win,” Trump told us on the phone. “But even when I endorse them in the general election, mostly they win. It's important.” (Now when Trump calls to pressure a fellow Republican about an issue or a vote, they are almost always grateful for his past support, or feel that they owe their seat to him.)

The Wiles process for evaluating potential endorsees—which she undertook with James Blair, now a deputy chief of staff in the White House, and Brian Jack, now a congressman representing Georgia—involved researching how they had spoken about Trump in the past. “The basic thing was their loyalty and their political viability,” one adviser told us. “So we were looking for things like: So, what did they say on J6? What did they say during the Access Hollywood tapes? What is their voting record with us?” Trump was building a coalition of loyalists, something he hadn't sufficiently done during the first term.

Wiles had plenty of experience managing men with big personalities. But colleagues say a key reason she's been successful working with Trump (she is now his White House chief of staff) is that she never tries to manage him. She does not imagine that she can control him, as some former top advisers attempted, and she tends not to offer advice unless specifically asked. Her primary role, as she sees it, is to set up processes to help ensure Trump's success, and then to execute his directives, whatever they may be.

At first, Trump's banishment from the big social-media platforms, along with mainstream media outlets' reluctance—including Fox News's—to give him much coverage, seemed potentially devastating. But Trump turned to the far-right platforms and activists still welcoming him. Taylor Budowich—now a White House deputy chief of staff—worked with MAGA influencers to evade the Twitter and Facebook bans: They would print out pro-Trump social-media posts; Budowich would have Trump sign the paper with his Sharpie, and then mail the signed post back to the influencer; almost invariably, the influencer would then post the signed missive, flexing their access and building their audience—while simultaneously amplifying Trump's voice. At the same time, a video ecosystem grew up around Trump, with streaming platforms such as Right Side Broadcasting Network stepping in to cover his events when cable networks would not.

“Him being banned gave rise to people like me, because the president's supporters followed me to find out what he was saying,” one MAGA influencer told us. “It backfired on the tech people who deplatformed him, because it platformed all of us.”

Trump, meanwhile, continued to promote the lie that he'd won the 2020 election, and that January 6 was just an ordinary Wednesday. Normal political logic suggested that this was a bad strategy. But his shamelessness, as ever, remained a strength. By repeating something frequently enough, he could slowly make it feel true, at least for his supporters.

Not long ago, we sat in Steve Bannon's Capitol Hill rowhouse, where he records his War Room podcast, pressing him on Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, and his denial of what transpired on January 6. “Our reality is that we won” and that January 6 was a “fedsurrection,” Bannon said, referring to the conspiracy theory that FBI agents had incited the crowd on the Ellipse that day.

But this reality, we pointed out to Bannon, is simply not true.

“Now, here's the interesting thing,” Bannon said. “Who's won that argument? I think we have.”

The first televised hearing of the House select committee on January 6 was scheduled for the beginning of June 2022, and it was sure to be a spectacle that reminded viewers of the horror of the insurrection and emphasized the former president's culpability. Trump's team at Mar-a-Lago was desperate to distract attention from the hearing. At one point, someone proposed a brazen gambit: Trump could announce his 2024 bid for the presidency just minutes before the hearing gaveled in.

Trump's response was telling. “I'm not ready for this,” he said. “We're not ready for this right now.”

“That was the first moment of, like, ‘Okay, he's not just thinking about it; he's seriously thinking about how he wants to do it,' ” one of his advisers told us. “He's not going to just use it as a stunt to make a moment. He wants to win.”

Before long, Trump began emphasizing behind the scenes that he was serious. “Be ready,” he would repeat to people who had served with him the first time around. “Be ready! Be ready! We're coming back! Be ready!”

Still, when Trump did launch his campaign, in November 2022, it did not get off to an auspicious start. Even his most fiercely supportive advisers concede that the announcement, in the form of an hour-long speech at Mar-a-Lago, was a dud.

Surprisingly few political reporters from major outlets were in attendance; it was as though the mainstream media still didn't believe that Trump could be a viable candidate again. Worse, some members of Trump's own family hadn't bothered to show up. As the speech dragged on, even Fox News cut away, switching to what Bannon called “a C-level panel,” before returning for the final few minutes.

The campaign struggled to gain traction. Trump's longtime pollster Tony Fabrizio told us that even months later, into early 2023, getting donors to attend the first big super-PAC event “was like pulling teeth.” And although Trump was now a declared presidential candidate, his team said it was still having trouble getting him booked even on shows such as Fox & Friends.

The first turning point, several advisers told us, came in February 2023. A Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border, spewing toxic material. Sitting in the West Palm Beach campaign headquarters one day, Trump's team watched Joe Biden's press secretary struggle to answer a question about the president's plans for outreach to East Palestine. Soon after, Susie Wiles received a call from Trump's oldest son, Don Jr., saying that his father ought to just show up there himself. When Wiles brought the suggestion to Trump, in the living room of Mar-a-Lago, his response was unequivocal: “That's a great idea,” he enthused. “When can we go?”

Trump's visit to East Palestine—and the footage of him buying McDonald's for the first responders—had a potent effect. “It just reminded everyone that people still like this guy,” one adviser told us. “He's still a draw.” Nearly two years later, Trump's visit continued to resonate. “People are living their lives and they don't delve that easily into policy,” a woman across the border in the swing state of Pennsylvania told our colleague George Packer before the election last fall. “All they know is that Trump was here buying everyone McDonald's” and that Biden hadn't visited for more than a year.

The halting start to the campaign kept Trump off the radar, giving his team time to plan. Former Trump advisers had used their years out of power to set up their own groups—America First Legal, America First Policy Institute, Center for Renewing America—to prepare for a second Trump administration.

“The people who were the true believers knew Trump was going to run again and win,” Caroline Wren, a former top Trump fundraiser, told us, adding that Trump's policy loyalists “sat there and prepared executive orders for four years.”

The time out of the spotlight also allowed the team to build a new election strategy. By now, Trump had alienated a significant share of the voting public, and he was polling lower among some demographic groups than in previous elections. The conventional wisdom was that the criminal investigations and legal proceedings then under way would only increase that alienation. His campaign directors decided that the best tactic was to turn this problem into a strength. Chris LaCivita, who was a co–campaign manager alongside Susie Wiles and a military veteran wounded in the Gulf War in 1991, took to exhorting younger staffers with a Marine slogan: “Embrace the suck.”

The impulse to let Trump be Trump, so contrary to the instincts of much of the first-term staff, was laid out in a memo that James Blair and Tim Saler, the campaign's lead data expert, sent to Wiles in early 2024. This became known around the campaign as the “gender memo.” “Instead of saying, ‘Look, we did two points worse with white suburban women between 2016 and 2020' and ‘How do we get those points back?,' what if we did it the other way?” an adviser familiar with the memo told us. “What if we said, ‘We gained eight points with non-college-educated men. What if we won them by 12?' ”

The strategy had the benefit of letting Trump be the version of himself that appealed to those men. In a moment when the Democratic Party often felt like an amalgamation of East Coast elitists, niggling scolds, and far-left activists, Trump appeared to offer judgment-free populism to a populace sick of being judged.

Trump's own view, we were told, was more self-referential: “Why would I distance myself from my people? They love me.”

On Friday, May 31, 2024, the day after Trump was convicted of 34 felony charges in a New York City courtroom, the treasurer at Make America Great Again Inc., the main super PAC supporting the former president, called his boss, Taylor Budowich, with good news. A large wire transfer was incoming—a record $15 million. The call set off an internal scramble, because the bank needed the donor's name to approve the transfer, and nobody knew who it was.

Shortly thereafter, the treasurer called back. “I'm so sorry,” he told Budowich. “I misheard him. It's not $15 million—it's $50 million.”

“Don't be sorry!” Budowich said. (The donation was eventually traced to Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune.)

The Democrats assumed that Trump's legal issues would politically neuter him. “A convicted felon is now seeking the office of the presidency,” Biden would say. But all the scandals and controversies that would have sunk a different candidate became background static. “The thing about the court cases is there were too many of them, and this is one of Trump's superpowers—he never just breaks the law a little bit; he does it all over the place,” Sarah Longwell, a formerly Republican, anti-MAGA political strategist who regularly conducts focus groups, told us. “And as a result, there were so many court cases that it was just white noise to voters. They couldn't tell them apart.”



The Democratic base remained outraged. Trump's base continued to believe his claims that all the criminal investigations and January 6 hearings constituted a “witch hunt.” But for the sliver of voters who would actually decide the election, the Democratic argument that Trump was a threat to democracy was too far removed from their more urgent concerns about grocery prices. As time passed and Trump continued to rewrite history to turn insurrectionists into “patriots,” the events of January 6 receded into abstraction for many of these voters.

“If you said, ‘What's J6?,' it's like, ‘What is that? Bingo? Are you playing Battleship?' ” the adviser familiar with the gender memo told us, describing what the campaign's voter research had found.

Trump's felony conviction actually proved to be a boon. This did not surprise his advisers. A year earlier, in the spring of 2023, when Trump had been indicted over hush-money payments to a porn star, his support in Republican-primary polls jumped 10 points within a month, to more than 50 percent—a level it would never drop below again. In the first three months of 2023, MAGA Inc. had reported raising only about $600,000; in the three months following the indictment, the group took in nearly $13 million. “Democrats just played right into our hands,” Fabrizio, the Trump pollster, told us.

For Trump's base, the cases were energizing, and they put his Republican-primary opponents in the difficult position of having to defend Trump against “lawfare” or risk being seen as supporting the Democrats' position. So even while campaigning against him for the nomination, they were in effect campaigning for him.

During his 2016 campaign, Trump had ignored the traditional fundraising circuit, which increased donor skepticism of him. But during his time in the wilderness, he began to enjoy raising money. He asked advisers to schedule more call time for him with top donors. He wrote personal notes, and he regularly invited wealthy supporters and potential donors to dine with him at Mar-a-Lago. He judged generosity not by the size of the check, his allies told us, but by the size of the check relative to the donor's net worth. He liked pressuring donors to bet on him—and watching them squirm if they hedged. Sometimes he was blunt, invoking the specter of a President Kamala Harris taking their wealth.

(“If I'm not president, you're fucked,” he would tell a roomful of oil executives at Mar-a-Lago after the election. “Look at your profit-and-loss statements. You realize what would have happened to you if she was president? What's wrong with you?”)

The Supreme Court decision in July 2024 regarding a legal challenge to the federal prosecution of Trump for interfering in the 2020 election gave Trump and his allies further momentum. Trump v. United States addressed the question of legal liability for a president, but Trump's allies focused on how the Court described the presidency itself, suggesting that all the powers of the executive branch were imbued in the personage. “Unlike anyone else,” the Court wrote, “the President is a branch of government.” That the prosecution of Trump both revivified his candidacy and then gave him more executive power in his second term remains a stinging irony for Democrats.

When we talked with Trump, we asked him if he thought the criminal prosecutions had made him stronger. “Shockingly, yes,” he said. “Normally, it would knock you out. You wouldn't even live for the next day. You know, you'd announce your resignation, and you'd go back and ‘fight for your name,' like everybody says—you know, ‘fight for your name, go back to your family.' ”

He paused. “Yeah, it made me stronger, made me a lot stronger.”

In the final months of the campaign, Democratic strategists working for Vice President Harris focused on seven swing states. Trump, by contrast, told aides that he wanted to put resources into picking up voters even in states he was already certain to win.

“We don't want anyone to know—it's a surprise—but I think we might win the popular vote,” Trump would say to his advisers. “We have got to run up the score.”

During breaks between events, his team would place calls to groups of voters in red states and put him on the line. “This is your favorite president, Donald Trump,” he'd say, before launching into brief remarks. They would make calls from the motorcade, from the campaign plane, as many as 10 a day. In this way, working around the old mass media, Trump reached thousands of voters directly.

“If there was someone in America in some state, still awake, Donald Trump would find a way to get to them,” Chris LaCivita told us.

In 2016, Trump had been so frustrated about losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton that he'd falsely asserted, “I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” Eight years later, he didn't have to pretend. As Election Night gave way to dawn in Palm Beach, Trump basked in the comprehensiveness of his victory—all seven swing states, and a strong showing in the popular-vote tally, which he ultimately won. Several aides got calls from him around 4 a.m. “You won't believe it,” Trump crowed, according to one. “I've already had 20 world leaders call me. They all want to kiss my ass.”

Some time later, Trump addressed a gathering of supporters in the living room at Mar-a-Lago. During his first term people would say, “Yeah, he won, but he doesn't have a mandate, ” Trump told the crowd. “Now they can't say it anymore.”

People who worked with Trump in his first term used to play a parlor game of sorts. What would happen, they wondered, if they, the human guardrails, weren't there to correct the president's errors, to explain to him all the things he did not know or understand, to talk him out of or slow-walk his most destructive impulses?

During his first term, he faced resistance and obstruction from all over the government: from the courts and from the Democrats, but also from Republicans in the House and Senate, who at times treated him like a floundering student. The contempt was mutual. “Paul Ryan was a stupid person,” Trump told us in March, referring to the former Republican speaker of the House. “And Mitch, Mitch wasn't much better,” Trump said of Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader and, lately, the epicenter of GOP resistance to Trump, such as it is. But some of the most crucial pushback came from within the executive branch. At times, his chief of staff and his White House counsel declined to carry out his orders. Trump had been apoplectic when “his” Justice Department, under Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein, opened an independent-counsel investigation into whether the Russians had influenced the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign had colluded with them.

This time would be different, because he'd learned from experience. “When I did it before, I never did it, you know?” he told us. “I didn't know people in Washington.”

On January 15, at 8 p.m., five days before the inauguration, Trump sent out an incendiary post on Truth Social. In it, he described the sorts of people his incoming administration would not be hiring—a list that included anyone who had ever worked for, in his words, “Americans for No Prosperity (headed by Charles Koch), ‘Dumb as a Rock' John Bolton, ‘Birdbrain' Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, disloyal Warmongerers Dick Cheney, and his Psycho daughter, Liz,” and anyone “suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome.” For those staffing Trump's second term, the missive was doctrine: This time, loyalty would be absolute.

In 2016, few experienced Republicans had been involved in Trump's campaign, so the pool of presumptive loyalists to draw from was small. His incoming team also used key transition picks—Cabinet secretaries, West Wing advisers—to reassure a still-skeptical Republican Party that Trump was one of them. This produced a dysfunctional dichotomy in which Reince Priebus, a mild-mannered traditional Republican from Wisconsin, and Steve Bannon, a revolutionary hell-bent on dismantling the administrative state, shared top billing in the West Wing. The competing camps—the MAGA fire-breathers, the establishment swamp creatures, “Javanka” and the globalists—leaked relentlessly to the media and tried to knife one another. A miasma of chaos surrounded Trump, and impaired the administration's ability to carry out its policy agenda.

But by 2024, Trump had effectively consumed the party, and he had no need to recruit traditional Republicans, if any even remained. Cliff Sims, who during Trump's first term had served as a communications aide in the White House before going to work for the director of national intelligence, helped the transition team manage hiring for the second term. The formula for staffing the administration wasn't hard this time, Sims told us: “Don't hire anyone who wasn't committed to the agenda last time.”

“I knew that Stephen Miller would ultimately run the policy operation, with immigration as a top priority,” Sims told us, referring to Trump's senior domestic-policy adviser, who is, famously, an immigration hard-liner. “So I just asked him, ‘Who do you want? Who should prepare DHS? Who should prepare ICE? Who are the rock stars from your team? Let's get them all rolling.' ” Same, too, with trade. Sims called Jamieson Greer, who had served as the chief of staff to the U.S. trade representative in Trump's first term before taking over the role himself this time around. He asked Greer who Trump's pro-tariff “killers on trade” were. “And he's like, ‘I've been sitting here hoping someone would call about this; I've already got a list ready,' ” Sims told us.

Because the transition hiring for the second term harvested a uniformly loyalist crop of staffers, getting things done the way Trump wants became easier. In the first term, executive orders designed by the MAGA faction were sometimes rushed through without proper legal vetting, in an attempt to prevent a warring faction from killing the directive, someone familiar with this process told us—which made them vulnerable to court challenges. This time around, the process for generating the orders is more disciplined.

Trump's aides and advisers also now understood the hydraulics of the government better. They'd learned, for instance, that immigration policy was not contained solely within the Department of Homeland Security, and that to curb the flow of immigrants across the southern border, they also needed to install loyalists in crucial roles at the Department of Health and Human Services. When it came to the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs at the State Department, they now knew they needed MAGA diehards in key roles. This kind of knowledge would now be applied to thousands of hires across dozens of agencies.

When his Cabinet nominees hit trouble in the Senate, Trump and his team were determined to test their new power. “It was ‘You'll eat your breakfast and you'll like it,' ” a veteran Republican operative told us. The first major test came during the former Fox News host Pete Hegseth's quest for confirmation as defense secretary.

Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican, was skeptical about Hegseth's qualifications. Ernst is the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate; Hegseth had previously said that women should not serve in combat roles. Ernst is also a sexual-assault survivor; Hegseth has been accused of sexual assault and other misconduct, including alcohol abuse. (Hegseth has denied the accusations.) But when Ernst publicly signaled that she might not be able to support the nomination, Trump's allies leaped into action. On private text chains, they talked about how failing to win confirmation for Hegseth was untenable. The consensus was clear: Because Matt Gaetz had already had to withdraw as Trump's pick for attorney general, if they lost another major nominee, there would be blood in the water. Even the most controversial—Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Kash Patel—needed to be muscled through.

They decided to make an example of Ernst, as a warning to other senators about what to expect if they stepped out of line. An op‑ed implicitly excoriating her appeared on Breitbart News ; Bannon and the gang on his War Room podcast hammered her relentlessly; and the powerful young conservative activist Charlie Kirk and his Turning Point USA team threatened to send resources to Iowa to oppose her reelection in 2026. Ernst's effort to “end Pete Hegseth,” Kirk posted on X in early December, “is a direct attempt to undermine the President and his voters. Pete Hegseth is the redline. If you vote against him, primaries will ensue.”

Trump's team knew that once the most prominent MAGA figures began their onslaught, second-tier influencers would follow. Ernst called around to Trump allies, begging them to stop the attacks. But they wouldn't relent; she voted to confirm Hegseth.

Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator and physician from Louisiana, also briefly found himself in the hot seat as he struggled with his confirmation vote on Kennedy, a vaccine critic who has misstated scientific findings, to lead the nation's top health agency. (Cassidy was also viewed as a problem by Trump supporters because he'd voted to convict the president for his role in the January 6 insurrection.)

Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, though he maintained that the vote had nothing to do with his own reelection prospects in 2026. Afterward, in the course of general conversations about the midterms, Cassidy's team sought Trump's support in his upcoming GOP primary. Trump told an aide to relay to Cassidy: “I'll think about it.” (A Trump adviser told us that, for the moment, the president and Cassidy have reached “an uneasy détente.”)

Business leaders fell more quickly in line. After the election, they descended on Mar-a-Lago.

At dinner with Silicon Valley moguls, Trump would sometimes play “Justice for All”—a song by the J6 Prison Choir that features men imprisoned for their actions on January 6 singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” interspersed with Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. One Trump adviser gleefully recounted how confused the tech billionaires appeared when “Justice for All” started, looking around for cues before inevitably rising and putting their hands over their hearts.

“The troll is strong,” the adviser told us.

The Thursday before the inauguration, a friend of Trump's was sitting with him at Mar-a-Lago when the once and future president held up his phone to show off his recent-call log.

“Look who called in the past hour,” Trump boasted, then scrolled through a list that included Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tiger Woods. Apart from Woods, all were former Trump critics who, eight years earlier, had tried to keep their distance.

The start of a new presidency is a famously harried and jury-rigged affair. But Trump and his team had spent his time out of office preparing for his return. Longwell, the anti-MAGA strategist, told us—echoing something our colleague David Frum had warned about four years ago—that watching Trump's second-term team attack the federal bureaucracy was like watching “the velociraptors who have figured out how to work the doorknobs.” Day one of the second term, the product of weeks of meticulous planning, was all about—in the Trump team's words—“shock and awe.” “We did all the immigration and border executive orders,” an adviser told us. “If we just left it at that, all the stories would have been about what bad people we are—we're kicking people out of this country. But then right after he signed those border executive orders, bam: the J6 pardons.” The adviser explained that, along with Trump's multiple speeches that day and inaugural balls that evening, this meant “the media had to choose what to cover. It's either the J6 pardons or the immigration executive orders.” This convulsion of activity, the adviser told us, was all “planned”—designed to overwhelm.

“We have everyone kind of in the barrel, like everyone's on the spin cycle, just getting whipped around, and that's advantageous for us,” another adviser told us.

In his first term, Trump had floated the idea of buying Greenland—speaking of it almost offhandedly as a potentially intriguing if unusual real-estate acquisition. But now, even before taking office again, he had suggested that Canada should be America's 51st state, threatened to reclaim the Panama Canal, and vowed to gain control of Greenland—“one way or the other,” as he would later put it. He followed this during his inaugural address by invoking “manifest destiny,” the 19th-century idea that the United States has a divinely ordained right to control North America.

“This time it's ‘Hey, fuck you, Greenland's ours,' ” Bannon told us.

He added that many of the things that, in his first term, Trump had floated as provocations or trollings or idle musings are now things the president realizes he can actually do. “These are all doable,” Bannon told us. “When you've come back from such long odds, you clearly feel, ‘I can do anything.' ”

In his first term, Trump and his team had not done certain things—fired key bureaucrats, upended certain alliances, overhauled various initiatives—because, as one former adviser told us, “we thought they were red-hot.

“And then you touch it,” the former adviser continued, “and you realize it's actually not that hot.” This may be the key insight of Trump's second term. The first time around, aides were constantly warning him that the stove was too hot. This time, no one is even telling him not to touch the stove.

Tradition holds that artists honored with lifetime-achievement awards at the Kennedy Center meet with the sitting president. During Trump's first term, some of the most prominent artists refused to do so. He, in turn, didn't attend a single performance there.

“I didn't really get to go the first time, because I was always getting impeached or some bullshit, and I could never enjoy a show,” Trump said, according to an adviser familiar with the comments. But as planning for the second inauguration got under way, someone mentioned the possibility of holding an event there, impelling Trump to muse aloud about naming himself chairman of the Kennedy Center, a position that had long been held by the philanthropist and Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein. Trump ordered, “Call David Rubenstein and tell him he's fired.”

Some of Trump's advisers have learned to operate by an unofficial rule: They make sure to do things after he says them twice. This is a necessary and important rule because, as one adviser explained, “he says a lot of shit.” So the second time Trump mentioned wanting to take over the Kennedy Center, his aides got to work, and in early February, Trump fired most of the board and named himself chairman. His cultural remit had gone overnight from entertaining his aides by playing oldies on his iPad on the patio of Mar-a-Lago to being chairman of the board of one of the nation's premier arts institutions.

One of the most chaotic departures from convention has been Elon Musk's prominent role in the administration. The disruption Musk has unleashed through DOGE, putting swaths of government “into the wood chipper,” as he described it, has tended to obscure the fact that the richest man in the world, who is one of Trump's biggest financial donors, is attending Cabinet meetings while continuing to run his private businesses, which benefit from billions of dollars in federal contracts. The conflicts of interest here run fathoms deep. But Trump has confidently normalized all of it, even going so far as to conduct an infomercial for Tesla on the White House grounds.

In previous presidencies, Musk's role in the administration would have been a scandal that dominated the media and congressional hearings for months. In Trump's second term, this—by design—gets drowned out by everything else.

So, too, does Trump's complete departure from convention regarding the Justice Department, which has historically had some independence from the president. In April, Trump ordered the DOJ to investigate Chris Krebs, who in Trump's first term ran the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which declared the 2020 election secure and Biden the legitimate winner. Trump, in short, wanted to prosecute Krebs for accepting reality. He has also made clear that he wants the attorney general to protect his supporters, including Musk, whose Tesla dealerships and charging stations have been targeted by vandals. “When I see things going on like what they're doing to Elon, that's terrible,” Trump told us. “That's a terrible thing. That's terrorism.”

Trump boasted to us of Musk's private business successes as if they were his own. One of Musk's companies, SpaceX, had just helped to retrieve astronauts who had been marooned for months on the International Space Station. “They don't come out of there at some point, you know, the bones start to break down,” Trump said.

Trump marveled at the media's coverage of the splashdown. “They said, ‘And the rocket's coming down in the Gulf of America.' They didn't make a big deal. They didn't say Trump named it,” he told us. “It was like it was old hat. And it's been the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years, literally hundreds of years. The Gulf of Mexico, before our country was formed. It's been a long time. And that's good.”

For all of Trump's success in dominating the political sphere, Democrats have grown more optimistic that his political fortunes may be changing. Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who gave the Democratic rebuttal to Trump's address to Congress in early March, told us that some of her constituents say their votes for Trump were born of despair. “They'll say to me, ‘Look, it's like I'm a Stage 4 cancer patient. My life has been getting worse, from my grandfather to my father, from my father to me, and my kids are going to do worse than me, so I need experimental chemo. Trump is my experimental chemo. It may hurt like hell. It may not work at all. But I'm at the end of my rope, and I'll try anything.' ”

We asked her whether now, several months into the second Trump administration, her constituents think the chemo is working. “I can't tell you how many Trump voters have said to me, like, ‘Look, I voted for him to make the economy work. I did not vote for all of this craziness, and I certainly didn't vote, for instance, for cuts to the VA,' ” Slotkin said. “That is not what they signed up for.”

But in nearly every conversation we had with various Trump advisers, they told us that delivering on what people had voted for was in fact essential to holding the House and the Senate in the 2026 midterms. Trump himself has his eyes on a larger, long-term political realignment. “It's a much different party,” he told us. “I got 38 percent of the male Black vote. Nobody knew that was possible. That's a lot. I got 56 percent of Hispanics. How about that one? Every county along the Texas border is Hispanic. I won every one of them.” Though every single number he cited was wrong, the general thrust of his observation was correct.

Delivering on Trump's campaign promises, his advisers told us, was the key not only to securing his legacy but to transforming the MAGA base into Republican voters for decades to come. (This project—persuading MAGA supporters to vote for Republicans even when Trump is not on the ballot—is a “central theme” of this presidency, one adviser repeatedly told us.) During the campaign and then the transition, Trump's aides kept a shared document that meticulously cataloged and updated his promises for what he would do on day one, as well as what he'd promised to do more generally. The advisers we spoke with said that voters had absolutely known what they were asking for when they pulled the lever for Trump—and Trump's team was determined to deliver.

But this is where the now nationally ingrained tendency to take Trump seriously but not literally may have created a disconnect between what Trump's supporters thought they were voting for and what they are now getting, even among his most committed base. Over the years, Trump said many things that never came to fruition. Or he spoke with such hyperbole that everyone substantially discounted the reality of what he was ostensibly committing to. Or the policy implications of what he said would get obscured in the cloud of his ruminations about shark attacks and electrocutions and Hannibal Lecter—allowing voters to focus on what they liked and to ignore the riskier, more worrisome aspects of his promises. So although it's true that Trump is delivering on commitments to impose tariffs, cut government waste, and aggressively deport immigrants, many of his voters are only now beginning to realize the effect these policies will have on their daily lives.

Several months into his second chance, the blitzkrieg of the early days continues—but it seems to be meeting more substantial resistance. Federal courts are once again blocking—or at least trying to block—Trump plans that flout the Constitution or stretch legal reasoning. The repeated rollouts and rollbacks and re-rollouts of his tariff measures have pushed the world toward an economic breaking point. (Even in the best-case scenario, any renaissance of the U.S. industrial base remains a long way off.) The Federal Reserve recently adjusted short-term-inflation projections higher, and GDP projections are getting lower. Financial analysts say the odds of a recession have risen significantly. The stock market just had its worst quarter in three years. When we talked with him in March, Trump had told us that Vladimir Putin “is going to be fine” in the Ukraine peace negotiations—but Putin has thwarted Trump's promise of a quick deal. (“I'm trying to save a lot of lives in the world,” Trump told us. “You know, Ukraine and Russia—it's not our lives, but it could end up in a Third World War.”)

The Signalgate fiasco appalled even a majority of Republicans. (Here Trump has so far stuck to his second-term policy of conceding essentially nothing, of never admitting weakness or a lie. To date, no one has been fired over Signalgate—though advisers we spoke with privately predicted that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, who inadvertently added The Atlantic's editor in chief to the attack-planning chain, would exit the administration by the end of the year, if not much sooner.) Mass anti-Trump protests, notably absent during the first two months of this term, have become more frequent, including in red states.

Jeffrey Goldberg: Signalgate, Trump, and The Atlantic

Even as Trump continually seeks to expand his presidential powers, he at times seems to acknowledge that they have limits. In our March conversation, he seemed frustrated at the notion that a court might try to curb his ability to deport anyone he wanted, however he wanted. Yet when we asked if he would go so far as to actively disregard a judicial order, his answer suggested that he understood the Constitution would not allow that. “I think the judge is horrible,” he said, referring to James Boasberg, the federal-district-court judge who had tried to stop deportations of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. But Trump then referenced the Supreme Court's more congenial opinion in Trump v. United States, which had given him immunity from criminal prosecution for anything he does as part of his core “official” duties as president. “But I've had a lot of horrible judges, and I won on appeal, right? I got immunity on appeal,” he said. He told us that the Court is “going to do what's right” when reviewing his expansive use of executive power, and he spoke with uncharacteristic charity about the Court's Democratic appointees. “I see them at the State of the Union, things that I do, and I think they're very good people,” he said.

When questioned, Trump has sought to evade direct responsibility for individual deportations by his administration, legal challenges to which are wending their way through the courts.

“You know, I'm not involved in that. I have many people, many layers of people that do that,” Trump told us when we asked if he was worried that he may have mistakenly deported innocent people. “I would say they are all extremely tough, dangerous people. I would say that. And, don't forget, they came in the country illegally.”

Trump's advisers argue that, overall, the shock-and-awe approach is working. “Think about everything that's happened immediately on immigration,” Cliff Sims told us. “Oh, we're just going to ship gang members to a prison in El Salvador? ‘Sure.' We're going to send Tom Homan”—Trump's border czar—“to kick down the door of every criminal illegally in the country? ‘Have at it.' It is the ultimate example of the ruthless efficiency of Trump 2.0.”



We asked Trump about the portraits on the walls of the Oval Office. Who, we wondered, had a legacy that he himself might like to have? “Ronald Reagan, I like in terms of style. But he was not good on trade—terrible on trade,” Trump replied. We pointed out that Reagan was also far more welcoming of immigrants. “Well, the toughest one in immigration was Eisenhower, believe it or not,” Trump said. “He was tough, and he just didn't want people to come in illegally, like, you know, me. Well, I'm great on trade.”

Trump has also started talking publicly about running for a third term, which the Twenty-Second Amendment clearly prohibits. This started as joking comments with advisers—before making them, he would sometimes teasingly instruct the sober-minded Wiles, “Susie, close your ears”—but now seems to have become more serious. MAGA acolytes outside the administration have said they've been investigating ways of getting around the Twenty-Second Amendment, and an adviser acknowledged that if Trump thought a third term could somehow be made feasible, he would likely consider it.

We asked Trump about a rumor we'd heard that he had tasked his Justice Department with looking into the legality of his running again in 2028. He said he hadn't, but then seemed to leave open the possibility. Was this the rare democratic norm he was unwilling to shatter? “That would be a big shattering, wouldn't it?” he mused, laughing. “Well, maybe I'm just trying to shatter.” He noted, twice, that his supporters regularly shout for him to seek a third term, but concluded, “It's not something that I'm looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do.” But not, it appears, a hard thing to profit from: The Trump Organization is now selling “Trump 2028” hats.

As a final question during our conversation in March, we asked the president whether he had concerns that his successor will follow his precedent and directly steer the powers of the presidency against his opponents, something he had accused Biden of doing against him. Wasn't he laying the groundwork for an endless cycle of tit-for-tat retribution?

“Oh, I don't know. I've already gone through it,” the president told us. “I got indicted five different times by five different scumbags, and they're all looking for jobs now, so it's one of those things. Who would have thought, right? It's been pretty amazing.”

Three weeks after our initial phone call, the political complexion of the moment seemed to have shifted rather dramatically, and we wondered if that had changed Trump's thinking. So we called the president's cellphone, hoping to ask some follow-up questions. He didn't answer. We left a voicemail.

That night, Saturday, April 12, Trump traveled from Mar-a-Lago to Miami to watch the mixed-martial-arts spectacle of UFC 314. He entered the arena like a conquering general, surrounded by a coterie of Cabinet secretaries and other high-level advisers and officials. The cheers from the adoring fans were uproarious. After some of the fights, the winner would rush to the side of the ring where Trump was sitting, to demonstrate fealty.

When the fights were over, well after midnight, Trump's motorcade headed back to Air Force One, at the Miami airport. The next morning, one of us awoke to find that, at 1:28 a.m., the president had called, just as the pool report showed he was getting back in his motorcade. He hadn't left a message. Had he been calling to ask if we'd seen what had transpired—the display of obeisance from these gladiators, and from his base? Or was this merely a late-night pocket dial? His team declined to clarify.

We made another appeal for an in-person interview. Later that day, an aide told us Trump was denying our request. But the rejection came with a message from the president—a message, Trump specified, only for Michael, not Ashley, with whom he was still annoyed. If the article we were working on really told the remarkable story of how he had come back from the political dead, “maybe The Atlantic will survive after all.” As is often the case with Trump, his business advice could also be interpreted as a kind of a threat.

The president had one last message for us. “What can be said?” Trump had instructed his aide to tell us. “I won the election in a landslide, and there isn't anyone who can say anything about that. What can they write about?”

We thought we'd finished our story. But for Trump, negotiation is a perpetual state, and nine days later, he reversed himself again. We were asked to report to the Oval Office on the afternoon of April 24 for the interview we had first requested two months earlier. Trump also invited the editor in chief of this magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, whom he had recently attacked as a “total sleazebag,” to join the meeting. Then, hours before we arrived, the president announced the interview to the world.

“I am doing this interview out of curiosity,” he wrote on Truth Social, “and as a competition with myself, just to see if it's possible for The Atlantic to be ‘truthful.' ” Goldberg, he added falsely, was a writer of “many fictional stories about me.” (Several White House aides, upon reading the message, joked about playing a prank on National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, the official who had accidentally added Goldberg to the Signal chat. “Tell Waltz to go into the Oval,” they dared one another, “but don't tell him who's in there.”)

“This will be very, very interesting,” Trump said, by way of greeting us as we approached the Resolute Desk. “You think Biden would do this? I don't think so.”

In private, Trump often plays against the bombastic persona he projects in larger settings—at rallies, on television, on social media. He was launching a charm offensive, directed mainly at Goldberg. There was none of the name-calling or hostility he regularly levels at our magazine. He boasted about the 24-karat gold leaf he'd had imported from Palm Beach to decorate the Oval Office. “The question is: Do I do a chandelier?” he asked. “Beautiful crystal chandelier, top of the line.”

Radio Atlantic: In the Oval Office With Donald Trump

Over the next hour, we asked questions about America's place in the world, the latest challenges to his administration, and his use of his powers to punish his enemies. He often avoided direct answers in order to recite lists of accomplishments. When pressed, he again committed to following the rulings of the Supreme Court. “You have to do that,” he said.

He also sought to distance himself from the most controversial parts of his own presidency. There are “two types of people,” he told us: those who want him to just focus on making the country great and those who want him to make the country great while simultaneously seeking retribution against his supposed persecutors.

“I am in the first group, believe it or not,” he said. (This was indeed difficult to believe, we interjected.) “But a lot of people that are in the administration aren't. They feel that I was really badly treated.” In our presence, he seemed inclined to outsource his retributive id to others. But soon after we left the Oval Office, Trump sought to exact further political revenge on his foes by directing the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, the main Democratic fundraising platform.

When we mentioned the turmoil at the Pentagon, including recent reporting that Pete Hegseth had installed a makeup room in the building, the president smiled. “I think he's gonna get it together,” Trump said of Hegseth. “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.” Trump also said that Waltz was “fine” despite being “beat up” by accidentally adding Goldberg to the Signal chat. What had Trump told his staff after the controversy? “Maybe don't use Signal, okay?”

He spoke of his opposition with earnest befuddlement, if not actual pity. “I think that the Democrats have lost their confidence in the truest sense,” he said. “I don't think they know what they're doing. I think they have no leader. You know, if you ask me now, I know a lot about the Democrat Party, right? I can't tell you who their leader is. I can't tell you that I see anybody on the horizon.”

Trump pushed back on the notion, popular among some Wall Street analysts, that financial turmoil—plummeting markets, the threat of a recession, a weakened dollar—would cause him to roll back his tariff policies. “It always affects you a little bit,” he said, but there's no red line, no “certain number” at which he would feel compelled to change course.

We asked about the concern that his administration was pushing the country toward authoritarianism, where politicians use the power of their office to punish their enemies for speaking their minds, as Trump was attempting to do to Chris Krebs, Harvard, law firms, universities, and news outlets. He did not answer the question directly, but instead talked about how he'd been wronged.

We pressed further, again bringing up his efforts to deport undocumented immigrants without due process. What would happen, we asked, if his administration accidentally got the wrong person—a legal resident, or even an American citizen? “Let me tell you that nothing will ever be perfect in this world,” he said.

Near the end of the interview, we asked Trump why, given that he's now definitively won a second term, he can't just let go of the claim that he won the 2020 election.

The president told us it would “be easier” for him to just accept our assertion. But he couldn't. “I'm a very honest person, and I believe it with all my heart,” he said. “And I believe it with fact—you know, more important than heart. I believe it with fact.”

“I'd like to say that that is reality,” Trump said. “Probably I do create some things, but I didn't create that.”

Never mind that the votes had been counted, the court cases concluded. He was still trying to shift perceptions, make a sale, bend the world to his will.

The price of boneless chicken thighs is finally catching up with the price of white meat.

Few things in life are both cheaper and better, but for a long time, this was true of the chicken thigh. Its superiority was passed like a shibboleth among food connoisseurs: Thighs are juicier, tastier, are almost half the price—preferable in just about every way to the boneless, skinless, flavorless breasts that reign supreme in America.



Well, the secret's out. On a recent trip to the grocery store, I picked up a pack of boneless thighs that cost, pound for pound, some 50 cents more than boneless breasts. In fact, the cost of thighs has crept steadily upward for years now, and surpassed that of breasts for much of last year. In recent months, breasts have gained in price again, but white meat's continued dominance no longer seems assured. Home cooks have embraced the flavor and versatility of dark meat; fast-casual restaurants such as Chipotle and Sweetgreen have it all over their menus. After a decades-long run, America's white-meat era may finally be ending.



That era began in 1980s, when the first plant dedicated to deboned breast meat opened in the United States. “Before that, deboned breast meat was very expensive and rare,” Paul Aho, a poultry-industry consultant, told me. Eating chicken used to mean getting whole chickens, skin and bones and all. But when processing plants started atomizing chicken into their parts, the popularity of boneless, skinless breasts exploded. Americans learned to love not only slabs of white meat but also nuggets, patties, and tenders—processed products made possible by the ubiquity of deboned breasts. In an era obsessed with low-fat, low-cholesterol diets, white meat was deemed the healthier option too. Demand for breasts drove the expansion of the entire American poultry industry, Aho said.



The billions of chickens being raised for breast meat of course also have billions of thighs, legs, wings, and organs, arguably by-products of breast production. U.S. producers learned to export minimally processed leg quarters—an entire thigh and leg with skin and bones—overseas, where consumers did not mind, or even preferred, dark meat. Russia was a major customer, then China, and then Mexico.



The boneless and skinless chicken thigh, however, did not exist as a widespread meat product in the United States until the 2000s. This is also partially a story of industrial innovation: Over time, the thigh-deboning process has become more automated, making boneless dark meat less labor-intensive to produce. The Baader 632 Thigh Filleting System, for example, boasts of processing 230 thighs a minute, by yanking the meat straight off the bone. Aho points out that automation tends to work better with thighs, which have only a single straight bone, than with breasts, which cling to multiple curved bones. Machines that debone breasts usually can't get the muscle off as cleanly, leaving more meat behind.



With the rise of the boneless thigh, American chicken producers saw an opportunity to sell dark meat at home, at prices higher than intact thighs can get overseas. They started producing more deboned thighs. In 2019, the chicken producer Sanderson Farms told the Los Angeles Times that it would soon have thigh-deboning capacity at all seven of its plants for large birds, compared with just one or two a couple of years earlier.



If a fully intact thigh is unmistakably a thigh, the boneless, skinless version is more approachable for Americans raised on similarly processed breasts. Deboned thighs are just as easy to throw on a grill, put in a sandwich, shred, or chop into bite-size pieces for burritos. In fact, they're easier to cook than breasts, because they're less prone to drying out from being left in the pan for five minutes too long. Recipe developers optimizing for easy and quick can tout their “mass appeal.” “I certainly see a lot more praise of dark meat than there used to be,” J. Kenji López-Alt, the food writer and cookbook author, told me. (He personally prefers a perfectly cooked chicken breast, but said it's hard to get right.)



Matt Busardo, who heads up North American poultry for the market-intelligence firm Expana, points to two other reasons for the popularity of thighs: the diversification of the American palate, thanks to the popularity of Asian and Latin American cuisines that prize dark meat, and the rise of fast-casual restaurants, which considered thighs a tastier, more forgiving, and until recently cheaper cut. Chicken breasts are still popular; their sales have been rising this whole time, too. But “thigh meat has kind of overshot that by leaps and bounds,” Busardo told me. Sales of chicken breast by volume are up 3.9 percent in the past three years, but sales of thighs are up 15.9 percent, according to the marketing-research firm Circana.



The historically single-minded focus on breeding chickens for white meat has, ironically, made it less appealing in some ways. Anecdotally, I've heard of shoppers put off by woody breast or spaghetti meat—muscle disorders that result from the breast growing too big too fast. Chicken breasts have nearly doubled in size since the 1950s, and these muscle irregularities became common enough to worry the industry about 20 years ago. Woody breast causes an unappetizing, almost crunchy texture; spaghetti meat comes out mushy and stringy. Tinkering with diets to slow growth or slaughtering birds at lower weights can mitigate woody breast, Casey Owens, a poultry scientist at the University of Arkansas, told me. But a small, slower-growing chicken is a less profitable chicken. Owens has also studied how to make woody breasts more palatable through extra processing. When ground up into patties, she said, the extra connective tissue found in woody breasts makes for a less dense, maybe even preferable, texture.



If the demand for dark meat continues to rise, chickens selected for their big breasts may no longer be economically optimal. Could the industry start breeding birds with bigger thighs? “I've actually brought that up to breeding companies, and 10 or 15 years ago, they would just scoff at the idea,” Aho said. “Now they say, ‘We might need a more balanced bird.'”

The president's economic policy has put unions in an awkward position.

by  Abdallah Fayyad

President Donald Trump's tariffs have drawn a lot of opposition — from economists, businesses, Wall Street, and the majority of Americans.

Yet Trump has received support from a seemingly unlikely source: Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, who staunchly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and previously called Trump a “scab.”

A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad.

”We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,” Fain said when Trump announced tariffs on foreign-made cars late last month. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions.” (The UAW did not respond to a request for an interview.)

He's not the only labor leader who supported tariffs. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country's largest labor unions, also endorsed Trump's policy, going so far as to support not just specific levies but across-the-board tariffs. (A spokesperson told Newsweek that the union is hopeful about the tariffs' long-term effects.) But that doesn't mean all unions or their members are enthused. Other leaders and rank-and-file members have criticized the president's blanket approach to import tax. And Liz Shuler, the president of AFL-CIO, a federation of unions in the United States, issued a statement criticizing Trump's overall policy.

Fain himself has since qualified his praise. “We support use of some tariffs on automotive manufacturing and similar industries. We do not support tariffs for political games about immigration or fentanyl,” he said in an address to UAW members after Trump announced his full tariff plan earlier this month. “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”

The mixed reviews that tariffs have received from unions reflect the awkward position some have found themselves in. For decades, unions, particularly those representing manufacturing workers, have argued against free-trade agreements and in favor of more protectionist policies, including tariffs, which they believe will help save American jobs in their industries. And now, the president of the United States is supporting that vision.

The problem is that Trump's tariffs will be harmful to the economy and will likely hurt the working class most — the people, in other words, who unions aim to represent. So where does this leave the long-standing union talking point that tariffs would be good for American workers? 

Manufacturing jobs in the United States have been declining for decades, and free trade — where countries can export and import goods without restrictions — is often said to be the culprit. In particular, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) gets much of the blame for lost jobs. Trump's tariffs might be “chaotic,” as Fain told NPR earlier this month. “But, you know, we've sat here for the last 30-plus years, with the inception of NAFTA back in 1993–‘94, and watched our manufacturing base in this country disappear.”

NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Since it took effect, many American factories moved to Mexico for cheaper labor — a financially appealing option for companies that could then produce goods for lower costs without having to worry about paying tariffs. Between 1997 and 2022, an estimated 70,500 US manufacturing establishments closed. Critics of the agreement claim that this dynamic has forced US-based manufacturing employees to accept lower wages out of fear their factories would relocate south of the border.

That outcome is why unions opposed NAFTA from the start. As the agreement was being negotiated, labor unions tried to stop it and the then-president of AFL-CIO called the agreement a “poison pill.”

Estimates vary on how many jobs have actually been lost. About 700,000 positions were eliminated directly as a result of NAFTA, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and many more as a result of other trade agreements. You can see the manufacturing industry's decline reflected in union membership. In the 1970s, UAW had a high of 1.5 million members. By 2023, the union had fewer than 400,000 members. 

As a result, unions see NAFTA and other free trade agreements as a roadblock to higher wages and long-term job security, which is why they have often advocated for more protectionist policies.

In the post-NAFTA era, the prevailing consensus among economists is that free trade has enjoyed broad political support from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington, while free trade might hurt some industries, its benefits outweigh the costs. Overall, free trade is still largely viewed as a driver of global economic growth.

But free trade doesn't mean fair trade. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 — ramping up trade between the US and China — the barrage of Chinese imports into the United States cost Americans, by some estimates, millions of jobs.

As workers' wages and job prospects struggled, evidence of the downsides of trade liberalization — particularly the widening pay gaps between workers and bosses — was hard to ignore, even by some free trade proponents. “The combination of changing patterns of trade, in which more activity takes place with low-wage economies, and new research has altered economic thinking on trade,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote in 2015. “The consensus view now is that trade and globalization have meaningfully increased inequality in the United States by allowing more earning opportunities for those at the top and exposing ordinary workers to more competition, especially in manufacturing.”

When President Barack Obama rallied to get support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement between countries in the Pacific Rim — in 2015, he faced fierce opposition from unions but also skepticism from politicians, some of whom had long railed against free trade and others who changed their minds. Trump famously opposed the policy, as did Sen. Bernie Sanders during their 2016 presidential campaigns. And Hillary Clinton, who initially praised the proposed accord, came out against it during that election season.

That's not to say that unions always oppose any kind of trade deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated to replace NAFTA during his first term, received union support because it included better labor protections than its predecessor. But in general, union opposition to unfettered free trade has continued. 

“In truth, our trade deals were not really trade deals; they were investment deals. Their goal was not to promote America's exports — it was to make it easier for global corporations to move capital offshore and ship goods back to America,” Richard Trumka, the former president of AFL-CIO, said in 2015. “The logical outcome was trade deficits and falling wages, and that's exactly what we got.”

For unions, tariffs were a part of the answer to failures of free trade along with other protectionist policies. But to free trade proponents, tariffs represent a break from consensus and threaten to break down trade relations across the globe.

While the way Trump has implemented tariffs has been irresponsible, the fact that he has is viewed as a step in the right direction. “Even though in [Fain's] heart of hearts he realizes that Trump has rolled these [tariffs] out in a — pick your adjective — disjointed, sloppy, incoherent manner, he believes that a lot more needs to be done to protect and preserve manufacturing in the US,” said Steven Greenhouse, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. “He rightly says that free trade has been very bad for manufacturing in the US. And in Fain's mind, an effective way to rebuild manufacturing is through tariffs.”

Tariffs can indeed be part of a solution to bolster manufacturing industries in the United States, as long as they're implemented strategically and coupled with a more coherent vision for boosting American industry, which would include subsidies and investments aimed at spurring growth in certain sectors. That's how former President Joe Biden imposed tariffs. 

But Trump's policy is too broad, inconsistent, and lacking in clear objectives. And if the pause on the tariffs does end up being temporary, his policy could throw the United States into a recession, threatening all kinds of jobs, including those in manufacturing sectors.

So while some unions and their members might support the idea of tariffs to help shore up certain industries, it's not clear that Trump's policy will get Republicans more union support in the long run, especially if the forecasts about how Trump's tariffs would impact the economy turn out to be true. And at the end of the day, it's difficult to see how Trump's blanket tariff policy will, on its own, revive American manufacturing. As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, the American economy has changed, transitioning from manufacturing to services, and the idea that we can reverse that trend is a “false promise.”

“I fear that the horses are out of the barn,” Greenhouse said. “It's really hard to get back those millions of manufacturing jobs.”

It's time to take a hard look at your own finances — and theirs.

by  Jonquilyn Hill

Money is always stressful, but between on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs, inflation, and a general sense of uncertainty, all things finance have been especially anxiety-inducing lately.

Much of the advice given is geared toward people who have time to make up losses in the stock market. But what if you're retired or close to retirement age? That's the matter at hand on this week's episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's call-in podcast where we answer the questions that matter to you most. 

Washington Post personal finance columnist Michelle Singletary knows that worry firsthand. She's on the edge baby boomer and Gen X and is looking ahead to when she's no longer working. “Like many people, I'm stressed to the max,” she says. “So I am punching a lot of pillows and crying and screaming and doing a little cussing, but trying to not let the fear dictate moves. And that's the key.” 

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

What other advice does she have for people looking to retire soon? And how should those of us who have more time talk with our older loved ones about their retirement plans? Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

What should people who are approaching retirement age be doing right now in this economic moment?

You want to do a retirement budget. Figure out what it would take if you retired to live in retirement. And if you have a shortfall, then there are some things that you need to do. 

Try to boost your savings. Try to look at your housing situation. Can I cut housing? Can I have a roommate? Do I need to move someplace that is more affordable? So you have to do some forward thinking before you retire to make sure that your finances are as secure as possible.

I have to admit something: I was particularly interested in this episode because my parents are boomers. What advice do you have for listeners that are like me?

It's understandable that you're concerned about your parents because if they're not prepared, then that burden may fall on you. I say burden, not in a sense of you don't want to do it, but certainly when you are in your 30s, 40s, and early 50s, you're trying to get ready for your own retirement. 

But I think this is a good opportunity to have open conversations. This is a window to say, “Hey, How are you positioned? Are you worried? Is there anything I should be concerned about? Is there something I can do differently to help you?” And maybe that'll open up a conversation where they say, “No, we're fine. We're really worried, but we got things in control. Here's what's happening.” 

It's a very difficult conversation to have, especially if you've grown up in a household where money wasn't talked about a lot. For a younger adult to try to come to their parents and say, “Hey, you got any money? What's going on?” — that's a hard conversation. But the roles aren't reversed. You are not their parents. You are now an adult friend who happens to be their child. 

How do you recommend that listeners start that conversation with the retirement-age folks in their lives?

Start with yourself and your own feelings. Say, “I'd love to talk to you about this because I'm a little worried. I'm saving for retirement and this is what's concerning me.” And then you say, “How about you?” What you don't want to do is say something like, “Do you have any money? What's going on?” You don't want to come at them in a more adversarial way. You should see each other as companions and accountability partners. 

What should people prioritize when they look at their finances right now?

In this moment, cash is king. If you got a tax refund, I would be saving that. If you were already just getting by — maybe you weren't living paycheck to paycheck but there wasn't much left over — I would be stockpiling cash in a high-yield savings account in case you lose your job, in case the economy really does go into a recession, if it gets worse than it is now.

The prudent thing right now is to not get into any kind of debt or use a lot of cash that you might need if you lose your job. 

If I was a federal employee, a federal contractor, anybody whose income is derived from the federal government in a significant way, I would be canceling vacations. I would not be doing major home improvement projects. I don't want to make people panic — although it's perfectly fine if you're scared because that's just human nature. But I will say the prudent thing right now is to not get into any kind of debt or use a lot of cash that you might need if you lose your job. 

What are the different ways people can help their parents financially without getting behind on their own goals?

Do your own budget, and make sure that you have a cash cushion for yourself. Make sure that you are saving in a way that will hopefully help you have a secure retirement. Get rid of all your debts: If you got credit card debt, student loan, car note — everything except for your mortgage. Then, if all of that is taken care of, if you want to create an account where you put some money in every month to say, “This is the money that I'm gonna designate to help my parents or maybe another relative.” My husband and I do that. We have a family and friends fund so that if somebody loses their job or has some difficulty, this is where we pull the money to help them out. 

What advice do you have for people who are at retirement age but haven't been able to save as much? How do they prepare for this moment?

The first thing I would say is don't beat yourself up. You are where you are. Accept that, but do something about it. If you are getting close to retirement, then you've got to make some hard decisions. Look at your housing situation. You might have to say, “You know what? Those young adults that were asking me about my money? Maybe I have to move in with them or they move in with me.” And so you look at the big parts of your budget and how you might change that.

Financial advice can admittedly be a little frustrating because we hear the same thing over and over again. “Sit tight, stay the course, don't make any rash decisions.” What do you say to people who feel antsy right now? Who want a different answer than what they usually hear?

Listen, good advice is good advice, no matter what. Good advice is timeless. And people want a microwave answer to a problem that needs to be baked in the oven. You can't microwave your way away from this situation. You just can't. 

There is no secret recipe or secret anything. We know by history. The market eventually returns historically. Could it change in the future? Sure it can. But we have decades and decades of data that show that when we go into an economic downturn, we come out because it's in everybody's interest to make sure that happens. And so while you may be tired of us saying, “Hold tight,” you might be tired of us saying, “Don't make rash decisions,” that is the best advice. We know that when you make decisions in haste, when you make decisions based on your emotions, you make bad decisions.

I will not tell you not to panic when the market goes down. I will not tell you that because it is human to be mad and angry and upset and scared. Be all of those. Just don't make decisions in that moment.

A political scientist explains “oligarchy” and argues that America has earned that label.

by  Lee Drutman

Joe Biden, in his farewell address, argued that “an oligarchy is taking shape in America.” More recently, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd of 10,000 in Arizona that “we are witnessing an oligarchy in America.”

Biden and Ocasio-Cortez are hardly the first to diagnose the United States as an oligarchy. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been warning about it for years. So have many others, though, recently, Sen. Elissa Slotkin has pushed back against Democrats using the word.

So, are they right? Are we an oligarchy? If so, when did we become one? And: How bad is it?

The concept of oligarchy goes back to ancient Greek philosophy. Aristotle's concept of oligarchy is laid out in his Politics, in which the philosopher distinguished among six possible forms of government. The best form was divine kingship: The monarch rules for the good of all. But this was unlikely. More likely was that the monarch would rule only for the monarchy, hence devolving into its deviant twin, tyranny.

Aristocracy, or rule by an enlightened elite, was a better alternative, assuming a virtuous few could be found to serve. But like kingship, aristocracy ran the risk of devolving into its ugly doppelgänger — in this case, oligarchy.

In an oligarchy, the elite few rule for their own personal enrichment, leaving everyone else worse off.

Which is similar to Biden's definition: “…extreme wealth, power, and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.”

And Ocasio-Cortez's definition: “…When those with the most economic, political and technological power destroy the public good in order to enrich themselves at the price of millions of Americans.”

Some might prefer the label “plutocracy” because it more literally means “rule by the wealthy.” But effectively, the two have become synonymous in the US, where wealth all but ensures political purchase. The basic idea is consistent — a handful of very wealthy individuals use their riches to shape and influence the government on their own financial behalf.

Democracy and oligarchy can coexist because they operate on different axes, the political scientist and oligarchy scholar Jeffrey Winters told me. In short, the more power is in the hands of the very wealthy, the more oligarchic the society. But even under these conditions, if elections are free and fair and formal individual rights are secure, we are still living in a democracy.

The tension arises when the majority of voters decide they don't like an unequal distribution of wealth and want a more equal distribution.

The tension deepens when the very wealthy — the oligarchs — use their wealth to influence political outcomes in their favor to prevent this democratic redistribution.

Even here, some tug-of-war is normal. Oligarchs may prefer to maintain a democracy and accept some level of redistribution because that is the price of stability. But the more concentrated the wealth and power, the more uneasy the bargain. And the bargain is indeed growing uneasy in the United States.

Oligarchy exists on a continuum, so there is not a single moment someone can point to and say that a country is now officially an oligarchy. But by analyzing data on economic inequality and money in politics, America starts looking distinctly oligarchic by the beginning of the 21st century.

Consider some stats from a comprehensive 2020 RAND report: In 1975, the median full-time American worker earned $42,000 (in 2018 dollars). In 2018, the median was $50,000, a slight increase.

But for those in the top 1 percent of earners, the bottom salary went from $257,000 in 1975 to $761,100 in 2018 — almost tripling. And the average income in the top 1 percent went from $289,000 to $1,384,000 — more than quadrupling.

In other words, almost all gains in the economy have gone to the very top of the income distribution. The paper's authors estimate that if the US had maintained the 1975 distribution of income, the median income as of 2018 would be $92,000 instead of $50,000.

Similarly, the share of income going to the top 1 percent has gone from about 10 percent in 1980 to over 20 percent in 2023. During this period, the level of inequality in the United States has gone from being pretty typical of developed countries to being on the extreme fringe.

Then there is the active involvement of the super-rich in politics. 

For example: that iconic image from Donald Trump's inauguration, with tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Sundar Pichai (Google), and Elon Musk lined up in support, with Apple's Tim Cook and TikTok's Shou Zi Chew nearby.

There is the official Cabinet of oligarchs. Though precise net worths are hard to pin down, the concentration of wealth is undeniable. Linda McMahon at Education (net worth estimated at $3 billion, combined with her husband); Howard Lutnick at Commerce (at least $2 billion); Kelly Loeffler at Small Business (at least $1 billion); Scott Bessent at Treasury (at least $500 million, combined with his husband); and Jared Isaacman for NASA (a longtime ally of Musk, also worth more than $1 billion). Plus Trump himself, who's reportedly worth $5.1 billion, though his accounting is famously untrustworthy. (By contrast, Biden's Cabinet members were mostly mere millionaires.)

And Congress. Though there are no billionaires, roughly half of the current Congress has a net worth of over $1 million, according to one tracker. The richest member appears to be Rick Scott, a former health care CEO, worth about half a billion. Very few representatives come from the working class.

“One reason oligarchs are in such a giddy moment is because they have picked up on the signals that what they are doing is permissible.”

Finally, there is the money spent on politics. Campaign finance limits who can even run for office, with early fundraising success as the golden ticket.

This fundraising money comes from some of the wealthiest Americans. Take the brazenness of the world's richest man, Musk, spending $291 million, or billionaire Timothy Mellon shelling out $197 million, or billionaire Miriam Adelson spending $148 million, all to support Republicans in the last election. These are extreme sums of money. They make Michael Bloomberg's $64 million in 2024 seem small.

By one estimate of publicly disclosed contributions, the 0.1 percent wealthiest Americans contributed about 16 percent of campaign dollars in the 2020 presidential election, while the top 1 percent contributed about 33 percent, a figure that has been roughly consistent throughout the 2010s. 

“One reason oligarchs are in such a giddy moment is because they have picked up on the signals that what they are doing is permissible,” Winters said. “In the past, there was a sense it was not okay to commandeer entire campaigns with just a handful of people funding them — that seems to have been lost.”

In earlier years, the very wealthy tended to prefer less transparent, stealthier ways of influence. Many recognized that being too public was likely to backfire. They preferred to hide their contributions through “dark money.” But these days, the super-wealthy are hiding less and getting out front more.

A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad.

There are certainly divisions among super-rich political financiers. On many social and cultural issues, the very rich are deeply polarized.

But on fiscal issues, there is much more consensus. The political opinions of the very wealthy are more fiscally conservative than the average voter. For example, in survey data from 2009, 52 percent of the general public supported a redistribution of wealth via taxes on the rich. In contrast, only 17 percent of the wealthy agreed.

Meanwhile, corporate lobbying dramatically outspends countervailing forces like unions and public interest groups. In my 2015 book, The Business of America Is Lobbying, I calculated that there is 34 times more spending by business interests than by these countervailing groups. This allows powerful companies to maintain a constant presence in the halls of power.

While money doesn't guarantee specific outcomes, it effectively constrains the policy options that both Republican and Democratic majorities are willing to consider, particularly regarding tax and regulatory advantages that benefit the wealthy.

So while America has been moving in this direction for a while, “we are really at peak oligarchic power,” Winters said. “This is in-your-face oligarchy. … The sheer visibility is incredible.”

The US has always had aspects of oligarchy. The Senate (originally appointed by state legislatures) was to represent the elite; the House was to represent the people. The Electoral College was to keep the people at a distance from the presidency.

And America's republican form of democracy has always wrestled with the same tension that Aristotle faced: How do we share power and wealth?

More economic inequality weakens social trust and government legitimacy, which in turn weakens support for democracy.

All forms of government give power to some group of decision-makers and not others. All free economies generate some level of inequality. No successful government has ever shared power or resources completely evenly, but successful governments have found a balance. 

So what happens now? 

American voters are extremely angry and distrustful. They think our political system is fundamentally broken and needs major change. Trump has long been the successful avatar of that anger and distrust. But he is also supported by some of the very wealthiest Americans.

This is not necessarily a contradiction. It is one tried-and-true answer to what the political scientist Daniel Ziblatt has called the “conservative dilemma.” In an unequal society, the party of the wealthy has a choice — it can embrace democracy even if it means some redistribution. Or it can try to undermine democracy by elevating divisive cultural and racial issues that will redirect conflict away from questions of wealth redistribution, further polarizing and dividing society. This appears to be what Trump is doing.

The political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson call this situation “plutocratic populism,” in their book, Let Them Eat Tweets. Similarly, a new paper calls the GOP's tense coalition of uber-wealthy elites and resentful non-wealthy regular people “plutopopulism.” The wild card aspects of Trump's populism — and its uneasy electoral dependencies on anti-elitist grievances — reflect the tenuous coexistence of democracy with increasingly excessive concentrations of wealth.

Meanwhile, as the Democrats also attract more uber-wealthy supporters, anti-establishment attitudes are turning against both parties. 

Consider the relationship between support for democracy and share of income going to the top 1 percent: The more unequal the economy, the less support for democracy. More economic inequality weakens social trust and government legitimacy, which in turn weakens support for democracy.

And support for democracy has notably fallen in the US, at a time of increasing inequality.

One possible future is that the rich continue to defend their wealth, but the quality of democracy continues to decline, perhaps sliding into autocracy. Elections become less fair; political corruption becomes more blatant. Cynicism turns to apathy. Citizens focus on their own survival, and that of their immediate families, and go more quietly. 

Progressives are often fond of quoting Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court: “We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.” Yet, the reality has been otherwise here for decades. We have had both.

But the tensions are mounting. The balance is increasingly unstable. At some point, one will have to win out. The question is whether we will actually get the choice.

The US wants central and eastern European countries to join its path of “energy freedom” instead of following the wider region's transition to a net zero economy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in Warsaw.

The Energy Secretary told the Three Seas Business Forum — which numerous leaders from the region attended Monday — that western Europe chose the wrong path of expensive “top-down imposition of enforced climate policies.” He argued that renewables investments weigh on growth and boost revenues of foreign companies, and that eastern Europe should pick a different path.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

An exclusive analysis shows that the US president's views on the war in Ukraine are increasingly aligned with the Kremlin.

By Bloomberg News

Share this article

Donald Trump's Russia policy has been sounding very familiar to the Kremlin.

Since Trump's phone call with Vladimir Putin on Feb. 12, their first direct contact since Trump's return to office, there's been a shift in US rhetoric that has seen the president begin to echo specific Russian talking points on the war in Ukraine, according to a Bloomberg analysis of his public comments.

Bloomberg used a Large Language Model to scan more than 300 of Trump's public comments between August 2024 and mid-March as well as more than 3,000 social media posts from the president and members of his administration since the start of 2025. The technique allows for comparing meaning across large volumes of text, even if the specific wording differs.

The results, which were reviewed by reporters, showed a correlation between Trump administration contacts with Putin and subsequent comments that echoed the Russian leader's own positions on subjects including the occupation, Kyiv's goal of joining NATO and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's political legitimacy.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for Trump's National Security Council, said: “It's embarrassing the media is using outdated and stale democrat talking points in an attempt to disrupt President Trump's efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the war in Ukraine.”

Detailed information about Trump's private conversations with Putin is scarce, but European leaders including Germany's Olaf Scholz have said that the Russian leader tends to repeat his public positions on Ukraine at length in their calls.

“Trump parrots Putin,” said Fiona Hill, who served as the top Russia adviser on the US National Security Council in the president's first term. “He wants to get close to Putin.”

Trump is seeking to unlock tens of billions of dollars in potential business deals by remaking the economic relationship between the US and Russia. And to do that he needs to resolve the war in Ukraine.

As a consequence, the US has made concession after concession to Putin, even offering to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, a Kremlin demand since it occupied the Black Sea peninsula in 2014 that successive administrations — including in Trump's first term — have rejected.

And yet the peace deal that Trump had promised early in his term has still not materialized and the president is getting frustrated. “It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along,” Trump said April 26 in a social media post.

Putin, for his part, has a simple goal, Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said: “To make friends with Trump.”

Trump revealed his first publicly announced contact with Putin since retaking the US presidency on
    Truth Social, saying they had a “lengthy and highly productive phone call.”

The Russian leader has also taken to echoing his US counterpart. Putin has encouraged Trump's claims on Greenland, a semi-autonomous island that's part of NATO ally Denmark, and repeated Trump's unsubstantiated claims of election fraud in Joe Biden's 2020 victory.

A few days after Trump was sworn into office in January, Putin told a Russian state TV interviewer: “I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president, if his victory had not been stolen from him in 2020, then maybe there would not have been the Ukraine crisis that broke out in 2022.”

Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to a request for comment.

“The media seemingly is advocating more death and more destruction in this unnecessary war that wouldn't have started if President Trump was in office,” Hughes, the NSC spokesman, said. “Russia didn't dare invade a neighbor during President Trump's first term yet did so under Biden and Obama. President Trump is taking action to clean up their mistakes.”

A new period of direct US contact with the Russian president began around Feb. 11 when Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff had the first of several lengthy meetings with Putin.

Trump and Putin spoke by phone for about 90 minutes on Feb. 12. The following day, Trump ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and said that Kyiv's aspirations to join the alliance had caused the war.

“They've said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO. They said that very strongly. I actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war.”

“There have been five, now six, waves of NATO expansion. They sought to transform Ukraine into their stronghold, an ‘anti-Russia'.”

Putin's demand that Ukraine never join NATO has been a central aim of his February 2022 invasion even as the attack spurred Sweden and Finland to join the defense alliance, greatly expanding its border with Russia. The US under President Joe Biden and its European allies said Ukraine had a sovereign right to apply for membership, which they supported even as NATO never set a date for entry.

Five days later, Witkoff traveled to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Trump, meanwhile, raised another Kremlin talking point in comments to reporters, criticizing martial law imposed in response to the Russian invasion and calling Zelenskiy a “dictator without elections.”

Witkoff, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio meet Russian officials to discuss how to end the war.

“We have a situation where we haven't had elections in Ukraine. Well, we have martial law, essentially martial law in Ukraine, where the leader in Ukraine, I mean, I hate to say it, but he's down at four percent approval rating.”

“The Kiev regime does not allow the very idea of cessation of hostilities because in this case the pretext for extending martial law disappears. And if the martial law has to be cancelled, it means that the elections, which were not held on time, will have to be held.”

While Putin has repeatedly denied Zelenskiy's legitimacy since the Ukrainian president's term formally expired in May 2024, the analysis shows that Trump only began raising the issue after he'd spoken to the Russian leader.

Ukraine cannot legally hold elections under the martial law that was imposed following the Russian invasion.

“A dictator without elections, Zelenskiy better move fast or he's not going to have a country left. Got to move. Got to move fast, because that war is going in the wrong direction.”

“Just like in 2014, the executive power in Ukraine has been usurped and is held illegally. In fact, we are dealing with an illegitimate government.”

“He refuses to have elections. He's low in the real Ukrainian polls.”

“[But] the chances of winning them are close to zero for the Ukrainian rulers who have lost their ranking and legitimacy.”

Another day later — and a week after their conversation — Trump also mimicked Putin's claim that Zelenskiy had extremely low approval ratings even as it was demonstrably untrue. A Ukrainian opinion poll conducted immediately after Trump's remarks showed Zelenskiy's trust rating among respondents rose to 65% from 57% the previous month. Only Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former top military commander who's now Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, scored higher.

The Kremlin seems to have “been successful to a large extent in shaping Trump's views on Ukraine,” said Gabriel Gatehouse, author of “The Coming Storm,” a book which investigated how conspiracy theories shaped the US political landscape.

“I love Ukraine, but Zelenskiy has done a terrible job. His country is shattered, and millions and millions of people have unnecessarily died. You can't bring a war to an end if you don't talk to both sides. You got to talk. They haven't been talking for three years.”

“We were not the ones who refused to negotiate. The Ukrainian side has forbidden itself to negotiate. Not us.”

Witkoff's second meeting with Putin was on March 13. Following that conversation he gave an extensive interview to Tucker Carlson, a Trump enthusiast who interviewed Putin himself at length in February 2024.

Witkoff told Carlson the US is “at war with Russia through our proxy Ukraine” and that occupied Ukrainian territories had held “referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.”

Again, those arguments echoed Putin's long held public positions, which he articulated frequently, including at a BRICS summit Oct. 18.

“NATO is fighting us, but they are fighting this proxy war using Ukrainian soldiers,” Putin told reporters there. “We asked the opinion of the people themselves and held referendums,” Putin told Russian Foreign Ministry officials in June 2024 as he sought to justify the illegal occupation of parts of Ukraine. “We did what the people decided.”

Actually, Russia organized those votes after its invasion of eastern and southern Ukraine sent millions of residents fleeing the fighting. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the referendums a “violation of the UN Charter and international law,” and other nations refused to recognize the results.

Witkoff traveled to Moscow to seek Russia's agreement to a 30-day ceasefire.

“They are surrounded by Russian soldiers. And I believe if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be here any longer. I was able to get them not to do anything at this moment but it is a bad situation in Russia and it is a bad situation in Ukraine.”

“I would like to say that we have noted today's appeal by the US President, Mr. Trump, to spare the lives of the Ukrainian servicemen, blocked by Russian forces in the Kursk Region incursion zone.”

While Trump and his team are evidently echoing Putin's talking points, it's unclear whether that's the result of Kremlin influence or their own determination to end the war at all costs, according to one former US official. Witkoff isn't naive about Putin, the official said.

After Witkoff's visit, Trump posted on Truth Social on March 14 that he'd “strongly requested” Putin to spare thousands of Ukrainian soldiers he said were “completely surrounded.” Kyiv had denied televised claims by Putin two days earlier that Ukrainian troops were encircled in fighting in Russia's Kursk region and being “systematically destroyed.”

Putin responded within hours to the “appeal by the US President,” telling a meeting of his Security Council that Ukrainians who surrendered would be spared. Trump later claimed his action had saved the Ukrainian soldiers.

Putin's claims on Crimea and the four partially occupied regions of eastern and southern Ukraine resurfaced in the US media after Witkoff's third meeting with Putin on April 11. 

“This peace deal is about these so-called five territories,” Witkoff told Fox News.

The talks in St. Petersburg mark a renewed diplomatic push, coming after Trump expressed frustration at the pace of negotiations with Russia.

“This peace deal is about these so-called five territories, but there's so much more to it. I think we might be on the verge of something that would be very, very important for the world at large.”

“The residents of Kherson and Zaporozhye have expressed their position in referendums, and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as well as the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, have become part of the Russian Federation. And there can be no talk of disturbing our state unity. The people's will to be with Russia shall be inviolable.”

Trump himself picked up Putin's narrative once again on April 14 when he told reporters in the Oval Office that Ukraine had started a conflict which had, in fact, begun with the Russian invasion.

“You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,” he said, complaining about Zelenskiy's repeated requests for weapons.

To be sure, Trump's growing impatience to seal a peace deal has also prompted him occasionally to criticize Putin. After at least 12 people were killed when Russia unleashed its biggest air attack on Ukraine so far this year, Trump called the bombardment “not necessary” on his Truth Social platform on Thursday, adding: “Vladimir, STOP!”

But a day earlier, Vice President JD Vance had been underscoring Putin's territorial argument, telling reporters in India that “the current lines, somewhere close to them is where you're ultimately, I think, going to draw the new lines in the conflict.”

On Friday, Witkoff was in Moscow for further talks with Putin as Trump pushed to seal a peace settlement as soon as possible. The White House said Trump had a “productive” meeting with Zelenskiy at the Vatican on Saturday, where they attended the funeral of Pope Francis.

“It's just manipulation 101,” Hill said. “They're giving it as a masterclass.”

IBM on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers.

""We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities,"" IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a release.   

The company's announcement comes weeks after President Donald Trump unveiled a far-reaching and aggressive ""reciprocal"" tariff policy to boost manufacturing in the U.S. As of late April, Trump has exempted chips, as well as smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components, from the tariffs.

IBM said its investment will help accelerate America's role as a global leader in computing and fuel the economy. The company said it operates the ""world's largest fleet of quantum computer systems,"" and will continue to build and assemble them in the U.S., according to the release.

IBM competitor Nvidia, the chipmaker that has been the primary benefactor of the artificial intelligence boom, announced a similar push earlier this month to manufacture its NVIDIA AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. 

Nvidia plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. via its manufacturing partnerships over the next four years.

Last week, IBM reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. The company said it generated $14.54 billion in revenue for the period, above the $14.4 billion expected by analysts. IBM's net income fell to $1.06 billion, or $1.12 per share, from $1.61 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

IBM's infrastructure division, which includes mainframe computers, posted $2.89 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating expectations of $2.76 billion.

The company announced a new z17 AI mainframe earlier this month.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday put the responsibility for reaching a trade agreement on China.

""I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable,"" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

The comments come with markets on edge over the direction of tariffs following President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of broad-based global duties. A week later, Trump said he would keep in place 10% across-the-board tariffs but table for 90 days more aggressive levies against individual trading partners.

Since then, the U.S. has made progress in negotiations, Bessent said, singling out India for a potential deal in coming days among 15 to 18 ""important trading relationships"" that are subject of negotiations.

""We've had many countries come forward and present some very good proposals, and we're evaluating those,"" he said.

""I would guess that India would be one of the first trade deals we would sign. So watch this space,"" Bessent added.

In addition to his assessment of the situation with China and other Asian countries, Bessent charged that European nations are likely ""in a panic"" over the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar since the trade tensions began. The euro has risen nearly 10% this year against the greenback after the currencies had reached near parity in early January.

""You're going to see the [European Central Bank] start cutting rates to try to get the euro back down,"" Bessent said. ""Europeans don't want a strong euro. We have a strong-dollar policy.""

Administration officials have sent mixed signals recently regarding the state of negotiations.

Trump last week said he was talking with Chinese officials about trade as they visited Washington. However, other reports indicated that negotiations were not taking place as the officials instead were in town for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings.

Bessent insisted that the White House will not be conducting negotiations in the press.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that International Monetary Fund meetings took place last week.

In this article

Mark Zuckerberg's plan is to make Meta the market leader in artificial intelligence. Investors will want to know how President Donald Trump's tariffs-heavy trade policies will impact that strategy. 

Those answers could start to come as soon as this week as Meta's AI strategy takes center stage when the company hosts its first Llama-branded conference for AI developers on Tuesday then reports its latest quarterly earnings the next day.

Already, tech companies are starting to talk about the potential impact they're bracing for as a result of the Trump tariffs. 

Intel Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said Thursday during the chip giant's first-quarter earnings call that U.S. trade policies ""have increased the chance of an economic slowdown, with the probability of a recession growing."" Meanwhile, Google CFO Anat Ashkenazi said that day during a first-quarter earnings call that the tech giant remains committed to its $75 billion investment in capital expenditures, or capex, this year, but also acknowledged that the ""timing of deliveries and construction schedules"" could cause some quarter-to-quarter spending fluctuation. 

For now, analysts expect Meta to follow Google's lead and remain firm in its plan to spend as much as $65 billion in capex for AI infrastructure this year when it reports earnings Wednesday. Some analysts believe Meta could even raise the figure because AI is a core priority for the company.

""We do not expect META to cut its CapX guidance of $60B-$65B in 2025, for its GenAI infrastructure,  because they see this as an important 10-year investment, we believe,"" Needham analysts wrote in a research note published Wednesday. ""However, tariffs add risks of upward cost revisions.""

Investors will also be monitoring Meta's LlamaCon event at its Menlo Park, California, headquarters for any signs that its AI investments are having an immediate business impact. This will be the first time Meta hosts a developer conference specifically for its Llama family of AI models.

""Investors want to see ROI on all these AI investments, and while Meta has shown clear benefits from leveraging AI to improve its products and drive faster revenue growth, it's been hard to quantify those benefits,"" Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali told CNBC.

Meta in April released a couple of its new Llama 4 models, which Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox previously said can help power so-called AI agents that can perform tasks for users via web browsers and other online interfaces.

It's critical that Meta keep improving Llama to create a major business involving AI agents that companies can use to interact with their customers within apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart said.

""Meta has an early mover advantage at scale in a multi-trillion dollar market,"" Schackart said in an email. ""We believe Meta is very well positioned to leverage its billions of global users across multiple platforms.""

Meta is unlikely to curb its Llama investment anytime soon, but should eventually consider doing so if it fails to generate enough money to justify its costs, said Ken Gawrelski, a Wells Fargo managing director of equity research.

""We do believe that over time Meta needs to continue to evaluate whether Llama needs to be competitive with the leading-edge models,"" Gawrelski said. ""This is a very expensive proposition and thus far, unlike Google, Meta does not directly monetize its model in any material way.""

Analysts are also following the Meta AI digital assistant. That's because the ChatGPT rival represents the second pillar of Zuckerberg's AI strategy. 

Zuckerberg in January said he believes 2025 ""is going to be the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant.""

In February, CNBC reported that Meta was planning to debut a stand-alone Meta AI app during the second quarter and test a paid subscription service, in which users could pay monthly fees to access more powerful versions like users can with ChatGPT. 

Although Meta's enormous user base across its family of apps gives Meta AI an advantage over rivals like ChatGPT in terms of reach, they may not interact with Meta AI in the same way they do with rival chat apps, said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan.

Gawrelski said that people may not want to use Meta AI within Facebook and Instagram if all they want to do is passively watch the short videos that Meta algorithmically recommends to their feeds.

""This is why a separate Meta AI, where Meta could clearly articulate its use case and value proposition, could be helpful,"" Gawrelski said.

A stand-alone Meta AI app could help the company better market the digital assistant and distinguish it from rivals, said Debra Aho Williamson, founder and chief analyst at Sonata Insights.

""ChatGPT has such wide brand awareness, that it's become a moat that is soon going to be very hard to overcome,"" Williamson said.

WATCH: The FTC has an uphill battle in its antitrust case against Meta.

The clock is ticking on trade deals that the U.S. will need to strike with many nations, most notably China, to avoid what Trump's Treasury Secretary has described as an ""unsustainable"" tariffs war. But in the U.S. farming sector, the damage has already been done and the economic crisis already begun.

U.S. agriculture exporters say the global backlash to President Trump's tariffs is punishing them, especially a decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products, leading to cancelled export orders and layoffs. Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a leading export trade group for farmers, tells CNBC the number of canceled purchases of U.S. agriculture should not be described as approaching a crisis. ""It is a full-blown crisis already,"" he said.

Data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday revealed China made its biggest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, halting a shipment of 12,000 tons of pork.

AgTC says ""massive"" financial losses are already being shared by its members as a result of the trade war, based on reports it is receiving from member companies.

A wood pulp and paperboard exporter reported to the trade group the immediate cancellation or hold of 6,400 metric tons in a warehouse and a hold of 15 railcars sitting in what is known in the supply chain as ""demurrage,"" when fees are charged for delayed movement of goods. Meanwhile, the exporter said there are 9,000 metric tons on the water to China expected to arrive on May 13 and facing the threat of costly diversion to Chinese bonded warehouses or to other countries as Chinese buyers may refuse the cargo and abandon it at port.

One grass seed exporter told AgTC it received two weeks notice that eight loads were being canceled by Chinese customers despite vessels bookings already being in place.

At a recent stakeholder meeting at the Port of Oakland headquarters regarding tariff impacts, Port of Oakland Executive Director Kristi McKenney warned that a tariff-induced downturn in the port's cargo volume — whether from import slowdowns or retaliatory export losses — ultimately could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.

McKenney cited retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, as well as manufactured goods, as essential exports that move through Oakland. Exports include almonds, beef, pork, dairy, and recycled materials, much of which is destined for Asia. China ranks as the port's top import trading partner and third export partner, representing 29% of Oakland's total trade volume.  

Unlike many U.S. ports that lean heavily on imports, Oakland is unique in maintaining a near 50/50 balance of imports and exports. That leaves Oakland concerned that tariff retaliation would directly impact its top export destinations — Japan, Taiwan, China, and South Korea — and could significantly erode California's market share for perishable and high-value commodities.

The Port of Oakland is the No. 1 refrigerated export gateway in the U.S and nearly all containerized cargo moving through Northern California goes through the Port of Oakland.

""So many local, union jobs depend on the Port's robust shipping operations including dockworkers, truck operators, and warehouse workers,"" said Democratic Party Congresswoman Lateefah Simon. ""I support smart trade policies that uplift workers and lower costs for Oakland's working families – not an illogical and retaliatory trade war.""

Agricultural exporters are warning that there are not additional markets to quickly replace China's demand and absorb the volume, and that is already impacting prices.

""We have diverted employees and production to other (less profitable) production and dramatically slowed down purchasing from independent venders (loggers, truckers, sawmills),"" one lumber exporter reported to AgTC.  Some products have already declined 20% in market value, the lumber exporter reported, which it said will influence inventory planning and future investments. ""The U.S. market was stable and improving, but now awash with inventory of former China products,"" it added.

An exporter of forage such as hay and straw that is a big business for U.S. farms supplying overseas livestock operations reported 68 blanked sailings after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" limiting its ability to export forage goods, with vessel space for exports restricted on freight ships still calling on U.S. ports.

""The worry is the vessel space that remains is going to be the most expensive/most 'premium' services that our product cannot absorb without selling at a loss. Being a high volume, low value item, we cannot afford drastic increases in ocean freight,"" the forage exported reported to AgTC.

There has been a sharp decline in China to U.S. vessel traffic, down 22.15% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year through April 14, according to the Vizion Global Ocean Bookings Tracker.

""What we've seen in the last two weeks is a continued correction in booking demand for U.S. imports, especially U.S. imports from China,"" said Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion. ""We are now seeing this translate to a drop in departures as well,"" he added.

A hay exporter in Central Washington that sends a large amount of its crop output to Hong Kong and mainland China was told to reroute most of the exports shipped in the past two weeks to Japan, Dubai, Taiwan, and a few Chinese ports. Those changes came a cost to the company, and it told the AgTC, ""it's not sustainable, no one can replace all the volume that China buys.""

The hay exporter immediately put a stop on all orders in process, and has begun layoffs.

""We had to adjust our employee count down by 12 persons. This accounts for one-fourth of our total employees,"" it wrote. The company said it has been communicating to customers and employees a hope that ""hasty and reckless decision-making at the top of our country will reverse, easing deep troubles that we are facing at this time."" 

In addition to the tariff backlash, agriculture is facing another looming financial challenge with the recently announced SHIPS Act measures approved by the US Trade Representative, with Chinese-made vessels calling U.S. ports to be charged port fees of upwards of $1.5 million starting in the fall.

Bulk agriculture was carved out of the port fees imposed under the USTR rule, but agriculture shipped in containers is not exempt from the fees. Friedmann said an exemption is essential because the most valuable U.S. agriculture exports are shipped in containers, not bulk.

Containerized exports include refrigerated beef, pork, poultry, fruit, vegetables, dairy, and processed foods such as french fries. Cotton, forage (hay, alfalfa), nuts, dried dairy, lumber, paper, and soybeans for human consumption are also shipped in containers. ""Efforts to exempt all agriculture exports, including containerized agriculture, are continuing,"" Freidmann said.

Based on U.S. trade data, the share of U.S. agriculture moved in containers is approximately 25% by volume and nearly 55% by value. 

The USTR did not respond to a CNBC request for comment on fee exemptions for containerized agriculture.

""So much of our future lies in the hands of so few,"" a hay exporter wrote to AgTC. ""We plead for those few to take a very long careful look at what can be done to keep shipments flowing while they work out the trade imbalances and perceived differences.""

BEIJING — Senior Chinese officials on Monday outlined plans to support jobs and help exporters, while hinting at the possibility of more stimulus in light of rising trade tensions with the U.S.

In just a few weeks, tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have more than doubled to over 100%, forcing Chinese factories to pause production and tell some workers to stay home. Exports have been a rare bright spot in China's economy, which has faced pressure from lackluster consumption and a real estate slump.

""Labor market stability remains a critical concern for Chinese policymakers, given its direct linkage to social stability and consumption recovery,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report Sunday. They estimate around 16 million jobs in China are involved in the production of goods exported to the U.S.

Authorities on Monday acknowledged the impact of trade tensions on jobs at exporting companies. China has repeatedly emphasized that consumption is its priority for the year. But Monday's press conference focused more on efforts to stabilize employment.

The briefing came after the human resources ministry on Friday announced subsidies for companies that hire recent graduates, but did not specify an amount. Officials speaking Monday spoke broadly about plans to promote entrepreneurship, increase vocational skills training and better distribute wages to workers in fields with ""urgent"" needs.

China will provide financial support to exporters so they ""will have more confidence to take orders,"" Sheng Qiuping, vice minister of commerce, told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

He pointed to recent measures, together with the National Development and Reform Commission economic planning agency, to help exporters sell products domestically and reduce operating costs such as rent.

Sheng was speaking alongside senior officials from the economic planner, central bank and human resources ministry.

On top of existing employment pressures, a record 12.22 million higher education graduates are entering China's job market this year, up by 430,000 from a year ago, according to official figures.

China's urban jobless rate among those aged from 16 to 24, excluding students, stood at an elevated level of 16.5% in March, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. That marked a modest dip from 16.9% in the prior month. The overall unemployment rate for the working-age population in cities eased slightly to 5.2% in March from a two-year high of 5.4% in February.

The People's Bank of China tends to cut rates when the labor market appears soft, Goldman Sachs analysts said, citing historical precedent. They predict that by the end of September, China will cut policy rates by 20 basis points, while enacting a 50 basis point cut for the reserve requirement ratio, or the amount of cash banks need to have on hand.

Chinese officials' comments on Monday followed a high-level Politburo meeting on Friday that called for targeted measures to help businesses, and said the central bank would cut rates as needed.

China is confident it can achieve its full-year growth target of around 5%, and will introduce incremental stimulus as the macroeconomic situation changes, Zhao Chenxin, deputy head of the the economic planning agency, told reporters.

He emphasized that policies to boost consumption and establish a state-level tech development fund would be implemented by the end of June.

Beijing has ramped up economic support since late September, but measures so far have not cumulated in the large-scale stimulus that many investors have hoped for. Gross domestic product grew by a better-than-expected 5.4% in the first quarter from a year ago.

""We think policymakers are waiting on more clarity around the tariff impact before committing to more sweeping stimulus,"" Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note Monday. Second-quarter gross domestic product ""is very likely to decelerate substantially, as exports falter and more than offset the momentum behind stimulus-charged investments.""

Higher German infrastructure spending will boost Europe's economic growth in the coming years — but not enough to outweigh the expected drag from U.S. tariffs, according to Alfred Kammer, director of the European department at the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF last week cut its growth outlook for the euro area, also making downgrades for the U.S., U.K. and many Asian countries due to President Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy.

The institution cut its euro area growth forecasts for each of the next two years by 0.2 percentage points, to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026.

""It's the tariffs and the trade tensions which weigh on the outlook rather than the positive effects on the fiscal side,"" Kammer told CNBC's Carolin Roth in an interview at the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings last week.

""What we see is we have a meaningful downgrade for Europe advanced economies... and for the emerging euro area countries double as much over this two-year period.""

The negative impact of tariffs will be slightly offset by Germany's recent infrastructure spending bill, which will boost growth in the euro area over those two years, Kammer said.

Exemptions passed to Germany's longstanding debt rules have unlocked higher defense spending and enabled creation of a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) infrastructure and climate fund. The move has been described by economists as a potential ""game changer"" for the sluggish economy — the largest in the euro zone.

However, optimism has been shaken by U.S. tariffs, which are widely expected to dampen global growth and trade flows.

Several policymakers at the European Central Bank told CNBC last week that while the inflation path appeared positive — with tariffs potentially bringing inflation in the bloc down further — their broader outlook was now significantly more uncertain.

The IMF's Kammer said that the ECB should only cut interest rates once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, despite growth risks.

The ECB has so far reduced rates seven times in quarter-percentage-point increments, starting in June 2024. Its most recent move lower in April took the deposit facility, its key rate, to 2.25%.

""We have a very clear recommendation for the ECB. What we saw so far is a huge success in the disinflation effort and monetary policy has worked ... so we are expecting to sustainably hit the 2% inflation target in the second half of 2025,"" Kammer told CNBC.

""Our recommendation is there is room for one more 25-basis-point cut, in the summer, and then the ECB should hold that 2% policy rate unless major shocks hit and there is a need for recalibrating monetary policy,"" he added.

Overnight index swap pricing on Monday pointed to market expectations for two more quarter-point cuts this year.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" ideology, which, generally speaking, prioritizes the domestic over the international, rests on the assumption that the world needs America more than it needs the world.

This may be true for the status quo. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and among the biggest exporters, according to the World Integrated Trade Solution, a database provided by the World Trade Organization. And its policies are already being felt: Factories in China are struggling to fill their order books because of increased export costs to the U.S.

But change is afoot. Countries are finding ways to respond to Trump's nationalistic gestures.

Southeast Asian nations, which suffered the brunt of Trump tariffs, are banding together to increase intra-regional trade and diversify their export destinations. China, after assessing the severity of Trump's threats, seems to be ready to strengthen its fiscal stimulus, and is likewise expanding to other overseas markets.

It's not like the U.S. has a monopoly over all aspects of international affairs, either. China controls much of the supply chain of rare earth elements as well as critical minerals like nickel and copper. Trump's green light to deep-sea mining of those elements is a sign the U.S. is playing catch-up with China.

An ""America First"" policy may backfire as it drives other countries to take measures that could leave the U.S. behind.

Asia markets tick upMajor U.S. indexes climbed Friday, concluding the week in the green. The S&P 500 rose 0.74% Friday to mark its first four-day winning streak since January. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.05%. However, stock futures edged lower Sunday evening local time. Asia-Pacific markets ticked up Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 added around 0.4%. Shares of Tokyo-listed Toyota Motor rose roughly 3.7% on reports the company is exploring a potentially 6 trillion yen ($42 billion) deal to acquire Toyota Industries.

China calls for more economic supportChina plans to help struggling businesses with ""multiple measures"" and called for ""timely reductions"" of interest rates in the face of ""increased external shocks,"" according to a readout of a Politburo meeting chaired Friday by President Xi Jinping, translated by CNBC. The meeting of the Politburo, the second most powerful political body in China, comes as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up.

Factories in China halting workChinese manufacturers are pausing production and sending workers home as the impact of U.S. tariffs sets in, according to companies and analysts. This phenomenon is largely occurring in the export hubs of Yiwu and Dongguan for now, said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. But Chinese companies are already turning to customers in Europe and Latin America to make up for a slowdown in exports to America.

Trump signs order to boost deep-sea miningU.S. President Donald Trump signed on Thursday a sweeping executive order to jump-start the controversial practice of deep-sea mining, which uses heavy machinery to remove minerals and metals from the seabed. The move attempts to shore up America's access to strategically important minerals such as nickel, copper and rare earth elements, offsetting China's dominant position in critical mineral supply chains.

Southeast Asian countries turn to each otherExport-oriented Asian countries were hit hard by Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and the ensuing U.S.-China trade war. China is among the biggest trade partners for those countries, while the U.S. serves as their strategic partner in areas like defense and development. Instead of picking a side, however, the region's nations are developing their own economies and strengthening trade ties with each other.

[PRO] Eyes on earnings and dataMore than 180 companies in the S&P 500 report their results this week, making it the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, notes CNBC's Sarah Min. Companies to look out for include Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. Investors should also watch the personal consumption expenditures price index, out Wednesday, and nonfarm payrolls, out Friday.

Indian airlines can't fly over Pakistan. Here's how that is affecting flights

Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines Thursday is forcing carriers to alter some routes that link India to Europe, North America, Central Asia and the Middle East.

The airspace closure comes amid tit-for-tat reactions from the nuclear-armed neighbors, following the killing of 26 tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in the northwestern India-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Indian carriers — including Air India, IndiGo, Akasa Air and SpiceJet — must now fly longer, and thus costlier, flights on some westbound routes. The detour could push some flights to add a refueling stop or cancel certain routes altogether.

Indian carriers will pay a price, but passengers may not see airfares go up by much because of Pakistan's airspace closure, said John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation intelligence company OAG.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","From mining giants to Big Oil, major players are jumping on the 'white hydrogen' bandwagon","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/28/natural-hydrogen-mining-giants-and-big-oil-jump-on-the-bandwagon.html","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 05:07:57 GMT","



A growing number of sizable companies, from mining giants to energy majors, are embracing the hype for natural hydrogen.

It comes as buzz continues to build over the potential for a resource that advocates say could radically reshape the global energy landscape.

Natural hydrogen, sometimes known as white, gold or geologic hydrogen, refers to hydrogen gas that is found in its natural form beneath Earth's surface. The long-overlooked resource, first discovered by accident in Mali nearly 40 years ago, contains no carbon and produces only water when burned.

Investor interest in the nascent natural hydrogen sector has been intensifying in recent months, fueling optimism initially driven by research startups and junior exploration companies.

Over the past year or so, some of the sector's established backers include mining giants Rio Tinto and Fortescue, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom, the venture capital arm of British oil giant BP and Bill Gates' clean tech investment fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Exploratory efforts are currently underway in several countries across the globe, with Canada and the U.S. leading the way in terms of project counts over the last year, according to research published by consultancy Rystad Energy.

Analysts expect the year ahead to be a pivotal one, with industry players hoping their exploration campaigns can soon locate the elusive gas.

Not everyone's convinced about the clean energy potential of natural hydrogen, however, with critics flagging environmental concerns and distribution challenges. For its part, the International Energy Agency has warned there is a possibility that the resource ""is too scattered to be captured in a way that is economically viable.""

Minh Khoi Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad Energy, said it's difficult to predict whether natural hydrogen can live up to its promise in 2025.

""I guess last year was the year that things got really interesting for the natural hydrogen space because that's when many companies started to plan drilling campaigns, extraction testing and we started to see some major players start to get involved as well,"" Le told CNBC by video call.

""Since then, I would say the progress has been relatively slow. There are only a few companies that have actually started drilling,"" he added.

Rystad's Le, who characterized the global pursuit of natural hydrogen as a ""white gold rush"" last year, said that while there'd been no major progress over the last 12 months, an upswing in investor interest could help to deliver some meaningful results.

""Now, we are starting to see companies getting investment, so they have money to fund their drilling campaigns. So, if we are to get an answer of whether this thing will work, we'll get to that conclusion a bit faster this year,"" Le said.

Hydrogen has long been billed as one of many potential energy sources that could play a key role in the energy transition, but most of it is produced using fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, a process that generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.

Green hydrogen, a process that involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, is one exception to the hydrogen color rainbow. However, its development has been held back by soaring costs and a challenging economic environment.

Australia's HyTerra announced an investment of $21.9 million from Fortescue in August last year, noting that the proceeds would be used to fully fund expanded exploration projects.

A spokesperson for Fortescue, one of the leading green hydrogen developers, said its push into the natural hydrogen sector was in line with its ""strategic commitment to exploring zero emissions fuels.""

Acknowledging that more work is required to fully assess natural hydrogen's emissions profile, Fortescue's spokesperson described the technology as a ""promising opportunity"" to accelerate industrial decarbonization.

Elsewhere, BP Ventures, the venture capital arm of BP, led a Series A funding round of U.K.-based natural hydrogen exploration startup Snowfox Discovery earlier this year, while France-based start-up Mantle8 recently received 3.4 million euros ($3.9 million) in seed funding from investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund founded by Bill Gates in 2015.

Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, said the fund had backed the likes of Mantle8 and U.S.-based startup Koloma because the promise of natural hydrogen is such that it ""could unlock a new era of clean, homegrown energy.""

""Hydrogen is pure reactive chemical energy. If we have enough hydrogen and it's cheap enough, we can do almost anything. We can use it to make metals, make fuels, you could even make food, and all with far fewer emissions than conventional approaches,"" Toone told CNBC via email.

""We know it's out there and not just in isolated pockets. Early exploration has identified natural hydrogen across six continents. The challenge now is figuring out how to extract it efficiently, move it safely, and build the systems to put it to work,"" he added.

Aurian Durbuis, chief of staff at France's Mantle8, said momentum certainly appears to be building from a venture capital perspective.

""There is a growing interest, indeed, especially given the dynamics with green hydrogen right now, unfortunately. People are turning their eyes to other solutions, which is in our favor,"" Durbuis told CNBC by video call.

Based in Grenoble, in the foothills of the French Alps, Mantle8 is targeting the discovery of 10 million tons of natural hydrogen by 2030 to complement the European Union's goals.

""The question is can we find producible reservoirs, in the oil and gas terminology. That's really what we need to figure out as an industry,"" Durbuis said.

""We think we can drill in 2028 and hopefully that is the eureka moment because if we can find something at that time, then it could obviously be a game changer. If we find highly concentrated hydrogen, with pressure, then this just changes everything,"" he added.

The Hydrogen Science Coalition, a group of academics, scientists and engineers seeking to bring an evidence-based view to hydrogen's role in the energy transition, said exploration for natural hydrogen is still at an ""embryonic stage"" — but even so, the likelihood of locating large finds of nearly pure hydrogen that can be extracted at scale look ""relatively slim.""

The world's only producing hydrogen well in Mali, for example, supplies ""just a fraction of the daily energy output of a single wind turbine,"" Arnout Everts, a geoscientist and member of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, told CNBC via email.

""Taking the evolution of US shale-gas as an analogy, even if large finds are made, it will likely take decades to achieve industrial production,"" Everts said.

Ultimately, the Hydrogen Science Coalition said the pursuit of natural hydrogen risks distracting focus from the renewable hydrogen needed to decarbonize industries today.

BEIJING — Chinese manufacturers are pausing production and turning to new markets as the impact of U.S. tariffs sets in, according to companies and analysts.

The lost orders are also hitting jobs.

""I know several factories that have told half of their employees to go home for a few weeks and stopped most of their production,"" said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. He said factories making toys, sporting goods and low-cost dollar store-type goods are the most affected right now.

""While not large-scale yet, it is happening in the key [export] hubs of Yiwu and Dongguan and there is concern that it will grow,"" Johnson said. ""There is a hope that tariffs will be lowered so orders can resume, but in the meantime companies are furloughing employees and idling some production.""

Around 10 million to 20 million workers in China are involved with U.S.-bound export businesses, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. The official number of workers in China's cities last year was 473.45 million.

Over a series of swift announcements this month, the U.S. added more than 100% in tariffs to Chinese goods, to which China retaliated with reciprocal duties. While U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday asserted trade talks with Beijing were underway, the Chinese side has denied any negotiations are ongoing.

The impact of the recent doubling in tariffs is ""way bigger"" than that of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Ash Monga, founder and CEO of Guangzhou-based Imex Sourcing Services, a supply chain management company. He noted that for small businesses with only several million dollars in resources, the sudden increase in tariffs might be unbearable and could put them out of business.

He said there's so much demand from clients and other importers of Chinese products that he's launching a new ""Tariff Help"" website on Friday to help small business find suppliers based outside China.

The business disruption is forcing Chinese exporters to try new sales strategies.

Woodswool, an athleticwear manufacturer based in Ningbo, near Shanghai, quickly turned to selling the clothes online in China via livestreaming. After launching the sales channel about a week ago, the company said it's received more than 30 orders with gross merchandise value of more than 5,000 yuan ($690).

It's a small step toward salvaging lost business.

""All our U.S. orders have been canceled,"" Li Yan, factory manager and brand director of Woodswool, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

More than half of production once went to the U.S., and some capacity will be idle for two to three months until the company is able to build up new markets, Li said. He noted the company has sold to customers in Europe, Australia and the U.S. for more than 20 years.

The venture into livestreaming is part of an effort by major Chinese tech companies, at the behest of Beijing, to help exporters redirect their goods to the domestic market.

Woodswool is selling its products online through Baidu, whose search engine app also includes a livestreaming e-commerce platform. Li said he chose the company's virtual human livestreaming option since it allowed him to get up and running within two weeks, without having to spend time and money on renovating a studio and hiring a team.

Baidu said it has worked with at least several hundred Chinese businesses to launch domestic e-commerce channels after this month announcing it would provide subsidies and free artificial intelligence tools — such as its ""Huiboxing"" virtual humans — for 1 million businesses. The virtual humans are digitally recreated versions of people that use AI to mimic sales pitches and automate interactions with customers. The company claimed that return on investment was higher than that of using a human being.

E-commerce company JD.com was one of the first to announce similar support, pledging 200 billion yuan ($27.22 billion) to buy Chinese goods originally intended for export — and finding ways to sell them within China. Food delivery company Meituan has also announced it would help exporters distribute domestically, without specifying an amount.

However, $27.22 billion is only 5% of the $524.66 billion in goods that China exported to the U.S. last year.

""A few businesses have told us that under 125% tariffs, their business model is not workable,"" Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters Friday. He also noted more competition among Chinese companies in the last week.

Tariffs from both countries will likely remain in place at a certain level, with exemptions for certain tariffs, Hart said. ""That's exactly what they're backing into.""

Products branded and developed for a suburban U.S. consumer might not directly work for a Chinese apartment dweller.

Manufacturers have gone directly to Chinese social media platforms Red Note and Douyin, the local version of TikTok, to ask consumers to support them, but fatigue is growing, pointed out Ashley Dudarenok, founder of ChoZan, a China marketing consultancy.

Fewer and fewer Chinese companies are considering diverting exports to the U.S. through other countries, given rising U.S. scrutiny of transshipments, she said. Dudarenok added that many companies are diversifying production to India over Southeast Asia, while others are turning from U.S. customers to those in Europe and Latin America.

Some companies have already built businesses on other trade routes from China.

Liu Xu runs an e-commerce company called Beijing Mingyuchu that sells bathroom products to Brazil. While his business has run into challenges from fluctuating exchange rates and high container shipping costs, Liu said he expects trade with Brazil will ultimately not be that affected by China's tensions with the U.S.

China's exports to Brazil doubled between 2018 and 2024, as have China's exports to Ghana.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ghana-based Cotrie Logistics was founded to help businesses with sourcing, coordinate shipments amid port delays and build dependable logistics routes, said CEO Bright Tordzroh. The company primarily works in trade between China and Ghana and now makes $300,000 to $1 million annually, he said.

The U.S.-China trade tensions have led many companies to explore sourcing and manufacturing locations outside the United States, Tordzroh said, which he hopes can create more opportunities for Cotrie.

U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" ideology, which, generally speaking, prioritizes the domestic over the international, rests on the assumption that the world needs America more than it needs the world.

This may be true for the status quo. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and among the biggest exporters, according to the World Integrated Trade Solution, a database provided by the World Trade Organization.

But change is afoot. Countries are finding ways to respond to Trump's nationalistic gestures.

Southeast Asian nations, which suffered the brunt of Trump tariffs, are banding together to increase intra-regional trade and diversify their export destinations. China, after assessing the severity of Trump's threats, seems to be ready to strengthen its fiscal stimulus.

It's not like the U.S. has a monopoly over all aspects of international affairs, either. China controls much of the supply chain of rare earth elements as well as critical minerals like nickel and copper. Trump's green light to deep-sea mining of those elements is a sign the U.S. is playing catch-up with China.

An ""America First"" policy may backfire as it drives other countries to take measures that could leave the U.S. behind.

Winning week for stocksMajor U.S. indexes climbed Friday, concluding the week in the green. The S&P 500 rose 0.74% Friday to mark its first four-day winning streak since January. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.05%. However, stock futures edged lower Sunday evening local time. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index added 0.35% Friday, its fourth consecutive daily gain. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed 0.1% up for its 10th straight positive session, extending its longest winning run since 2019.

China calls for more economic supportChina plans to help struggling businesses with ""multiple measures"" and called for ""timely reductions"" of interest rates in the face of ""increased external shocks,"" according to a readout of a Politburo meeting chaired Friday by President Xi Jinping, translated by CNBC. The meeting of the Politburo, the second most powerful political body in China, comes as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up.

Trump signs order to boost deep-sea miningU.S. President Donald Trump signed on Thursday a sweeping executive order to jump-start the controversial practice of deep-sea mining, which uses heavy machinery to remove minerals and metals from the seabed. The move attempts to shore up America's access to strategically important minerals such as nickel, copper and rare earth elements, offsetting China's dominant position in critical mineral supply chains.

Southeast Asian countries turn to each otherExport-oriented Asian countries were hit hard by Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs and the ensuing U.S.-China trade war. China is among the biggest trade partners for those countries, while the U.S. serves as their strategic partner in areas like defense and development. Instead of picking a side, however, the region's nations are developing their own economies and strengthening trade ties with each other.

[PRO] Eyes on earnings and dataMore than 180 companies in the S&P 500 report their results this week, making it the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, notes CNBC's Sarah Min. Companies to look out for include Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. Investors should also watch the personal consumption expenditures price index, out Wednesday, and nonfarm payrolls, out Friday.

Inflation job nearly done but tariff risks loom — what European Central Bank members said this week

European Central Bank policymakers whom CNBC spoke to at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's Spring Meetings this week broadly stuck a dovish tone, indicating they saw interest rates continuing to fall and few upside risks to euro zone inflation.

Christine Lagarde, European Central Bank president, said that the ""disinflationary process is so much on track that we are nearing completion.""

However, all stressed the current high levels of uncertainty, the need to keep monitoring data, and the high risks to the growth outlook. Lagarde, for instance, cautioned that the world economy is experiencing ""shocks"" that will be ""a dampen on GDP.""

Echoing her sentiment, Klaas Knot, president of The Netherlands Bank, said ""the uncertainty that is created by the unpredictability of the tariff actions by the U.S. government works as a strong negative factor for growth.""

04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27

Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion.""

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip.

Now, as Binance's chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, ""major"" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce"" shock.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a ""higher for longer"" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom.

“The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar.

The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell's relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates.

“Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, ""in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high.""

The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs' head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar's weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump.

04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares.

""We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven,"" CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report.

The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.”

“Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. 

“Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales' (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.”

Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades.""

""Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets,"" Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling"" from technology stocks.

""Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset,"" Jacobs said. ""The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion.""

BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year.

In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been ""wrong"" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as ""an index of money laundering,"" admitting bitcoin is ""digital gold” and a ""legitimate"" financial instrument.

The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital ""revolution"" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

 Coinbase will launch its Bitcoin Yield Fund on May 1 to offer 4%–8% returns for institutional investors seeking passive income on Bitcoin holdings. 

Coinbase, the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is launching the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund on May 1, aiming to offer Bitcoin (BTC) exposure for institutional investors outside the US.

The fund targets an annual net return of 4% to 8% on Bitcoin holdings, according to an April 28 blog post by Coinbase.

“To address the growing institutional demand for bitcoin yield, Coinbase Asset Management is excited to introduce the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF),” the company wrote.

The fund is backed by multiple investors, including Aspen Digital, a digital asset manager based in Abu Dhabi and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.

The yield will be generated through a cash-and-carry strategy, through the difference between spot Bitcoin prices and derivatives.

Unlike Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Bitcoin holders can't generate passive income through staking — a gap the fund is aiming to fill, according to the announcement:

The new fund seeks to lower the investment and operational risks typically associated with Bitcoin yield products, which Coinbase says will better align with the risk appetite of institutional investors.Related: Stacks Asia expands Bitcoin initiatives with Abu Dhabi partnership

Coinbase cited growing institutional crypto adoption as the reason behind the launch of the funds, which may have been the reason behind Bitcoin's significant price recovery over the past week.

Bitcoin rose by more than 9% in the week leading up to April 28, bolstered by exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, which recorded their second-highest week of inflows at over $3 billion, Farside Investors data shows.

Bitcoin's recovery to $94,000 was mainly supported by growing “ETF inflows and corporate buying,” amid lagging retail interest, Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, told Cointelegraph, adding:

On April 21, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that this might be the “last chance” to buy Bitcoin below $100,000, as the incoming US Treasury buybacks may signal the next significant catalyst for Bitcoin price.

Ethereum's potential 100x gas limit growth over four years prompts calls for a cautious implementation approach.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist has proposed a significant change to the network's gas limit, aiming to boost transaction capacity and network performance.

On April 27, Feist submitted Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698, suggesting that Ethereum's gas limit should grow 100 times over the next four years through automated client-side settings.

According to Feist:

“The current gas limit mechanism relies on miner/operator voting, which lacks coordination and predictability. While flexible, this approach can lead to stagnation or overly cautious increases.

By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency.”

Ethereum community member Fabda.eth explained that Feist's plan would result in a 100-fold increase that would push the network's capacity to around 3.6 billion gas, supporting approximately 2,000 transactions per second and 6,000 transactions per block.

This would significantly increase the network's current gas limit of approximately 36 million.

Notably, Feist's proposal aligns a similar suggestion by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In February, Buterin advocated for a tenfold gas limit increase, arguing that it would support transaction inclusion and application development on the base layer, despite growing reliance on Layer 2 solutions.

While many within the community see potential benefits of expanding the blockchain network's gas limit, several developers voiced caution about Feist's proposal aggressive growth pace.

Lukasz Rozmej, an Ethereum core developer, cautioned that any expansion should either be manually agreed upon or kept gradual to avoid unexpected network strain.

Ethereum Foundation developer Jochem Brouwer echoed these sentiments. He warned that targeting a 100x increase within four years could prove too aggressive.

Instead, he advocated a more measured approach, suggesting a 2x gas limit increase over the next six months.

Brouwer added:

“Let's do this in steps before we have the majority of the nodes committed to this 100x increase in 4 years schedule and we will have a problem when we find out the limit is getting too high (then we thus need to coordinate with all nodes to opt-out and shut it down again).”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices are stabilizing at around $93,500 and $1,770 at the time of writing on Monday, following a rally of over 10% and 12% the previous week. Ripple (XRP) price also rallied 8.3% and closed above its key resistance level last week, indicating an uptrend ahead.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and declined slightly over the next two days. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $93,500. 

If BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological importance level.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 65 after being rejected around its overbought level of 70 on Saturday, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Bitcoin's price could experience a sharp decline.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC continues its upward momentum and closes above $95,000, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000.

Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on Tuesday and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. However, ETH retested the daily resistance level at $1,861 the next day and declined slightly. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $1,773.

If ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

The RSI on the daily chart stands at 53 and points downward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Ethereum's price could experience a sharp decline.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

XRP price continued to trade above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average at $1.98 last week, rallied over 8%, and closed above the daily resistance level at $2.23 on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $2.24.

If XRP continues its upward trend, it will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 57, above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum. 

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around the $2.23 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

XRP climbs over 3% on Monday, hovering around $2.33 at the time of writing. The rally is likely catalyzed by key market movers like XRP futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) approval by the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a bullish outlook. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing above $94,000 at the time of writing on Monday, following a 10% rally the previous week. The institutional demand supports a bullish thesis, as US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded a total inflow of $3.06 billion last week, the highest weekly figure since mid-November.

Ethereum (ETH) recovered the $1,800 price level on Saturday after US spot Ether ETFs (exchange-traded funds) recorded their first weekly inflows since February.

Defi Development Corporation (formerly Janover) filed a registration statement with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, signaling its intent to offer and sell a wide range of securities, including common and preferred stock, debt instruments and warrants for the purchase of equity

Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality

Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months.

On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month.

Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift.

By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin's fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future.

In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders.

Although this goes against Bitcoin's decentralization ethos, it's undeniably bullish for its price.

Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst

Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin's market cap to $200T.

Some critics warn that Strategy's debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency's protocol.

Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin's hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case.

If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin's scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now.

Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency's coattails, it's the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet.

These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin's growth.



What's more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin's price increases by $25K.

The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on.

Don't miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here's a guide on how to buy it.

A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it'd be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they've taken off is an uphill task.

That's why you're better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice.



$MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone's opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode.

Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI's newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves.

If you buy $MIND today, you'll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token.

Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks.

It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It's currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market.

As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come.



Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity.

They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity's popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is.

Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now.

With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC.

However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns.

Bitcoin continues to assert its leadership across the digital asset market, with Bitcoin Dominance climbing to a new local high of 64% as of April 22. This metric, which tracks Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap, highlights a clear and growing shift in capital toward BTC as the asset rallies past $90,000, currently trading at $92,700.

With Bitcoin now just 18% off its all-time highs, the asset's performance becomes even more impressive when stacked against traditional markets. The S&P 500 remains approximately 15% below its record levels, while the Nasdaq Composite lags by more than 20%. This comparison reinforces Bitcoin's relative strength and increasing appeal as a macro asset—especially in a market where liquidity remains tight and investors are gravitating toward quality.

Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you.

This resurgence in BTC dominance comes at a time when ETF inflows are once again picking up steam, fueling renewed institutional interest. The regulatory landscape, while still evolving, appears to be stabilizing in Bitcoin's favor, especially when compared to the murky and often unpredictable regulatory path facing many altcoins.

Altcoins, by contrast, are struggling. Outside of isolated daily pumps, most of the altcoin market remains in a downtrend or in accumulation phases far from previous highs. Many lack the institutional interest, product-market fit, or meaningful on-chain activity to justify significant upside in the current environment. Fundamentally, the disparity between Bitcoin and most alts has never been clearer—and the market is pricing that in.

That said, some names did show strength. SUI was a standout performer, posting a gain of over 20% on the day and currently trading at $2.60. Despite the bounce, it remains more than 100% away from its all-time high, reminding investors how deep the bear market drawdowns have been for many newer Layer 1s and speculative projects.

Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.

Ethereum also posted a notable move, gaining 10% in a single session to trade at $1,745. While a positive development, ETH still has a long way to go—needing a 170% rally just to revisit its former highs near $4,900. The underperformance of ETH, traditionally seen as Bitcoin's closest competitor, further illustrates the widening gap in investor confidence between BTC and the rest of the market.

This growing disparity underscores more than just price action—it highlights a changing narrative. Bitcoin is being recognized not only as a risk asset but increasingly as a long-term store of value, particularly in uncertain times. The rise in BTC dominance is a reflection of capital rotating into perceived safety, and away from speculative ventures with shaky fundamentals.

To be clear, this doesn't mean altcoins are obsolete—though let's be honest, many are. But it does show how hard it is to consistently “beat the market” when Bitcoin is the market.

As BTC.D continues to climb, it sends a clear and resounding message: in crypto, strength leads. And right now, Bitcoin is doing just that.

 BNB price has shown resilience throughout all stages of the current bull market, but is it fundamentally stronger than its competitors? 

What to know:

Altcoins have lagged Bitcoin year-to-date, but BNB price shows relative resilience, trading only 10% lower than the previous cycle's all-time high.

BNB Chain shows a robust activity, consistently ranking third in daily transactions, active addresses, and TVL, while leading in the number of DApps.

The blockchain's weakest point is its revenue, which still lags compared to competitors.

Altcoin price action has been underwhelming for much of the 2023-2026 cycle, pushing many crypto traders to focus primarily on Bitcoin. However, with moderate optimism returning to the markets, a closer look reveals that not all altcoins are struggling. In fact, the total altcoin market cap remains solidly above $1 trillion — $1.17 trillion, to be exact — and its 9% surge over the past week offers a glimmer of hope.

Among the major altcoins, BNB Chain (BNB) stands out for its relative strength and stability. Currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind BTC, ETH, USDT, and XRP, BNB is valued at around $89 billion. Some analysts see it as one of the most resilient altcoins in the current cycle.

As João Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, pointed out, using data from the cryptocurrency drawdown heatmap:

For Wedson, this resilience isn't just about price action — it's also backed by solid foundations, such as BNB Chain's well-developed ecosystem and BNB's rising role in DeFi. He calls BNB “one of the rare altcoins with real utility, strong fundamentals, and growing adoption, making it the strongest-performing altcoin alongside BTC.”

Looking solely at price performance among top smart contract platforms' coins tells a more nuanced story. BNB has indeed reached a new all-time high during this cycle, but so have XRP (XRP), TRX (TRX), and SOL (SOL) — though in Solana's case, the new high barely surpassed its 2021 peak by just 1%.

When comparing current prices to their previous cycle highs (mostly from May or November 2021), BNB is now down only about 10%. That's significantly better than ETH (ETH), which is down 63%, and Solana, down 40%. However, XRP (+19%) and TRX (+49%) have performed even better.

One of BNB's monetary advantages lies in its low dilution risk. According to Messari's Market Cap/Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) ratio, 96.51% of BNB's supply is already in circulation. That's in line with Ethereum (99.93%) and TRX (99.96%), indicating a relatively low risk of future token inflation. In contrast, Solana (86.33%) and especially XRP (58.33%) could face significant future dilution.

While BNB's price performance has been relatively strong, it alone doesn't entirely justify its reputation for resilience; fundamentals offer deeper insight.

Beyond speculation, BNB's value is defined by its use in BNB Chain — an umbrella term now used to define both BNB Smart Chain (the original blockchain) and the Beacon Chain (used for governance and staking). BNB Chain specializes in gaming, DeFi, launchpads, and other large-scale consumer DApps. More recently, it also got into the memecoins game, soaking up some of Solana's volume. Being the key altcoin on the leading centralized exchange also helps.

According to Messari, BNB Chain processes around 4 million daily transactions on average, ahead of Ethereum (1 million), XRP Ledger (1.8 million), but behind Tron (5.5 million) and far behind Solana (54 million non-vote transactions daily). 

In terms of daily active addresses, BNB Chain also performs well with about 1.1 million, beating Ethereum (384,800) and XRP Ledger (55,600), but trailing Tron (2.4 million) and Solana (3.7 million).

Where BNB Chain really shines is in the number of DApps. According to DappRadar, BNB Chain supports 5,686 DApps — more than Ethereum (4,987), with Polygon (2,402) trailing in third. This reinforces Wedson's assertion of a “massive” BNB ecosystem and places BNB Chain in a strong position to lead the charge once Web3 fully matures. 

BNB Chain also ranks 3rd in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, with $5.8 billion, behind Ethereum ($50.5 billion) and Solana ($8 billion), according to DefiLlama. The blockchain seems to pay special attention to developing its DeFi activity. On March 24, its DEX trading volume even managed to briefly outpace all other blockchains, hitting a weekly total of $14.3 billion.

Blockchain revenue plays a crucial role in its long-term sustainability and growth. It is commonly assessed through the total transaction fees generated.

In 2024, Ethereum led the pack with $2.5 billion in fees, followed by Tron ($2.1 billion), Bitcoin ($923 million), and Solana ($751 million), according to CoinGecko. BNB Chain closed the top 5 with $194 million. Since XRP has little utility, its blockchain's revenues were only $1.1 million.

So far in 2025, the revenue rankings are shifting, but BNB Chain remains 5th. In the past 30 days, Tron has taken the lead with $272 million in fees, followed by Solana ($34.7 million), Ethereum ($20.8 million), and BNB Chain ($17.1 million), per Messari data. 

Overall, while BNB may not always top the charts across every metric, it consistently holds a respectable third place among the leading smart contract platforms. Its healthy activity metrics contribute to maintaining relative price stability within the sector. 

The blockchain's revenue remains its weakest point compared to competitors. However, if the promise of Web3 is realized and adoption accelerates, BNB Chain's dominance in the DApp space could become its biggest strength.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Bots against humanity — The battle for blockchain supremacy","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bots-against-humanity","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 15:03:06 GMT","

 With automated systems manipulating markets and driving up fees, implementing “proof-of-human” infrastructure will ensure decentralized systems serve people, not machines 

Opinion by: Steven Smith, head of protocol and applied research, Tools for Humanity

Blockchains were designed as systems of trust that are transparent, decentralized and accessible. The age of AI has, however, introduced significant new challenges. Nearly half of all internet traffic is generated by bots, with up to 80% of blockchain transactions now automated and AI agents accounting for most onchain activity. 

While some bots serve legitimate and helpful purposes, others — like those used for airdrop farming and fake account creation — clog networks, drive up fees, and monopolize space and resources. 

It's up to humans to protect the blockchains we know and love, ensuring that people aren't unfairly disadvantaged by automated systems, insulated from the effect of maximal extractable value attacks and exploits, and free from the need to pay significant gas fees to be included in a block.

AI bots are becoming more integral to networks and capable of more sophisticated exploits, dominating trading volumes, driving up gas fees, and manipulating decentralized finance (DeFi) markets. 

In some cases, networks have seen failure rates surge past 75% due to bot-induced congestion. Even Ethereum's mempool is increasingly flooded with automated transactions, forcing human users to compete for scarce block space.

The problem extends beyond blockchain networks — it's affecting the entire economy. AI-powered bots are set to disrupt traditional banking and financial services, threatening the very foundations of how money is managed and transactions are conducted. 

It's only a matter of time before bad actors begin deploying new AI-driven fraud tools at scale, creating an unprecedented security nightmare for financial institutions, businesses and users alike. 

This has already begun. AI-driven botnets fueled a 55% surge in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against the banking and financial services industry during 2024. 

If action isn't taken, humans risk ceding control of both decentralized and traditional financial systems to automated systems optimized for speed and scale — not fairness or accessibility. 

So far, the response to these issues has focused on scalability. Layer-2 solutions, rollups and high-performance execution clients make transactions faster and cheaper. 

Scaling without a focus on human users, however, leads to unintended consequences. Lower fees mean attackers can cause much grief for little cost, and bots can flood networks more easily. Meanwhile, faster transactions mean AI traders can outcompete human investors even faster.

Recent: Don't be afraid of quantum computers

This has played out repeatedly already. A spam attack on Zcash severely disrupted its blockchain. During its token launch, Manta Network suffered a DDoS attack, slowing withdrawals and frustrating users. On Ethereum, bots have been used to manipulate gas prices during high-traffic periods, resulting in delayed transactions and higher transaction fees for real humans.

While scalability is critical, it's equally important to prioritize another fundamental element of blockchain design: proof-of-human.

Proof-of-human infrastructure is a mechanism that digitally verifies a person's humanness and uniqueness. This is key to keeping control of blockchain systems in human hands, giving real people the power to ensure blockchains don't become automated playgrounds for bots — especially as AI agents continue to scale. 

Proof-of-human systems ensure blockchain architecture evolves with a human-first approach. Networks should allocate guaranteed block space for verified human users, ensuring that automated trading bots don't push out essential transactions. 

Introducing gas subsidies for human users can also prevent them from being priced out during periods of extreme network congestion. Optimized execution clients can enhance efficiency while implementing safeguards against bot-driven spam. 

Blockchain architecture has made remarkable strides in scalability, interoperability and security. We also still need to ensure positive experiences for humans. As an industry, it's fundamental to provide the ability to distinguish between real people and bots online to ensure the sector can continue to grow in the long run. 

The choice is ours. We can allow unproductive bots to take over our networks, pushing out human users and undermining the core promise of decentralization. Or, we can implement the necessary parameters to keep blockchains human-centric and ensure greater control over productive bots, ensuring fairer access, security and sustainability.

Now is the time to act. The future of blockchain and bringing more humans onchain depend on it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Beyond tariffs and chaos — blockchain emerges as the backbone of a parallel economy","https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-the-backbone-of-a-parallel-economy","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 09:01:21 GMT","

 As US tariffs and sanctions disrupt global trade, blockchain technology quietly enables a parallel economy — unlocking liquidity, transparency, and compliance through tokenized assets, stablecoins, and decentralized infrastructure. 

Opinion by: Ross Shemeliak, co-founder and chief operating officer of Stobox

The Trump administration is pushing a much-revived policy trajectory, marked by tariffs and sanctions that aim to reshore production. Despite exemptions favorable to technology, this dramatic turnaround may seem like a case of the White House treating global trade as its playground. The president's tariff agenda is fracturing supply chains overnight and disregarding long-standing economic rules.

This latent, chaotic agenda also sees the quiet emergence of a new infrastructure in which blockchain is taking on a fresh role. Insofar as it is not purely focused on decentralization, the technology is geopolitically resilient. With global businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, increasingly pushed toward blockchain, we are witnessing a global economic map redrawing into one centered on Real-World Assets tokenization and stablecoins.

There are few winners in a trade war. Sanctions and restrictions disrupt international economic rules, and liquidity is one of the first victims. Companies struggle to finance their operations, while risk management models force banks to step back. With the fragmented economic order, a new era in which secondary markets for tokenized trade assets are prevalent is being ushered in. 

These tokenized real-world assets — receivables, commodities or shopping slots, for example — can be fractionalized and sold in global permissioned marketplaces. The resulting access to capital outside of sanctioned corridors grants companies liquidity. As sanctions reduce liquidity, tokenization creates it. Within the economic disruption from the US, there is a moment of opportunity for tokenization.

Another implication of sanctions relates to the existential significance of transparency and traceability. Traceability means companies importing goods must prove their origin and routing or risk secondary sanctions. Tokenization may be in a position to benefit.

Recent: US exchanges bet big on crypto derivatives amid tariff turbulence

This owes itself to tokenized assets having immutable metadata — certificates of origin, shipping routes, customs approvals. The result is real-time, tamper-proof compliance, which far outstrips outdated spreadsheets and siloed databases. Manufacturers can directly onchain verify that every component used — down to the source of its raw materials — fully complies with sanctions.

The peril of sanctions extends yet further, as trust in banks is eroded. Exiting high-risk corridors, banks leave companies without neutral payment intermediaries. DeFi Infrastructure and tokenized Escrow represent meaningful options for rebuilding trust without banks. Tokenized Escrow via smart contracts enables milestone-based payments to be enforced by code, not banks. International deals can be conducted without traditional clearing systems while maintaining trust and accountability. When sanctions gnaw away at trust in banks, code can step in as the counterparty.

Stablecoins do more still. The technology no longer just enables DeFi; it facilitates parallel international trade. While this may seem like the remit of the theoretical, it is happening. As fiat rails fall under geopolitical pressure, companies from Latin America to Southeast Asia adopt stablecoin-based invoicing to keep commerce alive.

While stablecoins began as something of a fintech novelty, the disruption of sanctions to SWIFT and frozen cross-border transfers means that stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and even EURC are emerging as financial lifelines. A shadow banking system has come into being for the sanctioned world. Faster, cheaper, borderless, this offers three serious advantages:

Payments are processed 24/7, without banks or FX intermediaries.

Counterparties can settle in neutral, dollar-pegged assets — outside traditional financial rails.

Smart contracts and stablecoins enable programmable, conditional payments tied to compliance checkpoints.

The deepening fractures in geopolitics are leading to further opportunities for digital infrastructure. With supply chains increasingly politicized, the door is opening to greater use of tokenization by creating “compliance-first” trade hubs. 

This is significant because the trade hubs can be located in neutral countries like Singapore, the UAE and Turkey. These hubs tokenize ports, warehouses and logistics routes. As a result, they embed compliance and origin data directly into the asset lifecycle. Companies seeking a trustworthy alternative in a fraught geopolitical environment can turn to neutral blockchain hubs.  

Sanctions carry disadvantages for legacy contracts — these agreements are static, complex to amend, and dependent on intermediaries — and freeze when restrictions are hit. By contrast, the logic embedded in tokenized smart contracts offers more dynamic reactivity to regulatory shifts.

Let's briefly consider an example — a European supplier tokenizes its invoice and programs the contract to release payment only if goods clear non-restricted jurisdictions. This level of programmable compliance, enabled by the technology, reduces legal risk, operational lag and cross-border tension.

An unprecedented, challenging economic environment is emerging from US sanctions, which has painful implications for financial institutions and trade partners. As traditional infrastructure is broken, tokenization offers the possibility to build a new one.

On the surface, tokenization and stablecoins are about efficiency and transparency. Realizing the full benefits requires us to look deeper — they are becoming foundational layers in a parallel global economy. This new order adapts faster than banks, negotiates better than lawyers, and operates beyond the reach of sanctions.

Blockchain does far more than simply record trade. It enforces geopolitical logic at the asset level. With the next economic map being drawn onchain, tokenization's broad benefits are clear.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=nft","Disgruntled NFT Owners File Lawsuit Against Nike","https://www.insidehook.com/internet/disgruntled-nft-owners-file-lawsuit-against-nike","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:13:53 GMT","

In the beginning, there was RTFKT, and if you took one look at the all-caps name and lack of vowels and thought, “This sounds like an NFT company,” you are absolutely correct. In late 2021, Nike purchased RTFKT with the idea of getting into the then-burgeoning NFT market; the result led to a number of interesting collaborations, including pairs of sneakers that came with the ability to obtain a digital version. It's kind of like the download codes that come with some LPs, albeit without anything to listen to.More recently, Nike announced the closure of RTFKT. And as it turns out, that closure has prompted some NFT owners to file a proposed class action lawsuit against the sneaker giant. Writing at Reuters, Jonathan Stempel provided more details about a lawsuit filed in federal court in Brooklyn last week. The plaintiffs cited consumer protection laws in several states in arguing that Nike's 2024 decision to shutter RTFKT adversely affected their investments.Reuters cites the plaintiffs in the case describing Nike's decision to close RTFKT “[caused] the rug to be pulled out from under them.” The plaintiffs are seeking over $5 million in damages.How likely is it that the lawsuit will succeed? Earlier this year, online betting company DraftKings paid $10 million to settle a lawsuit over its own foray into NFTs. The circumstances there are different from the Nike case; for one thing, it wasn't prompted by DraftKings ending its NFT program, which did not happen until a year after the lawsuit was filed.

As NEXT.io reported about the DraftKings lawsuit, the case involved whether or not NFTs were considered unregistered securities. Reuters's coverage of the Nike NFT case mentions something similar: the plaintiffs' argument that they would not have invested in RTFKT NFTs “had they known the tokens were unregistered securities.” It's a larger question hanging over this lawsuit — and it could have wider implication depending on how this case goes.

Nike is facing a class action complaint in New York federal court by non-fungible token purchasers who claimed the corporation hyped a project with recently acquired RTFKT to attract investor money, only to see the NFT subsidiary shut down, leaving buyers “decimated” with worthless crypto assets.

And the allegations over the sale of unregistered securities and deceptive practices would carry more authority if the Securities and Exchange Commission had not shifted its regulatory stance under the Trump administration on what constitutes a security, according to Nicolle Lafosse, a digital asset attorney at the international law firm Diaz Reus in Miami.

A proposal for a class action lawsuit is accusing Nike of engaging in a “rug pull” by shutting down operations for its RTFKT NFT platform. 

The suit was filed Friday in a Brooklyn federal court with Australian resident Jadeep Cheema leading the group of aggrieved customers for Nike's digital sneakers. It argues that the value of the RTFKT tokens was based entirely on Nike's promotional efforts. Once the company pulled that support, investors were left “holding the bag.” 

Nike acquired RTFKT in 2021, a year after the sneaker NFT studio was founded, and began releasing Swoosh-branded digital collectables. Nike would profit in its initial sale of tokens and would also get its cut any time one of its NFTs were bought or sold on the secondary market.

Some of the NFTs could be redeemed for real-life sneakers, including limited-edition Air Force 1s. These “forging” events were particularly important for driving the value of the tokens, with one such occasion October 23 leading to a 600 percent rise in prices. 




			Watch on FN		






Amid a wider landscape of suits seeking to determine the legal status of NFTs, Cheema is joining the side arguing they should be considered as securities. “Plaintiff and others would never have purchased the Nike NFTs at the prices they did, or at all, had they known that the Nike NFTs were unregistered securities or that Nike would cause the rug to be pulled out from under them,” the filing said. 

Cheema is seeking damages of at least $5 million, as well as the disgorgement of RTFKT profits and injunctive relief to prevent Nike from offering additional unregistered securities.

Footwear News has reached out to Nike for comment and will update if a response is given. 

Cheema applies the Howey Test to the RTFKT project and says Nike created a reasonable expectation of profits with the company's continued backing. But even if the court doesn't find that the NFTs qualify as unlicensed securities, he contends Nike nonetheless engaged in a deceptive act by no longer propping up the ecosystem upon which the value of the NFTs were based. 

After Nike announced the closure of RTFKT, “holders of the Nike NFTs felt that the decision left them holding obsolete crypto assets,” the filing said before drawing a distinction between such tokens and more traditional artwork.

RTFKT

Nike is being sued by owners of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) issued by its RTKFT digital fashion subsidiary who claim their assets are now worthless following the company's decision to shutter its Web 3.0 operations last year. 

RTFKT was founded in 2020, offering shoes and collectibles that could be used across various avatars and applications in the metaverse. Nike purchased the company at the height of interest in Web 3.0, hoping to use RTKFT's user base, as well as its expertise in game development engines, blockchain, and augmented reality (AR) in targeting customers in digital environments.

Although NFTs were often marketed as digital items with collectible value, many were implicitly positioned by sellers or interpreted by buyers as investments. The value and volume of NFT sales have collapsed since the market peaked in early 2022, with one report suggesting as many as 95 per cent might now be worthless.

With dampened consumer enthusiasm, and growing interest from regulators who have long suspected many NFTs are unregulated securities, many firms have retreated from the sector.

OneFootball, which spent huge sums on licences to create NFTs based on major soccer leagues, has since returned to its core competency as a digital soccer platform, while DraftKings has closed its Reignmakers platform. Earlier this month, Candy Digital, which held licenses for Major League Baseball (MLB) and others was sold to Futureverse.

Nike's decision to do the same is further evidence that the original vision prophesied for Web 3.0 and the metaverse has failed to materialise and that there could be legal consequences to follow.

The class action lawsuit has been filed in Brooklyn, New York. The legal status of NFTs in the US remains unclear.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","World Federation of Exchanges explores CBDC for tokenization","https://www.ledgerinsights.com/world-federation-of-exchanges-explore-cbdc-for-tokenization/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:21:49 GMT","

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has published a paper exploring the potential impact of central bank digital currency (CBDC) on the adoption of tokenization. The WFE is an industry body representing the world's largest stock exchanges and clearing houses, including central counterparties (CCPs). These are amongst the organizations that will be most heavily affected by a shift to tokenization. One of its members, Switzerland's SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), already supports a pilot wCBDC.

“The Swiss experience demonstrates the utility of efficient CBDCs to the success of tokenisation, due to the enhanced trust, liquidity, financial inclusion and diversification associated with CBDCs,” said Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the World Federation of Exchanges. “Other central banks and policymakers should take heed of this example to generate the economic growth associated with tokenisation.”

A WFE report last year on tokenization seemed less than keen on the topic, although this one is more balanced.

Benefits of a wholesale CBDC include the ability to use central bank money as collateral and facilitate cross border payment. The authors note that while CBDCs support delivery versus payment (DvP), so do real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, although transactions can take from seconds to half an hour.

Regarding challenges, it highlighted the inability of a DLT to keep up with the settlement of microsecond transactions. It has been widely noted that instant settlement is not ideal for transactions that can benefit most from netting. We'd observe that CBDC can support netting and settlement on a far more regular basis, including intraday. The key point being that these settlements are atomic or delivery versus payment (DvP).

Given CCPs are key WFE members, the authors noted that CCPs also address counterparty risks while supporting netting. That's not up for debate. The question is whether a piece of code can fulfil a similar purpose in a future tokenized world.

With RTGS systems available and integrated today, the authors ask whether CBDCs will mainly be used when the RTGS system is closed. So they wonder whether it's worthwhile for that purpose, or whether extending RTGS operating hours would work. 

While extending RTGS hours is a valid point, we'd observe that CBDCs will most likely be used for the settlement of tokenized assets at any time of day. So it's more about the tokenization adoption curve. CBDC is an important and necessary element, but tokenization is still in the early stages. For SDX, wCBDC trials encouraged half a dozen bond issuances during a six month period. However, since extending the wCBDC pilot in mid 2024, there has only been one SDX bond issuance.

The WFE paper also highlights some of the tricky areas regarding CBDC adoption such as legacy system integration, interoperability and the need for a supportive regulatory environment.

For wCBDC, matters are moving in the right direction in many major jurisdictions. Switzerland is the first. But the EU recently announced an interim RTGS – DLT payment solution, to be followed by plans for a more comprehensive wCBDC. That was in response to regulators being pleasantly surprised by the appetite from industry during last year's Eurosystem trials. 

In the UK there's the private wholesale settlement institution, Fnality, whose token is a synthetic CBDC, although it doesn't like that label. Fnality is also planning to launch in the United States.

And there are numerous other jurisdictions such as Brazil, Hong Kong and the UAE working on pilots or planning launches.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global trade association for exchanges and clearing houses, has published a policy paper highlighting the advantage of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to the development of tokenisation, and warns that well-functioning CBDCs require a coordinated industry effort to achieve an efficient and well-regulated trading environment.

Tokenisation would see the advent of major benefits to the financial industry including fractional ownership – allowing multiple investors to own a share of an asset thereby lowering the capital requirement for individuals, financial inclusion by enabling smaller investors to access public market assets that were previously out of reach, improved transparency and security.

The paper explains that a CBDC would introduce a new type of central bank money: a digital payment instrument that is a direct liability of the central bank, thereby avoiding the credit and liquidity risks associated with using commercial bank money or an alternative like stablecoins.

This gives market participants the reassurance they have when trading securities such as stocks, bonds and derivatives. The view of the exchange industry is that without this reassurance, it will be more difficult to develop widespread participation in the trading of tokenised assets.

The paper details a number of issues that need to be addressed before CBDCs can be traded efficiently which fit broadly into three categories:

Investment
The whole market ecosystem, from exchanges to banks and asset managers, would need to invest heavily to update legacy systems to expedite settlement time to an appropriate level so they can be used as settlement assets in many trades. Small and medium-sized firms, or new entrants into the market, might find it difficult to comply with the infrastructure and technological demands required to integrate with a CBDC system. This could create a higher barrier to entry, concentrating market power among larger firms.

Legislation
Additionally, legislation would need to be updated to include the possibility of CBDCs as settlement assets and to ensure they can be used to make the final, irreversible settlement of a transaction in case of a default.

Cross-border settlement
The benefit CBDCs bring to enabling cross-border settlements will make regulatory oversight more complex with differing legal frameworks for CBDC use. The lack of regulatory harmonization between different countries' CBDCs could create bottlenecks or legal disputes.

Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the World Federation of Exchanges, said, “If the financial ecosystem at large agrees to make the necessary investment to ensure CBDCs are liquid and efficient, laws and regulation must then be updated to appropriately capture this new financial asset. We've laid out what is required to achieve this.”

Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the World Federation of Exchanges, said, “The Swiss experience demonstrates the utility of efficient CBDCs to the success of tokenisation, due to the enhanced trust, liquidity, financial inclusion and diversification, associated with CBDCs. Other central banks and policymakers should take heed of this example to generate the economic growth associated with tokenisation.”

          Once a darling of Lithuania's cryptocurrency scene, the Bankera digital coin raised tens of millions but has since collapsed in value. The project's co-founders bought a portfolio of luxury real estate using loans from a bank they owned apparently backed by funds from the crypto coin sales.

In early 2018, near the tail end of a major cryptocurrency boom, a Lithuanian start-up called Bankera announced that it had managed to raise over 100 million euros in just six months by selling its own digital coin. 

The company said the funds would be used to fashion a “bank for the blockchain era” — a fully fledged retail and investment institution, holding and exchanging most cryptocurrencies and competing with existing banks “as an equal.” 

More than 100,000 people had bought tokens in an “initial coin offering,” or ICO — a type of cryptocurrency fundraiser — and had started receiving weekly payments drawn from a share of the fees generated when others bought and sold the coin. Amid a wave of ICOs in 2017 and 2018, the Lithuanian token looked like a potentially lucrative investment.

But seven years after the ICO, the token has collapsed in value, leaving many investors disappointed, and the Bankera project still hasn't achieved one of its self-proclaimed core objectives: acquiring a European Union banking license. 

Now, an investigation by OCCRP and its partner 15min has uncovered how the once-promising cryptocurrency project has funded loans benefitting the founders of the venture, with investors left without the promised returns. 

Reporters found evidence that a portion of the funds raised in the ICO appears to have been funneled into a sprawling real estate portfolio — including a villa on the French Riviera and high-end property in Lithuania — via a bank thousands of miles away in the Pacific nation of Vanuatu.

The city of Port Vila, Vanuatu's capital.

In the four years following the ICO, more than 45 million euros flowed from a Lithuanian firm owned by Bankera's three co-founders into an account at Pacific Private Bank (PPB) – a Vanuatu-based bank the three had acquired just before the coin offering ended. 

Leaked company records and bank statements show the funds were used to underwrite loans to other companies owned by the same three men, which then purchased high-end real estate. Millions more, also backed by ICO funds, were loaned directly to the three co-founders themselves, often labeled as “personal use.” 

Kathryn Westmore, who leads the Royal United Services Institute's (RUSI's) work on financial crime policy, said the ICO proceeds should only have been used for the Bankera project.

“To extract funds and seemingly use them to finance personal spending raises suspicions that investors have been misled and [the co-founders] have profited personally,” she said. “Fundamentally this seems to be about misrepresentation of what the [ICO] funds were going to be used for, which raises the question of whether this was a fraud.”

Reporters repeatedly tried to seek comment from Bankera's three founders, including by traveling to a conference in Malta to attempt to speak with one of them, Vytautas Karalevičius. They sent multiple emails to him and the other founders, Justas Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius, and their companies, but only received a response from lawyers acting for the Lithuanian firm Bankera UAB, one of several companies in what the lawyers described as the “Bankera ecosystem.”

The ‘Bankera Ecosystem'

In the course of this investigation, reporters found several companies in various jurisdictions involved in the Bankera project or the ICO, as well as in receiving, holding, and moving ICO revenues. They sent requests for comments to these companies or their representatives, and directly to Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius.

The only substantive response came from lawyers representing the Lithuanian company Bankera UAB. Those lawyers declined to confirm that they were responding on behalf of the Bankera co-founders, or the other companies in what they referred to as the “Bankera ecosystem.” Bankera UAB provides IT and other services to other Bankera firms.

However, the lawyers confirmed Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were “the founders and majority owners of the …Bankera ecosystem.” They added that none of the three co-founders “own shares in every entity within the Bankera ecosystem, nor do they own their shares equally.”

Those lawyers declined to comment on specific transactions, but cited the purchase of PPB as evidence that funds raised in the ICO “were used towards the development of an innovative neobank using blockchain technology.” The movement of funds into the Vanuatu bank's account “had always been intended” and was carried out because “sums were given as grants to multiple Bankera ecosystem companies,” the lawyers wrote. 

While the lawyers acknowledged that the Bankera crypto token's value had “diminished significantly over time,” they said the “Bankera brand is now well known and successful” and denied that the ICO was in any way fraudulent. They declined to comment on the specific transactions related to the loans to the co-founders and their companies, and the property purchases.

Lawyers for PPB declined to comment on the transactions revealed in the leaked banking materials, citing Vanuatu's banking secrecy law.

PPB's managing director, Eimantas Kazlauskas, said the bank complied with all Vanuatu banking laws and regulations. 

And PPB's resident director, Martin St. Hilaire, said: “The goal of acquiring Pacific Private Bank by Bankera was to transform it into a modern digital bank for the blockchain era, which is being successfully done one step at a time.”

“From my standpoint, PPB has always been compliant and a good example of a small independent private bank,” he said.

The Central Bank of Lithuania told OCCRP it had contacted law enforcement regarding the Bankera ICO, but said it could not “disclose any details” due to legal restrictions.

Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were all born in the late 1980s in Šiauliai, a city of about 120,000 people in northern Lithuania.

Karalevičius is the son of a public health official and a plastic surgeon who became a politician, and Dobiliauskas is the son of a public prosecutor and a senior banker. Mockevičius' father is a civil judge and his mother worked in school administration.

They were all in their late 20s when Bankera started offering its token, known as BNK, for sale in August 2017. A fourth man, Ugnius Šimelionis, was a co-founder of multiple “Bankera ecosystem” companies, but sold his stakes in them to Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius in October 2017, shortly before the launch of the ICO. Šimelionis told OCCRP he sold his shares because his and the other founders' “long-term visions for the company's direction didn't fully align,” and said he had no involvement in the ICO or any other Bankera activities since.

By the time of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius had already established multiple digital financial service companies serving hundreds of thousands of customers, according to a white paper published by Bankera in 2017. These included three companies that would play key roles in the Bankera ICO: Pervesk UAB and Spectro Finance UAB, both registered in Lithuania, and Finalify Ltd., which was registered in the British Virgin Islands. 

Finalify issued the BNK tokens, and Spectro Finance operated the “virtual currency exchange” — an online platform to trade digital currencies — where people could buy Bankera's tokens using either traditional “fiat” currency or other cryptocurrencies. 

Potential investors had to set up a wallet for their tokens with SpectroCoin, owned by Spectro Finance, and they sent payments for BNK to an account at Pervesk, according to payment documents from multiple investors seen by reporters. Pervesk is an “electronic money institution” — a company licensed to issue electronic money and process digital payments — which Spectro Finance used to handle proceeds from the ICO. 

In its white paper, Bankera compared holding its tokens to owning shares in a publicly listed company, in the sense that they could be bought and sold after the ICO. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB told OCCRP it was incorrect to characterize the “ICO as being akin to the raising of equity.”)

Token holders would be entitled to discounted rates for Bankera services and products. They would also receive a weekly payout. Each week, Bankera would collect fees on transactions — and then, after deducting costs, it would put aside 20 percent of the remaining amount and distribute it to BNK holders in proportion to the share of the tokens they held. 

Bankera's resume was bolstered by the backing of prominent political and business figures. At the time of the ICO, the start-up's advisers included two members of the European Parliament, a former head of the Lithuanian tax authority, a former president of one of the country's largest banks, and a globally recognized blockchain entrepreneur.

The Bankera ICO Advisers

The advisory board for the Bankera ICO included ten senior figures from the worlds of politics, finance, and regulation, according to the Bankera white paper. At the time, some publicly sang Bankera's praises. Today, the tone has changed markedly. Contacted for comment, five of the former advisers denied having any significant involvement in the venture. Two claimed Bankera had simply used their names. 

The board included: 

Antanas Guoga – Former member of European Parliament (2014–2019), businessman, and well-known poker player. He left the board in March 2018. Reached for comment, he said he left after his “views diverged” with the project's founders.

Audrius Žiugžda – Former CEO of the bank SEB. He also served as head of administration of Šiauliai Bank. Žiugžda joined the ICO's advisory board in 2017. ""They never needed my advice,” he told reporters. “They just used my name.""

Modestas Kaseliauskas – Former director of Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate (2005-2014). He left the Bankera ICO advisory board after the coin offering ended, and now works at the International Monetary Fund. He said he did not take part in the “implementation stage” of the Bankera project and so could not comment on it. 

Marc Kenigsberg – Founder of the cryptocurrency and gambling news portal Bitcoin Chase, and an advisor to several blockchain businesses. He left his role as an adviser to the Bankera ICO after he felt they were going a “more traditional financial route,” he told reporters. 

Lon Wong – Entrepreneur and developer of blockchain technology. “Unfortunately, they never sought advice from me,” he told reporters, adding that he had since “lost touch with them totally.”

Pre-sales of the currency appeared to be a hit. On August 28, 2017, Bankera tweeted: “Please lower your orders so everyone could get some tokens!” 

The following month, the company announced that it had reached its initial target of 25 million euros nine days ahead of schedule. In February 2018, it said it raised a total of 100 million euros.

Andreas Horb, a German financial advisor, told OCCRP that the prospect of weekly payouts was a “key selling point” and helped convince him to buy about 2,000 euros worth of BNK. 

Despite the apparently enthusiastic uptake of the BNK token, more than six years on, its market capitalization — the total value of all issued tokens — has fallen to just $1 million, according to data from the Ethereum blockchain, which hosts the token. As BNK's value collapsed, so did the payments to coin-holders. Eventually, in 2022, the revenue-sharing scheme was halted. But some investors say problems emerged much earlier.

“Things started to change in 2018, a few months after the ICO launched,” Horb said. “The payouts began to drop significantly below the promised amount.” 

Lawyers for Bankera UAB said that during the ICO the token was purchased “by speculators hoping for a ‘boom',” and that the “relatively early abandonment of the BNK tokens by such individuals naturally played a part in the slide in value.” 

As weekly earnings from the revenue sharing scheme dropped, Horb said he and his friends tried to contact Bankera's founders and managers: “We had regular conversations with them at first, but eventually they stopped responding after a wave of investor complaints.”

Ryan Woodhouse, a British telecoms engineer, told OCCRP he bought 4,000 British pounds worth of Bankera tokens. 

“The concept looked amazing,” he said. But, he added, “it quickly became clear that the token had lost all its value when they stopped paying the weekly returns.”

The decline in the value of the BNK tokens underscores the risks of investing in cryptocurrency, a largely unregulated area of finance, experts said.

“Investing in cryptocurrency at that time was like buying magic beans,” said Ray Blake, a financial crime expert and director of the Dark Money Files.

RUSI's Westmore described the rash of ICOs in 2017 and 2018 as “the epitome of the wild west of crypto,” adding that people facing losses from cryptocurrency investments often struggle to win compensation due to the lack of oversight of the sector.

The Bank of Lithuania told 15min that it had received “a few individual complaints” about Bankera's ICO, but said it had directed the complainants to the financial supervisory authorities in the British Virgin Islands, where Finalify is registered.

In January 2018, in the middle of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were also buying a bricks and mortar bank half a world away.

Pacific Private Bank Ltd., known as PPB, is a boutique financial institution in Vanuatu, a Pacific nation inhabited by around 300,000 people that has been criticized for facilitating international tax avoidance and providing “golden passports” to people with questionable backgrounds. 

On its website, PPB describes its mission as serving “wealthy, private clients from around the world” with a focus on wealth and asset management and offering “tailored investment solutions.” 

“We accommodate to [sic] the individual objectives of every customer by providing personalized private banking services.”

Bankera's co-founders heralded the purchase of PPB as a step toward becoming “a bank for the blockchain era and a one-stop store for all financial services,” a goal which would now be delivered “ahead of schedule.” The sale price was not disclosed. 

The month after the trio bought PPB, millions of euros started moving from Spectro Finance's account at Pervesk — where BNK purchasers had sent their payments for tokens — into an account also held by Spectro Finance at PPB, leaked records from the Vanuatu bank show.

The first transfer — 15 million euros — took place on February 14, 2018, just weeks before the ICO's conclusion. Another 2.8 million euros were sent six weeks later, followed by 12 million euros six months after that. The leaked bank records give no purpose for the transfers, which are listed only as “transfer between own accounts.” An additional 15 million euros were sent in other transfers between August 2020 and September 2021. 

Lawyers for Bankera UAB said it was “not disputed that funds were moved into accounts with Pacific Private Bank,” but added that there is no “obligation to publicly set out the use of all the funds raised by the ICO.” 

In November 2019, 25 million euros were sent from Spectro Finance's PPB account to another PPB account held by Finalify, the British Virgin Islands company that issued the Bankera tokens. The credit was the first activity in the Finalify account.

In April 2021, the same Spectro Finance account also transferred 20 million euros to a PPB account held by Spectro Finance Systems Ltd., another firm registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2019 by Mockevičius, one of Bankera's founders.

All three PPB accounts — Spectro Finance's, Finalify's, and Spectro Finance Systems' — pledged funds to back loans by PPB to Bankera's three young co-founders or their companies.

Before the acquisition of PPB was announced, Bankera built up an air of suspense by promising “a very big announcement” was on the way. But once the news broke, the venture insisted that Bankera and PPB were remaining “separate projects.”

PPB never became a cryptocurrency bank. Instead, leaked banking records show, it repeatedly borrowed money from Spectro Finance, Finalify, and Spectro Finance Systems. It then loaned the same amounts to Bankera's three co-founders and to other companies they controlled.

On October 10, 2019, Spectro Finance's PPB account was debited 1.7 million euros for “B2B purposes,” a leaked bank statement shows. The same day, PPB disbursed a loan for an identical amount to a Monaco-based company called Azur Estates (SCI), registered by two of Bankera's founders, Karalevičius and Mockevičius, the previous August. The money was paid into a previously empty account held by Azur at PPB, the statement shows. 

Less than two weeks later, on October 22, Azur sent the 1.7 million euros to an account it held in Lithuania. Then, six days after that, the company bought a four-bedroom villa in Èze, a seaside village between Monaco and Nice, for 1.1 million euros. Azur paid for the house in full using corporate funds, according to French property records seen by OCCRP.

According to French property records, Azur intended the villa to serve a residential purpose. The 1.7-million-euro loan matured a year later, but Azur simply took out another loan from PPB, for a similar amount, to pay the original loan back. Karalevičius and Mockevičius also repaid loans with new loans. (It is not clear whether other loans were eventually fully paid back.)

Experts said the use of such “back-to-back” loans offered potential advantages, by creating paperwork to support property purchases and helping to keep the bank's books balanced.

“The bank that is receiving funds for the French property would want to check the source of funds,” said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a Florida company specializing in compliance and financial crime litigation. A documented paper trail would indicate that the bank providing the loan has conducted due diligence on the recipient, she said.

“If you have a pledge from a company that appears to be a separate entity, and has money in its account, then it doesn't then appear to be simply taking money out of the bank,” said RUSI's Westmore. “The opaque way these transactions were structured also raises questions about [their] legitimacy.”

Reporters sent detailed questions to Finalify, Spectro Finance, and Mockevičius, who is named as the representative for Azur, but did not receive any responses. Lawyers for Azur did not respond to questions by the time this article was published. 

Azur took another three loans from PPB amounting to 800,000 euros between August 2021 and July 2022, leaked statements show. 

These loans were guaranteed with part of the 25 million euros of ICO proceeds that Finalify received from Spectro Finance in 2019. Finalify agreed to deposit the full 800,000 euros at PPB for five years to guarantee Azur's repayment, leaked pledge agreements show.

One Man, Many Hats

The name of one PPB employee, Eimantas Kazlauskas, appeared repeatedly in transactions related to the trio and their companies.

For the first two loans to Azur, for instance, Kazlauskas — who was PPB's managing director at the time — signed the pledge agreements on behalf of the Vanuatu bank. But for the third loan, he signed on behalf of Finalify while acting as a director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., which bought Finalify in March 2020. Rational was, in turn, owned by PPB.

In 2023, Kazlauskas also signed a term deposit and a pledge agreement with himself to guarantee a loan of 100,000 euros to Mockevičius — the documents show his signature on both sides, as PPB's managing director as well as the director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd, which represented Finalify.

Between 2018 and 2022, Rational Pacific Investments also made several payments to Kazlauskas for “kitchenware” and “fridge rubber fittings” to be supplied to Villa 25, a luxury property the company had bought in Vanuatu. 

Contacted by OCCRP, Kazlauskas said he lives in one of the three houses at Villa 25 and is ""able to fix and or replace items if needed to maintain the value of the property,"" but did not comment on specific transactions.

In other cases, PPB loaned money directly to the trio — again, apparently to fund real estate purchases. 

On December 15, 2020, for instance, Finalify's PPB account was debited for 360,000 euros in relation to a pledge agreement, according to the bank statement. The same day, PPB loaned the same amount to Mockevičius. 

Two days later, Mockevičius transferred 329,604 euros to yet another PPB account, this one held by a Liechtenstein-registered foundation, Eternity Ventures Foundation, which company documents show was set up by two of Bankera's co-founders and whose 2020 bylaws named family members of each of Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius as beneficiaries. On December 18, Eternity paid the exact amount to buy a plot of land in the Old Town of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. 

Another 300,000 euros were debited from Finalify's account on November 10, 2021, for a pledge agreement. That same day, PPB disbursed a loan for the same amount to Mockevičius, who transferred 300,000 euros to Eternity, also on the same day. Two days later, Eternity paid out just under 290,000 euros for more real estate in Lithuania.

Including those transactions and others, Eternity received a total of just under 1.8 million euros from Mockevičius and Dobiliauskas between the summer of 2019 and the end of 2021, according to Eternity's leaked PPB bank statements. Over the same period, it bought a total of five properties in Lithuania for more than 1.3 million euros.

In mid-2018, shortly after the end of the ICO, a Vanuatu-based company called Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., then owned by PPB, bought another local company — called Beachfront Properties — which in turn owned Villa 25, a luxury resort in a secluded seaside district just outside the capital, Port Vila, according to registry documents from the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission.

The villa, which boasts a private pool and beach, promises “barefoot luxury by the sea,” and can be rented for up to 125,000 Vanuatu vatu (about $1,000) a night during peak season.

Lawyers for Bankera UAB declined to comment on the transactions involving Eternity. They said the Vanuatu villa “is owned by Pacific Private Bank, and has historically been let out to guests and used by/for staff (including management). We understand that it is currently being used as an office due to damage caused elsewhere by the Port Vila earthquake. There is nothing remarkable about this.”

Between May 2019 and May 2023, PPB also loaned Mockevičius a total of 5.4 million euros and Dobiliauskas 3 million euros — 4.2 million euros of which were explicitly listed as being “for personal use,” leaked bank statements show. Karalevičius was loaned 5.2 million euros, which the statements say are for “investment.” These amounts were almost all guaranteed by Finalify, Spectro Finance Systems, or Spectro Finance.

Tax Dispute

In 2021, a dispute with Lithuanian tax authorities revealed that Mockevičius earned millions from the Bankera ICO before it had even begun.

In August 2017, Mockevičius signed a contract with Finalify Ltd. — which he himself represented as director — to provide “advertising and marketing services” for the Bankera ICO, according to a decision by Lithuania's Supreme Administrative Court. He was paid 750 Bitcoins, worth more than 2.5 million euros at the time.

When Mockevičius sold the Bitcoins, in late 2017, they were worth 6 million euros. He used a portion of the money to buy a 3-million-euro apartment in Monaco, according to the court's decision. The tax authorities ruled that Mockevičius had misclassified the income and fined him over 32,000 euros for underpaying personal income taxes. Karalevičius and Dobiliauskas were fined 38,000 and 36,000 euros respectively, but no further details were available.

The three Bankera co-founders did not respond to reporters' requests for comment. But Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate confirmed the fines had been paid. 

Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius remain public faces of Lithuania's cryptocurrency industry, appearing at — and sponsoring — conferences in Vilnius and internationally. 

As for Bankera itself, the website remains active, and purports to provide “a modern bank account alternative for individuals and businesses,” though it has yet to receive an EU banking license. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB said ICO proceeds were used to secure an “electronic money institution license within the EU” for Pervesk, the e-money company involved in the Bankera ICO which lawyers described as “a Bankera ecosystem company.”)

Pervesk remains active. In 2023, the company claimed to have processed almost 2.5 billion euros worth of transactions and reported 4.8 million euros in revenues. 

And Spectro Finance's virtual currency exchange, which claimed to serve 300,000 customers at the time of the ICO, now says it helps more than one million users “buy, sell and exchange popular cryptocurrencies.”

In 2018, Lithuania's central bank fined Pervesk 700,000 euros for violations of Lithuanian banking laws. Karalevičius, Pervesk's manager, was fined 500,000 euros.

Pervesk was blocked from accepting or making payments. But by January 2019, the central bank had lifted the restrictions after Pervesk provided more information, improved its monitoring of business relationships, and “addressed other deficiencies identified during the inspection.” Two years later, a settlement between Pervesk and the Bank of Lithuania reduced the fine imposed on Pervesk to 244,000 euros, and canceled the one on Karalevičius altogether. 

The details of the settlement remain confidential.

The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) has published a paper exploring the potential impact of central bank digital currency (CBDC) on the adoption of tokenization. The WFE is an industry body representing the world's largest stock exchanges and clearing houses, including central counterparties (CCPs). These are amongst the organizations that will be most heavily affected by a shift to tokenization. One of its members, Switzerland's SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), already supports a pilot wCBDC.

“The Swiss experience demonstrates the utility of efficient CBDCs to the success of tokenisation, due to the enhanced trust, liquidity, financial inclusion and diversification associated with CBDCs,” said Richard Metcalfe, Head of Regulatory Affairs at the World Federation of Exchanges. “Other central banks and policymakers should take heed of this example to generate the economic growth associated with tokenisation.”

A WFE report last year on tokenization seemed less than keen on the topic, although this one is more balanced.

Benefits of a wholesale CBDC include the ability to use central bank money as collateral and facilitate cross border payment. The authors note that while CBDCs support delivery versus payment (DvP), so do real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, although transactions can take from seconds to half an hour.

Regarding challenges, it highlighted the inability of a DLT to keep up with the settlement of microsecond transactions. It has been widely noted that instant settlement is not ideal for transactions that can benefit most from netting. We'd observe that CBDC can support netting and settlement on a far more regular basis, including intraday. The key point being that these settlements are atomic or delivery versus payment (DvP).

Given CCPs are key WFE members, the authors noted that CCPs also address counterparty risks while supporting netting. That's not up for debate. The question is whether a piece of code can fulfil a similar purpose in a future tokenized world.

With RTGS systems available and integrated today, the authors ask whether CBDCs will mainly be used when the RTGS system is closed. So they wonder whether it's worthwhile for that purpose, or whether extending RTGS operating hours would work. 

While extending RTGS hours is a valid point, we'd observe that CBDCs will most likely be used for the settlement of tokenized assets at any time of day. So it's more about the tokenization adoption curve. CBDC is an important and necessary element, but tokenization is still in the early stages. For SDX, wCBDC trials encouraged half a dozen bond issuances during a six month period. However, since extending the wCBDC pilot in mid 2024, there has only been one SDX bond issuance.

The WFE paper also highlights some of the tricky areas regarding CBDC adoption such as legacy system integration, interoperability and the need for a supportive regulatory environment.

For wCBDC, matters are moving in the right direction in many major jurisdictions. Switzerland is the first. But the EU recently announced an interim RTGS – DLT payment solution, to be followed by plans for a more comprehensive wCBDC. That was in response to regulators being pleasantly surprised by the appetite from industry during last year's Eurosystem trials. 

In the UK there's the private wholesale settlement institution, Fnality, whose token is a synthetic CBDC, although it doesn't like that label. Fnality is also planning to launch in the United States.

And there are numerous other jurisdictions such as Brazil, Hong Kong and the UAE working on pilots or planning launches.

World Liberty Financial, supported by US President Donald Trump, has entered into a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council to enhance cryptocurrency usage in the South Asian country, according to a report from Business Recorder on April 27.

Pakistan is now ranked ninth globally for crypto adoption, with about 25 million active users and yearly transactions totaling $300 billion, based on statistics from blockchain analytics company Chainalysis.

Pakistan's finance minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, cited the country's large youth population as the major driver of this success, with around 60% of people below 30 years of age.

The pact between World Liberty Financial and the Pakistan Crypto Council details a number of key initiatives. World Liberty will assist in setting up regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain products, develop stablecoin use cases aimed at remittances and trade, study real-world asset tokenization, and aid in the development of decentralized finance protocols in Pakistan.

— PTV News (@PTVNewsOfficial) April 27, 2025



World Liberty co-founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro signed the deal in a meeting with the CEO of the Council Bilal bin Saqib. The signing was witnessed by top government officials, such as Pakistan's central bank governor, finance minister, and IT secretary.

Coming on top of Pakistan's move into cryptocurrency markets, there is now former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao appointed as an advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council. According to recent reports, Zhao will assist in shaping the country's direction on regulation and innovation efforts.

Zhao met with the three founders of World Liberty recently, indicating close collaboration between the different entities involved in the cryptocurrency development plans in Pakistan.

This collaboration represents a strong turnaround in the stance of Pakistan towards digital currency. Only a year ago, back in May 2023, then-finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha announced that Pakistan would never legalize bitcoin due to fears of Financial Action Task Force regulations.

Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency has now set out a new regulatory model, announced on April 10, which seeks to tackle terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer requirements while continuing to encourage innovation.

FIA Director Sumera Azam referred to the framework as one of efforts towards finding a balance between “technological advancement and national security imperatives.”

Reports disclosed that the planned regulations would need approval from legislators and consultation with crypto businesses based in Pakistan before they could be implemented, with implementation slated to start in 2026 via a multi-phased process.

Trump and his relatives have an economic interest in World Liberty's success, as they stand to gain a share of the profits from the platform after supporting the launch of the crypto lending and borrowing platform last year.

Imagine putting $1,000 into something today, and in a few years, it's grown so much that you never have to work for money again. That's the dream many people had when they bought Bitcoin early. Now, a new project called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is making some people feel like that chance is back. And this time, it comes with the speed of Solana, one of the fastest blockchain platforms in the world.

Solana has made a name for itself by doing one thing incredibly well — speed. With the ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, it leaves most other blockchains in the dust. That makes Solana perfect for applications that need to move fast, like trading platforms, games, and financial apps.

But here's the problem: fast doesn't always mean strong. Some blockchains have to give up decentralization or security to achieve speed. And that's where many users begin to worry. You can't build wealth on a platform that breaks under pressure.

Solana is great, but it's not complete on its own.

Bitcoin Solaris is built differently. It takes Bitcoin's strongest feature — its scarcity and rock-solid audited security — and fuses it with Solana's fastest technology to create something new and powerful.



Here's what it brings to the table:



















This structure allows BTC-S to stay safe while moving quickly — something very few coins have achieved.

Not everyone has thousands of dollars to buy mining equipment. Bitcoin Solaris solves this with its Solaris Nova App, which lets people mine BTC-S using just their smartphones.





The Future of Bitcoin Starts Here—Be Part of BTC-S

This opens the door for everyday people to earn BTC-S, grow their assets, and become part of a rising financial system.

Plus, Bitcoin Solaris offers staking rewards — you can hold your BTC-S and earn more without locking your tokens. You keep control of your funds while they work for you in the background.



Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is in its presale phase, offering a chance for early buyers to enter before the token becomes widely available. This isn't just a regular coin launch — it's a chance to buy into a project that could be the next big thing in crypto.







Phase One Has Begun—Secure BTC-S at the Starting Line

The tokens are initially launched on Solana, but once the native blockchain is live, each Solana-based BTC-S will be redeemable 1:1 for the real thing.

A $1,000 investment doesn't usually change your life—unless it's timed right and placed in something with real potential. That's what early Bitcoin buyers experienced. Now, Bitcoin Solaris might be that next rare opportunity.



By combining Solana's ultra-fast speed with the scarcity and security of Bitcoin, BTC-S is giving crypto investors a platform that doesn't cut corners. Whether you're new to crypto or looking for the next breakthrough, this is your chance to act early, think long-term, and maybe turn that $1,000 into something life-changing.

Cryptocurrency took the digital finance sector by storm, but alongside the perks come significant downfalls. In addition to digital anonymity, decentralization, and borderless transactions, cybercriminals are taking advantage of many juicy opportunities to scam people out of their hard-earned money.

Scammers now have prime opportunities to launder funds through mixers, split assets across multiple wallets, and even exploit exchanges with weak Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. As crypto fraud becomes more common, investigative firms like CNC Intelligence confront fraudsters with advanced technology, law enforcement partnerships, and deep cyber intelligence.

Crypto fraud isn't a small-time issue. Every year, billions are lost to crypto fraud as criminals continuously refine their methods. Whether it's rug pulls, phishing schemes, or fake investment platforms, these scams are getting increasingly sophisticated, making justice a hard-won outcome.

Why? First and foremost, tracing illicit funds across decentralized platforms and international borders is an elusive long shot for investigators.

So, how do these scammers get away with crypto fraud? One of the most common methods is using mixers—services that hide the origin of crypto by blending it with other funds. Sketchy online grifters can also utilize privacy coins like Monera, which are nearly untraceable. Of course, several criminals also exploit lax regulations in certain jurisdictions with limited KYC enforcement. This allows scammers to cash out anonymously and disappear just as quickly.

Just because stopping crypto scammers is challenging doesn't mean it's impossible. CNC Intelligence doesn't take these threats lightly, employing the most sophisticated cyber and crypto investigation solutions. These solutions offer blockchain analysis, darknet intelligence, and AI-driven fraud detection to hit the criminals with everything they've got. The CNC Intelligence team also identifies scammers, tracks illicit transactions, and works with victims and legal teams to support recovery efforts.

The CNC Intelligence strategy includes:

CNC Intelligence is about more than algorithms and digital forensics, which sets it apart from the competition. The firm employs a team of certified cryptocurrency investigators™ who are well-versed in digital asset tracking. Using cyber intelligence and investigative practices, they help uncover the people behind these fake identities and offshore shell companies.

The team's investigative work, including successful recovery efforts in high-profile cases, speaks for itself. Their work helps individuals and businesses pursue legal action to recoup stolen crypto. With a unique combination of AI-powered analytics and good old-fashioned detective work, CNC Intelligence is unveiling the digital masks worn by scammers—goodbye anonymity and hello accountability.

Individuals seeking justice for crypto scams may not know where to start when seeking law enforcement assistance. Luckily, CNC Intelligence works with agencies across multiple jurisdictions to offer law enforcement assistance services that strengthen international investigations into crypto crime. Given the amount of red tape civilians will likely contend with, that's certainly a weight off their shoulders.

Of course, given their rampant nature, most government agencies don't have the resources to pursue every crypto fraud case and track complex blockchain transactions. CNC Intelligence gives these agencies actionable intelligence to help take down fraudulent operations and get legal and monetary justice for victims.

As the crypto industry evolves, so do cybercriminal tactics—yet technology will continue to grow and adapt alongside these industry changes. That's why firms like CNC Intelligence must stay on top of these shifts and use developing tech to fight the good fight to protect investors and businesses.

It takes the right technology, intelligence, and global partnership cocktail to crack down on crypto crime. That time is on the horizon, with CNC Intelligence leading the charge.

President Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has reportedly inked a series of agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and innovation in the country's digital assets industry.

The Express Tribune reports that Pakistan's Federal Minister for Information Ata Tarar, PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saeed and WLFI co-chairman Zack Vetkoff attended a signing ceremony.

The event took place on Saturday, just a month after the PCC was formed. The regulatory body was created to oversee and promote crypto and blockchain technology within the country.

According to Tarar, the establishment of the PCC represents a pivotal step in embracing emerging technologies, and initiatives like the partnership with WLFI will help accelerate economic growth and technological advancement. 

“Pakistan offers tremendous opportunities in the crypto sector. Despite being a relatively new player, Pakistan has made remarkable progress in a short span of time.“

Pakistan is home to 241.5 million people, making it the world's fifth-most populous country. Vetkoff says the South Asian nation holds economic potential. 

“Pakistan is one of the fastest-emerging economies. We are excited to be part of its journey towards a vibrant financial future.”

The Trump family holds a 60% stake in the WLFI, and the project itself holds over $103 million worth of crypto assets, according to Arkham data.

Strategic allocation away from U.S. assets by investors could see bitcoin hit a new all-time high in the second quarter of the year, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a report Monday.

Kendrick sees the world's largest cryptocurrency as reaching $120,000 this quarter as he reiterated his previous target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. 

Bitcoin was trading around $95,300 at publication time.

Kendrick noted that the U.S. Treasury term premium, which is closely correlated to the bitcoin price, is at a 12-year high. Accumulation by whales has also been strong. In addition, bitcoin time-of-day analysis suggests that American investors may be looking for non-U.S. assets, he said.

Lastly, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows in the last week suggest ""safe-haven reallocation from gold into BTC,"" wrote Kendrick.

""Bitcoin may be a better hedge than gold against financial system risks,"" he added.

Crypto markets rose Monday, with bitcoin (BTC) trading above $94,000 and the CoinDesk 20, a measure of the performance of the largest cryptocurrencies, adding 2.2% by the middle of the European morning.

XRP led majors' gains, rising almost 7%, driven by a ProShares ETF approval that will see three futures-tracked products go live on April 30. Cardano's ADA gained more than 3% and BNB Chain's BNB added 1%. Ether (ETH) was unchanged.

One exception to the relatively dormant market was privacy coin monero (XMR), which surged more than 40% to as high as $371, a level not seen since May 2021. It was recently trading around $264, up 15% over 24 hours.

Trading volumes zoomed from an average of $50 million on a seven-day rolling basis to over $220 million in the past 24 hours.

The behavior likely followed a possible exploit. On-chain research ZachXBT identified a ""suspicious transfer"" of 3,520 BTC ($330.7 million) that was then swapped into XMR. The sudden increase in demand for the relatively illiquid token caused the price to spike, ZachXBT said in post on X.





The privacy-centric token is based on the CryptoNote protocol, which ensures that all its transactions are unlinkable and untraceable.

Sentiment among traders carried over from last week with a near-term bullish view intact but with a cautious attitude as macroeconomic headwinds remain.

“Bitcoin has maintained a relatively stable range above $92k as Trump's administration soften tariff policies of the crypto industry,” Jupiter Zheng, Partner, Liquid Fund and Research, HashKey Capital, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “This crypto-friendly attitude can boost Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to develop their own market direction, less correlated with US equities, and enable more growth and innovation in the industry.""

Broader equity markets showed mixed movements on Monday. A regional gauge advanced 0.6% while futures for the S&P 500 declined 0.6%, indicating a four-day US equities rally may snap. Gold pared last week's gains after a record-breaking rally. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was also flat as were other major indexes around Asia.

UPDATE (April 28, 9:25 UTC): Adds possible exploit as reason for XMR surge in fifth paragraph; updates prices.

Bitcoin (BTC) returned to positive territory for the year for the first time in almost two months, approaching $95,000 and erasing a drop of as much as 18%.

Its current performance, up less 1.5% since Dec. 31, places it between gold, which has gained 24% and the Nasdaq 100, which is down over 7%. As a result, the narrative positioning bitcoin as either a leveraged tech stock or digital gold is leaning slightly toward the digital gold narrative. But only just.

Analyzing bitcoin's correlation coefficients over a 30-day moving average, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization now shows a strong correlation of 0.70 with gold and a weaker 0.53 correlation with the Nasdaq 100. This suggests bitcoin is aligning more closely with gold's behavior than with tech equities. Correlation values can run between 1, a strong positive correlation, and -1, a strong negative correlation.

Last week, the bitcoin price rose 10%, its strongest performance since the week ended Nov. 17 during price run following President Donald Trump's election victory. 

Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs continue to feed economic uncertainty. U.S. levies on Chinese goods were raised to 145% earlier this month, leading to a significant drop in cargo shipment demand, according to Bloomberg. As noted in the report, major retailers like Walmart are warning that empty shelves and higher prices could return, reminiscent of the COVID era.

 The company's Bitcoin holdings are worth more than $50 billion following its latest purchase, with 553,555 BTC on its books. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy added to its massive Bitcoin stash last week as the cryptocurrency surged above $90,000.

In an April 28 announcement, Strategy reported acquiring 15,355 Bitcoin (BTC) between April 21 and 27.

The latest purchases cost Strategy $1.42 billion at an average price of $92,737 per BTC, increasing the company's aggregate BTC holdings by roughly 3% to a total of 535,555 BTC worth more than $50 billion.

Strategy's latest buy is its largest since late March, when the firm bagged 22,048 Bitcoin for $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per BTC.

Announcing the purchase on X, Strategy co-founder Saylor said the firm has achieved the BTC yield of 13.7% year-to-date.

“As of April 27, we hodl 553,555 BTC acquired for approximately $37.90 billion at $68,459 per Bitcoin,” Saylor noted.

Strategy's BTC yield — an indicator representing the percentage change of the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares — amounted to 74% in 2024.

The company expects to reach a BTC yield target of 15% in 2025.

Strategy's Bitcoin purchase came as the cryptocurrency caught significant bullish action last week, surging 8% from around $87,000 to nearly $94,000 in the period from April 21–27, according to data from CoinGecko.

Bitcoin traded at $95,442 at the time of writing, slightly above its price on Jan. 1, but still lower than its all-time high price above $109,000 seen on Jan. 21.

As Strategy beefed up its Bitcoin stash alongside a BTC rally, Saylor continued posting bullish messages to the community on social media.

“You can still buy BTC for less than $0.1 million,” Saylor wrote on April 25.

In another X post preceding the purchase announcement, Saylor said: “Stay humble. Stack sats [satoshis].” He linked the message to a screenshot of Strategy's portfolio tracker reflecting the company's BTC purchases on the timeline of the price chart.

The news comes as Strategy is inching toward a $100 billion market capitalization, with MSTR shares surging roughly 23% YTD and trading at $368.7 at the time of publication, according to data from TradingView.

 Last week's crypto ETP inflows were among the highest weekly inflows on record, down just about 13% from the all-time high seen in early December 2024, according to CoinShares. 

Cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) bounced back with their third-largest inflows on record last week, according to CoinShares.

Global crypto ETPs collectively posted $3.4 billion of inflows in the trading week of April 21–25, marking the highest level since December 2024, CoinShares reported on April 28.

The inflows were just 13% below the all-time high of $3.85 billion seen in the trading week of Dec. 2–6, 2024, CoinShares previously reported.

Renewed investment interest in crypto ETPs came as Bitcoin (BTC) broke back above $90,000 last week for the first time since briefly retesting the price mark in early March, according to CoinGecko.

Bitcoin was the primary winner among crypto ETPs last week, with investors pouring as much as $3.18 billion into BTC ETPs.

The fresh inflows covered all the previous outflows seen since the beginning of April, with year-to-date (YTD) inflows extending to $3.7 billion.

Bitcoin ETP's assets under management (AUM) have reached $132 billion, while total AUM surged to $151.6 billion.

Bullish sentiment was seen in all crypto ETPs except for Solana (SOL), with Solana-based investment products seeing $5.7 million of outflows last week.

Meanwhile, Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw $183 million inflows in the past trading week, breaking an eight-week streak of outflows.

Other notable gainers among altcoins were Sui (SUI) and XRP (XRP), which saw $20.7 million and $31.6 million of inflows, respectively.

The fresh crypto ETP flows were distributed across all major issuers, including those in the United States and Europe.

BlackRock's iShares ETFs saw the largest inflows last week at $1.5 billion, with ARK and Fidelity following at $621 million and $574 million, respectively.

Despite significant inflows, some issuers continue to see outflows month-to-date, or since April 1. Among those issuers are Grayscale with $84 million in outflows, ProShares with $18 million in outflows, and CoinShares with $7 million in outflows.

The latest inflows mark a notable trend reversal in crypto ETPs as the majority of issuers were seeing massive YTD inflows in the previous week, following a series of outflows in 2025.

According to CoinShares' James Butterfill, the new inflows likely came from concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings as well as a notable weakening of the US dollar, fueling demand for safe-haven assets.

The inflows also came as gold prices saw a notable decline last week after breaking new highs at nearly $3,500 on April 22, dropping to as low as $3,275 on April 23, according to TradingView.

 Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets is “still very early and fragile,” but the shift is “palpable,” says NYDIG's Greg Cipolaro. 

Bitcoin is starting to act as a store of value during times of “US-risk-off” sentiment, marking a potential shift in its relationship with traditional assets, according to the New York Digital Investment Group.

Bitcoin (BTC) felt “noticeably different” over the trading week ended April 25, NYDIG's global head of research Greg Cipolaro said in an April 25 market note. 

“We've been observing subtle shifts in its behavior over the past few weeks,” he added. “The decoupling from traditional risk assets is still very early and fragile, but for those watching crypto markets 24/7, the shift is palpable.”

Cipolaro noted that Bitcoin has gained more than 13% since the beginning of April, while US markets such as the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have declined amid escalating global trade tensions due to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

He added that the US dollar and long-term US Treasurys have also underperformed since the election and Trump's April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, which lumped every country with various rates, the minimum being 10%.

Gold and currencies such as the Swiss franc have been consistent winners as safe havens, Cipolaro said, noting that Bitcoin is emerging as a non-sovereign store of value.

Amid surging volatility in equities, measured with the VIX index, foreign exchange rates (CVIX index), and interest rates and bonds (MOVE index), investors have been on the hunt for these safe haven assets. 

Cipolaro said investors are also seeking alternatives to US hegemony, whether that is stocks, bonds, forex, or commodities. 

However, Cipolaro said investors seeking alternatives outside traditional financial systems have few large, liquid options.

Gold remains the largest non-sovereign store of value at around a $22 trillion market cap, while Bitcoin has just a fraction of that at $1.8 trillion.

Additionally, Bitcoin is the only top crypto asset listed that “solely focuses on monetary or store of value use cases,” while the others are better described as the fuel for decentralized application platforms, he said. 

Cipolaro concluded that despite Bitcoin's recent gains, “there are few signs of the market overheating,” and the recovery is still in early stages.

It Is in Our Nature to Need Stories

This article was published in Scientific American's former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American

It is in our nature to need stories. They are our earliest sciences, a kind of people-physics. Their logic is how we naturally think. They configure our biology, and how we feel, in ways long essential for our survival.

Like our language instinct, a story drive—an inborn hunger for story hearing and story making—emerges untutored universally in healthy children. Every culture bathes their children in stories to explain how the world works and to engage and educate their emotions. Perhaps story patterns could be considered another higher layer of language. A sort of meta-grammar shaped by and shaping conventions of character types, plots, and social-rule dilemmas prevalent in our culture.

“Stories the world over are almost always about people with problems,” writes Jonathan Gottschall. They display “a deep pattern of heroes confronting trouble and struggling to overcome.” So a possible formula for a story = character(s) + predicament(s) + attempted extrication(s). This pattern transmits social rules and norms, describing what counts as violations and approved reactions. Stories offer “feelings we don't have to pay [full cost] for.” They are simulated experiments in people-physics, freeing us from the limits of our own direct experience.

The ""human mind is a story processor, not a logic processor,"" says Jonathan Haidt. Certainly we use logic inside stories better than we do outside. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby have shown that the Wason Selection Test can be solved by fewer than 10% as a logic puzzle, but by 70-90% when presented as a story involving detection of social-rule cheating. Such social-rule monitoring was evolutionarily crucial because as Alison Gopnik notes “other people are the most important part of our environment.” In our ultra-social species, social acceptance matters as much as food. Indeed violating social rules can exclude you from group benefits, including shared food.

Darwin understood how our biology is fitted to the stories in our social environments, noting, “Many a Hindoo...has been stirred to the bottom of his soul by having partaken of unclean food.” The same thing eaten unknowingly would cause no reaction, so the story of the food, not the food itself, causes the “the soul shaking feeling of remorse.” Stories configure contextual triggers and the expected emotional reactions of our culture—perhaps defining a sort of emotional grammar.

Any story we tell of our species, any science of human nature, that leaves out much of what and how we feel is false. Nature shaped us to be ultra-social, and hence to be sharply attentive to character and plot. We are adapted to physiologically interact with stories. They are a key way in which our ruly culture configures our nature.

The site, which likely once housed a roman cavalry unit, shows evidence of the respect soldiers had for their mounts.

A well-defined horse cemetery uncovered in Stuttgart's Bad Cannstatt neighborhood was the final resting place for over 100 horses that were part of the Roman Empire's cavalry in the second century A.D.

Construction crews discovered the cemetery during preparations for a housing project. Over time, excavations by the archaeological company ArchaeoBW—under the supervision of the State Office for Monument Preservation of the Stuttgart Regional Council—continued to unearth evidence from what is now believed to be the largest Roman-era horse cemetery in southern Germany, according to a translated statement from the council. 

Considered one of the most important Roman military locations in modern-day southwestern Germany, experts believe the Roman calvary occupying the region had about 500 soldiers on site, and sustained a potential population of over 700 horses. 

The first discovery of a horse skeleton in the area actually occurred in 1920 (also during a housing project), but the recent development uncovered the entire cemetery. Sara Roth, an archaeologist with the preservation office, said that radiocarbon dating helped pinpoint the age of the cemetery. “Due to the archaeological and historical knowledge of the Roman Bad Cannstatt,” she said in a statement, “the horses of the equestrian unit—a so-called ala—can be assigned, which was stationed on the Hallschlag from about 100 to 150 A.D.” 

Roth said that the deceased horses were buried about 1,300 feet from the equestrian barns (about 650 feet from the soldier's quarters), and would have been constantly replaced. Evidence shows that the carcasses were slid into shallow pits and buried lying on their side with outstretched or bent legs. And even with the dense burials, there were few overlaps of graves, exposing that the site was likely clearly defined with above-ground markers. Even if a horse could walk on its own, if it was deemed beyond military usefulness, it would have been taken to the cemetery and killed there. 

“The horses do not seem to have all died at the same time in a major event such as a battle or epidemic,” Roth said. “Rather, here are the animals that either died during the presence of the ala in Bad Cannstatt due to illness, injury, or other reasons, or who no longer did their task as a military horse.” 

One grave was of particular interest to archaeologists, as they discovered two jugs and a small oil lamp placed in the crook of the legs of one of the horses—grave goods typically reserved for humans. “Here we see a particularly close connection of the owner to his horse,” Roth said. “Even after about 1,800 years, the grief over the death of this one animal is still apparent.” 

The crew also discovered the face-down skeleton of a human male—far from the regular burial location for the Roman settlement, he was likely a social outcast. 

Experts plan to study the sex, age at death, and size of the horses while looking for possible diseases and causes of death. The team hopes to uncover more details about the Roman calvary.

Hailstorm formation has remained a mystery, until now.

Every year, hailstorms cause billions in damage to homes, businesses, and crops, yet how these ice balls of destruction form in the upper troposphere has remained somewhat of a mystery. The predominant theory was that hailstones went through a recycling motion, which explained why they often contained varying layers of a clear and opaque ice. 

Now, a new study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that this recycling motion is only a small part of the story. In the study, Peking University's Qinghong Zhang, lead author of the study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used stable isotope analysis to effectively recreate the “history” of 27 hailstone specimens produced by nine separate storms in China. Using this precise method, Zhang and her colleagues could pinpoint at what level in the atmosphere certain layers of the hailstones formed, creating a vertical map of the ice chunk's journey toward the earth. 

“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Zhang said in a press statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.”

Of the 27 hailstones studied, only one of them displayed tell-tale signs of the hypothesized recycling method, in which hail travels up and down within a storm cloud. Some 10 stones showed that they formed while steadily descending toward the atmosphere, and another 13 displayed evidence of only one single upward push. Surprisingly, three even showed signs of nearly horizontal movement.

According to the researchers, hail typically forms in a temperature “sweet spot” of between roughly -30 and -10 degrees Celsius. However, Zhang's data showed that embryos of hailstones can actually form outside that gradient, between about -33.4 and -8.7 degrees Celsius. Although this largely refutes the previous theory behind hailstone formation, larger hailstones do require extended time (at least one upward growth) in this zone for supercooled water to form more layers. This explains why stronger storms—with more powerful updrafts—often produce larger hailstones. 

Zhang hopes that understanding the inner workings of hailstorm formation will help improve weather forecasting and our ability to estimate the potential dangers of a passing hailstorm (this research is in collaboration with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research). However, improving forecasting capabilities in the U.S. may prove difficult under the Trump Administration, as it steadily levies cuts on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the National Weather Service. Meteorologists at NWS have already reported degraded forecasting services due to curtailed weather balloon launches used to help gather data for accurate storm prediction. 

Although unlocking the secret of hailstone formation could help protect people in the path of dangerous storms, it helps to be able to identify that a storm is coming in the first place.

So many commonalities, so little time. 

In high school chemistry, we all learned that the elements of the periodic table are arranged according to their properties (and most of us will never forget having to fill them in on at least one test). Now, computer science is taking advantage of the usefulness of the periodic table to help them achieve their own scientific ends.

MIT researchers have created a periodic table that orders AI algorithms based on the properties they share with a mathematical framework known as information contrastive learning (I-Con). The table describes how algorithms find the data points where they are linked—a.k.a. where they have that mathematical DNA in common—and internally approximates those links. An individual algorithm can maximize efficiency by minimizing the differences between approximated connections with other algorithms and connections those algorithms are trained to make.

Just like heavy metals and noble gases, algorithms on this AI periodic table are grouped according to what they have in common—both with I-Con and with each other (I-Con is a loss function, which basically gauges a model's performance by figuring out how much it deviates from correct predictions). The table itself was something of an accident that emerged from commonalities between classical machine-learning algorithms. When Shaden Alshamarri, an MIT graduate student, was studying the clustering algorithm—which can learn to sort images into clusters depending on how similar they are—she found that it reminded her of a different algorithm known as contrastive learning.

“I-Con reveals that many seemingly disparate methods including clustering, spectral graph theory, contrastive learning, dimensionality reduction, and supervised classification are all cases of the same underlying loss function,” she and her team said in a study that was recently presented at the 2025 International Conference of Learning Representations (ICLR).

The contrastive learning algorithm was inspired by human brain function in the visual cortex—parts of the ventral visual cortex are involved with recognizing and categorizing objects, and a model trained in contrastive learning can learn to accurately carry out visual tasks by contrasting objects against each other. Alshamarri discovered that a mathematical function (I-Con) could show how the clustering algorithm she was studying was connected to this contrastive learning algorithms.

As Alshamarri and her team found relationships between the I-Con function and more types of algorithms, they realized they could arrange them in a way that mirrored the periodic table. These algorithms include dimensionality reduction (which deals with an overwhelming amount of data by reducing the features in a dataset) and supervised classification (which has the model predicting outcomes).

Just like the actual periodic table, which includes blank spaces for elements that have yet to be discovered, there are empty spaces in the AI periodic table that have been left blank for algorithms whose datapoint connections to I-Con are still unknown.

“We believe that the results presented in this work represent just a fraction of the methods that are potentially unify-able with I-Con,” Alshamarri said in the same study. “And we hope the community can use this viewpoint to improve collaboration and analysis across algorithms and machine learning disciplines.”

Metrics details

A longstanding prediction in interstellar theory posits that significant quantities of molecular gas, crucial for star formation, may be undetected due to being 'dark' in commonly used molecular gas tracers, such as carbon monoxide. We report the discovery of Eos, a dark molecular cloud located just 94 pc from the Sun. This cloud is identified using H2 far-ultraviolet fluorescent line emission, which traces molecular gas at the boundary layers of star-forming and supernova remnant regions. The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude side of the North Polar Spur, a prominent X-ray/radio structure. Our distance estimate utilizes three-dimensional dust maps, the absorption of the soft-X-ray background, and hot gas tracers such as O vi; these place the cloud at a distance consistent with the Local Bubble's surface. Using high-latitude CO maps we note a small amount (\(M_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\approx 20\text{--}40\,M_{\odot }\)) of CO-bright cold molecular gas, in contrast with the much larger estimate of the cloud's true molecular mass (\(M_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\approx 3.4\times 1{0}^{3}\,M_{\odot }\)), indicating that most of the cloud is CO dark. Combining observational data with novel analytical models and simulations, we predict that this cloud will photoevaporate in 5.7 Myr, placing key constraints on the role of stellar feedback in shaping the closest star-forming regions to the Sun.

Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant molecule in the universe and a key ingredient in all known star and planet formation. The stellar nurseries nearest to the Sun lie along the surface of a structure known as the Local Bubble1, in which our Solar System currently resides. Spanning a few hundred parsecs in diameter, the Local Bubble is a superbubble probably formed by multiple supernovae that created a hot evacuated interior cavity surrounded by a shell of swept-up gas and dust1,2.

All recent studies of the Local Bubble's star-forming molecular clouds and, indeed, all molecular clouds identified in the Milky Way Galaxy have relied on three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional observations of dust in emission and/or extinction3,4, and molecular spectral-line observations of CO5,6,7,8,9 or gamma rays8,9. CO, in particular, is important because it can be used as a tracer of the total mass of H2 in star-forming clouds, rather than observing the much fainter H2 line emission directly. Observing H2 is challenging because it is a homonuclear molecule and hence has no rotational dipole transitions. The first excited state of H2 capable of emission occurs at a temperature of T = 511 K, in stark contrast with the average T ≈ 10 K in dense regions of molecular clouds. Thus, much of the molecular cloud cannot be directly observed in H2, and other molecules, such as the relatively abundant CO molecule, whose lowest energy level is situated at 5.5 K, and OH10, are often used. Nevertheless, it is possible to directly observe H2 in emission in the infrared and far-ultraviolet (FUV), where it emits primarily along the boundaries of clouds or in warm shock-excited regions.

Here we identify a new Local Bubble diffuse molecular cloud that we name the Eos cloud using the FUV fluorescent emission capabilities of H2 molecules directly. FUV fluorescent emission of H2 stems from the ability of H2 to absorb FUV photons in the Lyman–Werner band (photons with energy between 11.2 eV and 13.6 eV), which sends the molecules into excited electronic states11,12. The relaxation back into the electronic ground state gives rise to fluorescent emission lines ranging between 912 and 1,700 Å.

To reveal the Eos molecular cloud we use the FUV fluorescent survey Far-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (FIMS). Figure 1 shows the all-sky map of FUV fluorescent H2 emission from FIMS13. FIMS, also known as Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from Astrophysical Radiation (SPEAR), hereafter referred to as FIMS/SPEAR, was an FUV spectrograph that operated from November 2003 to May 2005 as an instrument on the Korean satellite STSAT-113,14. FIMS/SPEAR observed over 70% of the sky at moderate spatial (5 arcmin) and low spectral resolution (R = λ/δλ ≈ 550).

Top: FIMS/SPEAR FUV H2 fluorescence emission map13. Bottom: map of the ratio of H2 intensity to total FUV intensity. In both the top and bottom panels, the location of the Eos cloud is outlined and appears as a bright fluorescent feature that is not present in the FUV continuum. We determine the on-sky boundary for the Eos cloud on the basis of the magenta contours in the bottom panel, which outline the 10% ratio of H2 intensity.

In the top two panels, we show the FUV H2 fluorescence emission map, in log line units (LU: photons cm−2 sr−1 s−1). In the bottom panels, we show a map of the ratio of H2 intensity to total FUV intensity, in percentage points (%). In both the top and bottom panels, the location of the Eos cloud, the feature of interest in this work, is highlighted, and appears as a bright fluorescent feature. The cloud line intensity is 20,000 LU on average and spans l = 25–45° and b = 40–63°. The cloud is not present in Hα emission nor is it seen in the FUV continuum data (not shown here, but see Figs. 3b and 4c from ref. 13), indicating a lack of massive stars and pointing to its being a gaseous molecular structure. It can therefore be seen very distinctly when viewing the ratio of H2 fluorescent intensity to total FUV intensity, as seen in the bottom panels of Fig. 1.

The insets in Fig. 1 show Cartesian close-ups of the cloud. The cloud has a characteristic crescent shape, which can be used to determine its correspondence to other gas tracers. For example, the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H i (GALFA-H i) Survey is a comprehensive project aimed at mapping the neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way at a spatial resolution of 4 arcmin and a spectral resolution of 0.18 km s−1 (ref. 15). The top right panel of Fig. 2 shows the contours of the Eos cloud overlaid on the 21-cm GALFA Survey map. H i is expected to be observed in and around molecular clouds as it is required for shielding molecules from dissociation from background UV photons16,17,18. In deeper regions of the cloud, the H2 can self-shield against dissociating UV radiation, but the outer layers will still have substantial amounts of H i due to ongoing photodissociation19,20. The fluorescent FUV emission traces the atomic-to-molecular cloud boundary (that is, the H2 to H i transition), and an excellent agreement is indeed observed between the 21-cm map and the FIMS/SPEAR contours. Using a high-latitude CO map6, we can search for CO emission that might be associated with the Eos cloud. In Fig. 2, bottom right, we show the Eos cloud CO data from ref. 6. A small CO cloud is present in the vicinity of the Eos cloud, which is identified as cloud 32 in ref. 6, with l = 37.75° and b = 44.75°, and is coincident with the location of MBM 4021,22. We discuss the implications for star formation given the possible association with this CO feature in Supplementary Methods.

The magenta contours in all images represent the H2 emission contour from the fluorescent emission in Fig. 1. Top left: total extinction derived by integrating the Dustribution density along the line of sight. Top middle: column density (NH) map of the Eos cloud derived from Planck 545 GHz data26 assuming T = 10 K, (Planck dust emissivity coefficient) κν = 4.73 cm2 g−1 and a distance of 100 pc. Top right: GALFA-H i column density map15. Bottom left and middle: ROSAT 0.25-keV (left) and 1-keV (middle) maps from ref. 34. The Eos cloud shows a prominent outline absorbing the soft-X-ray flux and creating a bright X-ray halo towards lower Galactic longitude. The interaction region provides a nearby example of a hot–cold gas interface. Bottom right: CO data from ref. 6; the small CO-bright region (known as MBM 40) within the on-sky cloud boundary is shown by the white arrow.

We compute the distance of the cloud using 3D dust mapping techniques, estimate its mass and describe its connection to the Local Bubble. The dust-based total column density maps are shown in Fig. 2. Total extinction, derived by integrating the 3D dust mapping technique Dustribution23,24,25, is displayed in the top left panel. We further describe the Dustribution algorithm in Supplementary Methods. The top middle panel in Fig. 2 shows the column density map of the Eos cloud derived from the Planck mission at 545 GHz (ref. 26).

Using Dustribution, we compute a 3D dust map of the solar neighbourhood out to a distance of 350 pc. Figure 3 shows the reconstructed map, focusing on the region of the Eos cloud as a function of distance. We see a single, distinct cloud that corresponds to the H2 emission stretching from 94 to 130 pc; no other clouds are visible along the same lines of sight in Fig. 3. This establishes the cloud as among the closest to our Solar System, on the near side of the Sco–Cen OB association1 and consistent with some reported distances to the high-latitude portion of the North Polar Spur known as Loop I from refs. 27,28.

Top: two-dimensional slices of the cloud at different distances. The colour bar indicates both the total dust extinction density and the total mass density, assuming dust properties from ref. 29 and a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 124. As in Fig. 1, the magenta contour shows the region with high H2/FUV ratio. Bottom left: Dustribution density for b = 55°. The two red lines indicate the minimum and maximum extents of the magenta contour in Fig. 2, and the cyan and green dashed lines indicate the extent of the Local Bubble at this latitude (from refs. 58 and 59 respectively). Bottom right: projected view of the Eos cloud isosurface and surroundings relative to Local Bubble models. There is no indication of other clouds in the same direction. The 3D dust density of the solar neighbourhood highlighting the Eos cloud and the Local Bubble models can be viewed at links provided in the Data availability section.

Smaller condensations are visible inside the cloud, and it seems that the cloud has a distance gradient, with the parts further from the Galactic plane being closer to us, and vice versa. A projected view of the Eos cloud isosurface and surroundings relative to Local Bubble models is shown in the bottom right of Fig. 3. There is no indication of other clouds in the same direction. Integrating the dust density on the basis of dust properties and a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 124 from ref. 29 results in a total dust mass for the cloud of 44 M⊙ and a total mass of 5.5 × 103 M⊙ within the magenta contour in Fig. 1. If we instead include all the dust in the range 20° < l < 50°, 38° < b < 70° and 90 pc < d (distance) < 140 pc, we find a total mass of 8.5 × 103 M⊙. We use Astrodendro to estimate the 3D boundaries of the cloud30,31. From these boundaries, we calculate the effective radius of an equivolume sphere as 25.5 pc. This gives an average mass density of 7.9 × 10−2 M⊙ pc−3. To derive the H i mass of the cloud we convert the H i column density observed within the Eos cloud region assuming an area of 15° × 20° and 〈N(H i)〉 = 3 × 1020, where 〈N(H i)〉 is the column density of H i. In this way we derive an H i mass of 2.0 × 103 M⊙ taking up 36% of the total cloud mass within the contour.

Interestingly, this molecular cloud is located in the vicinity of a region of the sky with significant emission at radio and X-ray wavelengths known as the North Polar Spur (NPS). The NPS is probably composed of a superposition of emitting layers from as far away as the Galactic centre to as close as the Local Bubble1,2. The nearby high-Galactic-latitude portion of the NPS, referred to as Loop I (hereafter NPS/Loop I), is probably at a distance of 105–135 pc (refs. 27,28), although this nearby distance is debated32,33. The 3D dust map from Dustribution as seen in Fig. 3 (bottom panels) agrees well with the nearby literature distances, showing a corresponding arc-like structure at ~100 pc. The proximity of the two structures to each other, on sky and along the line of sight, may suggest they are directly interacting with one another or that the Eos cloud is a foreground object. In Figs. 2 (bottom left and middle panels) and 3 (bottom panels) we show the position of the NPS/Loop I in relation to Eos. The 0.25-keV soft-X-ray map (bottom left panel of Fig. 2) probes hot gas in the local interstellar medium (ISM). The ROSAT 0.25-keV map has been crucial in studying the Local Hot Bubble, showing its extent and structure. Ref. 34 presented a model for the 0.25-keV soft-X-ray diffuse background in which the observed flux is dominated by a ~106 K thermal plasma located in a 100–300-pc-diameter bubble surrounding the Sun but has significant contributions from a very patchy Galactic halo and charge exchange in the heliosphere35. The Eos cloud's characteristic crescent shape outlines the soft-X-ray emission. The fact that the Eos cloud shape impacts the soft X-rays detected by ROSAT may have significant implications for the distance of the cloud and its column density. The absorption of soft X-rays suggests the nearby nature of the Eos cloud and indicates that the cloud acts as a barrier that prevents the soft X-rays from penetrating34. The bottom middle panel of Fig. 2 shows the higher-energy 1-keV map. Interestingly, the Eos cloud contours appear to absorb the 1-keV X-rays of the NPS/Loop I at b = 40–60°, which is similar to what happens in the 0.25-keV X-ray image. This may suggest that the cloud is interacting with the X-rays from the NPS/Loop I.

The shape of the NPS/Loop I emission at these high latitudes is clearly modulated by the presence of the Eos cloud. In addition to the ROSAT soft-X-ray data, the Eos cloud can be seen as a potential foreground shadow to other hot gas tracers such as O vi (Fig. 4, top panel). The structural similarities seen in Fig. 4 between the soft-X-ray and [O vi] emission, which both intensify at the cloud boundary, are suggestive of an X-ray ‘halo'. This is due to the high ionization potential of O v (113.9 eV, equivalent to λionization ≈ 110 Å) meaning that the generation of O vi ions in the ISM is dominated by collisional ionization and thus requires an interaction of the cloud and hot gas. While earlier studies36, on the basis of [O vi] absorption towards stars with known distances, have shown that such X-ray halos can be physically associated with neutral clouds embedded in hot gas, our [O vi] emission maps are more ambiguous as to the distance to the emitting medium. The geometric similarities and the need for high-energy gas to cause O vi ionization argue for an association of the cloud with the NPS/Loop I material, whether as solely an X-ray foreground shadow or a true X-ray halo. In Methods, we demonstrate that the fluorescent emission of the cloud is probably generated both by the background ISM FUV radiation field and by the X-ray emission from the NPS/Loop I.

Top row: FIMS/SPEAR O vi data, modified from ref. 52. The Eos cloud shows a distinctive absorption of hot gas traced by O vi. Second row: CO data from ref. 6 highlighting the Eos cloud. The small CO-bright region within the on-sky cloud boundary is shown by the white arrow. Bottom two rows: ROSAT 0.25-keV (third row) and 1-keV (bottom row) all-sky maps from ref. 34. The Eos cloud shows a prominent outline absorbing the soft-X-ray flux and creating a bright X-ray halo towards lower Galactic longitude. The interaction region provides a nearby example of a hot–cold gas interface. Magenta contours are overlaid, showing the location of strong H2 fluorescence from Fig. 1. The Eos cloud is outlined and a cut-out zooming in on the region is provided.

Will the cloud be photodissociated by the NPS/Loop I X-rays and ISM FUV background photons before star formation can take place? Regarding the gravitational collapse of the region, we can estimate the thermal Jeans mass of the cloud, assuming a radius of 25.5 pc (estimated using the dust-based distance to the cloud and size on the sky). Masses larger than the Jeans mass are unstable to gravitational contraction, which occurs when the gravitational free-fall timescale is faster than the sound-speed-crossing timescale. Given a range of uncertain temperatures and masses for the cloud, we find that it is marginally stable against gravitational collapse for temperatures typical of warm H2, as described in Supplementary Methods. Including the effects of turbulence and magnetic fields in this analysis would only increase stability against collapse. More precise temperature measurements could be made in the near future with higher-spectral-resolution FUV instruments (see, for example, ref. 37).

Regarding dissociation, given the average total fluorescent intensity of the Eos cloud and the average 21-cm H i column density, we can compute the dissociation and formation rates of H2 using the framework of ref. 38. Since the process of H2 photo-excitation results in both line emission and H2 dissociation, the H2 dissociation rate is proportional to the total intensity of the H2 emission lines. We estimate the observed H2 dissociation rate to be \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{D}}^{({\rm{obs}})}=0.32\,M_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{Myr}}}^{-1}\). Similarly, equation 12 of ref. 38 provides an estimate of the formation rate (\({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{F}}^{({\rm{obs}})}\)), which we estimate to be \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{F}}^{({\rm{obs}})}=0.02\,M_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{Myr}}}^{-1}\).

On the basis of the fact that \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{F}}^{({\rm{obs}})} < {\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{D}}^{({\rm{obs}})}\) and the fact that the cloud is quasi-Jeans supported, we conclude that the cloud is dissociating. Given \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{D}}^{({\rm{obs}})}\), a radius of 25 pc and H2 mass of 3,400 M⊙, the cloud will be destroyed on a timescale of ~5.7 Myr and is being photodissociated at a rate of ~600 M⊙ Myr−1.

It is of interest to connect these numbers to average conditions at the solar circle. The star-formation surface density in the disk local to the Sun is ~0.005 M⊙ yr−1 kpc2 (ref. 39). If the area of disk being surveyed is roughly 200 × 200 pc2, then the average star formation rate is around 200 M⊙ Myr−1 in this region. This calculation suggests that the photodissociation rate (and implied gas cycling rate in equilibrium) is about three times the star-formation rate, which is consistent with typical star-formation inefficiencies when combined with dynamical processes such as interstellar turbulence and stellar jets and winds as predicted in the numerical simulations of ref. 40. In this respect, dissociating clouds such as the one discovered here may be a common component of the feedback cycle that regulates star formation in galaxies.

We briefly review the data collection and identification of the H2 lines. For this investigation, we have used data from the FIMS/SPEAR long-wavelength channel (L-channel; 1,350–1,710 Å), which includes several key transitions of molecular hydrogen fluorescence. While the spectral resolution of the data is too low for individual line identification, the collected data provides low-resolution H2 bumps within the L-channel spectrum that can be used to detect H2 fluorescence. The H2 fluorescence features are dominant in two bands, from 1,450 to 1,525 Å and from 1,560 to 1,630 Å. Reference 13 used data from the FIMS/SPEAR mission to construct a nearly all-sky map of diffuse molecular hydrogen fluorescence in emission, as well as an FUV continuum map.

The FIMS/SPEAR all-sky diffuse-background FUV spectrum, weighted by exposure time and with direct stellar photons excluded, consists of multiple components: dust-scattered stellar continuum, hydrogen two-photon continuum, extragalactic background continuum, atomic emission lines and H2 fluorescence emission lines. The spectrum includes atomic emission lines such as Si iv λ1403, Si ii* λ1533, C iv λλ1548, 1551, He ii λ1640 and Al ii λ1671, along with several quasi-bandlike features of H2 fluorescence emission lines. The H2 fluorescence features are most prominent in the wavelength ranges 1,450–1,525 Å and 1,560–1,630 Å. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the original data cube, with stellar photons removed, was rebinned to the larger wavelength bin size of 3 Å. As a result, the seven H2 fluorescence emission lines with significant peaks consist of many narrow lines and appear as broad lines in the coarse-grained spectrum. An example spectrum can be seen in Fig. 1 of ref. 13. The data are public on the NASA Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) archive.

To extract only the H2 fluorescence emission, ref. 13 removed all continuum background components and atomic emission lines. The H2 fluorescence emission map was constructed using a pixel size of approximately 0.92° (ref. 41). The spectrum for each pixel was obtained by smoothing the spectra of neighbouring pixels with weights proportional to the exposure time. The radius of the smoothing circle for each pixel was adaptively increased from 2° to 15° in steps of 1° until the signal-to-noise ratio per spectral bin was greater than 15. The Eos cloud is a robust feature of the data regardless of whether adaptive smoothing is utilized or not (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The Eos cloud was discovered through H2 fluorescence lines, which were observed by FIMS/SPEAR during its all-sky survey. A variety of factors limited the instrument's ability to capture all of the H2 fluorescence lines. The primary limitation is the instrument's bandpass, which is unable to capture H2 lines below 1,350 Å. The spectral resolution and sensitivity of the instrument impose further limitations for the remaining in-band emission lines. From the H2 emission map and corresponding exposure time maps developed in ref. 13, the average exposure time per pixel is ~2,200 s for the Eos cloud. Due to contamination during launch operations, the L-channel sensitivity suffered a loss of ~74% (refs. 42,43). Given the relatively low exposure time, significant loss in sensitivity and low R ≈ 550, only a small fraction of the total intensity emitted in the H2 lines is detected. We define this fraction to be

where \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) is the total H2 line intensity emitted by the Eos cloud and \(\langle {{\mathcal{I}}}_{\det }\rangle\) is the H2 line intensity detected by FIMS/SPEAR, both in LU.

To determine the fraction η for the Eos cloud, we utilize the H2Spec model developed in ref. 44 to generate synthetic H2 spectra. H2Spec requires as inputs the column density of H2, the gas temperature of H2 and a source spectrum. We assume that the observed H2 is pumped by the Draine UV interstellar radiation field (ISRF)45, which is parameterized by the Draine field strength:

where u is the FUV energy density within a wavelength range of 912–2,480 Å and u0 is the FUV energy density of the Draine ISRF. A value of χ = 1 corresponds to a unit Draine field (which is equivalent to G0 = 1.7, where G0 is the field strength in units of the Habing field46). We use χ = 1 as the first model input, representative of the typical UV background for the solar neighbourhood45, along with an H2 gas temperature of T = 100 K. We also explored T = 500 K but found that this did not strongly affect the line amplitudes. We generate synthetic fluorescence spectra with H2Spec, where the H2 column density of the emitting layer is the sole variable. The value of \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) is then calculated for each synthetic spectrum.

To estimate \(\langle {{\mathcal{I}}}_{\det }\rangle\), we model the instrument's response to the synthetic H2 fluorescence spectrum. We first convolve the synthetic spectrum with a line spread function consistent with a fully illuminated instrument slit. We then calculate the noise floor of a single FIMS/SPEAR observation of the Eos cloud by utilizing the 3σ instrument sensitivity curve as a function of wavelength, found in Fig. 1 of ref. 47. These sensitivities were calculated before FIMS/SPEAR was launched, and account for the ~74% loss in sensitivity in the instrument response model. We adjust the sensitivity curve to be consistent with the exposure time reported in the H2 exposure time map. Finally, the observed spectrum is interpolated onto the FIMS/SPEAR L-channel bandpass.

We combine the H2Spec model and the instrument response model to determine the value of η for the FIMS/SPEAR cloud. We fit the H2 column density to the observed range of \(\langle {{\mathcal{I}}}_{\det }\rangle\) values in the Eos cloud, \(\langle {{\mathcal{I}}}_{\det }\rangle =(1.29\pm 0.29)\times 1{0}^{4}\) LU. The best fit results in \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}=(1.44\pm 0.10)\times 1{0}^{5}\) LU. Therefore, the Eos cloud is observed to have η = (8.96 ± 2.11) × 10−2. For reference, the value obtained for the model assuming T = 500 K was η = (7.77 ± 1.11) × 10−2.

In the following sections, we compare the value of \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) with model predictions, first considering an analytic photodissociation region model that assumes chemical steady state and then considering an out-of-equilibrium model.

Following ref. 48, the total H2 line intensity in a steady-state photodissociation region is given by

where \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) (LU) is the total line FUV intensity, R (cm3 s−1) is the H2 formation-rate coefficient on dust grains, n (cm−3) is the hydrogen nucleus number density (including H and H2), σg (cm2) is the dust absorption cross-section in the Lyman–Werner band per hydrogen nucleus, pdiss is the photodissociation probability per H2 photo-excitation, χ is the illuminating FUV radiation field intensity in units of the Draine field and β is a dimensionless factor accounting for the attenuation of H2 emission lines by dust (Appendix A in ref. 38).

This model assumes chemical steady state between H2 formation on dust grains and H2 photodissociation by Lyman–Werner radiation within an optically thick, uniform-density one-dimensional slab, externally irradiated by Lyman–Werner radiation normal to the slab surface. For a full derivation, see ref. 48 and Appendix A in ref. 38. We express Sternberg's dimensionless parameter αG (characterizing the H2 dissociation-to-formation-rate ratio) in terms of the radiation-intensity-to-density ratio χ/n, assuming αG = 59χ/n cm3 for standard solar metallicity gas (see equation 22 in ref. 49).

In equation (4), we evaluate the expression assuming standard parameter values: pdiss = 0.15, R = 3 × 10−17 cm3 s−1, σg = 1.9 × 10−21 cm2 and β = 0.5 (ref. 38). Notably, \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) is only weakly sensitive to metallicity and dust-to-gas ratio variations, as both R and σg are proportional to the effective area of dust grains, causing their effects to largely cancel out in equation (4).

Supplementary Fig. 2 presents the theoretical prediction of \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) as a function of χ (blue curve) for n = 10 cm−3, as given by equation (4). The surrounding shaded region corresponds to models with densities varying from n = 1 cm−3 (lower envelope) to n = 100 cm−3 (upper envelope). The vertical magenta-shaded zone encloses expected values of χ = 0.5–1, representing a parameter space around the standard ISRF value χ = 1. The horizontal orange strip above the theoretical models represents the total H2 line intensity emitted by the Eos cloud found in the previous section.

Our analysis reveals that the chemical steady-state model predictions are below the observed total H2 line intensity emitted by the Eos cloud considering a typical UV ISRF. This discrepancy could be attributed to a combination of factors, including the impact of additional excitation sources, such as energetic photoelectrons produced by X-ray absorption, and the invalidity of the chemical steady-state assumption for the Eos cloud. Both factors are likely contributors, given the cloud's proximity to the NPS/Loop I and its shape imprinted on the NPS/Loop I.

Regarding out-of-equilibrium H2: as described in equation 9 of ref. 38, the observed H2 dissociation rate is given by

where \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}\) is the total photon intensity summed over all the FUV emission lines (photons cm−2 s−1 sr−1) and \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{5}}}\equiv {{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}/1{0}^{5}\,({\rm{photons}}\,{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{{\rm{sr}}}^{-1})\), and N21 ≡ N/1021 (cm−2) is the average column density of atomic neutral hydrogen. With the estimated averaged \({{\mathcal{I}}}_{{\rm{tot}}}=1.4\times 1{0}^{5}\) LU from FIMS/SPEAR line modelling and average N21 ≈ 0.4 from GALFA, we obtain \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{D}}^{({\rm{obs}})}=0.32\,M_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{Myr}}}^{-1}\).

Similarly, equation 12 of ref. 38 provides an estimate of the formation rate (\({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{F}}^{({\rm{obs}})}\)), with this power-law relation:

where α = 1.3 and fH ≡ N(H)/N. The power-law relation with N21 arises from calibration using numerical simulations50,51 to approximate the product of the formation-rate coefficient of H2 on dust grains and the ISM density. More discussion on the derivation of equation (6) can be found in ref. 38. For the Eos cloud, the estimated formation rate using fH = 1 and the average N21 ≈ 0.4 from GALFA is \({\dot{\varSigma }}_{\mathrm{F}}^{({\rm{obs}})}=0.02\,M_{\odot }\,{{\rm{pc}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{Myr}}}^{-1}\).

These calculations suggest that photodissociation (from X-rays and UV) dominates H2 formation for this cloud. Future studies using spectral resolution higher than that of FIMS/SPEAR could directly test how far the cloud is from chemical equilibrium37.

All-sky maps showing the O vi, CO and X-ray data are provided in Fig. 4 to give context to the location of the cloud on the sky in various tracers. In particular, in addition to the ROSAT soft-X-ray data, the Eos cloud can be seen as a foreground shadow to other hot gas tracers. In the top panel of Fig. 4, we show the cloud contours overlaid on an all-sky map of five-times ionized oxygen (O vi) published in ref. 52. O vi traces hot, ionized regions probably produced by supernova remnants in the ISM with temperatures around a million degrees Kelvin. The cloud discussed herein produces a characteristic absorption in the O vi emission map, similar to what is shown by the soft-X-ray data, indicating that it is a cooler, denser foreground object. We note that the exact shape of the structures in these emission maps depends on where the hot gas causing the O vi ions originates and can include geometric effects of the line of sight and magnetic field. O vi absorption to stars with known distances will be of great value in understanding the relation between the hot gas and the Eos cloud. On the basis of the spatial correspondence between the X-ray data, O vi emission map and Eos cloud, it is very likely that this interaction between the molecular complex and hot gas provides the nearest example of a hot–cold ISM gas interface, which is also thought to be responsible for the O vi absorption observed through many sight lines throughout the Galaxy.

Given the presence of even a small mass of cold CO-bright gas, it is natural to enquire about the fate of this diffuse high-latitude molecular cloud. Is it on its way to being actively star forming, as is the case of present-day, more massive molecular clouds in the Local Bubble vicinity? Or will the cloud photodissociate before star formation can take place? Using a range of cloud masses and temperatures, we can estimate the Jeans mass of the cloud, assuming a radius of 25.54 pc (estimated using the dust-based distance to the cloud and size on the sky). Masses larger than the Jeans mass are unstable to gravitational contraction, which occurs when the gravitational free-fall timescale is shorter than the sound-crossing timescale.

Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the ratio of the cloud mass to the Jeans mass, considering only thermal support. For a range of estimated masses from 3D dust maps (Supplementary Fig. 4) and over a range of reasonable temperatures for the H2 gas, the cloud is marginally stable against gravitational collapse for temperatures above 100 K. This reflects the very low densities of the diffuse gas of ρ = 0.08 M⊙ pc−3. We note that our calculations make simplistic assumptions about spherical geometry and lack estimations for turbulence and magnetic fields. However, adding these terms would only strengthen the support of the cloud against collapse. Future work will examine the role of turbulence and magnetic fields in the Eos cloud with additional analysis of 21-cm emission maps and Planck polarization data.

We compute a 3D dust map of the solar neighbourhood out to a distance of 350 pc using the 3D dust mapping algorithm Dustribution23,24,25 modified with a variational nearest-neighbour Gaussian process53. Variational nearest-neighbour Gaussian processes can scale to almost unlimited numbers of voxels in the map in linear, rather than cubic, time; these modifications will be described in more detail in a forthcoming paper. This volume is divided into voxels such that (nl, nb, nd) = (360, 180, 117) with equal spacing in l and d and in sin b, giving us a grid resolution of l, b, d = 1°, 1°, 3 pc.

Dustribution takes in any catalogue of 3D dust extinction and distances and computes its 3D dust density and extinction within the given region. For the purposes of this Article, we utilize the catalogue of ref. 54, which derives stellar parameters from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP spectra, BP/RP and G photometry and parallaxes, 2MASS and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry and LAMOST spectra using a data-driven approach.

To derive the 3D isocontour from Astrodendro requires several input parameters: the minimum density above which cells may be included in structures, the minimum difference at which substructures may be identified and the minimum number of pixels in a structure, which we set to 4 × 10−5 mag pc−1, 0.15 dex and 8 pixels, respectively, on the basis of the final mean Dustribution model parameters.

For validation, we compare the Eos cloud line-of-sight width and masses with those of ref. 55. Applying the above methods to determine distance and mass, we derive a line-of-sight distance of 90–140 pc and a mass of 1.6 × 103 M⊙. While the line-of-sight width is in excellent agreement with our results from Dustribution, there is a difference of approximately a factor of 3 in the recovered masses. This mass discrepancy could be a result of the differences in the implementation and the resolutions of the two 3D dust density maps.

Several large and well-known molecular complexes in the Local Bubble vicinity are actively star forming, including Taurus, Ophiuchus, Lupus, Chamaeleon and Corona Australis1. These clouds are all observed in dense and cold gas tracers such as CO. In Fig. 4, second row, we show the CO data from ref. 6. As previously mentioned, a small CO cloud (MBM 40) is present at l = 37.75° and b = 44.75°.

While the distance to MBM 40 is not well constrained, if it is associated with the Eos cloud we can compute its mass, given the known distance to Eos. Adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 2 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1 (ref. 56) and including a factor of 1.36 for heavy elements, we can compute the cloud mass from the CO luminosity:

Using LCO = 1.53 K km s−1 deg2 from ref. 6 and d = 100 pc, the mass of the Eos cloud predicted by the CO emission is estimated to be M = 19.9 M⊙. Variations of a factor of a few in mass may be expected due to uncertainties in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor at high Galactic latitudes22,57. The CO luminosity estimates a cloud mass that is two to three orders of magnitude off of the mass estimated from dust and traces a much smaller volume than the more diffuse H2 gas. This highlights the importance of tracking CO-dark gas when estimating cloud masses and extents.

Metrics details

The European Union is committed to achieving ambitious area-based conservation and restoration targets in the upcoming decade. However, there is concern that these targets risk conflicting with socioeconomic needs, particularly for food, timber and bioenergy production. Here we develop an integrated spatial planning approach to identify where restoration, conservation and production allocation could maximize benefits to species conservation and climate mitigation, while acknowledging future land demands of the bio-economy. We show that, while changing production demands risk driving further biodiversity loss by 2030, when these demands are met alongside strategic restoration measures, as outlined by the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, future landscapes could improve the conservation status of populations for more than 20% of species of conservation concern while also increasing terrestrial carbon stocks. Our analysis demonstrates how critical the Nature Restoration Regulation is to achieving biodiversity targets and how integrated planning can align biodiversity policy objectives with future socioeconomic demands.

Metrics details

Uncovering the genomic bases of phenotypic adaptation is a major goal in biology, but this has been hard to achieve for complex behavioural traits. Here we leverage the repeated, independent evolution of obligate cavity nesting in birds to test the hypothesis that pressure to compete for a limited breeding resource has facilitated convergent evolution in behaviour, hormones and gene expression. We used an integrative approach, combining aggression assays in the field, testosterone measures and transcriptome-wide analyses of the brain in wild-captured females and males. Our experimental design compared species pairs across five avian families, each including one obligate cavity-nesting species and a related species with a more flexible nest strategy. We find behavioural convergence, with higher levels of territorial aggression in obligate cavity nesters, particularly among females. Across species, levels of testosterone in circulation were not associated with nest strategy nor aggression. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes and co-regulated gene networks revealed more shared patterns of brain gene expression than expected by drift, although the scope of convergent gene expression evolution was limited to a small percentage of the genome. When comparing our results to other studies that did not use phylogenetic methods, we suggest that accounting for shared evolutionary history may reduce the number of genes inferred as convergently evolving. Altogether, we find that behavioural convergence in response to shared ecological pressures is associated with largely independent evolution of gene expression across different avian families, punctuated by a narrow set of convergently evolving genes.

Metrics details

Generative AI is changing biotechnology research, and accelerating drug discovery, protein design and synthetic biology. It also enhances biomedical imaging, personalized medicine and laboratory automation, which enables faster and more efficient scientific advancements. However, these breakthroughs have also raised biosecurity concerns, which has prompted policy and community discussions1,2,3,4.

The power of generative AI lies in its ability to generalize from known data to the unknown. Deep generative models can predict novel biological molecules that might not resemble existing genome sequences or proteins. This capability introduces dual-use risks and serious biosecurity threats — such models could potentially bypass the established safety screening mechanisms used by nucleic acid synthesis providers5, which presently rely on database matching to identify sequences of concerns6. AI-driven tools could be misused to engineer pathogens, toxins or destabilizing biomolecules, and AI science agents could amplify risks by automating experimental designs7.

Metrics details

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed and food legume crop, with seed size and weight being critical traits for domestication and breeding. However, genomic rearrangements like structural variations (SVs) underlying seed size and weight remain unclear. Here we present a comprehensive pangenome analysis utilizing eight high-quality genomes (two diploid wild, two tetraploid wild and four tetraploid cultivated peanuts) and resequencing data of 269 accessions with diverse seed sizes. We identified 22,222 core or soft-core, 22,232 distributed and 5,643 private gene families. The frequency of SVs in subgenome A is higher than in subgenome B. We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs and 190 SVs associated with seed size or weight. Notably, a 275-bp deletion in gene AhARF2-2 results in loss of interaction with AhIAA13 and TOPLESS, reducing the inhibitory effect on AhGRF5 and promoting seed expansion. This high-quality pangenome serves as a fundamental resource for the genetic enhancement of peanuts and other legume crops.

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important legume crop for vegetable oil and protein1. Cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid species that originated from hybridization of two wild diploid progenitors, Arachis duranensis (AA) and Arachis ipaensis (BB)2,3. Pod size is a critical quantitative agronomic trait that impacts peanut yield. During the domestication process, peanuts were selectively bred from wild accessions with small pods to modern varieties characterized by larger pods. Despite limited exploration of causal genes in peanuts4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, the molecular mechanisms regulating pod size remain largely unresolved. In addition, currently available genomes still contain numerous gaps and high-quality genomic resources for peanuts are lacking because of the complexities of assembling polyploid genomes2,12,13,14,15,16. To optimize the exploration of genomic variations, it is important to have access to high-quality genomic resources across various populations of peanuts.

Different individual genomes of a crop species can vary greatly17,18,19. A pangenome, which amalgamates genomics data from diverse individuals or populations, offers an holistic perspective for a more profound understanding of the genome structural and functional diversity of a species or population18,19,20,21. The pangenome of a crop can be much larger than its reference genome19. Developing a pangenome can identify missing or unannotated genes in the current reference genome, aiding in the discover of genes linked to yield, disease resistance and adaptability, and thus enhancing crop improvement.

In practice, the utilization of genetically diverse germplasm resources for varietal improvement is critical for enhancing peanut yield22. However, the use of germplasm resources to improve traits is still limited, and genomic variations affecting phenotypic diversity remain underexplored. Recently, resequencing of germplasm resources was imperative for the identification of genomic variations and fundamental to the acceleration of genomic research23,24. With the resequencing data of a large number of accessions, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be conducted to identify genomic variations associated with specific traits in natural populations. This approach has been extensively utilized in various gramineous and leguminous crops25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. However, research of the mechanism and application after GWAS in peanuts remains limited23,24,35,36, especially for large-sized variations such as SVs.

In this study, we generated a comprehensive pangenome for both wild and cultivated peanuts, encompassing two diploid wild species, two tetraploid wild species and four tetraploid cultivated species. We assessed the genome-wide diversity of 269 peanut accessions, including wild species, landraces and improved species, and conducted SV-GWAS to investigate agronomic traits related to yield. Our analysis of the peanut pangenome showed significant genomic variations from breeding and highlighted trait-related variations affecting seed size and weight, providing a valuable resource for future improvements.

To explore genetic diversity and population structure in peanut, we collected ~8 TB of resequencing data from 269 accessions with various seed sizes. These accessions come mainly from four populations (32 diploid wild species, 8 tetraploid wild species, 155 tetraploid cultivated landrace, 67 tetraploid improved accessions and 7 unclassified accessions) that are geographically widespread (Fig. 1a). Two accessions were included from previous studies12,15, and 267 accessions were newly sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). After mapping reads and calling variants to the reference genome (Methods), we obtained 5,989,854 (AA: 5,048,032; BB: 941,822) high-quality SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05 and a missing rate <0.5). The phylogenetic tree showed that peanut accessions have diverged from wild and cultivated accessions (Fig. 1b). During the domestication of cultivated accessions from wild accessions, seed size and weight were increased significantly (Fig. 1c). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SNPs in both subgenomes A and B showed clear separation of wild and cultivated accessions. A large genetic distance was found between the A subgenomes of AA wild diploids and AABB allotetraploids, whereas high genetic diversity existed in the B subgenome of landrace peanuts (Fig. 1d,e), perhaps due to the limited availability of BB diploid accessions.

a, Different species (A. hypogaea, their tetraploid A. monticola ancestors, and two wild diploid ancestors A. duranensis and A. ipaensis) and populations (AA/BB, AABB wild, AABB landrace and AABB improved) of peanut, including 269 peanut accessions with different seed sizes, are widely distributed geographically. b, Relationships of peanut accessions are illustrated using a phylogenetic tree based on subsampling 100,000 SNPs.

Source data

AA wild diploid accessions had higher genetic diversity (π; 8.57 × 10−4) than BB wild diploid accessions (5.69 × 10−5). However, the allotetraploid accessions had higher values of π in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome (AABB wild: 9.62 × 10−5 > 7.48 × 10−5; AABB landrace: 1.46 × 10−4 > 1.17 × 10−4; AABB improved: 1.26 × 10−4 > 1.06 × 10−4). Of the four populations, AABB landrace accessions had the highest value of π in the B subgenome, which was consistent with the conclusion from PCA (Fig. 1f,g). Population fixation statistics (FST) values between AA wild diploids and other allotetraploids were high (0.739–0.866), whereas FST values between BB wild diploids and other allotetraploids were low (0.153–0.201) (Fig. 1f,g). The findings indicate an asymmetrical domestication process between subgenomes A and B. ADMIXTURE population structure analysis revealed peanuts possess ancestry proportions that derived from a combination of AABB wild and landrace accessions, with an estimated cluster number K = 9 (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1). All tetraploid wild accessions (Amon_N249, A7, US10 and so on) and several landrace accessions (SA080, DL183, SA117 and so on) were clustered into one group and shared more than 35% proportions with their ancestry BB accessions (H104, US38, US37, US36), suggesting that cultivated accessions likely originated from wild allotetraploid accessions.

We selected the genomes of eight representative peanut accessions that demonstrate a range of diverse pod sizes for the construction of a high-quality peanut pangenome: two previously published genomes and six newly published genomes, including one AA wild diploid, two AABB wild allotetraploids, one AABB landrace allotetraploid and two AABB improved allotetraploids (Fig. 2a,b). Cultivated peanuts (A. hypogaea (Ahy)) originated from tetraploid ancestors (Arachis monticola (Amon)) nearly 4,000 years ago, and these were derived from hybridization between two wild diploids (A. duranensis (Adu) and A. ipaensis (Aip)) approximately 11,000 years ago37 (Fig. 2c). The genomes of the six new sequenced accessions were assembled de novo based on the combination of Nanopore ultra-long, PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies, mainly using NextDenovo and HiC-Pro38,39 (Methods). These chromosome-level genome assemblies were more contiguous and complete than the previously published ones, with scaffold N50 values of 134–148 Mb, contig N50 values of 25–79 Mb, long terminal repeat (LTR) Assembly Index values of 21.27–29.37 and BUSCO values of 98.6–99.4% (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), which indicated the high quality of these genomes. Peanut genomes had a repeat sequence content of nearly 85%, with repeats mainly including retroelements (64–67%) and DNA transposons (10–12%) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4). In total 39,736–77,824 protein-coding genes were annotated (Supplementary Table 5).

We constructed a pangenome of peanut using protein-coding genes. The pangenome was composed of 50,097 gene orthogroups (family): 17,137 core, 5,085 soft-core, 22,232 distributed and 5,643 private. Clustering of the gene family by presence–absence variations (PAVs) showed that the newly de novo assembled genomes had significantly more gene families (~37,000) than the two public genomes (~30,000; Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRST) P < 0.001) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for five tissues showed that 1,086 genes from 1,021 novel families had strong expression evidence in at least one tissue (transcript coverage ≥95% and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped fragments (FPKM) ≥ 2; WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) indicating that a large proportion of the novel genes were real. Of the peanut pangenome, nearly 26,493–37,829 gene families were present in each peanut genome (Supplementary Table 5). The numbers of novel gene families and samples followed a power law distribution (R2 = 0.987, k = 10,150, a = 1.2) (Fig. 2e), indicating that the constructed peanut pangenome was closed. Of the 50,097 gene families, 34.2% were core, 10.2% were soft-core, 44.4% were distributed and 11.3% were private (Fig. 2f). All genes were located near the two telomeres of each chromosome, except for the private genes, which showed peaks on chr. 1 and chr. 7 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Core and private genes in the A subgenome, regardless of the type of gene family, were longer than those in the B subgenome (WRST P < 0.001 (core) and P < 0.05 (private)) (Fig. 2g). The core and soft-core families had longer genes, transcripts, exons and coding sequences (CDSs) than the distributed and private families (WRST, gene, transcript, exon and CDS length, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). The core and soft-core family genes in the B subgenome had higher Ka/Ks values than those in A subgenome (WRST, missense and synonymous rates, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2h). The genes of core and soft-core families had lower missense and synonymous rates than those of distributed and private families (WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5e–g) and higher expression levels in all tissues investigated (WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5h–l and Supplementary Table 6). The genes of core and soft-core families in both the A and B subgenomes were enriched in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and signaling pathways regulating the pluripotency of stem cells, whereas the genes of private gene families were enriched in mannose-type O-glycan biosynthesis. The genes of soft-core families in the A subgenome were uniquely enriched in aflatoxin biosynthesis and the Notch signaling pathway (Fig. 2i). Core genes found in cultivated peanuts but absent from wild peanuts were enriched in photosynthesis and lipid metabolism, indicating that they underwent convergent evolution during domestication (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).

We also investigated members from the distributed and private genes families of accession ZP06, which had the largest pod size (Methods). These genes were enriched in Pfam terms such as NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by Apaf-1, R proteins, and Ced-4) domain, Rx (Potato Virus X Resistance Protein) N-terminal domain, F-box domains and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase N-terminal domain (Fig. 2j). For example, most members of the distributed and private gene families with domain PF00931 (NB-ARC domain) were present in the A subgenome (Fig. 2k). However, a member of the gene family OG0025534 in the A subgenome of ZP06 (SL03G07910) was unique among the gene families of improved peanuts (Fig. 2l). We noted that gain of a core gene family OG0003529 in NDH108 and ZP06 occurred at chr. 3 of the A subgenome during hybridization and polyploidization, which mainly includes the plant growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 4 or 6 genes (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b).

A graph-based peanut pangenome was constructed utilizing a combination of assembly-based and read-based SV detection methods, exemplified by the NB-ARC gene that contains both SVs and small variants (Fig. 3a). Initially, we conducted a synteny analysis across multiple genomes, which revealed significant collinearity in the chromosomes of both the A and B subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 8). From eight peanut genome assemblies, we identified a total of 86,308 high-confidence SVs, with insertions and deletions being the predominant types (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). We performed genotyping on tetraploid accessions using resequencing data, and validated ten SVs in genes by polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR; Supplementary Fig. 10a–k). Insertions were positively correlated with deletions, duplications, inversions and SNPs or insertion–deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 11a). There were more SVs in subgenome A than in subgenome B, and these were not evenly distributed across each chromosome, mainly spreading in chr. 8 of A subgenome (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 11b,c). The size of SVs in the A and B subgenomes varied from 50 to 100,000 bp. The size of insertions was lower in the A subgenome than in the B subgenome, while the sizes of deletions and duplications were higher in A subgenome (Fig. 3d). Of the different SVs, 10–16% overlapped with genes and 15–30% overlapped with the upstream (promoter) or downstream 3,000 bp of genes (Supplementary Fig. 12a); 40–80% of SVs overlapped with repeat elements, particularly LTRs (Supplementary Fig. 12b). The sizes of insertions in promoter and exon regions were extremely variable and were in the three ranges, 50–500 bp, 500–5,000 bp and 5,000+ bp, while the sizes of deletions in promoter and exon regions were not similar (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 13a). Up to 40% of insertions and deletions in the promoter and exon regions were LTR and DNA transposons (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). Genes with insertions in exons were enriched in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the PPRP (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) signaling pathway, while the promoter insertions were enriched in beta-alanine metabolism, and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation (Supplementary Fig. 14). SVs in promoter and exon rather than downstream regions could regulate gene expression (Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 15a–f).

Our analysis particularly concentrated on accession ZP06 with the largest pod size. In this accession, we observed 2,130 insertions and 2,160 deletions in the A subgenome, and 1,401 insertions and 1,352 deletions in the B subgenome (Fig. 4a). In addition, fewer SVs were found to overlap with CDS, promoter regions and downstream regions in both subgenomes from Amon to ZP06 than from diploids to Amon (Amon to ZP06, 36–338; K30076 to ZP06, 40–650; Adu to ZP06, 269–6,185) (Supplementary Fig. 16a–d). There were more deletions in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome from Amon to ZP06 (SVs overlapping CDS, exon, promoter, gene, downstream: 55, 59, 140, 167 and 231 (A); 77, 86, 223, 186 and 338 (B)) (Supplementary Fig. 16c,d). These SV-related genes in the A subgenome were enriched in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, whereas those in the B subgenome were enriched in KEGG pathways such as stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, and inositol phosphate metabolism (Fig. 4b). SVs had the potential to affect gene structure or gene expression directly, including some important genes related to yield and disease resistance. For example, NDH16G00520 (Snakin-2) expression was higher in the flowers and fruits of ZP06, in which there was a 214-bp DNA/DTM (DNA transposon, Mutator) insertion in the promoter, than in other accessions without the insertion (Fig. 4c). In the exon of NDH14G21970 (glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase), the gene with a 7.9-kb deletion had strong evidence of supported whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ZP06 (Fig. 4d). A 1.2-kb insertion of a DNA/DTA (DNA transposon, hAT) transposon in an exon of NDH05G28200 (glycosyl transferase) divided it into two genes (Fig. 4e). A 1.7-kb deletion in ZP06 (encompassing exons of NDH18G35100 and NDH18G35110) resulted in two truncated genes (Fig. 4f). These results indicate that SVs have varied effects on gene functions.

To better understand how genomic variations affect the function of genes during domestication, we further investigated SVs under selection between wild and landrace accessions. Genome-wide analysis of selective sweeps using FST, the nucleotide diversity ratio (πW/πL or πL/πI) and XP-CLR (the cross population composite likelihood ratio test) showed the unbalanced selection of chromosomes during the evolution of landrace accessions from wild accessions (AmToAhL) and improved accessions from landraces (AhLToAhI) (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 17a,b). Chr. 1 (14.6 Mb), chr. 9 (7.8 Mb), chr. 13 (5.3 Mb) and chr. 20 (5.7 Mb) had more selection during the evolution of landrace accessions from wild accessions, whereas chr. 3 (10.3 Mb), chr. 10 (14.5 Mb), chr. 16 (27.4 Mb) and chr. 19 (31.4 Mb) had more regions under selection during the development of improved accessions from landraces (Supplementary Fig. 17c). Regions more than twice the size (AhLToAhI: 29 Mb (A) and 67 Mb (B)) were under selection in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome during the development of improved accessions from landraces (Fig. 5c).

We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs overlapping 329 genes (Supplementary Tables 7–9). Significantly, 108 SV-related genes in the A subgenome were subject to selection during the evolution of landraces from wild accessions, which were enriched in the salt stress response, antifungal and cullin family, whereas 114 genes in the B subgenome were enriched in bromodomain, leucine-rich repeat and sucrose synthase. During the evolution of improved accessions from landraces, 59 SV-related genes under selection in the A subgenome exhibited enrichment in the fasciclin domain and aminotransferase class-V, while 50 genes in the B subgenome were enriched in the legume lectin domain and pathogenesis-related protein bet v1 family (Fig. 5d). Some 41–55% of domestication-related SVs overlap with LTR or Gypsy elements and 35–55% domestication-related SVs overlapped with simple repeats. Of domestication-related SVs from the A and B subgenomes, the percentage of SVs with simple repeats (35% ≪ 52.8–54.7%), Helitron (8% ≪ 15–20%) and low complexity (3% ≪ 7–8%) in the B subgenome were the lowest during the evolution of improved accessions from landrace accessions (Fig. 5e).

Among the genes with domestication-related SVs, 19 were associated with traits such as fruit size or known disease resistance (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). For example, a higher proportion of diploids and wild allotetraploids had a 629-bp deletion in CRK26 (a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene), which is found in a cluster of up to 19 CRK genes on chr. 9: 114.3–114.9 Mb (Fig. 6a). A 27.7-kb deletion in IRK (a leucine-rich repeat gene) was difficult to detect because of alignment deviation near tandem gene duplications, but assemblies can accurately report its position and predict its length (Fig. 6b). A tandem unit consisting of the pod size gene NTF6 (mitogen-activated protein kinase, brassinosteroid signaling and homeostasis and regulation of grain size and plant height) and the disease-resistance gene FBRL2 (negative transcriptional regulator of immune responsive genes, including PR1), had high copy number variants (Fig. 6c, left), which was unique in peanut and did not exist in rice, soybean and cotton genomes. In addition, higher expression levels of both NTF6 and FBRL2 were observed in accessions with larger pod sizes (Fig. 6c, middle), whereas lower expression levels of both were observed in roots after bacterial wilt infection (Fig. 6c, right), indicating strong consistency in the expression of these two genes. These results indicate that the pangenome provides a valuable resource for gene exploration and expansion associated with fruit size and disease resistance during peanut domestication.

Cytokinins play crucial roles in plant development by regulating cell division. The mechanisms of cytokinin metabolism and signal transduction are well understood40,41. Zeatin and isopentenyladenine-type are considered the predominant active forms of cytokinins42,43, and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) catalyzes the irreversible degradation of cytokinins44,45. In this study, we identified 117 SVs or indels associated with seed weight (P < 0.001), and one significant SV for seed weight was identified on chr. 3 by SV-GWAS (P = 1.84 × 10−4) (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 10). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block analyses revealed a block (chr. 3: 9.71–9.73 Mb) next to the significantly associated SV in NDH03G08990 (Fig. 7b). Gene annotation showed that NDH03G08990 (AhCKX6) encodes a CKX containing an FAD-binding domain and a CK-binding domain (Fig. 7c). This gene might be involved in regulating cell division, thereby affecting yield, as previously reported in wheat46 and chickpea47. Gene structure analysis revealed that AhCKX6 has two insertions (TTACAAATATTATTTATTACTGT and CAAATTTGTC) in the 3′-UTR of accessions with larger seeds (Fig. 7d). Genotype-based association analysis revealed that the 3′-UTR insertions were absent in all 61 wild species. By contrast, three-quarters of the landrace and improved varieties exhibited insertions in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 7e). Furthermore, association analysis revealed that these insertions were significantly correlated with seed length and 100-seed weight (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Table 11).

CKX evolution was traced back only to the first primitive land plant, Physcomitrium patens48. The ancestral CKX gene evolved in the kingdom Plantae along with the diversification into monocot and eudicot plant species >150 million years ago (Ma)49. Following a whole-genome duplication event approximately 58 Ma, CKX genes appeared in legumes. They then emerged in the Arachis genus around 2.2 Ma (ref. 37). A phylogenetic association study revealed that AhCKX genes exhibit a high degree of similarity to soybean CKX genes (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Table 12). The expression levels of AhCKX6 were observed to be higher in the roots, leaves and seeds of HapI compared with HapII (Fig. 7h). In addition, AhCKX6 expression levels were elevated in small-seed accessions relative to large-seed accessions at various stages of seed development (Fig. 7i). Conversely, large-seed accessions exhibited higher cytokinin content levels (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Table 13). In summary, the insertion in the 3′-UTR of the CKX6 gene results in reduced expression levels. This increase in cytokinin promotes early cell division, ultimately leading to the development of larger seeds (Fig. 7k).

Seed size is a critical agronomic trait that is closely associated with grain yield. Here, we identified 73 SVs associated with seed size (P < 0.001) and a gene (NDH08G29450) exhibiting an exon SV was found encode auxin response factor 2 (ARF2). This was the most significant SV associated with seed length in SV-GWAS (P = 3.63 × 10−6) (Fig. 8a, Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supplementary Table 14), which acts as a negative regulator of seed size and weight in Arabidopsis50. In the ZP06 variety, the AhARF2-2 gene contains a 275-bp deletion and a 7-bp insertion in the 12th exon, as well as premature stop codons in the 13th exon (HapII) (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 19), resulting in loss of the conserved Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid domain (AUX/IAA, PF02309) (Fig. 8c and Supplementary Fig. 20a). This loss is significantly correlated with variations in seed length and 100-seed weight (Fig. 8d and Supplementary Table 15). Molecular markers have been developed based on this SV to differentiate between the HapI and HapII haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 20b). The AhARF2-2 gene was highly expressed in the seed and its expression was substantially higher in HapII accessions than in HapI accessions (Fig. 8e). Furthermore, after exogenous application of 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at the seedling stage, HapI accessions showed a significant upregulated response compared with HapII accessions (Fig. 8f). Further analysis indicated that the mutation did not alter the subcellular localization of its corresponding protein (Supplementary Fig. 20c).

Col n = 22, HapI-3 n = 9, HapII-3 n = 19. q, Model of AhARF2-2 determining peanut seed size: AhIAA13 binds AhARF2-2 via the AUX/IAA domain. Auxin releases AhARF2-2, which recruits TPL to suppress AhGRF5. Data are given as mean ± s.e.m. n = 3 biologically independent samples (e, f, k and m). P values were calculated by two-tailed Student's t-test (d, e, f, k, m, n, o and p).

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays confirmed that the AhARF2 protein from HapI accessions can interact with AhIAA13 and inhibit AhTPL, whereas the protein from HapII accessions has lost this interaction capability (Fig. 8g–i). In peanut, transient overexpression of the AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII genes resulted in a significant decrease in AhGRF5 expression, with HapI causing more pronounced downregulation than HapII (Supplementary Fig. 21). These findings suggest that AhARF2-2 may negatively regulate AhGRF5 expression in peanuts. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and firefly luciferase (LUC) complementation assays demonstrated that both the HapI and HapII AhARF2-2 proteins can bind to the promoter of the growth-regulating factor 5 (AhGRF5) gene (Fig. 8j). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) analysis revealed that AhGRF5 exhibited the highest expression levels in seeds, with significantly higher expression in HapII accessions than in HapI accessions (Supplementary Fig. 22). Moreover, AhARF2-2 could inhibit AhGRF5 expression, with HapI exhibiting a stronger inhibitory effect than HapII (Fig. 8k). TOPLESS (TPL) acts as an inhibitory factor in multiple biological processes51. AhARF2 has the capability to recruit TPL, thereby further suppressing the expression of AhGRF5; thus, HapI exhibits stronger inhibitory capability than HapII (Supplementary Fig. 23). Results from transgenic Arabidopsis showed that the seed area and seed length of HapII lines were significantly larger than Hap I transgenic lines (Fig. 8l–p and Supplementary Fig. 24a–e). In summary, we propose that AhARF2-2 interacts with AhIAA13 via the C-terminal AUX/IAA domain. In the presence of auxin, AhARF2-2 is released and subsequently recruits TPL to suppress the expression of downstream AhGRF5. However, in large-seed accessions with SV deletion, AhARF2-2 is unable to interact with AhIAA13 and TPL, which leads to the reduction of the suppression of AhGRF5, thereby promoting seed expansion (Fig. 8q).

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), recognized as one of the most important oilseed and food legume crops, exhibits the unique characteristic of ripening its seeds underground. Throughout the processes of domestication and cultivation, there has been a progressive increase in the size and weight of peanut pods and seeds1,12,49. However, our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary factors influencing peanut pod size and weight remains limited. In this study, we developed comprehensive peanut pangenomes by integrating data from eight high-quality peanut genomes and 269 resequenced accessions. This resulted in an extensive resource of genomic variations that contribute to key agronomic traits in peanuts. The newly constructed pangenomes and identified variations enhance our understanding of the genetic basis underlying traits such as seed size and weight, and will facilitate advancements in crop science and peanut breeding, thereby potentially improving global food security.

Along with SNPs and epigenetic differences, SVs are newly emerging as important variation features contributing to the genetic and phenotypic diversity observed in and between species. Understanding the impact of SVs on plant phenotypic variation is crucial for breeders aiming to develop superior cultivars51. SV identification has long been challenging in terms of both a lack of accuracy and comprehensiveness when using short-read resequencing data. Nevertheless, the important role of SVs has been highlighted in recent crop studies51,52. Our analysis revealed that combining assembly-based and read-based methods using long-read sequencing data improves the identification of SVs in plant genomes, especially large SVs. Notably, a significant observation is that most insertion SVs are associated with LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons. We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs and 190 SVs associated with seed size or weight. Our study revealed that SVs could influence gene expression, functional dynamics and uneven domestication between the two subgenomes, ultimately affecting seed size and weight.

Throughout the extensive process of domestication and evolution, differential selection pressures have been exerted on subgenomes A and B, resulting in distinct functional specializations, similar to those observed in cotton (Gossypium spp.)53 and rapeseed (Brassica napus)54. During the transition from landraces to improved cultivars, chr. 3, 16 and 19 experienced intense artificial selection. The genes in the B subgenome were enriched in legume lectin domain and pathogenesis-related protein, such as a tandem unit of two peanut-specific genes associated with pod size and disease resistance separately (Fig. 6c). In crop breeding, enhancing both disease resistance and yield presents major challenges, with trade-offs between these traits being a common phenomenon in crop production55. Our research suggested that resistance was compromised as yields increased during peanut domestication. SV-GWAS identified two significant regions potentially related to seed size and weight. Subsequent experiments confirmed that SVs in these genes influenced seed size and weight. Notably, an SV in the 3′-UTR of the AhCKX6 gene on chr. 3 was associated with seed weight. Another significant candidate gene, AhARF2-2, encodes an auxin response factor and negatively regulates seed size. However, our research still has the limitation on the sample size of tetraploid wild peanuts in population selection, owing to the specificity of Arachis monticola acting as an intermediate between cultured and wild peanut.

In summary, we have developed an extensive dataset comprising high-quality reference genomes, pangenomes and significant genomic variations, such as SVs, elucidating the influence of SVs on critical traits, including seed size and weight in peanuts. This study furnishes a genetic resource for the identification of functional genes associated with yield and disease resistance, offering valuable tools for breeding and crop enhancement for peanut as well as other polyploid species.

All 269 analyzed accessions (two accessions, Tifrunner and Shitouqi, were previously published and others were newly sequenced) were collected from major peanut-growing regions, including India, the United States and China. These accessions, which are currently one of the most complete and representative collections worldwide, were used to analyze the major haplotype of the candidate gene related to the seed traits. Plant DNA was extracted using the Plant DNA Extraction Kit (catalogue number SM262; Seven). Peanut seedlings were grown in pots in a growth chamber set to 28 °C, with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod and ~60% relative humidity. Experiments were conducted when the seedlings reached the four-leaf stage. All Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and transgenic plants were from the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype background. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants were grown in pots in a growth chamber at 23 °C with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod and ~60% relative humidity.

In this study, previously collected WGS and phenotypic data from 269 peanut accessions with various seed sizes were reanalyzed using an updated high-quality reference genome NDH108. Raw sequencing data was preprocessed using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56. Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome (Near T2T genome: NDH108) using BWA (v.0.7.17)57. Moreover, for wild diploid accessions, homologous chromosomes of subgenomes were retained as the reference genomes (NDH108-A or NDH108-B subgenome). SNPs and indels were called using bcftools (v.1.10.2)58 (parameter: bcftools mpileup --min-ireads 1 -Ou -f $ref ${sample}.bam | bcftools call --ploidy 1 -mv -Oz). The SNPs and indels were then filtered using bcftools (parameter: bcftools filter -g3 -G10 -e ‘QUAL<30 || DP<5 || MQ<20'). Variants from all accessions were merged into one file using bcftools (parameter: merge -0). To conduct the analysis for both diploid and tetraploid peanut genomes, SNPs with the A or B subgenome were filtered with a minor allele frequency of >0.05 and a missing rate of <0.5 using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --max-missing 0.5 --maf 0.05), respectively. These SNPs and indels were annotated using SnpEff (v.5.1)60.

SNPs in variant call format (VCF) were converted to PHYLIP format using Vcf2phylip (v.2.8)61 for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic relationship was inferred using the neighbor-joining method with PHYLIP (v.3.697)62. PCA was performed using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63 (parameter: --pca). To estimate the genetic similarity in and among populations, we calculated genetic diversity (π or pi) in four population using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --window-pi 100000 --window-pi-step 20000), as well as the population fixation statistics FST using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --fst-window-size 100000 --fst-window-step 20000). LD pruning was performed using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63 (parameter: --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.2). Population structure was estimated using ADMIXTURE (v.1.3.0)64, which identified different numbers of clusters (K) according to cross-validation error. Considering both agronomic traits and genetic variability, we newly selected several representative accessions with smaller to larger pods for high-quality genome assembly. These include an accession of Ad (Arachis duranensis; Adu), two accessions of Am (Arachis monticola; Amon and H16-5) and three accessions of Ahy (Arachis hypogaea; mH8, NDH108 and ZP06).

Raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads with a mean quality score >7 were retained at the pre-processing step. De novo genome assembly was performed with ONT Ultra-long reads or PacBio HiFi reads using NextDenovo (v.2.4.0)38. To improve the accuracy of the assembly, the contigs were refined with Racon (v.1.3.1)65 using long reads and Nextpolish (v.1.3.1)66 using Illumina short reads with default parameters.

Quality controlling of Hi-C raw data was performed using HiC-Pro (v.2.8.1)39 as former research. First, low-quality sequences (quality scores <20), adapter sequences and sequences shorter than 30 bp were filtered out using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56, and the clean paired-end reads were then mapped to the draft assembled sequence using Bowtie 2 (v.2.3.2)67 (parameter: -end-to-end --very-sensitive -L 30) to get the unique mapped paired-end reads. Valid interaction paired reads were identified and retained by HiC-Pro from unique mapped paired-end reads for further analysis. Invalid read pairs, including dangling-end, self-cycle, re-ligation and dumped products were filtered by HiC-Pro. The scaffolds were further clustered, ordered and oriented scaffolds onto chromosomes by LACHESIS68 (parameters: CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES=100, CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY=2.5, CLUSTER NONINFORMATIVE RATIO=1.4, ORDER MIN N RES IN TRUNK=60, ORDER MIN N RES IN SHREDS=60).

Transpose elements (TEs) were annotated using EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 () pipeline (parameter: --sensitive 1 --anno 1), which incorporates several well-performed structure-based and homology-based programs, including LTRharvest (v.1.5.10)70 (in GenomeTools), LTR_FINDER (v.1.07)71, LTR_retriever (v.2.9.0)72, Generic Repeat Finder (v.1.0)73, TIR-learner (v.2.5)74, HelitronScanner (v.1.0)75, TEsorter (v.1.3.0)76, RepeatModeler (v.2.0.2)77 and RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78. The interspersed repeats and tandem repeats of genomes were annotated using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78 with a TE library generated from EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 and TRF (v.4.09)79.

Three independent approaches, ab initio prediction, homology search and reference guided transcriptome assembly, were used for gene prediction in a repeat-masked genome. In detail, GeMoMa (v.1.6.1)80 was used to align the homologous peptides from related species to the assembly and then obtain the gene structure information, which was homolog prediction. For transcript-based gene prediction, filtered RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome using STAR (v.2.7.3a)81. The transcripts were then assembled using Stringtie (v.1.3.5)82 d and ORFs were predicted using PASA (v.2.3.3)83. For the de novo prediction, RNA-seq reads were de novo assembled using Stringtie and analyzed with PASA to produce a training set. Augustus (v.3.3.1)84 with default parameters was then utilized for ab initio gene prediction with the training set. Finally, EVidenceModeler (v.1.1.1)85 was used to produce an integrated gene set from which genes with TE were removed using the TransposonPSI package (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net/)86 and the miscoded genes were further filtered. UTRs and alternative splicing regions were determined using PASA (v.2.3.3)83 based on RNA-seq assemblies.

Proteins of each accession were assessed using BUSCO (v.5.3.2)87 with database embryophyta_odb10 v2020-09-10. Domains of proteins were annotated using InterProScan (v.5.55-88.0)88. The Gene Ontology of proteins was predicted using PANNZER2 (v.15.12.2020)89. Enrichment analysis was preformed using ClusterProfiler (v.3.16.1)90.

The longest protein sequences of each gene were selected as representatives. Short proteins with <50 amino acids were ignored. The orthogroups (or gene families) were found using Orthofinder (v.2.5.4)91 with the parameter ‘-S blast'. For each accession, orthogroups with at least one member gene were defined as being present. The orthogroups PAVs matrix was used for downstream analysis. The power model92 was chosen to fit the new gene family count (n) and sample count (N) as reported previously. Every new gene family count was the median of values from 100 iterations of random sampling without replacement. The curve was fitted using the ‘nls' function in R v.4.0.2. Pseudo-R2 was computed using the R package aomisc v.0.648. The orthogroups in all (eight of eight) accessions were considered as core families. Orthogroups present in more than 90% of samples but not all (seven of eight) accessions were considered as soft-core families, the same threshold used for ‘soft-core' in previous studies18,93. Orthogroups present in between two and six of eight accessions were considered as distributed families. The orthogroups present in only one (of eight) accession were considered as private families. Single-copy gene orthogroups with fewer than one member per accession were aligned in parallel using ParaAT (v.2.0)94. The gene pairs were aligned using MUSCLE (v.5.1)95 and nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates were calculated using KaKs_Calculator (v.3.0)96 with the model averaging method97.

Synteny and collinearity analyses were performed at both the genome and gene levels. We used D-Geneies (v.1.4)98 with whole genomes' alignment from Minimap2 (v.2.22)99 and MCscan (in JCVI) v.1.2.7 (ref. 100) with the CDS of longest protein sequences of each gene alignment from Last (v.1418)101.

SVs of each accession were called using assembly-based and read-based SV detection methods, generating three graph-based pangenome sets. (1) Assembly-based SVs, graph pangenome construction from variants (SVAss): SVs of each accession were detected with assembly-based methods Svim-asm (v.1.0.2)102 (parameter: haploid) and CuteSV (v.1.0.13)103 (parameter: -s 1 --genotype --report_readid -p -1 -mi 500 -md 500 –max_cluster_bias_INS 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.9 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.5). Insertions (INS) and deletions (DEL) from the intersection of two tools were compared and selected using Truvari (v.3.4.0)104 (parameter: bench). Duplications (DUP), inversions (INV) and breakends (BND) were selected from the results of CuteSV (v.1.0.13)103. SVs with supporting sequence names (RNAMES in the INFO column) from the same chromosomes or unplaced contigs were retained. Moreover, for two wild diploid accessions (Adu and K30076), the SVs from homologous chromosomes (Adu, A subgenome; K30076, B subgenome) or unplaced contigs were retained. The nonredundant SVs set was merged using SURVIVOR (v.1.0.7)105 (parameter: merge 1000 1 1 -1 -1 50). We constructed graph-based pangenome from variants and reference sequences using vg v.1.53.0. (2) Assembly-based SVs and small variants, graph pangenome construction from assemblies (FASTA) (Minigraph-Cactus): base-level pangenome graphs were constructed of each chromosome using Minigraph-Cactus (v.2.7)106. The DNA sequences (nodes) in the sequence graph (GFA) of each chromosome were renamed (chromosome prefixes + raw node identification) and merged into a graph of all chromosomes. (3) Assembly-based + read-based SVs, graph pangenome construction from variants (SV Assembly and Read): we added a read-based SV detection method to avoid heterozygous and unassembled-region SVs omitted in the single haplotype of genome assembly. SVs of each accession were detected using the read-based method CuteSV (v.2.0.3)103 from ONT reads and PacBio HiFi reads (parameter: --max_cluster_bias_INS 100 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.3 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 100 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.3 (ONT); --max_cluster_bias_INS 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.9 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.5 (PacBio HiFi)). The SVs with the ‘PRECISE' and ‘PASS' tags were filtered. Next, these SVs were divided into two subsets according to the regions of assembly alignment: SVs in assembly-covered regions and SVs in assembly-uncovered regions. For subset 1, heterozygous insertions and deletions were compared and merged with assembly-based SVs using Truvari (v.3.4.0)104 (parameter: bench). For subset 2, insertions and deletions were added with assembly-based SVs. The final SVs dataset included both assembly-based SVs and read-based SVs. We constructed graph-based pangenome from variants and reference sequences using vg (v.1.53.0)107.

SVs were annotated with gene regions (gene, exon, CDS and gene upstream and downstream 3,000 bp) and repeat regions (TE, low complexity and simple repeat) using Vcfanno (v.0.3.3)108. The alternative allele sequences of insertions were extracted and annotated for repeats using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78 with a TE library generated from EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 and TRF (v.4.09)79.

Five tissues (flower, fruit, stem, leaf and root) of accessions Adu, Amon, H16-5, mH8, NDH108 and ZP06 were selected for RNA-seq experiments. The raw paired-end reads were filtered and trimmed using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56. The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome (NDH108) using HISAT2 (v.2.1.0)109 (parameter: --dta) and sorted using Samtools (v.1.10)110. The coverage of each transcript of genes was calculated using Bedtools (v.2.29.2)111 (parameter: genomecov -bga -split -ibam). The expression of each transcript of genes and each gene was calculated using Stringtie (v.1.3.5)82. The FPKM was used to estimate the gene expressions.

We used three metrics to identify selective region of domestication sweeps, including genetic diversity ratio, FST and XP-CLR112. We compared the genetic diversity ratio (πAA/πAABBw, πBB/πAABBw, πAABBw/πAABBc) in four groups in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --window-pi 100000 --window-pi-step 20000). Windows with the top 5% of values were identified as candidate domestication-sweep regions. To identify additional domestication effects, we calculated the population fixation statistics (FST) in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --fst-window-size 100000 --fst-window-step 20000). Windows with the top 5% FST value were regarded as highly differentiated regions. We also calculated XP-CLR112 to scan for domestication-sweep regions in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb and identified windows with the top 5% XP-CLR values (parameter: --ld 0.95 --size 100000 --step 20000). Windows filtered with at least two metrics were considered as domestication-sweep regions.

NDH108 was cultivated using the hydroponic method (14 h light and 10 h dark photoperiod). When peanut roots reached 5–6 cm, seedlings were inoculated with Ralstonia solanacearum (strain number 180731-1) provided by the Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. We performed RNA-seq of roots in NDH108 with bacterial wilt infection, at three time points (0, 12 and 24 h) of three independent experiments in replicates. The analysis process of raw reads was the same as described in the section ‘Gene expression analysis'.

For genotyping of resequencing accessions, we used an ensemble genotyper EVG (v.1.2.0)113 combining GraphTyper2 (v.2.7.7)114, GraphAligner (v.1.0.13)115, vg (v.1.53.0)107 and Pangenie (v.3.0.1)116 with the graph pangenome constructed from both genome assemblies and long reads to genotype variations of SVs and indels (≥10 bp) from short-read sequencing data in tetraploid accessions. For SV-GWAS, two phenotypes (seed weight and seed length) were surveyed and the insertions and deletions from the graph pangenome were selected. Genotype files were prepared using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63. GWAS was performed using EMMAX (v.beta-07Mar2010)117.

Plots were generated using R (v.4.0.2) with the R packages ggplot2 (v.3.3.6), ggmap (v.4.0.0) (Plotting spatial data), GOplot (v.1.0.2), ggbreak (v.0.1.1) (axis breaks plots), gghalves (v.0.1.4) (half plots), qqman (v.0.1.8) (GWAS Manhattan plots), ggpubr (v.0.4.0) (significant level in box plots) Pheatmap (v.1.0.12) (heatmap; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap), iTOL (v.6.6)118 (phylogenetic tree), Bandage (v.0.8.1)119 (graph pangenome visualization) and Rcirco (v.1.2.2)120 (genomic circos plots). Plots of the genome browser including tracks of gene annotations, repeat annotations, SVs and alignments were generated using Samplot (v.1.3.0)121, JBrowse2 (v.2.3.2)122 and IGV (v.2.5.3)123. The LD heatmap was generated using LDBlockShow (v.1.40)124.

The amino acid sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 5.2 (ref. 125) (maximum-likelihood method), FastTree (v.2.1.11)126 (approximately maximum-likelihood method) and modified by iTOL (v.6.6)118. The multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (v.5.1)95. The protein structure was predicted using AlphaFold (v.2.3)127 and displayed using PyMol (v.2.3.4) (http://www.pymol.org).

The CDSs of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII (NDH08G29450) were cloned into a pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector using the Hieff Clone Universal One Step Cloning Kit (catalogue number 10911ES20, Yeasen). The recombinant plasmids pCAMBIA1300-HapI/HapII-GFP (35S:HapI/HapII-GFP), marker vector and empty control vector were then transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (AC1001, WEIDI). Agrobacterium mediated transient expression assays in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and peanut according to our previous work11. Fluorescence images of transiently infected tobacco leaf subepidermal cells were captured utilizing laser scanning confocal microscopy (catalogue number LSM710, Carl Zeiss).

Two-week-old seedlings (mH8 and ZP06), cultivated on plates, were subjected to treatment through spraying with 1 μM NAA. Samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h following the treatment with NAA. Total RNA was extracted using FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (catalogue number RC411, Vazyme) and TransScript One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit (catalogue number AT311-02, TransGen Biotech). Gene expression levels were assayed using the PerfectStart Green qPCR SuperMix Kit (catalogue number AQ601, TransGen Biotech) in conjunction with the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR system. The 2−∆∆CT method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each gene128. Ahactin7 (XM_025826875) and Atactin2 (U37281.2) were used as the internal control genes. Primers were designed using Primer 3 (v.4.1.0)129. Cytokinin measurements were performed by Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd, utilizing seeds from the Amon and ZP06 varieties, approximately 15 days following the peg's penetration into the soil.

The AhGRF5 (Arahy.V829EQ) promoter was integrated into the pAbAi vector. The recombinant plasmid pAbAi-AhGRF5 was digested with the restriction enzyme BstBI (catalogue number R0519V, New England Biolabs) and transferred into the Y1H yeast strain and tested on SD/-Ura medium (catalogue number PM2271, Coolaber) with different concentrations of aureobasidin A. The CDS of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into the pGADT7 and transferred into the Y1H yeast strain, containing pAbAi–AhGRF5 plasmid, tested on SD/-Leu medium (catalogue number PM2201, Coolaber) with 200 ng ml−1 of aureobasidin A.

The CDSs of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into the N-terminal half of yellow fluorescent protein (nYFP). The CDSs of AhIAA13 and AhTPL were cloned into the C-terminal half of YFP (cYFP) to generate HapI-nYFP, AhIAA13-cYFP, HapII-nYFP and AhTPL-cYFP vectors. The appropriate pairs of constructs (AhTPL-cYFP and HapI-nYFP; AhTPL-cYFP and HapII-nYFP; AhIAA13-cYFP and HapI-nYFP; AhIAA13-cYFP and HapII-nYFP) were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves via Agrobacterium-mediated transient infiltration and detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (catalogue number LSM710, Carl Zeiss).

AhIAA13 (Arahy. MDB4JZ) and AhTPL (Arahy.UFRA39) CDSs were cloned into pGBKT7 vector (bait vector). These recombinant vectors were transformed into the Y2H yeast strain. The bait vectors pGBKT7-53 (BD-T7-53) and pGBKT7-Lam (BD-T7-Lam), serving as positive and negative controls respectively, were cotransformed with the prey vector pGADT7-T. Yeast cells and control cells, carrying recombinant plasmids, were grown on deficient medium: lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD/-Trp/-Leu; catalogue number PM2221, Coolaber) and leucine, tryptophan histidine and adenine (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade; catalogue number PM2221, Coolaber), respectively.

The CDSs of AhTPL, AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector to construct the pCAMBIA1300-TPL-GFP (35S:TPL), 35S:HapI and 35S:HapII as effector plasmids. The AhGRF5 promoter (850 bp) was inserted into pGreenII 0800-LUC to construct the GRF5pro:LUC reporter plasmid. These vectors were individually transformed into GV3101 (harboring the pSoup plasmid). The pairs of constructs (35S:GFP and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapI and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapII and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapI, 35S:TPL and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapII, 35S:TPL and GRF5pro:LUC) were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves using the method reported previously130. LUC activity was detected using a low-light cooled CCD imaging apparatus (Tanon 5200). LUC or Renilla luciferase was assayed using the Double-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (catalogue number FR201, TransGen Biotech) with dual LUC assay reagents (Promega). Primers used for the LUC assay are listed in Supplementary Table 16.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 containing the recombinant vectors 35S:HapI-GFP or 35S:HapII-GFP was used to transform Arabidopsis (Col-0) using the floral dipping method131 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were selected on MS medium supplemented with 30 mg l−1 hygromycin and their identity was confirmed through PCR. Subsequently, the T3 generation of transgenic plants was utilized for phenotypic analysis of the candidate gene. Seed sizes were photographed with an anatomical microscope and were tested using the Ween SC-G automated test analysis system (WSeen). Primers used for gene cloning are listed in Supplementary Table 16.

The statistical analyses were mostly performed in R (v.4.0.2). For biochemical and molecular biology analysis, at least three individuals were mixed in each sample with three biological replicates. Standard deviations and P values were calculated using two-tailed Student's t-test and analysis of variance.

Metrics details

Achieving global biodiversity goals requires assessing, attributing and reversing the ongoing, unprecedented biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems, and relies on adequate data to inform policy and action. Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has become established as a novel and powerful approach to assess the state and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and although increasingly implemented by stakeholders its potential is not yet fully tapped. In this Perspective, we review the current state of aquatic eDNA research, focusing in particular on the policy relevance of eDNA and its utility in contributing towards the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We summarize key technological developments in eDNA science to measure organismal diversity, its potential for spatial and temporal upscaling to become a key reference for local to global biodiversity action, and the next steps needed to effectively implement eDNA for decision-making and reaching biodiversity targets. Using eDNA to support biodiversity assessment will particularly benefit the understanding of understudied ecosystems and allow the direct calculation of ecological indices and implementation of FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and inclusive data curation. Important next steps for eDNA require proper method standardization and commonly agreed quality standards, populating reference databases, and overcoming methodological constraints in retrofitting novel eDNA-based approaches to existing biodiversity monitoring approaches.

Aquatic biodiversity is declining from local to global scales, yet in most regions, no or only minimal data on state and change of biodiversity are available.

Representative, scalable and replicable monitoring of aquatic biodiversity is needed to achieve the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a key technology to achieve a global measurement network of state and trends in biodiversity, and many of its technical aspects are ready to be implemented.

eDNA analysis allows whole-community assessments, broad taxonomic coverage, high spatiotemporal resolution and calculation of environmental indices.

Particularly for undersampled regions, large rivers, lakes and marine systems, eDNA metabarcoding might be an effective technology to rapidly gain biodiversity data.

To make eDNA-based monitoring policy frameworks successful and trusted, inclusive development and uptake of international method standards are needed.

The unprecedented decline of global biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems1,2,3, including the loss of functional and genetic diversity, is exceeding the planetary boundary of biosphere integrity4 and threatening many ecosystem functions and services. Consequently, biodiversity loss has been identified as an urgent global challenge5, and increasing political consensus exists that rapid measures to halt and reverse biodiversity loss are needed. The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), adopted by the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022 (ref. 6), sets out four overarching goals for 2050: (1) halt human-induced species extinction, (2) achieve sustainable use of biodiversity, (3) implement equitable sharing of benefits from biodiversity and (4) mobilize resources to close the biodiversity finance gap. The GBF also contains 23 targets to be reached by 2030, including conserving at least 30% of the world's land and sea areas, restoring degraded ecosystems, reducing pollution, ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity and performing adequate monitoring of biodiversity globally6,7.

Freshwater and coastal marine systems are among the most affected by global change8, and the main drivers of biodiversity decline in these ecosystems are well known9: habitat modification, pollution, invasive alien species, direct exploitation and climate change. Attributing the effects of these large-scale drivers to localized spatial and temporal scales is challenging, primarily because of the transport and mixing of water in aquatic systems. For example, diffuse and point-source inputs of chemicals in rivers have cumulative effects on aquatic biodiversity at a downstream catchment scale10. Furthermore, aquatic ecosystems cross countries, continents and are — via oceans and through the global water cycle — far more continuously integrated than terrestrial systems11. Consequently, effects of anthropogenic pressures have the potential to spread over large spatial extents and across political jurisdictions.

To implement actions that successfully address aquatic biodiversity loss, adequate assessments are necessary7,12 and require monitoring of all aquatic biodiversity — including groundwater, surface water and marine systems. Such monitoring must be broadly applicable, comparable and scalable, and must be implementable for countries worldwide that have different baseline information on species diversity and abundance to effectively inform policymaking.

Environmental DNA (eDNA)13 analysis is a key advance in biodiversity monitoring14 that will help to achieve the GBF targets. eDNA is directly extracted from an environmental sample15, such as water, soil or air (in contrast to DNA directly isolated from specimens) and analysed. Environmental samples might contain the DNA of all organisms present (including microorganisms, meiofauna and macrofauna), and include both intra- and extracellular DNA. eDNA in aquatic systems can also provide information on the diversity of organisms in adjacent terrestrial systems whose DNA is washed into the water bodies16,17. Environmental samples might also contain RNA (eRNA)18,19, which is more difficult to handle, but can reflect more recent and metabolically active community signals than eDNA20,21.

As eDNA can be sampled and analysed across all aquatic ecosystems to detect organisms in a universal manner, it can be applied to meet multiple GBF targets (Fig. 1). Methods based on eDNA are already established and being implemented for the early detection and mitigation of invasive alien species22,23 (GBF target 6: reduce the introduction of invasive alien species by 50%) and the evaluation of the state of ecosystems under multiple stressors and in pre- and post-restoration states24,25 (target 2: restore 30% of all degraded ecosystems). Collecting eDNA samples is becoming increasingly fast and cost-efficient26, rendering this approach highly scalable across space and time. The simplicity of gathering water samples also grants eDNA analysis a high potential for automatization27,28 and for its inclusion in citizen science projects29,30,31. Methods based on eDNA could, therefore, be implemented across the world, even in regions for which we currently lack adequate biodiversity data.

a, The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) identified 23 action-oriented global targets to be reached by 2030 (ref. 6). Many of these targets require information on the state, change and trends of biodiversity for scientific, political and economic decision-making. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide information on biological diversity offers a potentially universal approach that can support GBF targets by providing baseline data and action–response information to guide decision-making. Establishing, tracking and assessing biodiversity hotspots, biodiversity trends and change is particularly important. b, Multiple targets can be directly assessed using existing eDNA technologies, which are sufficiently developed for implementation but not yet routinely used in most countries.

In this Perspective, we examine the current state of aquatic eDNA research, with a particular focus on the policy relevance of eDNA and its utility in contributing towards GBF targets (Fig. 1). We focus on eDNA only (not eRNA) because of its higher readiness level for biodiversity monitoring. First, we explain the technical aspects of eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring required for assessing baseline states and action–response effects. Second, we assess the use of eDNA at the level of communities and ecosystems, targeted species, and its ability to attribute environmental change to underlying drivers. Finally, we outline necessary steps, including standardization, data curation and data deposition, to make eDNA analysis globally accessible.

DNA is universal across all species, and traces of DNA are left in the environment by all organisms, for example, by shedding skin cells. Extraction of this DNA from an environmental sample, in theory, enables the detection of any organism, either by targeted screening for single species or assessment of whole communities13,32 (Fig. 2). In both cases15, the first step is sampling water in the focal environment and extracting the DNA present in these samples. For species-specific assays, a portion of DNA is amplified using primers specific to this taxon33,34 and the number of copies present in the original sample is evaluated using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)35 approach, such as real-time qPCR or digital PCR. When assessing whole communities via metabarcoding14, a barcode gene region is amplified using primers with a broader taxonomic scope. The amplified DNA is sequenced via high-throughput sequencing technologies36, which yield millions to billions of sequences (termed ‘reads'). These sequences are then bioinformatically processed and clustered into meaningful units (either as operational taxonomic units or as  amplicon sequence variants) and compared with reference sequences in databases to assign them to specific organisms. These two approaches are well established and are currently the most used methods applied to eDNA samples32,37. New approaches are being developed to investigate the functional or genetic diversity of a group of organisms38, to investigate trophic relationships39 or to obtain information on the whole genome of the organisms present in the samples40,41, but are not yet sufficiently developed for widespread biodiversity monitoring. Generally, sampling of eDNA is applicable to systems with minimal prior information and can also be integrated with data from other monitoring techniques such as remote sensing, camera or audio recordings17,42.

a, Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) is sampled from marine, freshwater and groundwater ecosystems, enabling spatial (for example, catchment wide) and temporal (for example, across seasons) integration. The basic principle of aquatic eDNA analysis include sampling and capturing the DNA (usually via filtration) followed by DNA extraction, amplification (either of single species or through metabarcoding), sequencing and taxonomic assignment by comparison to DNA reference databases. b, Environmental DNA collected in river networks enables gathering information on biodiversity from a wider spatial extent by integrating hydrological first principles and estimated production and decay of DNA. Collection of samples can be enhanced via automated methods (such as autonomous samplers) or via citizen science approaches, which enables accumulation of data at high spatiotemporal resolution.

Following pioneering work in the 1980s and 1990s to isolate microbial communities from environmental samples43,44 and the development of DNA barcoding technology for species identification45, the combination of these technologies in the late 2000s46 led to eDNA becoming established as a research field in its own right13. Uptake of eDNA-based approaches has since vastly expanded in the field of biodiversity research owing to their non-invasiveness and increased efficiency for detecting species in a range of habitats at decreasing costs47. Technological advancements36,48 have enabled progression from detecting single species — initially focused on protected or invasive alien taxa46,49 — to comprehensive biodiversity assessments of many taxa with a metabarcoding approach. Consequently, the past 15 years have seen substantial growth in the number of datasets produced using this approach (Fig. 3), alongside the development of guidelines, large-scale projects and end-user applications15,29,37,47,50,51,52,53,54.

a, A schematic chronological timeline of important steps in the development of the concept of environmental DNA (eDNA) (yellow dots), progress of molecular techniques (red dots) and use of eDNA (blue dots). b, Temporal trends in aquatic data volume over time as the number of datasets published in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive on 20 September 2024. Here, a dataset is defined as a data package with a specific run number. Metadata on these datasets were retrieved using Entrez Programming Utilities and parsed using a list of keywords to include only eDNA and eRNA datasets from aquatic environments. HTS, high-throughput sequencing.

The uptake of eDNA research has been particularly prevalent in aquatic ecosystems, including rivers, lakes and marine water bodies, because of the ease of sample collection. Gaps in biodiversity knowledge are often larger for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, necessitating the implementation of novel approaches tailored to aquatic ecosystems. Current eDNA research in aquatic environments has mostly focused on freshwater ecosystems (65% of studies compared with 25% on marine ecosystems and 10% on other/multiple systems) and more than half of the studies have focused on fish (52%)51 — probably due to their high commercial and recreational values. Additionally, fish tend to shed greater amounts of DNA than species with sclerotized exoskeletons (such as crayfish) and are easier to detect owing to their high biomass and mobility55.

The primary strength of using eDNA analysis for assessing biodiversity is the ability to infer species' presence without direct collection or observation13, and that the same approach can be applied across the whole tree of life. The minimally invasive sampling involved is desirable from ethical, work-safety and systems perspectives, as massive upscaling can be achieved without unwanted side effects. However, indirect inference — detecting DNA and not the organisms themselves — is sometimes also seen as the greatest weakness of eDNA analysis. This approach limits inference and information on population structure (abundance or life stages) and requires cautious interpretation of the signal as positive detections might be linked to transport of DNA56, sequencing errors57 or database classification errors58. Therefore, eDNA workflows require rigorous methods and best practices at each stage to minimize the risk of false positives59.

Successfully meeting the GBF targets requires the acquisition of three types of data (Fig. 1). First, biodiversity must be mapped across all scales and systems to identify priority areas for conservation and restoration (‘map biodiversity'; for example, GBF targets 3, 6 and 14). Second, the spatial movements and temporal changes in abundance of species of interest (such as pathogens, invasive alien or endangered species) must be tracked (‘track species'; for example, GBF targets 4 or 6). Finally, the responses of ecosystems to anthropogenic changes must be monitored and understood, including identifying pollution levels that do not harm biodiversity (as mentioned in GBF target 7) or tracking recovery success when restoring degraded ecosystems (see the ‘Understand and attribute drivers of biodiversity change' section). The analysis of eDNA is a powerful approach to address all these aspects and to provide common information needed for implementing efficient regulation. In this section, the potential use of eDNA-based approaches for these three objectives is explored and examples of their usefulness for GBF targets presented.

Effective ecosystem assessment for policymaking, such as monitoring systems under pressure or identifying biodiversity hotspots, hinges upon efficient characterization of biodiversity, including adequate baseline data and mapping biodiversity trends over space and time60. Traditional sampling approaches such as gillnet fishing or trawling are still widely used, but are not sufficient to reach the ambitious targets of GBF and other regional initiatives (such as the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive) because they are too labour intensive, destructive and costly to scale up or implement — particularly in undersampled regions, such as tropical streams, open ocean or groundwater systems. By contrast, eDNA analysis allows greater spatial resolution and increased temporal and taxonomical scales compared with traditional approaches, and eDNA sampling is increasingly adopted by public agencies as part of their routine biomonitoring programmes61,62,63. eDNA-based approaches effectively complement traditional aquatic biodiversity monitoring as they overcome the challenges of morphology-based classification (such as juvenile life stages or cryptic species64) and enable access to undersampled and less-accessible systems such as groundwater ecosystems65 or oceanic trenches66.

Technological advances are currently driving this transition. The ever-increasing pace of technological developments in eDNA science has inevitably reduced the cost of processing water samples67, enabling the collection of samples at high spatial and temporal resolution68,69. Although sample collection and eDNA capture can still be labour intensive, collecting water samples is becoming considerably faster owing to the development of autonomous robotic and passive samplers. Existing autonomous samplers70,71,72,73 are capable of multisample capture and preservation. When coupled with a microfluidic block, they can even collect, filter, extract and perform multiple targeted qPCR assays of eDNA samples in situ74,75. These automated samplers are highly attractive for early detection of invasive alien species (addressing GBF target 6; see the ‘Tracking endangered, harmful or invasive alien species' section), and can be operated for months at a time without intervention76; however, further technological improvements are possible and the cost of fully automated samplers is currently prohibitive for some applications. Low-cost and less technologically advanced alternative samplers are based on passive capture of eDNA on substrates, such as non-charged cellulose ester or even medical gauze secured in three-dimensional hollow printed housing77,78. Traditionally, monitoring biodiversity was often restricted to specialists, whereas these simple eDNA capture methods have the potential to include citizen scientists in eDNA-based biodiversity assessment29,30,31, contributing to increased participation and improving integration of biodiversity into decision-making at every level (GBF targets 22 and 14, respectively).

Owing to transportation and mixing processes in water bodies, aquatic eDNA samples taken at a specific location reflect both the local community and organisms living in the surrounding environment. This feature can be leveraged to understand the spatial structure of biodiversity underpinning the observed data. In rivers, for example, depending on the discharge and other abiotic factors, eDNA can travel downstream from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres56,79,80, acting as a ‘conveyor belt of biodiversity information'16. Thus, eDNA-based biodiversity measures not only correlate to upstream-averaged measures of land use and habitat types17,81,82,83, but also provide space-filling projections of biodiversity by integrating signals from discrete sampling points into a continuous representation along a watercourse (Fig. 2). Similarly, in marine systems, eDNA is transported by currents and shaped by the stratification of the water column84,85. Coupling stream86,87 and marine88,89 eDNA data with hydrodynamic models is therefore essential to unravel and understand the spatial distribution of biodiversity. Specific models90,91 enable spatial projection of pointwise eDNA samples beyond their collection point into space-filling taxon richness maps at high spatial resolution92. As such, they provide spatially integrated information on biodiversity.

The assessment of overall biodiversity is particularly relevant for GBF targets that focus on area-based or area-projected measures, such as target 1 (‘plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss'), target 3 (‘conserve 30% of land, water and seas') or target 14 (‘integrate biodiversity into decision-making'). These targets are most effectively reached when overall biodiversity assessments of ponds, streams, groundwater and marine systems are comparable, implementable and accessible from local to global scales.

Tracking or detecting species of particular interest or concern is often a key piece of information needed for policymaking and communication. In this context, eDNA analysis is a valuable tool for the detection and monitoring of individual species. Indeed, the first applications of eDNA were for the detection of either rare and endangered49 or invasive alien species46,93. The detection and monitoring of individual species of interest is directly associated with several GBF targets, including target 4 (‘halting extinction of [individual] endangered species') and target 6 (‘reducing the introduction of invasive alien species'). Two examples of integrating eDNA information on targeted species into policy are the tracking of the endangered great crested newt in the UK using eDNA94 and the almost globally implemented eDNA (and eRNA) tracking of pathogens (in particular SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples95. In both cases, real-time implementation and analysis of eDNA samples enables rapid dissemination to inform policy. eDNA-based methods are now implemented in many countries for routine monitoring of harmful algal blooms96,97, invasive alien species, such as the quagga mussel98 and European green crab99, and of endangered species such as the above-mentioned great crested newt94 or the harbour porpoise49.

Importantly, however, an eDNA signal does not automatically indicate an organism's immediate temporal or spatial occurrence. The signal can be transported in space (for example, by water current or in the faeces of predators), reflect past occurrences (ancient DNA), be a transient signal of an organism passing by, or even enter the water via wastewater or terrestrial run-off16,100,101,102. An eDNA signal therefore contains different information compared with the direct observation of an organism, including potential false positives103,104, and thus requires different interpretation. For example, detection of an alien species using eDNA analysis in a location where it has not previously been observed should not trigger a policy response for removal, but rather incentivize the deployment of other methods to confirm the species' presence. Similarly, eDNA-based techniques do not allow the collection of population demographics, such as age and size distribution or sex ratio, which can be required for endangered or invasive alien species monitoring105. Some of these limitations can be overcome by sampling eRNA rather than eDNA, as eRNA represents genes expressed in the sampled environment and degrades faster than eDNA20. As eRNA provides a more contemporary signal than eDNA, its analysis can potentially distinguish between live and dead material to reduce the number of false positives18,21 or, in specific cases, even differentiate life stages (for example, in amphibians). However, eRNA analysis is still under evaluation and, with a few exceptions19, is not yet ready for use in monitoring contexts to inform policymakers.

Approaches based on eDNA are potentially relevant for GBF target 4, which specifically links the halt of species extinctions to the prevention of genetic diversity loss. Addressing this target currently relies on indirect measures of genetic diversity based on abundance data for many species and subsequent estimation of effective population size. Determining abundance estimates from eDNA is challenging, but at least possible in some circumstances. Both targeted106,107 and metabarcoding108 approaches have demonstrated correlation between copy number and/or read counts from eDNA and biomass or abundance, indicating that the method is at least semi-quantitative. However, this approach is strongly debated owing to the high potential for bias throughout eDNA workflows, which can create noise and error in the signal109,110,111,112,113. Possible solutions include adding internal standards of a known amount of synthetic DNA (so-called DNA spike-in) to compare read counts within species and across sites.

In addition to indirect measures of genetic diversity based on abundance, eDNA analysis could enable direct measurement of intraspecific genetic diversity, even in hard-to-sample environments and for rare and elusive species. This approach is still in development and is not yet ready for direct implementation; however, it has shown promising results in particular cases. So far, investigations have focused on the detection of haplotypes in short sections of mitochondrial (mt)DNA used for metabarcoding, and demonstrated that eDNA captures the genetic diversity of sampled populations38,114,115,116,117. Such approaches can differentiate populations and identify regions with unique genetic variation based on the mtDNA marker genes118. However, these short mtDNA fragments generally have low power to resolve finer genetic structures within or between populations. Targeting longer fragments and nuclear DNA provides increased resolution but presents additional challenges related to the shorter persistence of longer DNA fragments in the environment, and that eDNA represents a mixture of DNA from different individuals. Current methods do not allow assigning genotypes to individuals, which restricts most genetic approaches to population-level estimates119. Likelihood-based DNA mixture models could be applied to address the problem of redundancy (multiple individuals sharing the same allele) as long as a relatively large panel of multi-allelic markers is available120. Technical challenges notwithstanding, microsatellite allele frequencies of round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) or an Arctic diatom (Thalassiosira hyalina) estimated from aquatic eDNA have been shown to closely resemble allele frequencies from genotyped tissues120,121.

A considerable challenge for estimating genetic diversity from eDNA data is the detection of errors generated during the amplification and sequencing steps. For species detection, many bioinformatic procedures remove genetic variability during regular data cleansing and cluster sequences at the species level. For population genetic-level analysis, keeping exact sequence variants while removing erroneous sequences is the primary goal and can be more challenging119. Resolving this challenge requires combined improvements in sequencing technologies and the computational steps to identify and remove errors.

For policymaking and management, attribution of biodiversity change is key: only when drivers of change (both positive and negative) are linked to their biodiversity effects can effective policy and management be achieved. Traditionally, attributing drivers to aquatic biodiversity change has relied on monitoring and morphological identification of a relatively small number of species (such as macroinvertebrates, benthic macrofauna, fish and diatoms) that are biological indicators of environmental pressures such as nutrient pollution122. However, these methods are often unsuitable for monitoring emerging drivers, such as pollution by nanoparticles or microplastics, and hinge on the (often incorrect) assumption that a few indicator groups represent overall ecosystem responses. eDNA-based methods have already led to marked improvements in our ability to document biodiversity123 and identify pollutant thresholds124 by integrating data from diverse taxonomic groups with only one sample. This approach, in comparison with traditional methods, will provide a more comprehensive — and at least more diversified — response of aquatic communities to anthropogenic changes, individually and in combination24,25,125.

Current monitoring, whether with traditional or molecular tools, often focuses on the structure of communities (their richness and composition) rather than their functional properties123. However, the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services cannot be fully understood from estimates of taxonomic diversity alone. To characterize ecosystem health in its entirety, structural and functional biodiversity must be measured as these parameters can respond differently to different stressors. This type of monitoring requires a shift from focusing on which species provides the function to understanding how the functional properties of the whole community respond to pressures123,126. For example, co-occurrence data generated from eDNA metabarcoding across the tree of life allow reconstructing multitrophic ecological networks, from which functional properties such as connectance and nestedness can be estimated127. Other emerging approaches for addressing ecosystem changes are based on the analysis of expressed genes via eRNA. The strength of these eRNA methods lies in monitoring the physiological state of populations or communities by detecting changes in the activity of single or multiple genes18. Shotgun sequencing of total RNA from environmental samples (metatranscriptomics) allows the identification of genes that are actively and collectively expressed under different conditions128. Changes in freshwater biofilm microbial community-level expression in response to pollutants have been demonstrated, even when changes in community composition were not detected129. Additionally, experiments have revealed changes in community-wide gene expression of aquatic organisms under heat stress through sampling experimental tank water, demonstrating that metatranscriptomics of extra-organismal eRNA can reveal gene expression response to environmental change130. These emerging measures of ecological condition, especially when using eRNA, are promising but not yet ready for widespread use for practitioners and to inform decision-making.

Advances in artificial intelligence and modelling are enabling new approaches for attributing biodiversity change to environmental and/or anthropogenic drivers. For example, eDNA coupled with machine-learning models is used to infer the ecological status of aquatic systems131,132, and allows inclusion of a broader set of indicator taxa. Microorganisms, for example, differ considerably in their metabolism and sensitivity to different pollutant sources133, but have been largely ignored in biomonitoring because they are difficult to culture and identify, and because knowledge of their ecological function is unavailable134,135. Validated approaches based on profiling communities using amplicon sequence variants and/or operational taxonomic units detect changes in the structure of communities of bacteria133,136, freshwater invertebrates25,137 and diatoms138 against well-understood disturbance gradients, and have demonstrated strong improvements in the accuracy of ecological quality assessment139,140. Supervised machine learning combined with metabarcoding will complement and expand current morphology-based methods to produce the same ecological quality assessments at increased speed and cost efficiency, and without necessarily depending on taxonomic assignment using barcode reference databases135 (Fig. 4). The ability of supervised machine learning to outperform traditional indicator value approaches, using training datasets with reference disturbance levels to estimate biotic indices, has been demonstrated131,132,140,141,142,143.

The principle of the machine-learning approach is to link genomic features of the environmental DNA (eDNA) samples (such as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) or taxonomically assigned information) to environmental reference states. Specifically, during the training phase, the model learns relationships between genomic features and known environmental conditions, iteratively refining its predictive rules. In the predicting phase, the trained model applies these learned rules to analyse new eDNA samples, generating straightforward, actionable predictions. Through continuous feedback cycles, the model enhances its accuracy, improving its utility for environmental monitoring and management.

Overall, eDNA analysis enables attributing changes in biodiversity to specific environmental factors17,65,144, evaluating the impact of implementing protected areas145,146, and calculating biodiversity and ecosystem state indices47. Aquatic eDNA analysis can also attribute change beyond aquatic ecosystems: imprints of terrestrial land use on aquatic eDNA are well established, showing that aquatic eDNA signals associate to the structure and diversity of terrestrial land use assessed by remote sensing at 400–1,000-m upstream distances17. This information can then be translated into effective practice for the prevention of biodiversity decline.

eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring has the potential to scale from a local to a regional and eventually a global perspective, and enables data integration and the use of this information to downscale back to regional and local interventions42. eDNA approaches are already widely used across different scales, which helps to contribute to monitoring progress on GBF targets. These methods are particularly useful for spearheading activities in regions in which previous knowledge on biodiversity is limited; for example, eDNA-based approaches are being tested to study the biodiversity of deep marine habitats147,148. Similarly, subterranean habitats are one of the least studied environments and the use of molecular tools such as eDNA contributes to mapping their biodiversity65,149. Moreover, eDNA-based assessments are being developed and implemented in many of the world's largest rivers such as the Danube150, Yangtze144 or Rhine151, which are not only home to enigmatic megafauna but are also severely threatened by anthropogenic activities.

Achieving target 1 of the GBF (‘plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss') depends on understanding the initial state and change of overall biodiversity. In many cases, eDNA data are the very first baseline data, and linking these data to possible drivers of biodiversity change will ultimately guide restoration planning152. The ability of eDNA analysis to provide data on the state and change of individual species focuses on target 4 (‘halt species extinction, protect genetic diversity, and manage human–wildlife conflicts'), which directly refers and links to the monitoring and managing of biodiversity, at the species or within-species level. Similarly, target 6 (‘reduce the introduction of invasive alien species by 50% and minimise their impact') operates at the species level, aiming to decrease the impact of alien species in part through preventing their introduction in aquatic systems. To support this approach, eDNA analysis provides early detection and monitoring of alien species. Although initial attempts to detect invasive alien species (for example, the Asian carps Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix93,153) were partially challenged by detection failures (false absences), false presence indications and unknown lower thresholds of detectability, increasing standardization and the adoption of structured decision-making processes have resulted in a relatively broad application of eDNA methods to monitor Asian carp species in North America23,154. Similar efforts have been established for other aquatic alien species, such as invasive kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and sea stars (Asterias amurensis)155, tunicates (Didemnum vexillum)156, dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.)22 or freshwater aquatic plants (Najas minor)157.

The contribution of eDNA analysis to GBF targets 1, 4 and 6 focuses on simply detecting the presence of species. However, eDNA analysis can provide insight into why and how biodiversity is affected; that is, mechanistic monitoring of aquatic systems and the effects of stressors. Classic assessments of environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry have focused on monitoring a highly diversified set of chemicals10. To reach target 7 (‘reduce pollution to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity'), pollutant monitoring must be linked to an ecosystem's ecological health and resilience status. eDNA is effective in capturing how environmental stressors, particularly chemical pollution, have combined negative effects on the structure, stability and composition of aquatic communities across a wide range of taxa158,159,160. Target 10 (‘enhance biodiversity and sustainability in agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry') requires similar monitoring of effects on biodiversity, but in relation to the production and harvesting of natural resources. eDNA is already routinely used to monitor impacts of aquaculture (such as salmon farming) by examining marine benthic sediments161 and has also been used to monitor the outflow of wastewater into natural streams, focusing on possible effects of different agricultural runoff100.

eDNA-based methods have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and contribute to national and global biodiversity targets. For successful inclusion of eDNA analysis in monitoring programmes, careful action is needed as methods must be broadly applicable, comparable and scalable, and must be implementable for countries across the globe.

Two key barriers exist to the implementation of eDNA: first, the perceived limited comparability between results generated with eDNA-based approaches and those obtained with traditional methods162,163,164; and second, unequal access to technical infrastructure. eDNA metabarcoding technology is considered ready for implementation and allows — when needed — retrofitting of indices to current standards47,135. Discrepancies with traditional assessments occur because of amplification biases and incomplete reference databases, but also because eDNA can detect cryptic or elusive species47,123,165 previously missed by traditional tools. Assessing biodiversity and achieving successful conservation outcomes will require effectively using eDNA alongside traditional methods, as biodiversity monitoring globally remains under-resourced. In high-income countries, existing monitoring programmes should be complemented with eDNA-based approaches, creating continuity for existing long-term monitoring and generally allowing comparison at the index level. Maintenance and overlap with other programmes will increase costs and require extra work over the short term, but secure existing data series in the long term. To encourage the rapid adoption of eDNA globally, in low- and middle-income countries, novel (and first) monitoring could use eDNA only.

This section discusses necessary steps towards a global application of eDNA to assess biodiversity within the context of the GBF. First, methods of standardization must be agreed and promoted (agree on minimal standards on sampling and processing, provide training opportunities and institutionalize quality control). Second, adequate reference databases, digital sequence data deposition and general access to these resources must be established. Finally, efforts must be made to increase inclusivity and remove technology barriers (collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility and ethics (CARE) principles and Nagoya Protocol).

The development and implementation of international standards is an essential next step to make eDNA approaches broadly applicable. These next steps, including establishing standardized protocols and best practices for general implementation of eDNA, are particularly relevant for global initiatives, such as the GBF, that rely on common agreement beyond the borders and jurisdiction of individual countries.

eDNA has always been developed as a tool for practitioners, rather than for academic research only. Consequently, discussions on an adequate and replicable implementation paralleled the rapid advances in the field153,162,166,167. General protocols and guidelines were developed from the first species-based assessments, such as amphibians in the UK29, to the monitoring of whole communities of invertebrates and fish, for example, in Switzerland168, the EU37,169, China170 or the USA93.

Despite these standardization efforts, eDNA-based biodiversity assessments still use various approaches throughout the world171. The selection of a certain filter material, DNA extraction methods, primers, sequencing technologies and post-processing steps can drastically affect the inferred taxa lists172,173. For multispecies detection approaches, such as eDNA metabarcoding, the effects of the choice of methods are most pronounced for rare species that are easily missed. Broader use of eDNA for monitoring thus requires standardization of practices63,174, in particular a global agreement on general minimum standards for sampling and processing, reporting and data publishing. Here, specific recommendations for different freshwater ecosystems (for example, small stream versus large, stratified lake), environmental factors (turbidity, flow, pH and so on) and specific research questions and tasks (single species detection versus multispecies detection) must be accounted for37,168,175. This standardization is well underway — a first ISO standard is available in draft form after international voting176, and several others are in development under the framework ISO/TC 147/SC 5 (Biological methods) — but must be continued. Given the ambitious 2030 GBF timeline, the implementation and standardization of the method in its current form might be more effective than deferring implementation considering the promise of upcoming new technologies.

Comparability and scalability across taxa and regions are the biggest assets of eDNA analysis. These capabilities hinge, however, on adequate access to reference databases as most uses of eDNA rely on assigning specific sequences to taxonomic and genetic reference databases (although taxonomy-free approaches exist139). These reference databases are globally still highly unevenly distributed, and large geographic and taxonomic gaps are present177,178,179. For example, (sub)tropical systems and many invertebrate groups are far less represented than temperate systems and vertebrate groups. Populating, expanding and maintaining these reference databases is imperative.

Advances in sequencing technologies enable the upscaling of reference database generation by several orders of magnitude while also drastically reducing costs. However, many — even formally described — species are still absent from public genomic repositories180. Novel nanopore sequencing technologies could allow the barcoding of thousands of specimens from a single amplicon pool at a sequencing cost of few US$ per specimen, offering the potential to catalogue all species within two decades181. The portability and applicability of sequencing technologies in field conditions is also rapidly improving; for example, portable sequencers have been used for DNA barcoding in the Ecuadorian Chocó Rainforest182 and other remote locations. Populating databases is still a major bottleneck as implementation is lagging behind this progress in technologies, and also critically depends on taxonomists' knowledge and expertise. Scientists and end-users must be mobilized alike and commit to complementing the databases as the task is important, necessary and cannot be delegated. This challenge is particularly pronounced given the large number of undescribed or underrepresented taxa, discrepancies in taxonomic classifications and the need for rigorous validation of reference sequences. The complexity of maintaining and curating these databases has been widely discussed in the literature, touching on issues such as funding177 and standardization efforts58. A comprehensive discussion of these aspects is, however, beyond the scope of this Perspective.

Alongside data generation, the raw data produced from environmental samples must be deposited in repositories (Table 1) whose long-term operability is guaranteed183. Priority should be given to open platforms specifically adapted to host genetic data, enabling better discoverability through advanced application programming interfaces (which enable the exchange of data between existing programmes) and research tools184. The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, linking the Sequence Read Archive, the European Nucleotide Archive and the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive are currently among the most suitable options for depositing and indexing eDNA data. Ideally, eDNA repositories should facilitate the seamless exchange and integration of data across different platforms and disciplines. For example, biodiversity data portals such as the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) can include biodiversity records derived from raw DNA data while providing a permanent link to the original repositories185. Publication of eDNA datasets in these global biodiversity databases is crucial to ensure that data can be used by policymakers with little to no specialist knowledge186. However, so far, few eDNA datasets have been made publicly available through these platforms. The key to successful adoption is the mandatory deposition of eDNA raw data along with relevant metadata provided in standardized data models, such as provided by the Genomics Standards Consortium (see the MIxS MIMARKS checklists187) or the Biodiversity Information Standards consortium TDWG (Darwin Core extended data model188,189). As part of ongoing international task forces, new metadata standards are currently being developed190. These data standards ensure that the most critical metadata are recorded and made available through a standardized vocabulary191, which in turn can be aligned with other biodiversity community standards. Such metadata (Table 1) are crucial as they ensure that the data can be accurately interpreted and reused in various contexts, which is necessary to reach a broad range of stakeholders, including citizens.

eDNA data producers must focus on creating datasets that can be used and reused186, which involves ensuring the longevity of data, adopting standard formats and metadata for ease of interpretation, and promoting open access to facilitate wide usage across different sectors. Thus, published eDNA data must adhere to the FAIR principles — findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable192 — as this approach enhances the discoverability and usability of eDNA data across various scientific and non-scientific domains186 (Table 1). Therefore, setting minimum guidelines for data reporting and analysis is recommended, and minimum information to be reported as part of any aquatic eDNA study has been proposed190,193. Data deposition must include the raw sequencing data and the essential metadata specific to the samples and their processing in the laboratory, but also the final community data matrix, easily interpretable by the stakeholders, as well as the bioinformatics tools and reference databases required to produce the results. These minimum guidelines will ensure a baseline of quality and comparability for eDNA research and application.

The successful, widespread implementation of eDNA hinges on removing barriers to its access and making the methods inclusive. Technological barriers and uneven distribution of knowledge and resources between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries exist across biodiversity sciences. As eDNA analysis (similar to remote sensing and other technology-driven approaches) depends on specialized laboratory and analysis techniques, overcoming discrepancies in lack of knowledge, training and resources is particularly relevant. If countries cannot afford eDNA-based monitoring or do not have access to the technologies to process and assess the samples, the existing inequality in biodiversity knowledge will further increase.

In addition to ensuring equitable access to eDNA technology, local and Indigenous knowledge on biodiversity must be both valued and integrated into technology-driven monitoring efforts. Although measuring biodiversity variables through proxies such as eDNA is technologically feasible, maintaining taxonomic and natural history knowledge, as well as connections to ecosystems and nature, is essential. Datafication of biodiversity and reliance on technological solutions run the risk of disconnecting people with nature194, as sequencing information and eDNA approaches cannot replace observing and experiencing nature directly. Additionally, limits exist to the quality and applicability of data available from methods based on indirect collection of information, such as remote sensing or eDNA. Conversely, eDNA also has the potential to be a powerful tool that provides people with a new perspective on their surrounding environment and biodiversity, strengthening their interest in and commitment to nature29,30,31. Any eDNA-based approaches should, therefore, consider how to include the public and taxonomic experts such that the information on biodiversity from eDNA is accompanied by increased understanding and perception of biodiversity.

Addressing the sociocultural dimensions of eDNA, particularly when data originate from territories of Indigenous communities, necessitates the adoption of the CARE principles195. These principles ensure that eDNA research is conducted in a manner that respects the rights and traditions of local communities, promoting an ethical approach and facilitating the local populations acceptance of biodiversity research. Incorporating the CARE principles aligns eDNA practices with broader societal values and legal frameworks, such as the Nagoya Protocol196 and GBF target 13 (‘fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources'). In some situations, however, open-access goals such as the population and maintenance of reference databases can bypass traditional mechanisms for benefit sharing, potentially disadvantaging the countries or communities where the genetic material originated. Public deposition without consultation can undermine the authority of these communities over resources tied to their cultural identity and governance systems. Moreover, eDNA can also complicate traditional frameworks, especially when DNA is transported across national boundaries by natural processes such as ocean currents, river flows and air197. All stakeholders — nations, Indigenous groups and local communities — must be included in discussions about the implementation of CARE principles, data sharing and benefit sharing to ensure that the benefits of eDNA research are distributed fairly and with due regard to the sovereignty and cultural significance of the data sources194,198.

One of the four overarching goals of the GBF is to mobilize the business and finance sectors to close the gap in funding biodiversity. In particular, target 19 (‘Mobilize $200 billion per year for biodiversity') encourages solutions to incentivize international companies and finance to engage in the monitoring of biodiversity and contribute monetarily to its protection. Several initiatives are being promoted to market biodiversity and to incentivize the development of activities and technologies that are not harmful for the environment or that mitigate deleterious actions, such as green bonds or biodiversity credits (quantifiable units of biodiversity improvement that should provide an incentive for funding conservation projects)199,200. Although such market-based solutions to environmental challenges are gaining substantial attention at the global scale, deep uncertainties exist regarding the process and their benefits199. Without proper transparency and accountability, these schemes might be ineffective and lead to greenwashing and inequitable outcomes, as has occurred for carbon credits201.

A challenge to the broad use of biodiversity credits is the difficulty in quantify biodiversity improvements accurately and in a standardized manner. Sampling and identification methods vary substantially, are not all easily implementable across the globe, and the multidimensionality of biodiversity cannot be captured in one single number. eDNA metabarcoding has been suggested as a useful method to help the development of marketing metrics for biodiversity, as its simplicity and scalability could allow the collection of comparable data across the globe. However, this approach also requires global standardization of methods and a clear reference to its limits. Moreover, eDNA is particularly well suited for aquatic environments but is less proven for terrestrial ecosystems, which might limit the comparability of this data201,202.

Addressing biodiversity decline and implementing global measures to assess, manage and restore biodiversity are essential and at the core of the GBF framework. The huge progress in molecular-based biodiversity monitoring, particularly the use of eDNA, has created the first feasible and coherent approach to monitor aquatic biodiversity. To successfully implement eDNA biomonitoring as a reliable and widely trusted basis for policy and decision-making, a new common agreement on its use is needed, including common protocols, data standards and standardization for quality assurance. Further, implementation of eDNA approaches hinges on increased FAIRness and open accessibility of biodiversity data globally, which also presents an opportunity to enhance collaboration, improve conservation efforts and advance research. Rapid completion of reference database, curation and integration of FAIR principles are needed. Although progress towards these goals, in particular where and by whom data are stored, is becoming more systematically addressed in academic research, agreement has not yet been reached and implemented regarding data produced by public stakeholders and private companies. Sample repositories (such as the Global Genome Biodiversity Network) and data centres established for eDNA data should not only be accessible and implemented for high-income countries (for example, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration), but also for low- and middle-income countries. As these repositories are funded by public money and provide collective benefits, all data collected through governmental programmes should be included — even when data collection and analysis is executed by private companies.

Coherent, integrated and complete data storage and access will allow establishing new universally valid metrics for describing biodiversity and elevate the quality and comparability of biodiversity data. In the framework of the GBF, regional to global progress on reaching targets could be tracked by new eDNA-based indicators on the state, change and pressures of biodiversity. Particularly in aquatic systems, these metrics can be calculated at high spatial and temporal resolutions: transport of eDNA in the water allows predictions of biodiversity across catchments and water bodies, whereas matching eDNA sampling to existing monitoring stations of water quality allows synergy with existing infrastructure. A pragmatic approach should be chosen when designing new metrics versus retrofitting to existing monitoring programmes: that is, complementing rather than replacing existing monitoring programmes, yet building new monitoring timelines where no data are available. Swiftly establishing a global network of coherent aquatic biodiversity monitoring using eDNA is realistic and required to achieve GBF targets.

A possible way forwards is institutionalizing eDNA monitoring activities through regional centres (examples of such attempts include the Defra DNA Center of Excellence in the UK, the Joint Research Center in the EU and the National eDNA Reference Centre in Australia). These centres coordinate activities that include funding, supporting and driving research that is relevant to policy implementation, reaching out to local monitoring personnel, receiving samples from citizens, performing quality checks through internal positive control, and generating reference material and certification standards. Such regional eDNA excellence centres can facilitate capacity building and act as coordinating and executing building blocks, linking both local and global biodiversity monitoring centres (similar to GEO BON). The Canadian Centre of Biodiversity Genomics at the University of Guelph and other federal initiatives are examples of such centres. Global join up of these initiatives and centres is crucial to ensure international standards and comparability of datasets across countries. Finally, to future proof the data acquired and ensure long-term comparability, adequate biobanking of samples is a necessary next step, which should, at a minimum, include storing metadata, raw sequencing output, and the extracted DNA samples in quality and quantity sufficient to be used by generations to come203. Together, these measures will elevate the accessibility and extent of aquatic biodiversity data to levels needed for achieving GBF targets and securing global biodiversity.

A 2024 analysis of UK higher education found that students from minority ethnic groups are more likely than white students to drop out and less likely to be employed after graduation (see go.nature.com/4cakscu). Similar disparities exist in the United States, where white and Asian students have better graduation rates and career outcomes than do Black, Hispanic or Native American ones (see go.nature.com/42atwz2). The problems extend to staff members, as well: Black people, for example, are under-represented in both UK and US academia.

‘Silence is complicity' — universities must fight the anti-DEI crackdown

‘Silence is complicity' — universities must fight the anti-DEI crackdown

UK universities are working to remedy these gaps by investing in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. But, in the United States, things have taken a stark turn: affirmative action at universities and DEI programmes in the federal government have been stopped. The administration of US President Donald Trump has also threatened to withhold federal funding and other forms of support from institutions and businesses that continue to pursue inclusivity-related goals. Although dismantling systems aimed at addressing inequities is highly misguided, supporters of DEI initiatives do recognize that there is room for improvement in how these programmes are implemented.

The broad scope of DEI can often cloud meaningful discussion about what works and what doesn't. For instance, a 2019 report by a collective of UK universities and the National Union of Students recommended measures — such as fostering a diverse campus environment and curricula that reflect the experiences of minority ethnic groups — to close the academic achievement gap (see go.nature.com/4jrgpfc).

Such interventions risk overlooking a simpler, if less palatable, explanation for racial disparities: instructors' biased behaviour. Research has shown that when submitting work of identical quality, white students are given higher grades and are seen as more capable than are those from minority ethnic groups1. In another study, researchers posed as prospective PhD students and contacted some 6,500 potential supervisors at top US universities2. Those with white-sounding names were most likely to get a response, especially from supervisors at private institutions, despite all their e-mails and qualifications being identical otherwise2. Moreover, this finding was independent of the proportion of women and people from minority ethnic groups at contacted universities.

Don't wait out four hard years: speak truth to power

Don't wait out four hard years: speak truth to power

In these situations — grading academic work and applying for a PhD — a highly diverse campus will probably not solve the problem, although it could provide other benefits. This is why it is important to acknowledge the reality of bias in universities, set clear objectives for DEI initiatives and develop standardized metrics to measure progress. Too often, DEI interventions end up being symbolic gestures that fail to address the real barriers faced by students and researchers from minority ethnic groups.

Two years ago, astronomers believe they detected a star devouring one of its planets. Now, new observations of the aftermath of same event from the James Webb Space Telescope have suggested a scenario previously only considered in the realms of science fiction: that a planet about the size of Jupiter self-destructed by heading straight into its parent star. The scientists in charge of the observation believe they witnessed the first “planetary suicide” in history.

The only noted way for a star to consume its own planets is for the star to increase significantly in size. This happens when a main sequence star, like our Sun, runs out of hydrogen to fuse and swells to many times its original size, becoming a red giant. Experts are studying this process with interest because the solar system itself is likely to face it. In about 5 billion years, after exhausting the hydrogen in its core, the Sun will expand to 100 times its current radius, devouring nearby planets such as Mercury and Venus in the process.

When a star absorbs a planet, observatories on Earth detect an increase in its luminosity, albeit one that's short-lived. Such a moment of brightening is known as a nova.

In 2023, the Gemini South observatory observed a nova 12,000 light-years away. It was initially suspected to be a red giant consuming one of its nearby planets. However, two years later, a more detailed analysis with the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared instrument revealed that the star was still in its main sequence phase, fusing hydrogen—the star had not aged and expanded into being a red giant. This new evidence suggests that the young star's nova was caused by it being impacted by a Jupiter-sized body.

According to a recent study published in the Astrophysical Journal, this nova is the most convincing direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star. The same researchers had already posited that this nova was evidence of a planet being engulfed in another report, published in Nature a couple of years ago. But in the new study, the team added more evidence of this being the signs of an engulfment, having conducted spectroscopy of the star—that is, analysis of the visible light and other radiation it emitted—820 days after its peak brightness.

This provided new data on the star's luminosity and ejected dust debris, and gave the team of astronomers a better idea of what might have happened in that solar system. They believe a Jupiter-sized planet, orbiting at the same distance as Mercury does from the Sun, gradually approached its star until it was destroyed by the star's outer layers.

As far as the evidence allows us to know, planets moving towards their star, towards destruction, are not common. Scientists estimate that the process may have been triggered by the same phenomenon that generates tides on Earth—the gravitational pull of other nearby celestial bodies (which in Earth's case is the Moon and the Sun). Over millions of years, the gravitational forces exerted by the star would have extracted some of the planet's orbital energy, pulling it out of its stable path towards the host star. In the end, the planet would have orbited too close to maintain its structural integrity.

Not all of the scientific community is convinced by this explanation. One of the main counter-hypotheses says that the star only looks young, because it is could be surrounded by a dense cloud of stellar dust, dampening its luminosity. If it turns out that the age or type of star is different from what is hypothesized, then there may be another explanation for the nova.

New measurements with more powerful telescopes will measure this star's brightness better, and will hopefully provide more evidence as to what happened. It's also possible that more “suicide” planets will be found in future in other places, revealing that the scenario is more common than thought.

On the morning of Christmas Eve 2016, residents of a house in Fraser, Michigan heard a curious pop, pop, popping sound coming from their walls. After initially dismissing it as melting snow falling from the roof, they soon realised the truth: the noise was the result of bricks being squeezed out of place as their home slowly crumpled into a sinkhole.

The house and several nearby were evacuated as authorities assessed the situation and determined its cause: a collapsed sewer interceptor, threatening several homes and a long stretch of Fraser's busy 15 Mile Road. It was hardly the start to the festive season anyone would wish for.

“This was quite the impact to our system and community,” says Vince Astorino. As Operations Director at the Macomb County Public Works Office, he's responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the county's wastewater infrastructure, including some 68 miles of sewer lines. “An 11-foot diameter sewer, approximately 70-feet deep, experienced a failure which drastically reduced wastewater flow. This section of pipe is near the main outlet of our system and approximately 800,000 residents rely on it to convey their wastewater downstream.”

Prompt action from Astorino and his team got bypass systems in place in time to prevent sewage backing up into residents' homes, and in the end only one building—the house where the popping sound was heard—required demolition. But it was nine months until the offending stretch of pipe, roughly 4000 feet of it, would be fully replaced. The direct cost to taxpayers was around $75 million, not taking into account the added costs to residents and nearby businesses as a result of the disruption.

The key to preventing disasters like this is regular inspection of sewer lines, hunting down any cracks and fissures that, if left unattended, can lead to soil ingress and eventual collapse of the pipe. But sewer pipes can be dark, cramped and filled with pockets of gas, making inspecting large networks using traditional methods (typically a tethered, remotely operated crawler fitted with a camera or even in-person) a slow, costly and often hazardous process.

This is where drones come in. Designed and engineered to operate in confined spaces, a new generation of flying robots is being sent into sewers to perform inspections in a safer, more efficient way.

The Elios 3 drone is a popular option for sewer inspections.

One such drone is the Elios 3, designed and manufactured by Swiss company Flyability and used by major industry players like Veolia. Equipped as standard with a protective cage, impact-resistant exoskeleton, 16,000-lumen lighting rig, 4K camera and LiDAR, it can navigate through dark and dusty pipes while creating a live 3D model of the environment. The modular design means it can also be fitted with specialized payloads like explosive gas sensors or ultrasonic thickness gauges.

Eloise McMinn Mitchell, Communication Manager at Flyability, says that the company is seeing huge sales growth as a result of the Elios 3's capabilities and efficiency versus in-person human inspections, particularly when it comes to sewers. “To inspect a stretch of sewer underneath a road, you'll need teams of at least four people and have to divert traffic in multiple locations. With the drone, you just need two people, and nobody has to climb into the sewer, eliminating confined space risks and exposure to hazardous environments.”

As a result, the safety rules surrounding drones are much less rigid than when humans are involved, which McMinn Mitchell says greatly eases the cost of inspections. “There's an average 40 percent cost reduction compared to traditional methods, and you can inspect 900 meters in a day with the drone compared to 400 meters.”

In May 2024, in a drive to streamline their inspection process, Macomb County adopted a technology-led approach combining a remotely piloted Asio X drone, built by Flyability rival Flybotix, with a software program called SewerAI. The total cost of both was around $100,000. Previously, the county had been spending $1 million on inspections every three years, manually inspecting footage for defects, many of which could be missed due to the poor image quality.

Around 16 inches across and equipped with powerful 40,000-lumen lights, a 4K camera and a cage for protection against collisions, the Asio X can capture crystal clear video of the sewer system while navigating all but the narrowest of pipes. Astorino describes it as a “night and day difference” to the old method.

Footage from the Asio X of the Macomb County sewers

Unlike some of the latest consumer drones, which fly almost autonomously, the Asio X requires mostly manual control, and in some very unforgiving locations too, as Astorino points out: “It's dark, air flow can quickly change within a confined space, and managing a flight path above flowing water in a restricted pipe is challenging.” As a result, he leaves flight to the experts: “Our main operator, Captain Zach, is able to fly through some very tricky environments.”

That being said, the inspection process itself is straightforward. “An antenna is lowered into the manhole to provide signal strength from the drone controller to the drone,” Astorino tells WIRED. “The operator will fly the drone from one manhole to the next, recording video through that flight path.” With around 20 minutes of battery life, the Asio X can document around 1,000 feet of pipe in a single flight, capturing not only video but LiDAR and infrared scans, and gas readings as it passes through a section of sewer.

Under the old system, video data would be analyzed in the field, with the camera operator logging defects as they navigated through the pipes. Now, the drone-captured data is sent off to contractors at SewerAI, who run it through their AI-assisted algorithms to identify defects automatically. Astorino tells me it's been a game-changer, saving his team huge amounts of time and money.

SewerAI can detect problems that need addressing from drone footage.

“We performed months of testing against coded video in the field from various contractors against what SewerAI was able to do with the same footage, and every single time SewerAI excelled in what it was able to find and code correctly.” Previously, inspecting a section of sewer pipe might take months, but SewerAI has an agreement to send data analysis back to the county within 10 days; Astorino says it usually does so within 24 hours.

The team have been so impressed with the software package that even in areas where the drone cannot go and more traditional methods of inspection are required—small diameter pipes, for instance—the resulting data is now sent off for analysis rather than being coded in the field. Old data can be quickly reviewed and re-analyzed too, picking up defects the original contractors may have missed at the time. This means repair work can be done where it's most needed, preventing the sort of worsening conditions that can lead to disastrous and costly incidents like the 2016 sinkhole.

Macomb County has been a pioneer in this field. It's the first county in Michigan to utilize this combination of drones and AI software for underground infrastructure inspection and has won two in-state awards as a result of its forward thinking. But Vince Astorino tells me he and his team are always on the lookout for new ways to modernize operations. “It's hard to count out great leaps forward in technology around this space, especially with the great AI race taking place all around us. We're keeping our options open.”

Automakers are increasingly pushing consumers to accept monthly and annual fees to unlock preinstalled safety and performance features, from hands-free driving systems and heated seats to cameras that can automatically record accident situations. But the additional levels of internet connectivity this subscription model requires can increase drivers' exposure to government surveillance and the likelihood of being caught up in police investigations.

A cache of more than two dozen police records recently reviewed by WIRED show US law enforcement agencies regularly trained on how to take advantage of “connected cars,” with subscription-based features drastically increasing the amount of data that can be accessed during investigations. The records make clear that law enforcement's knowledge of the surveillance far exceeds that of the public and reveal how corporate policies and technologies—not the law—determine driver privacy.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

“Each manufacturer has their whole protocol on how the operating system in the vehicle utilizes telematics, mobile Wi-Fi, et cetera,” one law enforcement officer noted in a presentation prepared by the California State Highway Patrol (CHP) and reviewed by WIRED. The presentation, while undated, contains statistics on connected cars for the year 2024. “If the vehicle has an active subscription,” they add, “it does create more data.”

The CHP presentation, obtained by government transparency nonprofit Property of the People via a public records request, trains police on how to acquire data based on a variety of hypothetical scenarios, each describing how vehicle data can be acquired based on the year, make, and model of a vehicle. The presentation acknowledges that access to data can ultimately be limited due to choices made by not only vehicle manufacturers but the internet service providers on which connected devices rely.

One document notes, for instance, that when a General Motors vehicle is equipped with an active OnStar subscription, it will transmit data—revealing its location—roughly twice as often as a Ford vehicle. Different ISPs appear to have not only different capabilities but policies when it comes to responding to government requests for information. Police may be able to rely on AT&T to help identify certain vehicles based on connected devices active in the car but lack the ability to do so when the device relies on a T-Mobile or Verizon network instead.

Charlotte McCoy, a GM spokesperson, tells WIRED the company now requires a court order before handing over location data to law enforcement. “We review each request individually to assess the circumstances and the nature of the request before providing any information,” they say. “Connectivity offers many benefits—including navigation, communication, safety, and maintenance—and customers can mask their location or turn off connectivity at any time.”

Other car manufacturers listed in the CHP presentation, including Ford, did not respond to a request for comment.

“There's definitely a role being played by the companies in deciding what kind of standard they're going to insist on,” says Andrew Crocker, the surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “And this is a dynamic we've seen in other areas of tech. Google and Facebook and Apple all played a role in saying, ‘We'll only provide this data in response to a warrant; other data we'll provide in response to a subpoena.'”

When police are investigating a specific suspect, they will often use a technique known as a “ping” to geographically locate a specific device known to belong to that individual. But when canvassing near a crime scene for an unknown perpetrator, authorities commonly rely on a procedure known as a “tower dump,” requesting that ISPs cast a wider net and identify virtually any devices that have connected to a specific cell tower during a certain window of time. Police analysts can then comb through this data and attempt to identify a culprit, often using surveillance footage or witness testimony about a vehicle's color, make, or model.

Nearly all subscription-based car features rely on devices that come preinstalled in a vehicle, with a cellular connection necessary only to enable the automaker's recurring-revenue scheme. The ability of car companies to charge users to activate some features is effectively the only reason the car's systems need to communicate with cell towers. The police documents note that companies often hook customers into adopting the services through free trial offers, and in some cases the devices are communicating with cell towers even when users decline to subscribe.

In an August 2022 email, one detective noted: “In some vehicles, again [it] depends on manufacturer, the vehicle is still doing this despite the lack of an active subscription, and just sending the data back to the mother ship. This could be due to collecting user data for what the manufacturer sells it for, to providing this data to try to sell you on renewing your [subscription] package that lapsed.”

The “tower dump” technique is becoming increasingly unpopular in US courts following the US Supreme Court's acknowledgement in 2018 that location data raises significant Fourth Amendment concerns. While the Supreme Court specifically avoided addressing tower dumps in its landmark US v. Carpenter decision, a Fifth Circuit ruling last year placed the capability in great jeopardy, concluding that a warrant to “geofence” an area and collect evidence from a wide variety of individuals is inherently unconstitutional.

On the back of that decision, a federal magistrate in Mississippi ruled two months ago that tower dumps are likewise unconstitutional. While a “tower dump” and a “geofence” are not precisely the same—the latter relying on GPS coordinates obtained from internet companies such as Google, as opposed to a cell tower—the results are more or less identical: offering police a dragnet with which to accumulate vast amounts of location data on individuals, many if not most of whom are not suspected of committing a crime.

In response to the rapid changes in case law surrounding location data, Google—historically a frequent target of geofence warrants—announced technical changes to its software last year, making it effectively impossible to respond to these types of warrants.

“Location data is some of the most sensitive, revealing information that is generated by our devices, including our cars,” the EFF's Crocker says. “It's extremely revealing of obviously where you go and where you've been, but also all the people you associate with and all the things you're doing. You can paint a very clear picture of someone's life with just a list of all the places they've been in their car. The Supreme Court has made that very clear.”

The police documents reviewed by WIRED alone demonstrate the arbitrary nature of vehicle surveillance upon this shifting legal landscape, with police noting, for instance, that while Verizon will refuse to allow police to define their own radius when requesting cell tower data, its competitors impose no such limitations. Another document notes that while AT&T will conduct “pings,” locating a device in real time, it will only do so for “voice devices.”

What is also clear from the documents is that US police are aware of the control corporations have over their ability to acquire vehicle location data, expressing fears that they could abruptly decide to kill off certain capabilities at any time.

In a letter sent in April 2024 to the Federal Trade Commission, US senators Ron Wyden and Edward Markey—Democrats from Oregon and Massachusetts, respectively—noted that a range of automakers, from Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, among others, are willing to disclose location data to the government in response to a subpoena without a court order. Volkswagen, meanwhile, had its own arbitrary rules, limiting subpoenas to fewer than seven days' worth of data. The senators noted that these policies stood in contrast to public pledges previously made by some automakers to require a warrant or court order before surrendering a customer's location data.

Automakers “differ significantly on the important issue of whether customers are ever told they were spied on,” the senators wrote. At the time of the letter, only Tesla had a policy, they said, of informing customers about legal demands. “The other car companies do not tell their customers about government demands for their data, even if they are allowed to do so.”

“We respect our customers' privacy and take our responsibility to protect their personal information seriously,” Bennet Ladyman, a T-Mobile spokesperson, says.

AT&T spokesperson Jim Kimberly says: “Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and other lawful discovery requests. In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid. We require a search warrant based on the probable-cause standard for all government demands for real-time or historical location information, except in emergency situations. For government demands for cell tower searches, we require a probable-cause search warrant or a court order, except in emergency situations.”

Verizon did not respond to a request for comment.

“Especially now, with American civil liberties eroding rapidly, people should exercise great caution in granting new surveillance powers to law enforcement,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People.

Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the police documents reviewed by WIRED contained substantial detail about car surveillance that appear to be publicly unavailable, suggesting that corporations are being far more open with law enforcement than they are with their own customers.

“It's an ongoing scandal that this kind of surveillance is taking place without people being aware of it, let alone giving permission for it,” Stanley says. “If they're carrying out surveillance on the public, the public should know. They should have meaningful knowledge and give meaningful consent before any kind of surveillance is activated, which clearly is not the case.”

I am holding in my hand what for a moment feels like the holy grail. But mostly I'm a little confused. Somehow, the new Rapid Brewer from Oxo has done something I've declared impossible many times over: It has made actual good-tasting cold brew in five minutes.

The promise of fast cold brew has been made so many times I've taken to ignoring it: It's pretty much always a lie. I've tried north of a dozen cold-brew devices this past year, and the WIRED Reviews team has tripled this number going back to 2017. Over and over, every device offering “instant cold brew” is wrong or different or a separate substance called iced coffee, or maybe even actually terrible. Cold brew, by its nature, takes time: anything from a few hours to a full day.

But New York–founded kitchen brand Oxo already makes my favorite traditional cold-brew maker. So if Oxo is making promises, I listen. The Oxo Rapid Brewer, released last autumn, is a little multipart device with a hand pump, a water reservoir, and a tight-tamped coffee reservoir—designed to use hand-pumped air pressure to push water through a tight espresso-like puck of coffee grounds. It costs a mere $40, and it's small enough to take on a hike. Worth a try, I figured.

And so I ground a whopping 40 grams of medium-roast coffee to a super-fine, nearly espresso-like grind and tamped it into the device's coffee reservoir like a thick quad-shot puck. I poured a standard American coffee cup into the reservoir I'd screwed up top, and then I waited five minutes before pumping air pressure into the water chamber.

And lo, a delicious dark elixir showered into the waiting cup. Well, actually it more kinda dribbled, like water through a leaky roof. But anyway, the result was about 4 ounces of genuinely credible cold-brew concentrate—ready to be diluted with milk or ice water into a morning drink. The coffee had released its natural sweetness and a whole lot of flavor.

Among all instant-ish cold brew I've tried, this tasted the most like traditional cold brew, the stuff that takes 12 or 24 hours to make. Wild stuff!

So, how does this thing work? Well, it's hard not to notice similarities between the Oxo Rapid Brewer and another multipart plastic tube of a brewer that … also uses hand-applied pressure to brew coffee quickly.

Indeed, when she saw the device, an editor asked excitedly, “Is this an AeroPress from Oxo?” It is absolutely not, replied Oxo's reps emphatically when asked this very question.

“Unlike the AeroPress, where the coffee and water are fully mixed and agitated before filtration, the Rapid Brewer's process focuses on pressure-driven extraction through the coffee bed,” went the response, filtered through the anonymizing power of emailed public relations. “The resulting concentrate is bold and flavorful, with our cold brew in particular reaching extraction levels that are difficult to achieve with other brewing methods.”

Indeed, the process is a bit different. Basically, the AeroPress is like a French press that's been hand-pumped through a filter, with a bit of pressure to aid extraction. The Oxo? It's more like a combination of Kyoto-style slow-drip and espresso. But also hand-pumped.

For five minutes, water dribbles through a shower filter into a thick, tamped coffee puck, working its way slowly through the puck but releasing very few drops. Only when I start hand-pumping is the water pushed more quickly through the puck, dribbling out over the course of another minute or so: The air in the chamber reaches higher than one bar, about double what you'd usually expect from an AeroPress but still way less than the nine bars needed to qualify as espresso.

The resulting cold brew concentrate benefits from pressurized extraction, sure. But also, super-fine grounds aid faster extraction. Using a boatload of coffee grounds also means a greater bulk of flavor compounds is extracted.

The device manages to coax out a surprising amount of sweetness, especially with roasts that lean caramelly and medium-dark. And in such a short time span, it produces a satisfyingly full-bodied and full-flavored drink, ready to be diluted with ice or milk. In side-by-side testing, the results were significantly better than fast cold brew made with an AeroPress.

But a lot of caveats are in order.

Is the cold brew produced by the Rapid Brewer as complex and sweet and smooth as a 12-hour cold brew? No, it's absolutely not. The Rapid Brewer is a fast but blunt instrument, extracting sweetness and full body but not quite all of the flavor. And using the right roast matters a lot. While my first attempt with the brewer yielded cold brew so delicious I thought my senses had gone haywire, subsequent attempts with different beans showed limitations.

Light roasts, in particular, came out underextracted to the point of sour: don't go below medium with this one. Too dark, you risk some bitterness. This really is a somewhat finicky balance you're striking. (For the record, my initial success came with a medium-roasted Stumptown Colombia single-origin: have fun.)

You're also using a whole heck of a lot of beans for each mug of cold brew: 40 grams of coffee for four ounces of concentrate, enough to make eight to 12 ounces of drinking-strength cold brew once diluted. By comparison, I'd expect to use less than half that if making 10-ounce mug of drip coffee. The portion you're using for the Rapid Brewer is also significantly more than you'd need to make the traditional cold brew that involves patience and forethought.

As a daily driver, this Rapid Brewer would quickly become expensive. Which is all to say, this is not a cold-brew maker of first resort. It is, rather, a magic trick to be reserved for hiking, camping, or mornings at home when long-extracted cold brew is not available.

I haven't said much about hot brew as of yet, but the Rapid Brew will indeed also produce hot coffee, if you use about half as much coffee and steep for only 2 minutes. But I don't see as much use for the hot-coffee side of the equation.

First off, this Rapid Brewer produces its hot coffee in concentrated form, meaning you'll then have to dilute your hot coffee with more hot water after brewing or it'll be bitter and strong, but definitely not espresso. Second, the hot brew isn't much faster than any other method of brewing hot coffee, and the results are also not as complex or aromatic as an AeroPress or a good drip brewer. Fine for camping, I guess.

But that said, as with the AeroPress it kinda resembles, user experimentation will eventually determine what works and doesn't work with the Rapid Brewer. I've started messing around with different doses, and I even tried running water twice through coarser grounds, with surprisingly OK results. What made the AeroPress popular was not the original AeroPress recipe; it was the opportunity to goof around with it and come up with one's own ideal result.

In the meantime, this Oxo Rapid Brewer offers a palatable and quite economical home solution to a sudden need for cold brew—the only such solution I know. And when you need coffee, you always need it fast.

EliteBook is HP's business laptop brand—“real power for real work”—and a quick peek at the price reveals a fairly universal truth about business-focused hardware: It's more expensive than consumer-grade gear. Considerably so. With a $2,429 MSRP (though already discounted to $1,999), the EliteBook Ultra G1i is the priciest laptop I've tested in over a year, except for Apple's MacBook Pro, which had its specs blown out.

The EliteBook Ultra G1i has relatively tame tech under the hood, a modest configuration that would barely merit a raised eyebrow amongst its Windows competitors. So what are you getting for that outsized outlay?

The big sell is security: HP Wolf Security for Business adds several extra layers of protection on top of existing anti-malware features, and it's hard not to notice them right away. For example, one feature of Wolf emerges when you attempt to install any software. Wolf pops up to alert you if the software is not on its authorized list (nothing was, during my tests), and asks if you really want to install it. It's similar to Microsoft's User Access Control system, except you can't bypass this through the Control Panel.

Additional features of Wolf Security include anti-phishing protection, a BIOS tamper-prevention feature, Windows OS hardening/resilience features, and much more, with extras geared toward IT fleet management. I tested as many of the security features as I could and was impressed that they were wholly effective at blocking any of the bad stuff I could turn up. Much of this is overkill for the consumer, but if your business needs this kind of protection and added manageability, well, you probably already know it.

Beyond all that, there's the actual hardware, which is buttoned up. Matte black, with curved corners but generally crisp edges, nothing about the design will surprise any user who's worked on a corporate laptop in the last decade, save perhaps for the screen, which opens to a lie-flat 180 degrees. The magnesium cover has a moderate amount of give, but the thinness does help keep weight down to a svelte 2.6 pounds, and thickness at 19 mm.

Specs are not bare-bones but are far from luxe; the 14-inch touchscreen has a 2,880 x 1,800-pixel resolution, and the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V CPU. That's a few steps up from the basic processor model, but still a step down from higher-end options you typically find at this price. The 32 GB of RAM is fair, but the 512-GB solid-state drive feels chintzy for the money, though perhaps that's an acknowledgement that most business users will be leaning heavily on cloud or server-based storage instead. Ports are acceptable: three USB-C with USB4 support and a single USB-A port (with a flip-down cover). You'll need one of those USB-C ports for charging.

Given the above specs, I was surprised that performance was generally on the low side, more in keeping with a true entry-level configuration than what the G1i includes. None of the benchmarks I ran were any more impressive than I've seen on slower, cheaper machines running Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2 processors, and many of the scores I saw were below even those uninspired levels, albeit only slightly. I suspect the overhead from the Wolf Security features is giving the unit a slight performance hit that, while not severe, may be more noticeable when putting the laptop under heavy loads.

Battery life on a full-screen YouTube playback hit just over 14 hours, a decent score, and I was impressed by the completely silent operation of the laptop; I couldn't get the fan to kick in, no matter how heavy a load I put on the device. The speakers are fine, and the screen looks good enough, but neither blew my socks off. I did appreciate the keyboard on the device, which has just enough travel and responsiveness to make for easy data entry, while also being fairly quiet. The touchpad is spacious but just short of being too large.

As with most laptops today, AI is a major focus for the EliteBook line, and HP's AI Companion, the company's own GPT-4o skin, is preinstalled on the unit. AI Companion purports to let you take fuller advantage of the onboard neural processing unit, though it requires an active internet connection to work and wasn't any faster than any online tools available. You're also getting double AI duty here, as pressing the Copilot button on the keyboard still brings up a standard Microsoft Copilot interface.

The temporary sale price of $1,999 makes the EliteBook Ultra G1i a better deal, but it still doesn't measure up on a price-to-performance basis against competing systems. It does, however, provide a much stronger value proposition for its security and manageability benefits, though again, I doubt many of these features have much utility outside of large, corporate environments.

Quantum computing has long been announced as “just around the corner,” but several companies are now determined to make this a commercial reality, with the promise of solving complex problems beyond classical computers' reach.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing.

As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems.

But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results.

Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking.

Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. 

Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. 

Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction.

Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company's first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others.

Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms.

At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025.

D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem.

Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE.

Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago's Humboldt Park.

In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023.

In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. 

Google didn't stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow's performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.”

IBM's quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates.

Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn't happened. 

IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. 

IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers, and a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland that received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program.

In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others.

In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years.

Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. Having emerged out of the Institut d'Optique in 2019, its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize Laureate Physics and professor Alain Aspect.

In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore's Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa'ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund).

PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York.

In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments.

Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach including hardware, software, and applications.

Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year.

Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers.

In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and also received support from  the French government through the France 2030 Plan.

Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction.

QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025.

Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). 

Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket.

QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. 

Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the upcoming 336-qubit Lyra system.

Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021.

In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing.

U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM's superconducting electronics division. 

In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” 

In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. 

Other backers include Merck's corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck.

SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them  are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).

Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system including 35 photonic chips.

Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

AI-based coding has exploded in popularity on the promise that it will make developers' jobs faster and easier. But AI coding has also resulted in something else: a vast increase in lines of code, and thus the likelihood of bugs resulting in crashes or other mishaps. 

On Monday, an Israeli startup called Lightrun, which has built an observability platform to identify and debug (remediate) code before those problems arise, announced a Series B of $70 million. The funding underscores not just the gap in the market for tools like these, but also Lightrun's traction in meeting that demand. 

New backer Accel is co-leading the round alongside previous investor Insight Partners, with participation from Citi, Glilot Capital, GTM Capital, and Sorenson Capital. Lightrun has now raised $110 million to date, including a Series A led by Insight that we covered in 2021.

The startup is not disclosing its valuation, but there are some strong signs that it's doing well. 

First, there are its customers. Citi is a strategic backer and is one of an impressive list of big-name clients that also includes ADP, AT&T, ICE/NYSE, Inditex, Microsoft, Priceline, Salesforce, and SAP. 

Second, there is the product and the company's timing for how it fits into the current market landscape. Back in July 2024, Lightrun announced a new AI-based debugging tool to use within organizations' integrated developer environments (IDEs), appropriately called the Runtime Autonomous AI Debugger. Although the company's platform was already delivering impressive results, this was the product that really spoke to the current predicament many enterprises are facing: AI is leading to a lot more coding and a lot more problems, and Lightrun had built an AI tool to address that. 

The company said that revenues have grown more than fourfold since it was launched, and that this is what got investors knocking. Andrei Brasoveanu, the Accel partner who led the investment for the firm, said that he'd had his eye on Lightrun (observing, even) for years before this, and he finally took the plunge after that launch. 

“Everything came together last year,” he said. “They saw acceleration in the enterprise, all because of AI.”

Timing is something that Ilan Peleg, the CEO who co-founded the company with CTO Leonid Blouvshtein, knows something about. Before turning his attention to further education and eventually building Lightrun, Peleg was a champion middle-distance runner, winning four national championships in Israel and ranked in the top 16 of all middle-distance runners across Europe. 

As Peleg sees it, there are dozens of companies building observability tools in the market today; some of the most prominent include the likes of Datadog and App Dynamics.

But none have yet reached “the holy grail” of such work: not only being able to get a big picture of all the code that is being shipped in production, but to understand how it will interact with what is already being used, and how to anticipate where problems might arise — and, to do so with minimal interruption and thus minimal cost to the organization. 

“Code is becoming cheap but bugs are expensive,” he said.

That problem, meanwhile, has reached “an inflection point,” he said. “Developers now can ship more code than ever before,” due to all the automation that is being used, thanks to AI. “But it's still a very manual process to fix it when things go wrong.”

Lightrun's breakthrough has been to build an observability toolset that can monitor code just as it is in the IDE and understand how it will behave alongside code that is actively in production. Lightrun is then able to automatically make adjustments to the code as it moves into production to continue operating without interruption and crashes. It does this by way of being able to create AI-based simulations to understand that behaviour, and then to fix the code before issues arise. 

“This is the part where we are unique,” Peleg said. 

There are a lot of options for how Lightrun might develop, given how close observability sits to other activities in organizations. 

One of those is building tools more specifically for cybersecurity teams, given the obvious security implications that arise out of bugs. Another is potentially building some of its tooling even closer to the point of code creation, to make finding and fixing possible bugs even more efficient. 

For now, the plan is to remain focused on building out its tools, talent and business specifically in the IDE, Peleg said. “Everything that poses risk to resilience, we are mitigating,” he said, although he didn't rule out more purpose-specific tooling in the future. 

As for code assistants, “these might be in our future,” he said, “but even focusing and working only on the problem of software remediation once executed is complex and wide.” It will be hard to anticipate, he said, what code creation will look like in the future. Today, with between 30% and 60% of all production issues estimated to come from code issues generated by both humans and machines, providing a way to observe and fix everything — regardless of how it was created — is what Lightrun is racing to fix.

The world has a trash problem. The amount of stuff we throw away is expected to nearly double, to 3.8 billion metric tons, by 2050. Reducing what we use would go a long way to addressing the issue, but let's face it, we're not very good at buying less either.

That leaves recycling, which has its own problems. People routinely try to recycle dirty yogurt cups or toss plastic in the aluminum bin. It all makes recycling more expensive because, ultimately, someone has to manually pick out the unwanted stuff.

In response, several companies have been building automated systems to sort recyclables, including Glacier, a 6-year-old company that has developed inexpensive robotic arms controlled by computer vision to identify over 30 different types of materials. 

The startup has deployed its robots in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, and now Seattle.

As Glacier looks to expand its robot fleet to more municipalities, it recently raised a $16 million Series A, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. 

The round was led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from AlleyCorp, Alumni Ventures, Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Cox Exponential, Elysium, New Enterprise Associates, One Small Planet, Overlap Holdings, Overture, VSC Ventures, and Working Capital Fund. 

Materials recovery facilities — or MRFs, as sorting facilities are called — are getting squeezed on both ends, Rebecca Hu-Thrams, Glacier's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. Governments want more waste to be recycled, but MRFs are having a hard time finding enough people to staff the sorting line.

Industry-wide, turnover is extremely high. A typical MRF will have to hire five times per year for a single sorting position. The job is so undesirable that one MRF operator told Hu-Thrams that, even though his wages were higher, he was concerned about losing workers to a new warehouse set to open nearby.

“Would you rather stand at a conveyor belt and sort through people's trash, or would you rather be lifting boxes in an air-conditioned warehouse?” Hu-Thrams said. “That kind of underscores the dilemma that a lot of our customers are facing.”

Glacier offers its robots to customers as outright purchases or on a lease-to-own model. It encourages MRFs to make repairs they feel comfortable with, supplying them with training and spare parts. For those that would rather not, the startup offers maintenance packages.

Glacier is also offering a data product, in which MRFs and other stakeholders like consumer products companies and government agencies can pay for access to insights about the waste stream. For an MRF, that might mean identifying where on a line it's losing valuable aluminum cans to the landfill. For a company or regulator, it might mean auditing the waste stream to determine whether packaging that's designed to be recycled is actually getting recycled.

With enough robots, recycling rates should improve, if only because robots are faster and better at distinguishing between recyclables and trash.

“Every time we send people to audit our AI systems, the people just do so much worse,” said Areeb Malik, Glacier's CTO and second co-founder. “AI is getting really powerful, being able to distinguish beyond what people can even notice.”

Creating animation is a time-consuming process, requiring multiple steps including storyboarding, rendering, composition, and lighting to craft a single scene. If a director wants to experiment with a different take for a scene, an animation team has to go back and tweak things before the scene can be finalized.

Cheehoo, a startup founded by a mix of Hollywood execs and technologists, wants to create an AI-powered tool to make it easier for creatives to produce animated content.

The startup was born out of production company Rideback, which produced the Lego Movie franchise. Rideback's co-CEOs, Michael LoFaso and Jonathan Eirich, are a part of Cheehoo's founding team along with Rideback co-founder Dan Lin. Other founding members include former President of DreamWorks Animation Chris deFaria and ex-Apple AI researchers Hubert Tsai and Wei-Cheng Kuo.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, LoFaso said that Cheehoo wants to lead the way for studios and creators to bring their animation to life. 

“What we found through Rideback is that in Hollywood, the process of creating animation was getting expensive and complex,” LoFaso said. “It was starting to become tougher for creators to get their idea out in the world. We wanted to create a tool that was native to the workflows of creators and make their lives easier.”

Cheehoo's tools provide creators a way to prototype and iterate on animation rapidly. They help with tasks like data annotation, file conversions, and format consistency, allowing creators to move between different steps of the animation process. 

Cheehoo's workflow, which can integrate with existing platforms like Maya or Unreal, allows users to make changes in animation and see the results right away. Creators can turn AI features on or off to take more control of the editing process. Cheehoo uses in-house AI models to assist with character and asset creation, and also lets users integrate third-party models from OpenAI, Runway, and others for tasks such as post generation, motion stylization, and scene composition. 

Cheehoo didn't announce any launch partners, but the company said that it is already working with several IP holders, studios, and creators. Cheehoo has raised $10 million in funding led by Greycroft, with participation from Point72 Ventures, Basis Set, Headline Asia, Powerhouse Capital, Playground Productions, and Rideback.

Brentt Baltimore, principal at Greycroft, said that the venture firm has always been inclined to make investments in companies that create “new age” media. He added that he thinks Cheehoo has the right mix of Hollywood, media, and technology DNA to solve problems in animation pipelines.

“Cheehoo has an opportunity to reduce the cost of animation production overall,” Baltimore said in an interview. “That means it can have sophisticated creators can easily create animation films without having an expensive studio setup. Using […] AI, the company is trying to put enterprise or big studio-level workflows into a tool enabling independent filmmakers to individuals to be creative with animation features. It also doing all this while providing creative control to users, which creatives have always wanted.”

Looking to the future, LoFaso said that while Cheehoo is working with enterprises and prosumers mainly, it intends to roll out more consumer-focused products. That may help Cheehoo compete against startups like Accel-backed Cartwheel and Naver-backed Cinamon, which are also building tools to help simplify aspects of animation production.

When Deepankar Rustagi last raised money for OmniRetail in 2022, excitement was high for African startups addressing the supply chain and operational challenges in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. At one point, these startups received more capital than all sectors, except fintech.

Recently, though, the industry's enthusiasm and venture capital's interest have faded, as various business models have struggled under mounting pressure.

Yet for Rustagi, OmniRetail isn't just another B2B commerce platform; it's an ambitious effort to reshape informal retail across Nigeria and West Africa using technology and embedded finance in a scalable, profitable way. Now, that vision has received further endorsement with a $20 million Series A equity funding round. This capital will help OmniRetail expand its presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, while deepening its focus on embedded finance products.

The round was co-led by Norwegian development finance institution Norfund and Lagos-based VC firm Timon Capital, with follow-on participation from Ventures Platform, Aruwa Capital, Goodwell Investments (via Alitheia Capital), and Flour Mills of Nigeria.

This marks Norfund's first direct equity investment in an African startup, and according to Rustagi, puts OmniRetail on a path to dominating in a segment where others have struggled to grow profitably. OmniRetail has raised $38 million in equity and debt since its inception in 2019. 

OmniRetail's model digitizes order management for 145 manufacturers, more than 5,800 distributors and services over 150,000 informal retailers across 12 cities in Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast.

Retailers use the app to order inventory, access working capital, and make digital payments. In the background is a third-party logistics network of over 1,100 vehicles and distributed warehousing capacity managed by 85 local logistics partners. 

OmniRetail's asset-light strategy has been important in hitting profitability. In 2023, the Lagos-based B2B e-commerce platform became EBITDA positive. In 2024, it turned net profitable. A similar story is unfolding in Egypt, where another B2B e-commerce platform, Cartona, owes its push toward profitability to the model.

Both CEOs have noted that Africa's informal market is vast and made up of suppliers and distributors that don't need to be displaced or competed against, but rather made more efficient with the tech tools provided by their platforms.

“The profitability journey was an outcome of our efficiency on utilizing the assets that we aggregated in the network, and this has proven that the model that we put together as a ‘network of networks' is profitable and is highly scalable, Rustagi said. “That's the reason we went ahead and raise the capital to finally put the metal on the pedal and scale in more geographies and in more categories. We're expanding now not just to grow, but to optimize.”

Better occupancy in warehousing, smarter logistics routes, and deeper category penetration will all improve margins, he added. 

Rustagi, in a conversation with TechCrunch, alongside OmiRetail's head of investment, Archit Bagaria, further explained that the company's progress also lies in a deep understanding of the FMCG retail ecosystem, with the entire leadership team boasting decades of experience.

According to them, it affords a unique advantage of understanding how the value chain works, who the key players are, and where the gaps in visibility exist.

“For years, goods have been moving from point A to point B, but the lack of transparency has hindered financial inclusion and caused inefficiencies in the process,” said Bagaria. “By building an ecosystem that streamlines this entire landscape, we can solve these problems.”

Once a startup reaches critical mass, Bagaria adds, it becomes easier to layer additional services, such as payments and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), on top of its existing infrastructure. “Our approach has been different from others, and we believe we've found success with this model,” Bagaria added. 

Unlike other startups that jumped into offering credit products too early or mistimed the launch, OmniRetail waited until it had significant distribution scale and data. Thanks to this strategy, OmniRetail processed over ₦1.3 trillion (~$810 million) in transactions last year, with Omnipay, its BNPL product, disbursing ₦19 billion monthly (~$12 million) in inventory credit, boasting near-zero defaults, according to the company.

Acquiring Nigeria-based merchant solution platform Traction Apps in 2024 further strengthened OmniRetail's strategy. Traction provides full-stack payment capabilities, including POS terminals, PSSP and Super Agent licenses, and access to retailer-level sales data. 

For OmniRetail, the purchase allows it to gain a complete financial profile of each retailer, giving it even greater control over the supply chain and the ability to offer tailored financial solutions.

“Every transaction in the FMCG value chain has two sides: the movement of goods and the movement of funds,” said Rustagi. “Today, we are in a position to aggregate maximum benefits from every transaction in the value chain. Our plan is to dive deep into the value chain and maximize margins. International players have done well in their markets, and we're bringing that model to Nigeria today.”

While it no longer publicly discloses GMV figures, shifting away from the metric that has long been a key performance indicator in the sector,  it reports a 35% increase in net merchandise volume (NMV) and a 40% bump in revenue over the past year, all while maintaining profitability despite its expansion.

 Some of our next moves are laser-focused: a solid debt raise for inventory finance, strategic acquisitions, and a relentless profitable growth.”

With $20 million in fresh capital, OmniRetail plans to continue growing its retailer base and expand into new product categories like personal care, home care, and cold storage. 

The capital will also upgrade its infrastructure, enhance its credit underwriting tools, and strengthen partnerships with domestic debt providers. As such, some of its next moves include a debt raise for inventory finance and strategic acquisitions, according to Bagaria.

For Norfund, OmniRetail represents more than just a fintech or commerce bet; it's infrastructure.

“Embedded finance is one of the most transformative tools for small business growth in Africa,” said Norfund Investor Director Cathrine Conradi. “OmniRetail's model brings capital to areas where traditional systems haven't reached.” 

Meanwhile, Timon Capital, which backed OmniRetail from its seed stage, sees this as a breakout moment for the company.

“OmniRetail has now hit an inflection point in distribution, payments, and credit, showing just how much profitable growth they can generate with their expanding footprint,” the firm said.

Firstly, there's no account for correlation between the features identified. The article mentions VINs which have several single-vehicle accidents, for example, but  someone who has one single-vehicle accident is probably more likely to have another. Switching coverage is another of those potentially-correlated features; if you claim and it bumps your premium, aren't you likely to shop around as a result?Secondly, there's no attempt to account for the law of large numbers. It's incredibly unlikely that someone has three single vehicle accidents in a year, but because the probability of that is nonzero, we know that with enough vehicles on the road then someone is going to do it.The article covers itself by acknowledging this, of course, but if you title your blog post ""We Found Insurance Fraud in Our Crash Data"" then you should actually do that.

But the point being, I really don't have evidence one way or the other. Implying insurance fraud is saying you think a criminal act occurred, and when you say something like that the burden should be on you to provide some evidence to that effect.Random internet commenters bullshit all the time. But this blog post provides specific data and an unambiguous conclusion that fraud occurred (the title does not hedge, it is ""We Found Insurance Fraud in Our Crash Data""), so if you do something like that you need to provide evidence for it. I appreciate the parent commenter for pointing out that, despite all of their data, they didn't really provide much evidence for their conclusion.

There are cams that can do a rear view as well from inside the cab, which likely provides enough evidence if you're rear ended.I only opted for a forward facing dash cam.In my state, you are 100% at fault for rear ending someone unless you can prove your innocence -- which a dashcam can do assuming the person in front does something shady (like lane change + intentionally slam breaks).However, do note that dash cams are not going to magically make rear ending the person in front of you somehow that person's fault. Virtually no one seems to leave enough follow distance by default because doing so means someone merged into the space.. and a dash cam doesn't shift the blame for simple rear endings unless it can prove some kind of malice or inattentiveness on the other driver (but even then, inattentiveness of the other driver is not necessarily a legal defense for you not leaving enough room to react.. perhaps if they stopped faster than a car could be expected to break, e.g. hit a concrete wall....) -- of course, laws vary by state

Installation was easy - glue a thing to the windshield & rear windshield, & run the wires to the cigarette lighter USB adapter (which was also included). It was a bit of a pain to tuck the wires into the trim around the doors, but overall, not bad.But yes, it would have been easier to have a dealership install one for me.

If someone backs into you, or slams on their breaks on the freeway without reason you can drive as defensively as you want and still get unlucky. People can cause ""accidents"" much more effectively than you can avoid one. Careful motorcyclists know that watching the behavior of all the people around them is critical to survival, but they still get into collisions.If you do try to drive so ""defensively"" that you can never get into an accident another person tries to cause, then you end up with 7-10 car lengths of separation, and people will regularly cut you off increasing risks. Please don't be that guy stopped 70ft back from the traffic light and stopping on on-ramps.

I was in the left lane, stopped, signaling to make a left turn, when someone rear ended me because they didn't notice me.I was stopped at a red light. The octogenarian behind me revved his engine, dropped into drive, and peeled out to rear end me a second time, because he “had places to be”. When I asked for his insurance, he drove off and I had to file a hit-and-run report with the police.Just saying, sometimes you can be minding your own business and get really unlucky.

Yes Fraud is tricky, but a VIN does not equal a person (PII) committing the behavior, and these poor association attempts leave innocent people screwed by insurance companies. What makes this bad analysis annoying, is the constant caveats, if you know VIN associations don't prove fraud then maybe don't build some sort of risk scoring on it, and then try an sell it.

1. Drink/drugs impair your judgment, making you more likely to commit fraud if you were on the fence, or the impulsive sort.2. Drunk drivers get into multiple accidents, but some are able to keep evidence of impairment off the record (buddy on the force or the insurance co, etc.)3. Drivers doing drugs that aren't detectable on the spot, and clear the body quickly, reducing evidence of drug use in crashes.4. More people are likely to do drink/drugs at night, so if 1-3 are true, we should expect to see more crashes at night. Likewise for a lack of witnesses (fewer passengers or bystanders).Most importantly, statistics are completely absent from the article. Does OP have any evidence these numbers wouldn't fit the correct random distribution? I know the point of fraud is to appear natural, but if done well, that means evidence has to be collected by other means, and this kind of analysis is only a weak signal.

Yeah. I'm not a fraud expert, but ""impaired judgement"" is a common effect of alcohol, and ""desperation"" is a common effect of drug addiction, so it seems weird to assume that people using drugs are committing fraud at a lower rate than the overall population rate.As a side note, I grew up in Norwich so it's funny to see it mentioned in that report as ""remote"" because there isn't really anything remote in Norwich. Wilderness Rd, despite its name, does a ring around Mohegan Park, which is an urban-ish park with some trees and a rose garden. You can walk to the rose garden from the high school, which I sometimes did. Anyway.

They're outraged by Trump's tariffs and reaching out directly to US consumers.

Since the video was posted earlier this month, millions of TikTok users have watched as a young Chinese man in a blue T-shirt sits beside a traditional tea set and speaks directly to the camera in accented English: “Let's expose luxury's biggest secret.” 

He stands and lifts what looks like an Hermès Birkin bag, one of the world's most exclusive and expensive handbags, before gesturing toward the shelves filled with more bags behind him. “You recognize them: Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci—all crafted in our workshops.”

“But brands erase ‘Made in China' from the tags,” he continues. “Same leather from their tanneries, same hardware from their suppliers, same threads they call luxury. Master artisans they never credit. We earn pennies; they make millions. That is unfair—to us, to you, to anyone who values honesty.” 

He ends by urging viewers to buy directly from his factory.

Video “exposés” like this—where a sales agent breaks down the material cost of luxury goods, from handbags to perfumes to appliances—are everywhere on TikTok right now. 

Some videos claim, for example, that a pair of Lululemon leggings costs just $4 to make. Others show the scale and precision of Chinese manufacturing: Creators walk through spotless factory floors, passing automated assembly lines and teams of workers at clean, orderly stations. Some factories identify themselves as suppliers—or former suppliers—for brands like Dyson, Under Armour, and Victoria's Secret.

Whether or not their claims are true, these videos and their virality speak to a new, serious push by Chinese manufacturers to connect directly with American consumers. Even with tariffs, many of the products pitched in the videos would still be significantly cheaper than buying from the name brands. (MIT Technology Review did not verify the claims made in the videos about where products are produced and how much the manufacturing costs; Lululemon, Hermès, Kering (the owner of Gucci), and LVMH (the owner of Louis Vuitton) did not reply to requests for comment.)

Fueled by fears of losing international business and frustration over Trump-era tariffs, factories are turning their production lines into content studios to market themselves—filming leather workshops and sewing lines, offering warehouse tours. What began as the work of a few frustrated sourcing agents has morphed into a full-blown genre that's part protest, part marketing plan, part survival strategy.

It's “a collective search for a workaround” to the tariffs, says Ivy Yang, an e-commerce expert and founder of the New York–based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy. “Smaller platforms and sourcing agents are jumping in, offering ‘direct from factory' content on social media as an alternative supply route.”

The Chinese creators sharing insights into sourcing materials and manufacturing techniques often offer direct purchasing options that effectively bypass traditional retail channels. 

The companies that sell directly to consumers include DHgate, a Chinese B2B e-commerce platform, which users commonly refer to as “the gate” or “the yellow app.” In the US Apple app store, the app jumped from #302 on April 8 to #2 overall in mid-April, just behind ChatGPT. On April 15, it was the most downloaded app in the country. As of April 18, DHgate sat at the top of Apple's shopping charts in 98 countries. 

They won't bring back manufacturing, and they could stunt our ability to make tomorrow's breakthroughs.

After buying on DHgate, users enthusiastically return to TikTok to share their new purchases; one user jokingly bragged, “Ordered my bag from my Chinese plug.”

DHGate told MIT Technology Review that the social media attention has resulted in a surge in transactions on the platform, with categories like home goods, electronics, outdoor gear, and pet supplies seeing the most popularity. During the week of April 12 to 19, home appliances saw a 962% increase in sales, while security tech jumped 601%.

TikTok is indeed not a vanity project for these manufacturers but a survival strategy in an increasingly competitive environment. 

Chinese factories have long sold to overseas markets, but when domestic economic growth started to slow in the past decade, manufacturers increasingly turned to major B2B platforms like Alibaba to connect with buyers abroad without relying on middlemen. In the past few years, however, the cost of gaining visibility to foreign buyers on major platforms like Amazon and Alibaba has skyrocketed. 

“It has become a crowded, saturated space, and it could cost 30,000 to 40,000 RMB [$210,000 to $290,000] a year just to get your factory to show up on the first page in search results,” says Logan Wang, an e-commerce manager at Shendeng Consulting, who advises Chinese manufacturers on overseas operations.

The landscape only got more fraught as traditional manufacturing sectors struggled with oversupply and post-covid stagnation. In 2024, China's apparel exports to the US grew by less than 1%, while the average unit price of those goods dropped by 7.6%—a sign that competition is fiercer and profit margins are shrinking. 

Add the new tariffs to this mix and Chinese manufacturers are increasingly motivated to find creative ways to reach buyers.

Linda Luo, a manager at a Guangzhou-based apparel factory, says that in the wake of the latest round of sanctions, her factory has paused US shipments, which previously accounted for around 30% of their sales. Now, storage rooms are filling up with products that have no clear destination. 

“Many nearby factories are like us,” Luo says, “holding out to see how these tariffs develop, hoping the situation will resolve itself.” Motivated by the success of peers who've gone viral, Luo says, her team is now actively reaching out to TikTok-famous sourcing agents, hoping to forge direct connections with new buyers.

But it's not just economic conditions pushing the viral videos; there's also a feeling that Chinese work and craftsmanship are being disrespected. In a Fox News interview on April 3, for instance, Vice President JD Vance made a comment denigrating the “Chinese peasants” who make products for Americans. The remark drew sharp criticism from Chinese officials and from Chinese people across the internet, who viewed it as insulting. 

“Chinese manufacturers have done the dirtiest, most arduous work for Western brands since the 1980s—often with razor-thin margins,” says Wang. “And yet they're constantly stigmatized, pushed around, and caught in the crossfire of geopolitics. Hearing President Trump frame the past few decades as China taking advantage of the US—that's a narrative that doesn't sit right with anyone working in this industry.”

Beyond rage and anxiety, Chinese factories have been inspired by the past viral success of manufacturing content on TikTok, according to Tianyu Fang, a technology and democracy fellow at the think tank New America who studies Chinese technology and globalization. Since 2020, factory videos showing assembly lines producing everyday items like wigs, dolls, and gloves have amassed millions of views. In comments, viewers describe these looping production videos as “soothing” and “mesmerizing.” 

By 2022, factories themselves recognized their work floors as content gold mines. But Alice Gu, who works at a Shenzhen-based digital marketing company and helps factories build their TikTok presence, has seen client inquiries triple over the past year, with many now featuring English-speaking staff as on-camera personalities.

As Fang explains, “These videos resonate with young people in the West on TikTok because manufacturing is so removed from their daily experience. They offer rare glimpses into advanced manufacturing while satisfying genuine curiosity.”

He adds: “Seeing Chinese factory workers address Western audiences directly feels almost subversive.”

The cultural gap between creators and audiences has become an asset rather than a liability, generating authentic moments that resonate with users who are hyper-online. 

One creator, Tony, toggles between American accents while promoting light boxes; he has gained over 1.2 million Instagram followers as the face of LC Sign, a Guangzhou electrical signage company. The “alumununu lady,” a saleswoman with a distinctive accent promoting capsule homes by Etong, turned “Hello, boss” into a catchphrase adopted by countless factory videos. In 2024, Dong Hua Jin Long, an industrial glycine manufacturer, went viral for machine-translated promotional videos boasting unmatched production quality. TikTok users found humor in the niche company's efforts to connect with potential customers, making it a widely circulated meme.

“These videos appeal largely because they're so wonderfully out of context,” Fang says. “The popularity of these sourcing videos reflects a desire to understand previously hidden parts of the global economy and find alternatives to mainstream political narratives.”

Despite the trend, experts including Yang and Fang don't believe large numbers of average American consumers will shift to buying directly from factories, as the process involves too many logistical hurdles. There's also been plenty of news coverage warning that you may not end up getting an all-but-equal-to-Hermès bag without the brand label. 

Chinese apps are dominating US app stores right now, but they could get caught in still-expanding efforts to ban TikTok.

Yaling Jiang, writer of the newsletter Following the Yuan, explains that buying through factory back channels is a common practice in China: “It's an open secret that many local factories produce for prestigious brands, and people often buy through side channels to get similar-quality products at a fraction of the price.” However, Jiang suggests that these arrangements rely on a complex supply and distribution system—and warns that some TikTok sourcing agents may be falsely claiming connections to well-known companies.

On top of all this, these direct-to-consumer videos may not even be available much longer. Yang warns that a lot of the content treads dangerously close to copyright infringement. “This will quickly become an IP minefield for platforms like TikTok and Instagram,” she says. “If the trend continues to grow, rights holders will push back—and platform governance will need to catch up fast.”

MIT Technology Review found that many of the original viral videos promoting knockoff products have already been removed from TikTok. DHgate did not respond to a request for comment regarding whether it facilitates the sale of counterfeit products.

Nevertheless, many Chinese factories will almost certainly continue to build out their own R&D teams—and not just to weather the current moment. “Every factory owner's dream is to have their own brand,” Wang says. “After decades of making products designed elsewhere, Chinese manufacturers are ready to create, not just produce.” 

Human “bodyoids” could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.

A classic springtime storm setup could unleash dangerous weather across the Upper Midwest today, including damaging tornadoes, large hail, and strong winds, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

The SPC has issued a Moderate Risk—its second-highest threat level—for parts of southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin. Thunderstorms are expected to fire up in the late afternoon and continue into the evening, bringing with them all the ingredients for a regional severe weather outbreak.

“The most dangerous period is likely during the late afternoon and evening,” the SPC warned in its latest forecast, “when strong tornado potential should be maximized.” Warm, moist air is surging northward ahead of a sharp dryline—the boundary between moist and drier area along which storms form.

An incoming jet streak—fast winds high in the atmosphere—will supercharge developing storms. The greatest risk for severe storms is in the Upper Midwest, but by the mid-afternoon thunderstorms may break out as far south as Texas. However, the only area with a moderate risk is a 56,152-square-mile (145,433 square kilometer) area comprising the Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin border, an area populated by about 5.6 million people.

The greatest threats from the system are supercells capable of producing intense tornadoes, large hail (think golf balls and bigger), and damaging gusts of wind.

The threat isn't just confined to the Midwest. Farther south, from central Oklahoma into parts of Texas, another round of supercells could form along the dryline. These storms will also carry a risk of large hail, particularly in the evening hours, the NWS bulletin stated.

If you're in the affected area—especially where the worst weather is expected—keep track of updates from your local National Weather Service station. This is the kind of day where conditions can change fast—it costs nothing to be prepared, and its value can be priceless.

When all smartphones are huge slabs that look like iPhones, tech companies really need to go hard with eye-catching designs. Carl Pei's Nothing has been turning heads with its transparent phones and wireless earbuds since 2021, and last year the company's sub-brand, CMF, surprised everyone with its unapologetically plastic and modular Phone 1.

The fact that I can't remember a damn thing about the Phone 1's tech specs but vividly recall how fun it was to unscrew the back plate to install a card case, kickstand, and neck lanyard should tell you what CMF prioritized for the budget phone.

Nearly a year later, CMF is back with the Phone 2 Pro. I've only had the device for a weekend, so not enough time for a full review, but you can expect it on Gizmodo in the coming days. CMF beefed up the specs—a slightly faster processor, higher-resolution cameras including telephoto and ultra-wide lenses, more battery life— and even added the physical Essential button for accessing what's basically an AI memory that was introduced on the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro. But I feel like the Phone 2 Pro has lost some of the modular charm that made the Phone 1 so memorable.

The first thing I did after unboxing the Phone 2 Pro was see which of CMF's official Phone 1 accessories worked. Both the kickstand and the neck lanyard screwed into the Phone 2 Pro's round wheel without issue. However, the card case wallet, which requires attaching a special magnetic plate that also secures into the round wheel, didn't. And because the Phone 2 Pro's back is sealed and no longer removable, any Phone 1 back plate “cases” aren't compatible, either. 

If you own extra Phone 1 back plates or the card case wallet, you're shit out of luck. It's not completely bad news… if you own a 3D printer. Thanks to CMF retaining the four easily removable screws, you can still design and 3D print your own accessories or buy them from makers off marketplaces like Etsy. I wouldn't be surprised if the flourishing DIY community is why CMF is breaking compatibility with some Phone 1 accessories so soon.

The Phone 2 Pro is a decent-looking phone that feels solid—refreshingly lightweight (185g) and thin (7.8mm) compared to other phones with a similar-sized display. The screen is more than bright enough, and Nothing OS 3.2 (Android 15) is responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. 

Nothing sent me the light green that you see in these photos. It has a satin-like sheen when viewed at different angles. But the phone also comes in white, black, and orange. The latter has a two-tone design that looks the best of the lot, in my opinion. 

As I mentioned earlier, the Phone 2 Pro is more powerful under the hood—it's just all very incremental. The display is a slightly larger 6.77-inch AMOLED versus the Phone 1's 6.6-inch screen, the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G chip is 10% more powerful, and even though the battery capacity is the same 5,000mAh, CMF says it should last an extra hour.

The most noteworthy upgrade is the rear cameras. Whereas the Phone 1 had a single 50-megapixel main camera (and a controversial and mostly useless 2-megapixel “depth camera”), the Phone 2 Pro has a proper no-bullshit triple-lens camera system consisting of a 50-megapixel f/1.88 main lens, a 50-megapixel f/1.85 telephoto lens, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens. Photo and video quality will have to wait until I can snap enough photos to make an evaluation, but at the very least, you can get more zoom reach and a wider field of view in your shots.

I admit I wasn't expecting to find the Essential key below the right-side power button. I thought Nothing would gatekeep it for its more expensive phones, but perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised, since Nothing plans to charge a subscription to use the AI feature in the near future. Gotta get the button onto as many phones as possible if you wanna turn it into a subscription business!

Currently, the button works exactly like it does on the mid-range Nothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro devices. Press it once to take a screenshot, to which you can then add a text note or attach a voice recording for additional context. Press and hold the Essential key, and you're taken to the Essential Space, where all your screenshots live, but also where generative AI organizes and helps make sense of all those captures. The AI might offer a summary of text or describe photos, create calendar events or reminders, transcribe voice memos, or make task suggestions. It's a nifty idea for a “second brain” or “memory recall” function where you can just dump everything into the Essential Space and let AI sort it all out, but its usefulness is pretty limited right now. There isn't even a way to search your screenshots (yet).

For a budget phone, the CMF Phone 2 Pro packs in a lot while still keeping some modularity. Nothing's primarily targeting India and Europe with this phone: £219 in the UK, €249 in Europe, and ₹18,999 for 8GB of RAM + 128GB of storage. A Phone 2 Pro with the same RAM and twice the storage (256GB) will go for £249 in the UK, €279 in Europe, and ₹20,999 in India. Like always, U.S. consumers can get the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage model—the only variant shipping to America—through Nothing's Beta program for $279.

CMF is also selling several official Phone 2 Pro accessories, and for some reason, exclusively and in limited quantities in the UK and Europe. There's a “universal cover” for attaching other accessories (£25 / €25), interchangeable fisheye and macro lenses (£35 / €35), and a wallet/stand ( £35 / €35). There will also be two bundles: one with a cover and choice of wallet/stand or lenses for £45 / €45, and another with a cover and both the wallet/stand and lenses for £65 / €65. You'll have to convert the currency yourself if you plan to import them, since they won't be available in the U.S. or India. I've not tried any of these accessories, so your guess is as good as mine as to how good they are. Pre-orders start today, April 28, and official sales directly from Nothing and select retailers on May 6.

Body mass index might be a more accurate measurement than commonly thought. New research shows that a vast majority of people with a BMI signifying obesity have substantial excess body fat.

Scientists at Johns Hopkins University conducted the study, published this month in JAMA. In a nationally representative sample of Americans, they found that adults with an obese BMI almost always met the criteria for obesity in terms of waist circumstance or body fat percentage, too. The findings suggest that BMI remains an important population-level tool for assessing obesity, the researchers say, even as many people are trying to phase it out.

The researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey of Americans' dieting and lifestyle habits regularly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As part of the NHANES, some people are given more extensive examinations, which include tests measuring their body fat or waist circumstance.

The researchers looked at the most recent NHANES data (2017-2018) that included people who received these other tests in addition to having their BMI checked. Obesity is typically defined as having a BMI 30 and over (27 for people of Asian descent). But it can also be defined by having a body fat percentage of 25% for men and 35% for women, or a waist circumstance of 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women.

More than 98% of people who were considered obese using BMI alone also fit the bill when either waist circumstance or body fat percentage were taken into account, the researchers found.

“Although certain patient populations (eg, athletes) may warrant further evaluation, our results suggest that these individuals make up a very small portion of the population,” the researchers wrote.

Say Bye to Just BMI: Experts Call for a Major Shift in How We Measure Obesity

The findings are especially relevant given recent developments in the field of obesity medicine. Earlier this January, a large group of experts called for a sizable shift in how obesity is diagnosed.

They've pushed for doctors to stop using BMI as the sole criteria for measuring obesity. Instead, they say, doctors should either use two measurements of body size (one of which can include BMI) or a direct measurement of body fat to diagnose obesity. They further called for obesity to be grouped into two broad categories, depending on whether a person's obesity is actively causing related health problems: preclinical and clinical obesity.

Other researchers and advocates in the body positivity and fat acceptance movement have long called for BMI to be phased out, and the group's conclusions were strongly backed by many public health groups, including the American Heart Association and World Obesity Federation.

The study researchers note, however, that direct body fat tests require specialized equipment and could be more expensive for patients in terms of out-of-pocket costs, and given their findings, many people might not benefit from undergoing these other tests. Either way, it seems likely that the scientific debate over the usefulness of BMI isn't quite settled yet.

“For nearly all U.S. adults with elevated BMI, there may be limited utility to confirming excess adiposity,” the authors wrote. Currently, under the current BMI criteria, around 40% of adults in the U.S. are considered obese, though the rate may be starting to finally decline, thanks in part to the arrival of newer, more effective weight loss medications like Wegovy.

Nicholas Galitzine confirms Masters of the Universe will be “quite different” from the source material. “Trauma” is the watchword for both Thunderbolts* and Andor. And Ruby Sunday returns to Doctor Who! Take your wins where you can get 'em, folks—Morning Spoilers, ho!

Netflix has announced it will release Brick, a sci-fi thriller starring Matthias Schweighöfer and Ruby O. Fee this July 10. Directed by Philip Koch, the story concerns a couple who “awake trapped in their apartment behind an impenetrable, futuristic wall which has materialized overnight…and they are not alone. The entire building and its residents seem to be enclosed. What happened? Who built that wall and why? Without any chance of outside help, they must band together to find a way out. Can they solve the mystery of the wall in time — and survive?”

[Bloody-Disgusting]

Variety also has word Simona Tabasco (The White Lotus) will star alongside Alan Ruck, Ashton Sanders, and Rosanna Arquette in Corporate Retreat, a horror-thriller from director Aaron Fisher, in which “a team-building getaway spirals into a violent struggle for survival when their retreat leader reveals a deadly agenda.”

According to insider Jeff Sneider (via AVP Galaxy), a Predator will feature in Fede Alvarez's sequel to Alien: Romulus.

During a recent interview with Screen Rant, Thunderbolts* director Jake Schreier stated “there's a lot of trauma to be mined” amongst its team roster.

I think it more just came from the endemic story that we had to tell. When you have Sentry and the Void – and people have said it online, “How are they supposed to beat that guy?” – we know it's always going to have to be a more internal version. I think what we tried to do is have that be more than a talking-down, and really find a visual action narrative way to dramatize what that internality looks like. And I hope it resonates.

The good thing is, in this world, there's a lot of trauma to be mined. They've gone through a lot. When you have a character like Bob, The Sentry and The Void, you know that's part of the story, and that's such a rich character. We talked to Paul Jenkins, who created it, and it always was meant to be a parable for mental health.

So, we have to do something that plays in that world if we're going to be honest about who that character is. And then it becomes about, “How do we tie the arcs of the other characters to be such that they fit with that antagonist?”

Speaking with Variety, Gary Dauberman stated he's “hoping” the live-action Gargoyles series at Disney feels “very similar” to the original animated one.

Oh, yes, another beloved piece of IP. This new iteration of Gargoyles…The show was already pretty dark in that it was serialized, it was a mature thing, it's operatic and the story was so epic. I'm hoping it's very similar to the vibe that you got when you were watching it back in the late '90s. I just loved that half hour of television, falling into their world. I'm hoping we achieve that. It's a lot of fun, though — it's a thrill.

Speaking with TV Line, Adria Arjona suggested Bix Calleen's “accumulation of traumas” are somewhat lessened by her doomed relationship with Cassian Andor.

There is a lot for Bix to get over. It's not easy to get over what Dr. Gorst did to her, and having to leave her motherland, Ferrix. And in Episodes 1 through 3 [of Season 2], she goes through even more stuff. It's an accumulation of traumas that Bix is carrying, and she is trying desperately to get over them. She's creating this beautiful relationship with Cassian, and relying on someone is something she is experiencing for the first time.

The use of 3GB GDDR7 memory could help Nvidia add more VRAM to its GPUs.

It has only been a few months since Nvidia officially announced its RTX 50-series graphics cards, but rumors are already pointing to a potential Super series refresh. According to a post on the Chiphell forums, a hit-and-miss source for hardware leaks, Nvidia might already be working on an RTX 5080 Super with 24GB and an RTX 5070 Super with 16GB of VRAM.

The key enabler behind these rumored memory configurations is said to be Nvidia's use of 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. These modules essentially allow for more flexible VRAM amounts than the traditional 8GB or 16GB increments. By leveraging 3GB chips, Nvidia can gain the ability to offer configurations like 18GB (6×3GB) and 24GB (8×3GB) VRAM for its desktop class GPUs without making any major PCB redesigns.

This can also help Nvidia make refreshes or upgraded versions (like the aforementioned Super variants) easier to deliver without changing much hardware or firmware. With the higher amount of VRAM, these graphics cards will potentially have the ability to handle larger textures at higher resolutions, and more complex scenes with fewer performance drops.

Before this raises any expectations, it's important to note that there's currently no official confirmation from Nvidia, and these rumors should be treated as entertaining speculation. Given how early it is in the RTX 50-series lifecycle, a refresh at this moment seems unusual, but is not entirely out of the question.

Prior to the launch of the RTX 50-series, there were similar reports around Nvidia's plans to use 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. It was also speculated that the RTX 5080 would arrive in a special 24GB VRAM flavor. However, the company ended up using conventional 2GB memory chips, possibly due to higher costs. Notably, these 3GB modules are being used for Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPUs, as well as the laptop variant of the RTX 5090 which comes with 24GB of VRAM with a 256-bit memory interface.

While the discussion around these models is still at a very preliminary stage, it is possible that Nvidia is experimenting internally or possibly working on contingency plans. Although, we don't expect Nvidia to bring a Super refresh for the RTX 50-series as soon as Computex 2025, for example, they would more likely arrive late in 2025 or even for CES 2026.

For now, though, it would be best to view the RTX 5080 Super and RTX 5070 Super as interesting possibilities rather than inevitable products. We'll be watching closely for any reliable updates or official hints from Nvidia in the coming months.

Intel is likely finalizing software support for Panther Lake. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An update by Intel to the perfmon platform has added support for upcoming Panther Lake CPUs, listing their core architecture codenames and CPUID, via InstLatX64. This commit unofficially confirms that Panther Lake will employ Cougar Cove Performance (P) cores, while Darkmont will serve to power its Efficiency (E), and likely Low Power Efficiency (LPE) cores as well. Panther Lake is expected to launch later this year, succeeding current-generation Arrow Lake U/H offerings.

With Intel's flagship 18A in risk production, Panther Lake is scheduled for mass production later this year. Hence, it wouldn't be surprising if the bulk of Panther Lake arrives in Q1 next year, similar to how Meteor Lake rolled out. Make no mistake: Panther Lake isn't a successor to Lunar Lake, which was uniquely focused on efficiency as a one-off product, with on-package memory, limited TDP, and a power-optimized design. Current rumors indicate Panther Lake variants will sport up to 18 hybrid cores (6P+8E+4LPE) and 12 Xe cores, based on Intel's upcoming Celestial (Xe3) graphics architecture.

Intel positions Panther Lake as combining Arrow Lake's power and Lunar Lake's efficiency, but that's still a somewhat general claim. According to leaks, most Panther Lake systems will include traditional SODIMM/soldered memory, while some laptop designs might even support next-gen LPCAMM, combining fast and upgradeable RAM. Based on their TDP (rumored: up to 64W), Panther Lake chips are expected to power a wide range of devices, including entry-level laptops, handhelds, and gaming laptops. The company is even eying bringing this architecture to automobiles.

An Intel engineer has pushed an update to the lookup table for perfmon, adding Panther Lake as a supported architecture. Panther Lake has been marked with the ""GenuineIntel-6-CC"" identifier, assigning it to CPU Family 6, Model 204 (0xCC). In addition, the patch reports the Cougar Cove and Darkmont architectures for Panther Lake's Performance (P) and Efficiency (E) cores, respectively.

#Intel perfmon: #PTL=CougarCove+DarkmontCPUID.1Ah.EAX =20000000 #Tremont20000001 #Gracemont20000002 #Crestmont20000003 #Skymont20000004 #Darkmont40000000 #SunnyCove40000001 #GoldenCove40000002 #RedwoodCove40000003 #LionCove40000004 #CougarCovehttps://t.co/adntAfZRm5 https://t.co/1in8Rvleue pic.twitter.com/bWZyYtZcViApril 27, 2025

Intel's speculated P-core evolution goes from Lion Cove (ARL/LNL) to Cougar Cove (PTL/WCL), and then Coyote Cove (NVL). Likewise, the rumored E-core path is Skymont (ARL/LNL) to Darkmont (PTL/WCL) and Arctic Wolf (NVL). Once again, these are based on preliminary assumptions and a compilation of several leaks, so take them with a heavy dose of skepticism.

Essentially, we're seeing a full architectural jump and shift to a leading-edge node, which should yield substantial performance gains. I'm curious to see how much Panther Lake laptops will cost compared to Lunar Lake, which was entirely manufactured by TSMC. With Computex just weeks away, we expect Intel to share finer architectural details at the show.

 April 28, 2025  

INCHEON, South Korea — The diabetes drug metformin may reduce the pain of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients with overweight or obese, independent of weight loss, according to results from a randomized placebo-controlled study presented at the World Congress on Osteoarthritis (OARSI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The double-blind trial, which was simultaneously published on April 24, 2025, in JAMA, involved 107 patients with symptomatic radiologic knee OA and a body mass index > 25, who were randomly assigned to receive either 2000 mg/d metformin or a placebo for 6 months.

This treatment was associated with a mean change in the visual analog scale for pain of −31.3 mm in the treatment group compared with −18.9 mm in the placebo group at 6 months, which represented a significant adjusted between-group difference of −11.4 mm (P = .01).

While this did not achieve the minimum clinically important difference of 15 mm, Flavia Cicuttini, MD, a rheumatologist at the Alfred Hospital and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and researcher on the study, described the metformin's effect size of 0.43 as moderate.

The study also found significant differences in favor of metformin in the secondary outcomes of improvements in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores for pain (−113.9 with metformin vs −68.2 with placebo), stiffness (−56.9 vs −26.7), and function (−426.1 vs −221.7). These analyses used imputed data to address missing primary and secondary outcomes for the 18% of patients in the trial who were lost to follow-up and did not provide data at 6 months.

“I think this provides a different approach that has the potential to slow this rapid move towards knee replacements for early OA,” Cicuttini said.

An earlier systematic review, which Cicuttini co-authored, found consistent preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting metformin had chondroprotective, immunomodulatory, and pain-reducing effects in knee OA.

“Metformin has a whole lot of different actions or benefits on joint cartilage, on low-grade inflammation, on the metabolism,” Cicuttini commented to Medscape Medical News. “What's also attractive about metformin is it doesn't cause hypoglycemia; you can use it in normal healthy people, you don't have to monitor their blood sugar.”

There was some weight loss in both groups (mean change, −1.8 kg in the metformin group and −1.2 kg in the placebo group), but Cicuttini said the impact on OA symptoms was independent of weight loss.

Some patients experienced adverse events, with 15% of the metformin group reporting diarrhea compared with 8% of the placebo group, but there were high levels of adherence to the medication.

Rheumatologist Anita Wluka, MBBS, PhD, of the Alfred Hospital and Monash University — who was also a co-author on the study — said to Medscape Medical News that “metformin ticks all the metabolic boxes, and it's cheap as chips.”

Commenting on the findings, physiotherapist Brooke Patterson, PhD, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said there are numerous trials looking for medications to help with OA, but it is challenging to find effects because of the nature of the disease.

“You've got all these different subgroups within the 50 participants that are getting the intervention, but only a small proportion of those might respond to one treatment,” she said. “I would just recommend that people with OA talk to not only their doctor but a range of health professionals or get their doctor to try and understand potentially what are some of their risk factors” and their OA disease phenotype.

The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. Cicuttini reported receiving funding from the NHMRC Investigator Grant and being on the advisory board of Magellan Stem Cells. Patterson and Wluka had no relevant conflicts of interest.

 April 28, 2025  

The diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be tricky, especially in the absence of known triggers and when other conditions, such as urticaria and asthma, mimic aspects of the reaction. Biomarkers can help to identify this deadly condition promptly. But only histamine and tryptase have been extensively studied.

Tryptase is the most frequently used biomarker for diagnosing anaphylaxis, but it is not the most reliable in minimizing false-positive or negative results. A more accurate approach to using tryptase requires clinicians to have the patient's baseline level on hand, according to a new systematic review published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

“There are so many other biomarkers that could maybe help us diagnose anaphylaxis with better accuracy,” said Roy Khalaf, MD, a resident in the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and a lead author of the study.

Khalaf and his colleagues analyzed 28 studies published over a 20-year period starting in 2004 on biomarkers of anaphylaxis, with a sample of more than 18,000 patients, 3329 of whom had confirmed anaphylaxis. While tryptase was the most studied biomarker, its ability to correctly identify patients who have the disease, or sensitivity, was suboptimal at 0.49. However, its specificity, or ability to identify those who did not have the disease, was 0.82. When a baseline level of tryptase was compared with a level drawn during anaphylaxis, the sensitivity improved to 0.78. Many patients do not have their baseline levels unless they have seen an allergist.

One study indicated that combining histamine with tryptase boosted the sensitivity to 0.93. Histamine alone showed higher sensitivity (0.76) but lower specificity (0.69). The use of histamine is also limited by its short half-life of about 15 minutes.

One study in the review of a rarely used biomarker, platelet-activating factor (PAF), showed great promise (sensitivity, 100%), but Khalaf said more data are needed before the test can be used clinically. Limited data on PAF acetylhydrolase and urinary prostaglandin D2 were available.

Urinary prostaglandin D2 has shown promise, but “there may be practical challenges in obtaining urine samples from patients experiencing life-threatening reactions,” Khalaf and his colleagues wrote.

Inflammatory chemicals like tryptase and prostaglandins are triggered by a reaction caused by allergens or environmental factors like exercise. These mediators can cause vasodilation, smooth muscle contraction, and increased vascular permeability, resulting in bronchoconstriction, airway swelling, and death. If found early, anaphylaxis can be reversed with the use of epinephrine.

“If you already have a confirmed diagnosis of anaphylaxis, you can anticipate the next reaction and act appropriately,” Khalaf told Medscape Medical News.

Establishing a definitive diagnosis is instrumental to preventing another occurrence. Khalaf said he hopes more clinicians, especially in emergency settings, will test for biomarkers to confirm anaphylaxis, especially in diagnostically challenging situations or when a clinician is unfamiliar with the condition. Patients with anaphylaxis must be monitored for a few hours after the event to prevent a flare-up of the condition.

Patients with confirmed anaphylaxis should also receive a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector. Clinicians should also make a referral to an allergist to determine triggers, especially considering epinephrine auto-injectors can be costly, said Jason Caldwell, DO, an allergy and immunology specialist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina. Additionally, allergists routinely order biomarker tests.

While tryptase and histamine are readily available, the other biomarkers are largely only accessible in urban hospital settings, Caldwell said. Tryptase sensitivity is enhanced when a clinician knows baseline levels, but few patients have this information when they arrive at the emergency department. Primary care clinicians and pediatricians generally do not order these tests for patients with allergies who have not had the reaction.

With more comprehensive studies, researchers could establish protocols and improve patient outcomes, Khalaf said.

Clinicians also need new biomarkers because those currently available do not cover every trigger, Caldwell said.

“We are still not capturing all anaphylactic cases with the biomarkers we currently use,” he said.

The authors of the review reported no relevant financial disclosures.

 April 28, 2025  

Optimized medical therapy (OMT) is as effective as surgery for carotid revascularization in reducing stroke risk in the majority of patients with carotid artery stenosis, results of a planned interim 2-year analysis showed.

Using a recalibrated model to estimate stroke risk — the carotid artery risk (CAR) score — investigators determined that as many as 75% of patients currently receiving carotid endarterectomy (CEA) could instead be treated with OMT alone.

The CAR score model uses contemporary data on the risk for recurrent stroke in patients on OMT that reflects improvements in medical therapy and includes some characteristics not used in the original score.

“We recommend using the CAR score to identify patients with carotid narrowing that can be managed with optimized medical therapy alone,” study author Martin M. Brown, MD, emeritus professor of stroke medicine, University College London Queen Square Institute of Neurology, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

Investigators said the findings could lead to updated practice guidelines, although Brown stressed that further follow-up and additional trials are needed to confirm the new results.

The findings were published online on April 16, 2025, in The Lancet Neurology.

Current guidelines recommend CEA in selected patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50%-99% or asymptomatic stenosis of 60%-99%, Brown said.

But those recommendations were based on landmark trials carried out 30 years ago when medical therapy “was basically just aspirin,” said Brown. “Medical prevention of stroke has since improved dramatically.”

He estimates nonsurgical treatment today is about 80% better at preventing stroke than it was 30 or 40 years ago. “We reckoned these older trials were out of date and effectively needed to be redone,” he said.

Also, there was a need to revaluate the ability of the predictive risk model used in older trials — the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) model — to reliably identify low-risk patients for whom medical treatment alone might be appropriate.

The CAR score predicts the risk for stroke in patients with carotid stenosis treated with OMT. This involves using much more intensive and effective therapy not available 30 years ago when the original score was used, Brown said.

In addition to stenosis severity, the CAR score considers older age, male sex, history of myocardial infarction (MI), hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as symptoms of carotid territory ischemia and shorter time since symptom onset, among other risk factors.

The current 5-year Second European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-2) trial included 429 adult patients (median age, 72 years; 69% men) at 30 centers in Europe and Canada who had 50% or greater carotid stenosis. Symptomatic patients were required to have a predicted 5-year risk for stroke < 20% based on the CAR score.

The study also included patients with stenosis who had been asymptomatic for at least 180 days. They were assumed to have a low 5-year risk for stroke (≤ 5%) with OMT alone. About 40% of the study population were symptomatic and 60% asymptomatic.

Participants received OMT alone or OMT plus revascularization with CEA. OMT included a low cholesterol diet, target-adjusted cholesterol-lowering medication, antihypertensive medication according to blood pressure readings, and guideline-based antithrombotic therapy. Where applicable, patients were also encouraged to stop smoking, lose weight, and manage diabetes.

Follow-up visits were scheduled at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, and then annually. Brain MRI or CT was done at the time of randomization, before any revascularization procedure, and with follow-up imaging at 2 years.

The primary outcome for this 2-year interim analysis was a hierarchical composite of: Periprocedural death (within 90 days), fatal stroke, or fatal MI; nonfatal stroke; nonfatal MI; or new silent cerebral infarction on MRI or CT.

For the primary analysis, researchers used the win ratio method, which compares outcomes of random pairs of patients (one patient from OMT alone and one from OMT plus revascularization. The patient in the pair with the better outcome was deemed a “win.” If patients had similar outcomes, researchers recorded a “tie.” 

The win ratio was the number of wins with OMT alone divided by the number of wins with OMT plus CEA.

The win ratio is a better way of accounting not only for the severity of components of the composite endpoint but also the time to an event, Brown said.

“Using older methodology, if one person had a stroke after a week and another after 2 years, you'd say they both had a stroke,” he said. “But using the win ratio method, you'd say the patient of the pair who had the stroke later had the better outcome.”

He and others believed this method provides a more powerful way of analyzing the various primary outcome events than conventional noninferiority comparisons.

Complete 2-year follow-up data were available for 94% of participants (n = 404). The authors noted compliance to medical therapy was “remarkably high” for both groups.

The majority of pairs (77.3%) were recorded as a tie, meaning outcomes were similar regardless of treatment approach. Of the remaining pairs, the number of wins was similar between therapies, with 11.4% doing better with OMT alone vs 11.3% with OMT plus CEA (win ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.60-1.70; P = .97).

As for components of the primary outcome, the OMT alone group reported four periprocedural deaths, fatal stroke, or fatal MI; 11 nonfatal strokes; seven nonfatal MIs, and 12 new silent cerebral infarctions. The numbers for the OMT plus CEA group were three periprocedural deaths, fatal stroke, or fatal MI; 16 nonfatal strokes; five non-fatal MIs; and seven new silent cerebral infarctions.

Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary hierarchical composite looked at outcomes by symptomatic status, age, sex, CAR score, diabetes, hypertension, stenosis severity, contralateral stenosis or occlusion, and size of the medical center. These analyses found no significant group differences although the statistical power to detect potential differences in subgroups was low.

While the results suggest patients whose CAR score is < 20% can forego an operation, Brown believed additional risk factors can be added to the score — such as imaging of the carotid clot itself — to improve patient selection for OMT-only therapy.

Patients with higher risk for stroke — those with a CAR score over 20% — would still likely benefit from the surgical intervention, said Brown.

Discussions are underway with vascular surgeons about recommending OMT alone in low or intermediate risk patients with the aim of potentially updating relevant guidelines, “but we're not there yet,” study coauthor Paul J. Nederkoorn, MD, PhD, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, told Medscape Medical News.

An updated guideline would have a major impact in the stroke field, he noted. Treatment with OMT alone would also allow patients to avoid the risks for CEA, which include stroke, death, and wound infection and cranial nerve injury from the surgery.

In the Netherlands, about 2000 patients with carotid artery stenosis undergo revascularization. That figure is much higher in the United States because “a large number of patients there are operated on for asymptomatic stenosis,” said Brown. He estimated that more than 120,000 CEA or carotid artery stenting procedures are performed each year in the United States for asymptomatic stenosis.

“For the vast majority of these patients, in the Netherlands perhaps up to about 75%, medication alone is probably sufficient to reduce the risk of another stroke. It is a lot nicer for the patient not to have to have surgery and it saves a lot of healthcare costs,” Nederkoorn said in a press release.

The current study shows risks appear to plateau within the first 2 years, “suggesting that further follow-up might not favor revascularization,” the authors wrote, adding this needs to be verified.

That's why the study follow-up has continued. The 5-year results of ECST-2 have actually been collected but have not yet been analyzed, said Brown.

In the current analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic often caused follow-ups to limit the number of patients with brain imaging at the 2-year follow-up and led to follow-up visits being postponed or conducted by telephone rather than in person. Another limitation was the accuracy of the recalibrated CAR score hasn't been independently tested.

In an accompanying commentary, Jan K. Ho, MBBS, Perron Institute for Neurological and Translational Science, Perth, Australia, and Graeme J. Hankey, MD, also of the Perron Institute and the University of Western Australia Medical School, noted several strengths of this new trial, including the investigators' selection of patients according to their predicted risk for future stroke rather than only according to symptoms and degree of stenosis and the use of the win ratio.

But they also noted that the estimated win ratio of 1.01 is “imprecise” as reflected by its wide CI and the high proportion of ties between groups, due to the small number of outcome events.

“The estimated win ratio also incorporates the early perioperative risks of carotid revascularization without incorporating possible longer-term benefits of revascularization” beyond 2 years, they wrote.

Also weighing in, Steven Messe, MD, professor of neurology, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, called the study “an important contribution” to the literature, but also noted the relatively small study size, which reduced the power to rule out clinically meaningful effects. In addition, 60% of patients had an asymptomatic stenosis, who typically have a lower risk for stroke with medical therapy than those with symptomatic stenosis.

As well, study subjects with symptomatic stenosis were included based on a relatively low 5-year expected stroke risk, which may not apply to many patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis, said Messe.

But the most important limitation is that patients were only followed for 2 years, he noted.

“Prior studies of asymptomatic carotid stenosis demonstrated that it takes time, at least 3-5 years, for the benefit of long-term stroke prevention to outweigh the upfront risk of performing the revascularization,” Messe said.

This study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR); the Stroke Association; the Swiss National Science Foundation; the Dutch Organization for Knowledge and Innovation in Health, Healthcare and Well-being; and the Leeds Neurology Foundation. Brown reported receiving grant funding for ECST-2 from the NIHR, Stroke Association, and Leeds Neurology Foundation, and reported getting a receipt of fees for the Courts on Claimants with carotid artery disease. Nederkoorn reported receiving grant funding for ECST-2 and a Dutch cost-effectiveness substudy from the Dutch Organization for Knowledge and Innovation in Health, Healthcare, and Well-Being. Ho and Messe reported no relevant conflicts of interests.

A postmarketing study showed that the Optilume BPH system improved the flow of urine while leaving sexual function unchanged in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), researchers reported at the American Urological Association 2025 Annual Meeting.

Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2023, the Optilume BPH devices uses balloons to dilate the anterior commissure of the prostate, which connects the two lobes of the gland, and the roof of the prostatic urethra. A slow-release coating of paclitaxel on one of the balloons shrinks the prostatic tissue and prevents it from closing around the opening to enhance the enhanced flow of urine.

The new study, from 30 men participating in the SUMMIT study, provides encouraging 1-year data on the effectiveness of the approach, said Dean Elterman, MD, MSc, associate professor of urology at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who presented the findings.

“We saw all the things we expected to see in this type of study, such as a good improvement in their symptoms and improvement in their flow and emptying of their bladders,” Elterman told Medscape Medical News. 

The trial found sustained improvement in maximum urinary flow and postvoid volume of residual urine after treatment with the device: Maximum urinary flow increased from 7.9 mL/s at baseline to 16.4 mL/s at 12 months, and postvoid residual urine declined from a baseline of 77.5 to 68.1 mL at 12 months (P < .05).

Elterman said men reported significant improvements in quality of life a year after treatment, and none said they had experienced problems with erections or ejaculations as a result of the therapy. 

Zachary Glaser, MD, urologist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, called the results “very exciting. There is limited data beyond 5 years postoperatively, but the short-term data with 1-5 years of follow-up is robust and quite promising from an avoiding and sexual health standpoint,” Glaser said. “I'd be very, very curious to see if this is something that remains durable for greater than 10-15 years after treatment.”

Two main advantages of Optilume BPH over techniques such as transurethral resection or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and aquablation are that it does not involve any incisions or cutting of tissue and that the approach preserves antegrade ejaculation, Glaser said. As a result, the treatment may be particularly appealing to younger men who want either to preserve their fertility or maintain the ability to conceive without assistance or who would be bothered by retrograde ejaculation.

However, he said, the therapy requires a catheter to be left in the urethra for several days, and in some cases, men should use a condom because the paclitaxel can pass to a female partner during sex, raising the risk for birth defects should she become pregnant. Men taking blood thinners also may experience more issues with blood in the urine, Glaser added.

Elterman is an investigator for Laborie Medical Technologies, which supplied the catheters for the study.

 April 28, 2025  

Adrenalectomy significantly reduced the risk for vertebral fractures compared with conservative care in adults with mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), according to data from a recent study.

Previous research suggested that MACS occurs in approximately half of the patients with adrenal incidentalomas and may promote cardiometabolic conditions, but recovery from MACS may reduce this risk, wrote Valentina Morelli, MD, of IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, Milan, Italy, and colleagues.

“Among the other possible complications correlated with MACS is skeletal fragility, and in particular, some studies have shown that patients with MACS have an increased prevalence and incidence of vertebral fractures compared to patients with nonfunctioning tumors,” said co-author Vittoria Favero, MD, of the University of Milan, Milan, Italy, in an interview. However, intervention studies on the possible effect of the recovery from MACS on bone fragility are lacking, she said.

The European Society of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines on the management of adrenal incidentalomas developed in collaboration with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ESE-ENSAT guidelines of 2023) regarded the link between MACS and osteoporosis as not well established. The current study sought to address the effect of treating MACS on bone health, specifically the risk for vertebral fractures, Favero told Medscape Medical News.

The researchers performed separate analyses of two cohorts of patients with MACS, one through a retrospective study and the other via a prospective study. Their findings were published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

In the retrospective study, 53 adult outpatients with MACS were followed for approximately 35 months after undergoing adrenalectomy or conservative care to evaluate the incidence of vertebral fractures.

In the prospective study, 51 adult outpatients with MACS were randomized to adrenalectomy or conservative care and followed for 24 months to evaluate the effect of adrenalectomy on outcomes potentially associated with hypercortisolism, including vertebral fractures, body weight, blood pressure, bone mineral density (BMD), and glucometabolic control.

In the retrospective study, the percentage of women was 74.2% in the surgical group and 45.5% in the conservative care group; the average ages were 63 and 64 years, respectively.

For the prospective study, women accounted for 67% of the surgical group and 78% of the conservative care group, with average ages of 63 and 69 years at baseline, respectively.

All patients were assessed at baseline and follow-up for calcium-phosphorus metabolism and BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck.

In the retrospective study, patients in the surgery group had a significantly lower incidence of vertebral fractures than those in the conservative care group (9.7% vs 50%; P < .005). BMD at all three locations was similar between the groups.

In the prospective study, patients in the surgery group had a significantly lower incidence of vertebral fractures than those in the conservative care group (4.8% vs 25%; P = .04). Patients in the surgery group also showed an increase in calcium and phosphorous levels at 6 months, 12 months, and the end of the follow-up period compared with baseline. BMD was stable and similar in both groups.

The dramatic impact of recovery from mild cortisol excess on vertebral fracture risk reflects data from similar studies, the researchers wrote in their discussion. Considering data from both studies, adrenalectomy was associated with a 6.5-fold reduced risk for vertebral fractures in patients with MACS, they said.

“The randomized study confirms that the conservatively treated patients with MACS are exposed to an increased risk of vertebral fractures, similarly to what has already been suggested from retrospective data,” the researchers added.

The findings were limited by several factors including the lack of trabecular bone score, the potential for confounding variables in the retrospective study, the longer observation period in the surgery patients, and the lack of blinding of the radiologists who reviewed the results, the researchers noted.

Additional larger studies are needed to better identify patients with MACS at a greater risk for incident vertebral fractures; meanwhile, the current data suggest clinicians consider the increased risk for vertebral fractures in patients who do not undergo surgery, they concluded.

“The key message for clinical practice is that adrenalectomy significantly reduces the risk of vertebral fractures in patients with adrenal incidentalomas and MACS,” Favero told Medscape Medical News. The finding that fragility fractures occurred mainly at vertebral sites aligns with data from previous studies on subclinical hypercortisolism and MACS showing the sensitivity of trabecular bone to glucocorticoid excess, she added.

“The inadequate response to bisphosphonates in some patients was also an expected finding, as it is consistent with the understanding that MACS increases the risk of fragility fractures beyond what is typically seen in postmenopausal osteoporosis,” said Favero.

The results suggest that clinicians consider bone fragility when determining the most appropriate treatment strategy for these patients, she noted.

Looking ahead, further research is needed to identify tools beyond BMD evaluation to better identify patients with MACS at a higher risk for fractures, Favero said.

Although cortisol excess is known to have detrimental effects on bone health, the degree to which lower levels of cortisol excess, as is seen in MACS, affects bone health is not as well understood, said Trenton Foster, MD, assistant professor of surgery at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, in an interview.

The current study is important for better quantifying the benefits of adrenalectomy, and the findings were not unexpected, said Foster, who was not involved in the study. “Many studies in recent years have shown that MACS is a clinically relevant condition with a detrimental impact on health if left untreated, and definitive treatment with adrenalectomy results in improved outcomes for these patients,” he noted.

“There are many reasons to consider adrenalectomy for treatment of MACS,” said Foster. “This paper shows reducing fracture risk is another reason to do so.”

Most studies on adrenalectomy for MACS have been retrospective and observational; the current study includes one of the few prospective randomized clinical trials, said Feibi Zheng, MD, an endocrine surgeon and assistant professor of surgery at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, in an interview.

In a recent meta-analysis looking at MACS-associated comorbidity improvement after adrenalectomy, differences in BMD and fracture rate were among the strongest findings favoring adrenalectomy over conservative management, said Zheng, who was not involved in the study.

“Patients with MACS should not be monitored; they should be referred for surgical evaluation,” Zheng told Medscape Medical News. “Not every patient with MACS needs or should have adrenalectomy, but every patient should have an opportunity to meet an endocrine surgeon and have a personalized discussion of risks and benefits of surgery,” she said.

Further research is needed to examine other MACS-associated comorbidities such as hypertension and glycemic control, she added.

The study was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health. The researchers had no financial conflicts to disclose. Foster had no financial conflicts to disclose. Zheng disclosed having employment with Intuitive Surgical, a medical device company that makes surgical robots.

 April 28, 2025  

For more than 40 years, artificial sphincters have been the standard of care for stress urinary incontinence in men following prostate surgery. The iPhone age is finally catching up.

Electronic devices now in development could make it easier to control urination and enable more people to use this treatment. One-year data from a pilot study of the most advanced electronic device, UroMems' UroActive, were presented on April 26 at American Urological Association (AUA) 2025 Annual Meeting. Researchers also presented results of a long-term outcomes trial of Boston Scientific's manual hydraulic artificial urinary sphincter (AUC), the AMS 800, the gold standard for treatment of male stress urinary incontinence. The findings showed the evolution of incontinence treatment and the benefits and potential risks of new and existing technologies.

“Really the monumental and truly transformational aspect of this space is going to be with the innovations that will come with an electronically actuated device,” Melissa Kaufman, MD, PhD, professor of urologic surgery and chief of the Division of Reconstructive Urology and Pelvic Health at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in Nashville, Tennessee, told Medscape Medical News. “It's going to open up an opportunity for many more patients.”

Stress urinary incontinence may occur after prostate surgery or radiation therapy for cancer, which can damage the nerves and muscles around the bladder. An AUS mimics the function of the normal sphincter by opening and closing the urethra under the control of the patient.

The AMS 800 system has a cuff that wraps around the urethra to control the flow of urine. A pump is implanted in the scrotum, which a patient squeezes to move fluid in the cuff to a balloon implanted in the abdomen. When the cuff is deflated, the urethra opens so the patient can pee and after a few minutes the cuff refills and closes the urethra automatically.

The prevalence of stress urinary incontinence following prostatectomy ranges from 6% to 69% depending on the study and how incontinence is defined. Ten-year follow-up data from the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis of Surgery and Radiation After Localized Prostate Cancer (CEASAR) study found up to 25% of men who underwent prostatectomy reported bothersome leakage.

Sarah Faris, MD, associate professor of surgery at the University of Chicago, Chicago, said AUS implantation is highly effective for treating severe stress urinary incontinence. After prostate surgery, men may go through two to seven heavy pads a day to absorb urine, she said; AUS implantation can get them dry or close to dry. Some people avoid behaviors and social activities because they are embarrassed about leaking and AUS “can really give people's lives back,” Faris said.

Faris, a moderator at the AUA podium session on male incontinence, noted that the device typically lasts about 7-10 years and may need revisions. The potential risks include infection and erosion of the device into the urethra, which range between 1% and 3%, she said.

The AMS 800 device was cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1983 under the 510(k) process. In 2000, the agency issued a final rule requiring submission of a premarket approval application, which requires clinical studies, for an implanted mechanical/hydraulic urinary continence device. American Medical Systems, then the manufacturer of the device, submitted the application, which the FDA approved in 2001. Boston Scientific acquired the device from American Medical Systems in 2015.

The AUA's guideline on incontinence after prostate treatment, which the group amended in 2024, calls for clinicians to discuss the option of AUS in patients who are experiencing mild to severe stress urinary incontinence.

While the AMS 800 has undergone modifications over the years, including changes in cuff size and the addition of antibiotic coating to minimize prosthetic infection and explant risks, its basic design has remained largely unchanged. More advanced alternatives are on the horizon.

A June 2023 article in Translational Andrology and Urology described several artificial sphincters in development, including UroMems' device and Affluent Medical SA's electronic Artus system. The French company announced in March 2024 it had treated the first male patient with the Artus.

The paper also noted Boston Scientific has an electronic AUS program that features personal device integration for bluetooth control. A representative for Boston Scientific declined to share details about the company's electronic sphincter.

At the AUA meeting, Emmanuel Chartier-Kastler, MD, PhD,aprofessor of urology at Sorbonne Université in Paris, presented results of UroMems' pilot study in six men who were 1 year out from activation of the device. All patients reported more than a 50% reduction in the combined weight for all the pads required during a 24-hour period (the 24-hour pad weight test).

Chartier-Kastler, the study's principal investigator, said in an interview he has used the mechanical hydraulic AUS for 30 years. Some of his patients complain the device is too complicated, and many do not want to manipulate a pump. The main advantage of UroActive is patients “just have to use a patient remote control like you use for your garage door,” he said.

The wireless remote-control unit has two settings, a “baseline” or ambulatory setting and a “lying down” setting that puts less pressure on the occlusive cuff. The settings are fixed in consultation with the patient's physician so the patient can switch from one setting to another. Chartier-Kastler said the device may result in fewer urethral complications because it generates less pressure on the urethra when the patient is lying down. In addition, he said the system will automatically open the urethra so it does not depend on the patient, who may have cognitive or physical impairments, to do so.

UroMems said it will begin enrolling approximately 100 men in a pivotal trial at multiple sites in France and the United States later this year. The results of the study will be the basis of a premarket approval application to FDA, according to the company, which plans to seek an indication for men with urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency, including those following prostate surgery. UroMems said it also intends to conduct a pivotal trial of the device in women with urinary incontinence.

In another presentation on patient interest and concerns about electronic urinary sphincters, Yannic Volz, MD, an assistant professor at Ludwig-Maximillans-Universität in Munich, Germany, described the results of a survey of 208 men who underwent implantation of an AUS. Among them, 166 (79.8%) said they were satisfied with their current device, 186 (89.4%) would opt for the procedure again, and 125 (60.4%) expressed interest in an electronic system.

Most patients in the survey said they preferred remote control operation of the electronic AUS, although some reported being concerned about potential malfunctions, such as battery failure or loss of connection between the device and its controller. An article about the survey published in European Urology Open Science in February reported that 60% of respondents said they preferred smartphone-based control.

Although the medical literature contains many studies of AUS outcomes, most of these have been single-center, retrospective analyses of the technology. A group of urologists recently conducted a multi-institutional prospective AUS clinical outcomes (AUSCO) trial to assess safety and efficacy of the AMS 800 device, and quality of life in patients who receive it. The results of the single arm study of 115 men at 17 sites in the United States and Australia, were presented at the AUA meeting but have not yet been published.

Kaufman, the national principal investigator of the trial, reported the study met the primary endpoint, with 93.8% of patients experiencing at least 50% reduction in the weight of pads used in 24-hour period at 12 months. A total of 60.4% of men reported using no pads at the 12-month mark.

Adverse events were fairly common, with 38 patients (33%) reporting at least one complication during the study: 10 (8.7%) experienced serious problems with the device; nine (7.8%) required revision implantation; two (1.7%) experienced erosion; and three (2.6%) experienced a mechanical malfunction. No infections related to the AUS were reported.

Kaufman said previous retrospective studies were limited by variability in the way researchers measured outcomes.

“The regulatory landscape in the country has changed since the introduction of the artificial sphincter, and now we need to have very robust datasets that are standardized in order to move forward with any future technologies,” she said.

Kaufman noted that, in addition to the significant reduction in the need for pads and the 0% infection rate, men with a history of radiation therapy to the pelvis, who accounted for almost a quarter of participants in the trial, were not at increased risk for poor outcomes or adverse events.

Based on retrospective studies in the literature one “would expect that irradiated patients may have higher levels of erosion, explant and secondary surgeries,” she said. “We'll have to follow these men out for a longer period of time to assess impact, however for the time frame of this study, radiation did not affect outcomes or increase adverse events, which was very reassuring.”

In other analyses of the AUSCO data, Andrew Peterson, MD, a professor of surgery at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and a co-investigator on the trial, described patient perceptions about ease of use after AUS implantation and the device's improvement in depression, anxiety, and overall emotional health in men with stress urinary incontinence.

Artificial sphincters have not been widely used for treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women. One reason, Faris said, is slings, surgical mesh implanted to support the urethra or bladder neck, are so effective an AUS typically is unnecessary.

Kaufman noted implantation in women is more challenging as the cuff is implanted at the bladder neck rather than the urethra, which traditionally requires an open incision. And the pump, which is placed in the labia, can sometimes be uncomfortable to manipulate. 

Still, research on the devices in women is ongoing. Researchers at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in the United Kingdom, presented a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical outcomes and safety of AUS for women with stress urinary incontinence. The analysis of eight studies comprising 300 patients found implantation of the devices was associated with an overall rate of continence of 72%. Rates of revision (22.5%), explant (17.6%), and overall postoperative complications (26.3%) were moderate, the UK researchers reported.

UroMems announced results of its first clinical feasibility study of UroActive in women in February. The study was conducted in France in six women with stress urinary incontinence. The company said at 6 months after implantation the devices operated as expected with no need for revision or explant.

Kaufman said robotic surgery is now being used to implant the device in women in a much less invasive way. And with the emergence of an electronic device, she said, “you won't have to have the labial pump which should open access for a lot of women.”

Chartier-Kaster is a paid consultant for UroMems. Kaufman was the national principal investigator for the AUSCO trial, which was funded by Boston Scientific, and received compensation from Boston Scientific for serving as faculty on its courses. Other sources reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Patients with cancer who received prophylactic intravenous (IV) magnesium before starting cisplatin had a lower risk for cisplatin-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) than those who did not receive IV magnesium.

“The findings of this multicenter cohort study suggest that prophylactic administration of IV magnesium — a safe, inexpensive, and readily available intervention — was independently associated with a lower risk of cisplatin-associated AKI in patients with cancer initiating cisplatin chemotherapy,” the authors wrote. However, “randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.”

The study, led by Shruti Gupta, MD, MPH, Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was published online in JAMA Oncology.

Study limitations included baseline differences between the groups and lack of data on home medications, including oral magnesium and diuretics. Outcomes from only the first cycle of cisplatin administration were assessed, and information about IV fluid administration could not be reliably captured.

The study was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the US National Institutes of Health. Several authors reported receiving consulting fees or having other ties with various sources, outside the submitted work.

The legacy of discriminatory housing policies continues to shape both economic and health outcomes. A study by Tulane University, New Orleans, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, reveals that patients in historically redlined neighborhoods experience significantly longer delays in achieving HIV viral suppression than those in non-redlined areas.

Researchers analyzed 1132 newly diagnosed patients with HIV in New Orleans between 2011 and 2019, finding a 15% longer delay in viral suppression among those from redlined neighborhoods. These delays impact both individual health and broader public health efforts to prevent HIV transmission, said senior author Scott Batey, PhD, a professor at Tulane's School of Social Work, New Orleans.

“The association between redlining and health outcomes is not a new concept, but applying this lens specifically to HIV was novel,” Batey noted.

Though HIV viral suppression can be achieved in about a month with a single daily pill, the study found it took patients from redlined neighborhoods nearly a month longer to achieve it than their counterparts (193 vs 164 days). The study was conducted in collaboration with the Louisiana Department of Health and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama. 

Abolished in 1968, redlining refers to the practice of mortgage lenders marking certain areas with red lines on maps to signify where loans would be denied to residents based on their race or ethnicity. This financial exclusion led to lasting disparities in healthcare access, education, and household income.

Today, even in areas where investments have been made to counteract redlining, “individuals still experience longer times to achieve viral suppression,” Batey said. “This suggests that historical systemic barriers continue to have lingering effects, even across generations.”

Among the study participants, 62% resided in formerly redlined neighborhoods. Most were men between ages 25 and 44 years. Although New Orleans has a Black majority population, the study revealed a higher concentration of Black individuals in redlined areas than in non-redlined ones.

“Our study reinforced existing research that links social determinants of health — such as poverty, depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence — to HIV outcomes,” he added. “However, structural determinants of health remain less explored, making our findings particularly compelling.”

Factors like limited healthcare access, financial insecurity, transportation barriers, and medical mistrust further delay treatment, Batey said. Limited health literacy and stigma further complicate access to timely care. “Stigma remains a major barrier — people may avoid seeking care due to fear of discrimination.”

While the study focused on New Orleans, its findings are relevant across the Deep South, where redlining was prevalent and healthcare disparities persist. This region accounts for over half of new HIV cases in the United States, Batey said.

Addressing these systemic issues requires targeted interventions. “If we can make services more accessible and get people virally suppressed sooner, the impact on the HIV epidemic could be profound,” Batey said. “Expanding on-site testing and at-home testing, telehealth options, and culturally competent education initiatives can help close these healthcare gaps.”

The results from the redlining study can help inform and reinforce the need for community-based strategies. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to addressing HIV treatment adherence, added Shobha Swaminathan, MD, FIDSA, professor of medicine and director of HIV services at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.

“Most infectious disease physicians enter their specialty driven by a strong desire to improve public health and reduce health disparities,” said Swaminathan, who also serves as medical director of Infectious Diseases Practice, Rutgers Health at University Hospital. “This foundational motivation is a powerful asset in addressing the complexities of HIV treatment adherence.”

By collaborating with mental health and substance use disorder clinicians, community health workers, and case managers, providers can deliver patient-centered care while increasing education on HIV treatment effectiveness. Encouraging the use of long-acting injectable medications can also help address adherence challenges, Swaminathan said.

Education campaigns, community outreach, and partnerships with local organizations — especially through social media — can inform at-risk populations about early treatment and viral suppression, she added. Integrated care models that address HIV alongside mental health and substance use concerns can improve retention, with local services easing access to multiple types of care.

Community health worker programs and long-acting injectable antiretrovirals offer promising solutions, reducing the burden of daily medication and improving engagement in care, Swaminathan said.

“By approaching HIV care with a comprehensive, empathetic, and advocacy-driven mindset, we can be catalysts for change in the fight against HIV, improving both individual and community health outcomes.”

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) describes chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the gut, mainly Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. An associated complication of IBD is metabolic bone disease, including osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures. 

The connection between IBD and low bone density is multifactorial. Researchers report that contributing factors include chronic active disease and medications, general lifestyle factors — such as low physical activity and poor nutrition — and hormonal changes. Clinicians can monitor bone density, advise on optimizing lifestyle factors, recommend supplements as necessary, and consider pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis.

One meta-analysis reported that the overall risk of fracture is increased by about 38% in patients with IBD compared to the general population. This study also reported that the increased risk is significant only for the spine (and more than double that of healthy individuals at this site). However, another population-based study found a 60% increased risk of hip fracture in patients with IBD, indicating involvement of multiple skeletal sites. Osteoporosis has overall been reported in 12%-70% of patients with established IBD and osteopenia in as many as 77%.

Many factors appear to contribute to the pathophysiology of low bone mineral density in IBD: older age, chronic active disease, gut resection, malabsorption, nutritional deficiencies, low weight, lower physical activity, hypogonadism, chronic glucocorticoid treatment, and the underlying inflammatory process. In children, additional risk factors include impaired longitudinal growth, reduced lean mass, and delayed puberty. There is emerging evidence that use of biologics in IBD (such as infliximab and adalimumab) may spare bone to a greater extent that traditional therapy.

Malabsorption with deficiencies of vitamin D, calcium and protein (essential for optimizing bone health) are common in patients with IBD. A majority of patients with Crohn's have low serum calcidiol (the storage form of vitamin D), which is worse if there is an associated small bowel resection. 

Further, hypogonadism is common in patients with IBD due to impaired nutritional status, chronic inflammation, and long-term glucocorticoid use; it is an important contributor to low bone density. Delayed puberty is a risk factor for low bone density in children with IBD. Deficiency of the gonadal steroids results in increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation. Chronic glucocorticoid treatment impairs calcium absorption from the gut, the renal handling of calcium, bone formation, bone resorption, the growth hormone-insulin like growth factor-1 axis, and can contribute to hypogonadism. 

Hypogonadism, chronic glucocorticoid therapy, and chronic inflammation all have an impact on the RANKL (receptor activator of NF-kappa B ligand)-OPG (osteoprotegerin) system, a key mechanism contributing to increased bone resorption, including in IBD.

RANKL is expressed by cells of the osteoblast lineage and binds to a receptor on osteoclast precursors called RANK resulting in activation of cells of the osteoclast lineage to begin the process of bone resorption. However, RANKL can also bind to a soluble decoy receptor called OPG, which blocks the interaction of RANKL and RANK, thus preventing osteoclast differentiation, activation, and bone resorption. 

Glucocorticoid treatment (such as with hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone), estrogen deficiency, and chronic inflammation all increase RANKL and decrease OPG expression, thus favoring bone resorption. However, with glucocorticoid therapy, the increase in RANKL is only transient, and the failure of bone formation seems to be more important contributor to impaired bone health than bone resorption. Treatment with budesonide, a commonly used oral glucocorticoid with mostly local and limited systemic effects, allows for sparing of bone density in patients with IBD, although studies are conflicting. Of note, studies have reported increased, rather than decreased, OPG level in patients with IBD compared to controls, likely an adaptive mechanism to prevent further bone loss.

Excessive alcohol use and smoking are risk factors for low bone mineral density and increased fracture risk in patients with IBD, as they are in general.

Bone mineral density is a surrogate for bone health. It is measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine and hip in adults and at the spine and whole body less head in children. In post-menopausal women and men older than 50, osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density that is at least 2.5 SDs below peak bone mass in healthy adults. Osteopenia, a precursor of osteoporosis, is defined as bone mineral density between 1 and 2.5 SDs below peak bone mass. 

In individuals younger than 50, low bone density is defined as “below the expected range of age” (Z-score ≤ -2). In children, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires both a low bone mineral density (Z-score ≤ -2) and a significant fracture history. The latter includes a vertebral compression fracture or at least two long bone low impact fractures by the age 10 or at least three long bone low impact fractures by the age 19. A vertebral compression fracture qualifies for a diagnosis of osteoporosis regardless of bone density.

Patients with a previous fragility fracture should be evaluated with a DXA scan and monitored over time. Other high-risk individuals are patients who have received prolonged or repeated courses of glucocorticoids, those older than 50, and those younger than 50 with other risk factors such as chronic active disease, malabsorption, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, decreased physical activity, hypogonadism, chronic glucocorticoid therapy, poorly controlled IBD with persistent underlying inflammation, history of gut resection, excess alcohol intake, and a history of smoking. 

The American Gastroenterology Association recommends repeat bone mineral density testing every 2-3 years. However, yearly DXA measurements are recommended for children and those showing > 3% decrease in bone mineral density annually. Further, DXA scans may be obtained sooner in children (such as at 6 months) if the patient develops clinical features of cortisol excess from glucocorticoid therapy, including increasing BMI z-scores. 

Other tests to consider in high-risk patients include a complete blood count, a complete metabolic panel, calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, parathyroid hormone, sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, levels of gonadal steroids, and urinary calcium excretion. In children receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy, a lateral spine x-ray is recommended (to assess for vertebral compression fractures) at baseline and annually and if the patient develops back pain or if spine bone density Z-scores decrease by ≥ 0.5 over two consecutive measurements.

It is important to optimize weight and nutrition. Every attempt should be made to ensure optimal intake of calcium and vitamin D in diet or as supplements. Recommendations include at least 1200 mg elemental calcium (preferably as calcium citrate) and 800-1000 IU vitamin D every day. Calcium citrate is better absorbed and less likely to be associated with renal stones. However, higher doses of calcium and vitamin D may be necessary in some individuals, particularly when there is ongoing malabsorption. 

Weight bearing exercises help maintain or improve bone density. Avoiding excess alcohol intake and quitting smoking are important. Hypogonadal individuals should receive gonadal hormone replacement therapy. Use of comfortable shoes and installing safety measures at home can help reduce the risk of falls and fractures.

Pharmacologic therapy is indicated when there is evidence of osteoporosis. In older adults without osteoporosis, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score may be used to get an estimate of the 10-year probability of major fracture risk. Oral bisphosphonates are the first-line pharmacologic option. Alendronate or risedronate are given orally weekly. IV zoledronic acid is a good option for those who cannot tolerate or absorb oral bisphosphonates and is given every 6-12 months (dosing every 6 months is recommended in children until their bone density is in the normal range, after which it may be given annually). Those with several fractures despite having tried other drugs can try a bone anabolic agent, such as teriparatide, romosozumab, or abaloparatide. 

Overall, IBD is associated with low bone density and increased fracture risk. Risk factors include chronic active disease, nutritional factors, low physical activity, gut resection, hypogonadism, prolonged and repeated courses of glucocorticoids, and the underlying inflammation. Bone density monitoring is important in those at high risk for low bone density and fracture. It is important to optimize nutritional and weight status, physical activity, limit alcohol intake, and avoid smoking. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation are typically necessary. Those with osteoporosis may require pharmacological therapy with bisphosphonates. Some may require bone anabolic therapy.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

SAN DIEGO — A 20-year initiative by Kaiser Permanente Northern California that assessed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening status and offered flexible options for screening has made a huge difference in CRC incidence, deaths, and racial disparities, an analysis showed.

“The program promptly doubled the proportion of people up to date with screening,” reported lead investigator Douglas A. Corley, MD, PhD, a research scientist with Kaiser's Division of Research, at a press briefing held on April 24, ahead of a presentation at the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

Additionally, within about 10 years, cancer rates were cut by a third, deaths were halved for the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and the differences that had previously been seen by race or ethnicity were largely eliminated, he said.

“Ten years ago, there were big gaps in cancer risk and death, especially among our Black patients. Now, those differences are nearly gone,” Corley said.

A systematic CRC screening program was implemented across Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The program included proactive outreach to members who were overdue for screening and mailing them fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits for at-home use.

Corley and colleagues tracked screening status and CRC incidence and mortality annually from 2000 to 2019 among about 1.1 million members aged 50-75 years across 22 medical centers of the integrated healthcare system. The cohort included American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and White members.

Screening rates via FIT, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy more than doubled after starting the program, from about 37% in the early years to about 80% within a few years, and it stayed that high through 2019, Corley reported. 

“Importantly, these large increases occurred across the whole population with only small differences,” he said. 

For example, about 76% of Hispanic members, 77% of Black members, 82% of White members, and 83% of Asian members were up to date in the later years and through 2019.

“This shows that systematic, comparable outreach can provide a level playing field for completion of preventive care,” Corley said.

After an expected early uptick in CRC incidence due to early detection, incidence later declined and by 2019 had dropped approximately 30% across the groups.

CRC deaths also fell by about 50% across all groups, with the largest decline among Black members, Corley noted.

Racial and ethnic disparities in both CRC incidence and mortality have long existed, with Black patients in particular experiencing higher risks and worse outcomes, likely from a mixture of risk factors and healthcare utilization, Corley said.

Offering outreach and equal access to screening in the Kaiser program erased those long-standing disparities.

“It's remarkable that some of these large differences in mortality by race and ethnicity that we saw two decades ago, and which are found throughout the United States, are now similar to small chance variation in the population,” Corley said.

Flexibility was key to getting more people screened, he noted. “It's about reaching people at their homes and offering a choice to patients. It's an astonishingly simple concept.”

It's important to note that these findings stem from a large, integrated healthcare system, which may differ from other settings, although similar outreach strategies have succeeded in safety net clinics and smaller practices, Corley added.

By boosting screening rates to 80%, the health system reached the level that's essentially been defined in the past as our goal of screening programs, said Loren Laine, MD, professor of medicine (digestive diseases) at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, and chair of this year's DDW. 

“It shows that if health systems institute programmatic screening for all their covered individuals, they could markedly increase screening, said Laine, who also served as moderator of the press briefing.

“Most importantly, of course, [screening] was associated with a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and deaths,” he said.

The study had no commercial funding. Corley reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Laine's disclosures included consulting and/or relationships with Medtronic, Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven, Celgene, Intercept, Merck, and Pfizer.

Children with peanut allergy who achieved remission with sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) had lower basophil activation before treatment and greater suppression of basophils at 1 year than those who experienced treatment failure, a new study showed. Basophil activation might serve as predictive biomarker of treatment success, the study authors suggested.

“These data indicate that lower basophil activation at baseline and suppression of basophils within the first 12 months may be key to success on peanut SLIT,” the study authors wrote. “Future studies should focus on defining how quickly basophil suppression occurs in subjects that go on to achieve remission.”

Jessica R. Humphrey, MS, with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on April 15 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Additional studies with more patients are needed to replicate the findings, the authors noted.

We look forward to hearing from you.

A 51-year-old man without significant past medical history presents to an outpatient Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Sports Medicine clinic for bilateral foot pain, which he describes as a burning sensation, worse on the inner aspect of the plantar surface. The patient is an avid runner, a self-reported heel-striker, who has participated in multiple marathons, but the pain currently limits his ability to run. He works out regularly and has not had any significant change in exercise habits. The pain is worse at the end of the day. The patient has tried using both a heel cup and orthosis without relief and reported that the heel cup made the pain worse. He has also tried topical anti-inflammatories and lidocaine patches, as well as multiple physical therapy sessions, all without significant relief. He states that he eats adequate well-balanced meals.

Ultrasound of the affected foot is the most important test/intervention to order at this point. Although a CT scan may identify bony lesions such as osteoarthritis and stress fractures, this patient's history is more suggestive of a soft tissue pathology. Of note, if evaluating for bony lesions, an x-ray would be a more appropriate imaging study than a CT scan.[1] Burning pain is typical of neuropathic conditions, and the patient's diet and steady exercise habits do not lead towards the likelihood of a stress injury.[2] To evaluate soft tissue injury, including tendinous and ligamentous injuries, ultrasound is an excellent imaging modality. For this body part, ultrasound can evaluate for conditions such as plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinopathy, and calcaneal spurs.[1] Although a corticosteroid injection may alleviate symptoms, it has local and systemic adverse effects that should be minimized through image-guided delivery.[2] The patient has previously not responded to conservative treatment with physical therapy, anti-inflammatories, lidocaine patches, and orthoses.

Considering the patient's history of avid running with pain worsened at the end of the day, it is important to rule out an acute injury such as a fracture, Lisfranc injury, or other sprain/strain of the foot, or a potential bone stress injury, thereby reducing complications and improving functional outcomes.[3] The patient should describe their pain symptoms; the history and physical examination are essential in identifying the pain as muscular, neuropathic, or bone pain.[2]

Initial physical examination revealed pes planus bilaterally and tenderness along the plantar aspect of the right foot at the mid-portion of the plantar fascia. The rest of the foot exam was otherwise normal. The patient's strength was intact and symmetric and there were no sensory deficits. Pulses were symmetric without abnormality. There were no obvious deficits in muscle bulk comparatively to either side. Gait was normal throughout the cycle. An x-ray showed a periosteal irregularity at the base of the first metatarsal and could not exclude a nondisplaced fracture (Figure 1).

Figure 1: X-ray of right foot showing a periosteal irregularity at the base of the first metatarsal

However, the patient was asymptomatic at the base of the first metatarsal. A point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed to evaluate for conditions such as bursopathy, plantar fasciitis, plantar fibromatosis, tendinopathy, and heel spurs. POCUS revealed mild thickening of the plantar fascia at the origin and 1-2 cm distally without distinct fibromatosis (Figure 2a).

Figure 2a: Ultrasound showing mild thickening of the plantar fascia

Transverse view revealed medial thickening of the plantar fascia with an adjacent enlarged medial plantar nerve (Figure 2b). Symptoms were reproduced by sonopalpation of this nerve.

The diagnosis of medial plantar nerve entrapment was made based on the history of burning pain worsening at the end of the day and with more strenuous activity in an otherwise healthy individual, non-traumatic etiology without inciting event, and no gross abnormality aside from pes planus seen when inspecting the foot. POCUS revealed focal enlargement of the plantar fascia and of the medial plantar nerve adjacent to the plantar fascia, with maximal tenderness along this region. POCUS is an excellent diagnostic tool for evaluation of the medial plantar nerve along its entire course.[4,5] There are multiple locations where this nerve can become entrapped, including the distal tarsal tunnel[2,6] and deep to the flexor retinaculum, adjacent to the master knot of Henry (where the flexor hallicus longus and the flexor digitorum longus tendons cross over).[7] This condition is often called Jogger's foot because it is mostly seen in joggers. Patients usually present with pain along the medial plantar arch and heel. POCUS can show tenosynovitis, tendon sheath effusions, bursitis, and space-occupying lesions of this area, which could also cause this nerve entrapment. During MRI, tendon sheath effusion at the knot of Henry heightens the concern for entrapment of the medial plantar nerve.[7] The MRI also shows abnormal thickness and T2 hyperintensity of the nerve centered at the knot of Henry, with muscular denervation changes in late cases especially in the flexor digitorum brevis.[8]

Entrapment may also be due to direct nerve compression from fibrous scar tissue from prior surgery.[2]

Morton's neuroma (benign, non-cancerous tumor of a nerve) can be ruled out on the basis of the patient's history. People with this condition will often describe a marble-like sensation between the third and fourth digits. Morton's neuroma is eight times more common in women than men and typically affects ages 30-60. Physical exam could reveal a click between the toes when squeezing the foot, known as a Mulder's click.[9]

A Lisfranc injury is a tarsometatarsal fracture dislocation often resulting from a traumatic event that can cause swelling of the midfoot and joint instability.[3] Radiography can be performed while the patient is weight bearing and non-weight bearing to assess for increased distance between the metatarsal bones involved for disruption of the intermetatarsal ligaments.[10] MRI can provide further classification[3] if surgery is required.

Osteoarthritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a middle-aged individual experiencing musculoskeletal pain.[1] However, in this patient, the pain is located at a specific point along the dorsum over the foot and is described as burning. This would be an unusual pain symptom of osteoarthritis, which is typically described as dull and achy. Furthermore, osteoarthritis pain is not located in a specific joint along this region.

Conservative management for medial plantar nerve entrapment consists of stretching and physical therapy along with topical or oral anti-inflammatories as needed and activity modification.[2] Additional treatment modalities, such as lidocaine injection,[11] dextrose injection, or hydrodissection, can be considered.[2] For refractory cases, surgery may be an option depending on the etiology of the entrapment.

As noted previously, medial plantar nerve entrapment is most often seen in joggers. Space-occupying lesions of the medial plantar arch and heel, which could also cause this nerve entrapment, can be seen on POCUS.[5,7] Entrapment may also occur as a result of direct nerve compression from fibrous scar tissue from prior surgery.[2]

For this patient, ongoing physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications,[2] and injections like dextrose prolotherapy[2,12] or hydrodissection were expected to lead to significant improvement. The patient, who was initially diagnosed with medial plantar nerve entrapment by an enlarged plantar fascia using POCUS, underwent a diagnostic ultrasound-guided hydrodissection (Video 2) using 2 mL of 1% lidocaine (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Still image of ultrasound-guided hydrodissection

Upon returning 1 month later, the patient reported at least 50% improvement of ongoing symptoms and was able to resume running. He was offered dextrose prolotherapy or corticosteroid injections for potentially greater relief, but he has not yet pursued these. The patient's previous treatment for this condition, which included orthotics and topical medications, may not have been ideal and may have worsened his symptoms. A more focused approach involving physical therapy targeting stretching, strengthening, and activity modification may better address the underlying nerve compression.[2] If conservative measures fail to provide relief, injection therapies could be considered, as they reduce nerve compression and inflammation. Surgery would be a last option for individuals who were unresponsive to other treatments.[2,7]

For people who do not respond to orthotics and topical medications, injection therapies have been explored. A 2022 retrospective single-arm study assessed dextrose prolotherapy and hydrodissection for medial plantar nerve entrapment. Among 40 patients, 61% experienced near-complete symptom relief.[13] These injections help decompress the nerve and reduce inflammation, providing long-lasting relief. Conversely, lidocaine injections offer only temporary relief.[11] This suggests that prolotherapy and hydrodissection targeting inflammation and nerve adhesions possibly offer more sustained benefits.

Given that the patient has shown about 50% improvement with the initial diagnostic lidocaine injection, the next appropriate step would be to continue with a more therapeutic injection, such as prolotherapy with dextrose or a corticosteroid. Hydrodissection with these medications targets inflammation and nerve adhesions and may help provide sustained relief[2] while avoiding the need for more invasive treatments like surgery.

Continuing physical therapy and activity modification will also remain important. For refractory heel pain, referral to a neurologist for an electromyography or a nerve conduction velocity exam could be considered subsequently.[2] Hospitalization is unnecessary because the patient's condition is not acute, and surgery should be considered only if conservative treatments fail.[2,7]

The prognosis for this patient's medial plantar nerve entrapment with adhesions to an enlarged plantar fascia is generally favorable following prolotherapy (hydrodissection) or a corticosteroid, which may help provide sustained relief.[2] Given this patient's positive response to the initial diagnostic lidocaine injection (50% symptom improvement), it is expected that therapeutic injections will further help reduce inflammation and nerve compression, leading to continued improvement over the next few months. Although surgery can provide benefit in refractory cases, it is not the immediate next step,[2] and the patient's condition is not expected to worsen significantly with conservative treatment.

 April 28, 2025  

ORLANDO, Fla. — Treatments of the face with fully ablative carbon dioxide lasers and nonablative fractional lasers (NAFLs) have in recent years been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of developing keratinocyte-derived carcinomas (KCs) on treated areas of skin.

At The American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS) 2025 Annual Meeting, researchers presented evidence that pulsed-dye laser (PDL) facial treatments, used since 1987 to treat erythema, rosacea, and other skin conditions, may also reduce the risk for these common skin cancers, which include basal cell and squamous carcinomas.

At the meeting, Jamie K. Hu, MD, a research fellow in dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, the study's lead investigator, presented results from a retrospective chart review from a cosmetic dermatology practice at the hospital of 59 patients (61% women) with a history of facial KCs who received at least one facial treatment with PDL and no other type of laser. These patients were matched with non–laser-treated control individuals from the same cosmetic practice for sex, age, and Fitzpatrick skin type.

After a mean follow-up of 8.6 years, 27.1% of the PDL-treated patients developed facial KCs compared with 54.2% of matched control individuals (P = .0047). Confounding based on differences in sunscreen use between patients and control individuals was unlikely, Hu said, because “our patient population at the cosmetic center is very on top of their sunscreen use.” 

The findings added to a growing body of evidence, dating back more than a decade, that laser treatments have a prophylactic effect with regards to KCs. In 2023, the same Harvard University–based research group, led by Mathew Avram, MD, director of the MGH Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center, found that facial NAFL treatment was associated with a decreased risk for subsequent facial KC development.

In a joint interview at the meeting, Avram and Hu commented that while the effect seen previously for fractional laser treatment has been linked to skin changes that boost DNA repair, the mechanism with PDL may be different. “There are a few other theories,” Avram said. One is that PDL reduces the proinflammatory cytokine milieu associated with increased basal cell development, as seen in a recent study of patients with granulomatous rosacea. Another relates to enhanced immune surveillance stimulated by PDL. And finally, “we actually treat basal cell carcinomas with the pulsed laser. So it may be that we are treating incipient ones unknowingly,” Avram said.

In a separate interview at the conference, R. Rox Anderson, MD, director of the Wellman Center for Photomedicine at MGH, who was not involved with this study, said it was a “real surprise” to him that both the fractional laser and the pulsed laser, which work differently and target different dermal structures, would both be associated with a decreased risk of developing KCs.

Anderson, who invented PDL technology, said he nonetheless suspected that the same mechanisms thought to underlie the prophylactic activity of other laser treatments were also at play here.

He said that the findings of protective effects from skin lasers, when first reported, had struck him as counterintuitive: Early on, he had feared that the treatments might increase cancer risk.

“I come in with a laser and I randomly kill 20% of your epidermis. Those cells have to be replaced. You would think that the cells that had accumulated mutations that allow them to replicate really well would be the ones that would win,” Anderson said. “Instead, those micro-injuries stimulate the [DNA] repair process. It's not an anticancer treatment but is an interesting mechanism that may well be applicable beyond the skin.”

Despite being in a high-resource setting, infants with congenital tuberculosis (TB) across Europe were more likely to have been born preterm and had low birth weights than those with postnatal TB, with both the groups showing substantial mortality and morbidity.

""TB symptoms in the mother are often absent, but this should not discourage clinicians from performing investigations for TB in the infant. Also, clinicians should consider the possibility of cTB [congenital TB] even if the Cantwell criteria are not fulfilled,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Florian Götzinger, Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Klinik Ottakring, Vienna Healthcare Group & Austrian Reference Centre for Childhood Tuberculosis, Vienna, Austria. It was published online on April 19, 2025, in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe.

The retrospective nature of the study resulted in some missing documentation. The study team relied on imaging reports from local radiologists with limited experience in paediatric TB disease. Despite conducting the study through a large network, a limited number of identified patients meeting the inclusion criteria prevented detailed statistical analyses.

This study did not receive any specific funding. Several authors reported receiving financial support from pharmaceutical companies, such as bioMérieux, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer; and organisations, including the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery, European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, and Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS — Infectious Diseases.

DISCLOSURES |  April 28, 2025  



Nicholas J. Silvestri, MD, recounts how the 2025 American Academy of Neurology meeting was an exciting and energizing event, particularly in the realm of myasthenia gravis (MG), where numerous new therapies and promising data on existing treatments were shared. These advances offer hope for more personalized and effective care for patients, acknowledging MG as a highly individualized disease that benefits from a diverse range of therapeutic options.

However, Dr Silvestri also notes how questions remain about how best to select and sequence these treatments for different patient profiles, highlighting the need for future research into predictive biomarkers and demographic factors. Overall, the outlook for patients with MG is bright, with continued progress expected in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.

New research reveals that ultra-processed foods account for nearly half of US household grocery purchases, with lower-income and less-educated families bearing the brunt, underscoring the need for urgent national policy reform.

In a recent article published in the journal Public Health Nutrition, researchers analyzed purchases of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) by American households, examining differences based on education levels, household income, and race and ethnicity.

They found that almost half of all food purchases and more than one-third of beverages were UPFs; snacks, soft drinks, and mixed dishes accounted for the highest proportions of UPFs. Purchases of UPFs were more common in households with lower incomes and members with lower levels of education, as well as in non-Hispanic white households. The study included a nationally representative sample of 59,939 US households, analyzing over 33 million purchased products during 2020.

Statistical analyses used a significance threshold of p < 0.0001 to determine meaningful differences between groups.

UPFs are highly engineered products made with additives and ingredients derived from food and are becoming increasingly dominant in American diets. These foods have been linked to several chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, depression, sleep issues, and even premature death.

Unlike traditional food research focused on nutrients, recent studies use the NOVA classification system to assess food processing levels, aiming to highlight foods designed to encourage overconsumption.

UPFs are identified not only by their high processing but also by the use of certain additives rarely found in home cooking. Current estimates show that approximately half of American beverage and food purchases are ultra-processed. Nutrition-related health problems, including obesity, also show significant disparities across ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups.

Past research undertaken from 2007 to 2012 revealed that more educated individuals consume fewer UPFs, while white and Black adolescents consume the most. Income and age were inversely related to UPF intake. While purchase data provide a clearer picture than dietary surveys, earlier findings indicated that Black households bought more processed drinks but fewer processed foods.



Proportion of food and beverages purchased by US households by level of processing

In a quickly changing food market, researchers sought to update research on UPF purchasing patterns, exploring how race, income, education, and family structure intersect with food purchasing.

The study utilized data from a consumer panel survey of 59,939 American households, drawn from a nationally representative sample of approximately 35,000 to 60,000 households per year, conducted in 2020. Participating households scanned packaged beverage and food purchases and provided demographic data, including race, ethnicity, education, income, and household composition.

Ethnicity and race were grouped as non-Hispanic, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Black. Income was divided into three levels based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), namely <185%, 185–350%, and >350%. Education was classified into at most high school, some college, or college graduate and above. Households were also classified based on whether they included children.

Using commercial databases, each product was matched with nutrient labels and ingredient data. Items without nutrition labels or barcodes (like fresh produce and meats) were excluded. Products were grouped into nine food and eleven beverage categories.

Based on the NOVA classification system, items were categorized as minimally processed, containing processed ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods (UPFs). UPFs were identified by checking for substances not typically used in home kitchens, including flavor enhancers and sweeteners. If items originally classified as UPFs were found to contain none of the NOVA markers or additives, the product was reclassified as processed foods rather than UPFs.

The authors used statistical tests to compare the purchase volumes of UPFs across demographic sub-groups, applying Bonferroni adjustments to account for multiple comparisons.



Proportion of (A) foods and (B) beverages purchased by US households by both level of processing and food category

In 2020, among 59,939 American households and over 33 million purchased products that were analyzed, 38% of beverages and 48% of packaged foods were classified as UPFs, accounting for 43% of all products purchased.

The groups with the largest share of UPFs were carbonated beverages, which contained 90% UPFs, followed by soups and mixed dishes at 81%, and snacks and sweets at 71%. In contrast, fruits, vegetables, fats, nuts, and oils had virtually no UPFs. Importantly, although these minimally processed categories had almost no UPFs, they made up only a small fraction (12%) of total purchases, compared to the top three UPF categories (carbonated soft drinks, sweets and snacks, and mixed dishes/soups), which together comprised 36% of all purchases.

Non-Hispanic white households had the highest percentage of UPF purchases (49%), followed by non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (46%), and other ethnic groups (43%). Lower-income and less educated households purchased a higher proportion of UPFs than higher-income and more educated households.

These patterns held across racial-ethnic groups even when stratified by income. Differences were observed across food categories, with non-Hispanic white households purchasing more carbonated UPF drinks, and non-Hispanic Black households purchasing more UPF dairy beverages and fruit juices. The ""other"" race/ethnicity group consistently had the lowest proportion of UPF purchases, except in the dairy beverage category. Grain products and fruit/vegetable juices showed the greatest variability by group, with at least a 10% difference between the lowest and highest proportions of UPFs purchased.

It is important to note that this study measured only in-home purchases. Previous research has shown that non-Hispanic Black households are more likely than other race-ethnic groups to purchase sugar-sweetened beverages outside the home, which was not captured in this dataset. Therefore, the observed lower in-home beverage UPF purchases among non-Hispanic Black households may not reflect their total beverage consumption.

This study confirms the dominance of UPFs in American household food purchases, consistent with previous research. Notably, non-Hispanic whites now purchase more ultra-processed beverages than other groups, differing from earlier findings. One possible explanation for this shift is purchasing behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have disproportionately affected minority groups and altered patterns of food insecurity and at-home purchasing. Additionally, the limitation of only capturing in-home purchases may confound observed racial and ethnic differences in UPF beverage purchasing patterns.

Despite using a nationally representative sample and full-year data collection, limitations include reliance on purchase (rather than consumption) data, potential underestimation due to food waste, exclusion of restaurant purchases, possible misclassification using the NOVA classification system, and pandemic-related purchasing shifts. Despite these, scan-based data likely ensures reasonable accuracy.

The findings emphasize the urgent need for American policy initiatives addressing UPF consumption to enhance diet quality and mitigate chronic disease risks, particularly given the absence of federal regulations compared to other countries.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have found that individuals with colon cancer and a documented history of high cannabis use were more than 20 times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis compared to those without such a history.

This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that heavy cannabis use may have underrecognized impacts on the immune system, mental health and treatment behaviors - all of which could influence cancer outcomes.""

Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., lead author, associate professor, Department of Anesthesiology, UC San Diego School of Medicine

The research team drew on electronic health records from more than 1,000 colon cancer patients treated across the University of California Health system between 2012 and 2024. They evaluated how cancer outcomes differed based on patients' documented cannabis use before diagnosis, controlling for age, sex and indicators of disease severity such as tumor staging and cancer biomarkers.

The analysis found:

While some laboratory studies have shown anti-tumor effects from certain cannabis compounds, the authors note that real-world use is more complex. Given the increasing prevalence and social acceptance of cannabis use, they also emphasize the need to further investigate its long-term effects in medically vulnerable populations.

""High cannabis use is often associated with depression, anxiety and other challenges that may compromise a patient's ability to engage fully with cancer treatment,"" said Cuomo, who is also a member of UC San Diego Moore's Cancer Center. ""However, this isn't about vilifying cannabis. It's about understanding the full range of its impacts, especially for people facing serious illnesses. We hope these findings encourage more research - and more nuanced conversations - about how cannabis interacts with cancer biology and care.""

The study was published online in the Annals of Epidemiology. No funding or conflicts of interest were reported for this study.

Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab before, during and after standard-of-care surgery had longer event-free survival without the cancer coming back and higher rates of substantial tumor shrinkage prior to surgery, according to the first interim analysis of a randomized, open-label phase 3 clinical trial led by investigators from Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

This trial, called KEYNOTE-689, is the first study in more than 20 years to show improvements in outcomes over standard of care for this patient group. Current standard of care for resectable head and neck cancer involves surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, though only 40% to 50% of patients survive five years.

""This is a practice-changing study,"" said Robert Haddad, MD, chief of the Division of Head and Neck Oncology and the McGraw Chair in Head and Neck Oncology at Dana-Farber, and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Haddad is the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center principal investigator and member of the KEYNOTE-689 steering committee. ""Not only has this regimen improved event-free survival, but we also observed that fewer patients required chemotherapy as part of standard of care after receiving immunotherapy before surgery.""

The results will be presented by the study global chair, Ravindra Uppaluri, MD, PhD, director of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital Endowed Chair in Otolaryngology, at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. A press conference will take place on Sunday, April 27, from 12:00-1:00 p.m. ET / 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. CT. Uppaluri will then present the study in Clinical Trials Plenary Session CT001 on Sunday, April 27, 2025, from 2:00-2:15 p.m. ET / 1:00-1:15 p.m. CT.

Douglas Adkins, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Section of Head and Neck and Thyroid Medical Oncology at WashU Medicine who worked closely with the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center team in a previous phase 2 trial, is the co-senior author.

The KEYNOTE-689 trial randomized 714 patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IVA head and neck squamous cell cancer to receive either pembrolizumab before (called neoadjuvant), during and after (called adjuvant) standard of care or standard of care alone. The investigators also measured the presence of the target of pembrolizumab, PD-L1, in tumors to determine if higher scores of PD-L1 in tumors would affect response to treatment.

They found that patients who received pembrolizumab had longer event-free survival regardless of their PD-L1 scores. Median event-free survival across all patients was 51.8 months with pembrolizumab and 30.4 without after a median of 38.3 months of follow-up. The team also observed significantly higher rates of major pathologic response, a substantial immune mediated tumor destruction seen in surgical resections, across all patients taking pembrolizumab.

The treatment was found to be safe with no new observed side effects. Further, patients taking pembrolizumab received surgery in a timely manner and were not delayed by immunotherapy-related side effects prior to surgery.

The ability for surgery to occur without delay was a very important observation.""

Robert Haddad, MD, chief of the Division of Head and Neck Oncology and the McGraw Chair in Head and Neck Oncology at Dana-Farber

Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing potential approval of this regimen for this patient population.

""It is very exciting to see this first positive trial of upfront immunotherapy moving forward with the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with head and neck cancer worldwide,"" said Uppaluri, who expects further analysis of the study data after a longer follow-up later this year.

This new regimen would represent a substantial change in workflow for head and neck cancer care. Currently, patients see a surgeon for a definitive diagnosis via biopsy and, if positive, move straight into surgery. The addition of immunotherapy prior to surgery requires a robust multidisciplinary approach.

""The value of multidisciplinary care in head and neck cancer becomes even more important with this approach of providing immunotherapy prior to surgery,"" Haddad said. ""The mindset of many surgical oncologists in the U.S. and the world will need to evolve to incorporate this paradigm shift.""

""Our multidisciplinary teams are now focused on determining if this progress can be improved upon with different agents or with combinations of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in head and neck cancer,"" Uppaluri said. ""This study really has opened up the potential for neoadjuvant treatment to make a difference for our patients with head and neck cancers.""

Analytical instruments underpin the measurement, monitoring, and control of a diverse array of processes in a wide range of industries.

Choosing the right equipment and adopting innovative methodologies can significantly improve the accuracy of results. Three noteworthy analytical methods include:

Process analyzers like mass spectrometers offer continuous, real-time monitoring of solids, liquids, and gases. Striking a balance between sensitivity and resolution remains one of the biggest challenges in designing these instruments, but Fluid Metering pumps offer precise measurement solutions for both liquid and gas applications.

Incorporating these pumps into mass spectrometers helps to improve the accuracy and reliability of readings, ensuring optimal process control and safety.

Water quality is a critical concern across numerous sectors. Providing reliable solutions for monitoring and analyzing water parameters is essential to support both environmental and public health.

One of the key challenges in developing efficient water quality analyzers is the need for frequent recalibration.

Fluid Metering pumps address this issue by maintaining 0.5 % precision over millions of cycles without the need for maintenance or recalibration. This ensures stable, long-term performance—helping to support safety and regulatory compliance in water assessment and treatment processes.

Pressure drops and other pressure-related issues typically arise when designing chromatography machines. Fluid Metering pumps are able to maintain consistent flow and pressure, enabling precise flow control and ensuring the ideal mixing ratio for fluid dilution. These pumps' low shear, non-destructive capabilities also make them suitable for working with delicate samples.

The importance of real-time precision and reliability in measurement and analysis cannot be overstated in today's analytical landscape. Advanced solutions are meeting the unique challenges faced by industries across the board.

Dr. Ho Sang Jung and his research team from the Advanced Bio and Healthcare Materials Research Division at the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), in collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, have developed a technology that enables the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes using synovial fluid. This marks the first such achievement in Korea.

According to some studies, over 50% of the population aged 65 and older experience symptoms of osteoarthritis, while rheumatoid arthritis is known to be a serious chronic disease that affects approximately 1 in 100 people over the course of their lifetime. Although osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis may appear similar, they differ in both their causes and treatments, making accurate differentiation at the early diagnosis stage critically important. Until now, diagnosis has relied on X-rays, MRI scans, and blood tests, which are time-consuming, costly, and limited in accuracy.

The human joints contain a fluid known as synovial fluid. The research team focused on the differences in the composition of metabolites-byproducts of chemical processes occurring within the body-present in this fluid. By analyzing these metabolic differences, they developed a technology capable of distinguishing between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes, as well as assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.

 The research team utilized Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, a phenomenon in which the optical signals of molecules are amplified by several million times. This technology amplifies signals from trace molecules present in synovial fluid and, through a combination of AI-based analysis and mathematical algorithms, detects minute substances responsible for arthritis. In addition, the team developed a simple and rapid diagnostic method using a sensor composed of a sea urchin-shaped gold nanostructure formed on a paper surface with high moisture absorption, enabling efficient detection via body fluids.

 In collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, the research team conducted tests using this technology on 120 patients. The results showed that osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis could be diagnosed and distinguished with an accuracy of over 94%. Furthermore, the technology achieved over 95% accuracy in determining the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings demonstrate that the technology not only significantly reduces the time and cost of arthritis diagnosis but also ensures a high level of diagnostic accuracy.

If this technology is commercialized, it will not only aid in diagnosis but also be highly useful in monitoring treatment progress. We also plan to continue expanding our research to cover a wider range of diseases in the future.""

Dr. Ho Sang Jung, lead researcher at KIMS

This research was funded by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program and the Global Young Researcher Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), as well as the Materials and Components Technology Development Program of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE). The research findings were published online on March 30 and will appear in the April 2025 issue of Small (IF: 13), a globally renowned scientific journal in the field of nanomaterials.

A study on donor lungs preserved outside the body before transplantation demonstrated that the hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) technique is a safe and effective lung preservation method, even with total out-of-body times approaching 20 hours.

Jitte Jennekens, MSc, organ perfusionist/transplant coordinator at the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, presented the study results at today's Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in Boston.

""This technique is being used to preserve donor livers and kidneys and is being studied in clinical trials for hearts, but it hasn't gotten that much attention for lung preservation yet,"" said Jennekens. 

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique that allows for donor lungs to be maintained, assessed, and potentially reconditioned outside of the body before transplantation. The lungs are connected to a pump and a ventilator and perfused with a solution that functions as a physiological fluid.

The UMC Utrecht developed its HOPE protocol to safely extend perfusion times, to maintain the viability of the lungs overnight until the transplantation can be performed during the day.

Donor lungs selected for EVLP are typically transported on ice and then warmed to 37 degrees Celsius using a normothermic EVLP (called nEVLP) protocol for functional assessment. Following nEVLP, the lungs are then returned to ice until the transplant begins.

The HOPE protocol eliminates the second period on ice by assessing the lungs during one hour of nEVLP and then preserving the lungs at 12 degrees C until the procedure.

Jennekens presented data comparing the outcomes of 12 cases conducted using the nEVLP-HOPE protocol with a historical cohort of donor lungs transplanted directly into patients without ex vivo lung perfusion. 

The control cohort included 118 cases of lungs transplanted directly without perfusion between 2017 and 2022. The cases were performed between 2022 and 2024 using the HOPE protocol for logistical reasons.

No lungs in the nEVLP-HOPE group were rejected for transplantation, and short-term outcomes were similar between the study and control groups.

""Our findings indicate that HOPE is a safe and effective lung preservation method after a period of normothermic EVLP,"" Jennekens said.

Jennekens said the next step is to determine the preservation strategy that will be most beneficial to a specific type of donor lung.

""Extending perfusion times for donor lungs outside of the body will allow for a future in which donor lungs can be optimized with different therapies,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Heart transplant volume rises with adoption of DCD techniques","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250427/Heart-transplant-volume-rises-with-adoption-of-DCD-techniques.aspx","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 02:46:00 GMT","

Researchers at the Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) marked the 10-year anniversary of modern heart donation after circulatory death (DCD), a technique that has significantly increased transplant volumes around the world.

Sarah Scheuer, MD, PhD, said that most centers that have started a DCD program experience an approximately 30 percent increase in their transplant volume.

""It's arguably the biggest shift in heart transplantation since the introduction of modern immunosuppression,"" she said.

In a DCD transplant, the heart comes from a donor whose circulatory and respiratory functions have stopped but who did not meet criteria for brain death.

""The first heart transplants performed in the '60s and '70s all preceded the legislation surrounding brain death, so in essence, they were DCD,"" said Dr. Scheuer, MD, PhD, a cardiothoracic surgeon trainee at St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia.

After brain death criteria were established in 1981, donation after brain death (DBD) was the predominant source of donated hearts for nearly five decades.

The first modern DCD heart transplant was performed at St. Vincent's Hospital in 2014; the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, England, followed with their first in 2015. The modern DCD pathway was developed over a 10-year period of research and laboratory work conducted in Australia and the UK, both of which are challenged by the limited availability of donor organs.

In 2022, a randomized, controlled trial in the United States showed that transplantation outcomes with DCD hearts were comparable to traditional (DBD) hearts.

""The successful US trial led to a real explosion of the field within the USA with increasing numbers of centers starting modern DCD heart transplant programs,"" Dr. Scheuer said. ""It's a huge impact on the availability of donor hearts.""

Over the past decade, 123 DCD hearts have been transplanted as part of the St. Vincent's DCD program, and 134 DCD hearts have been transplanted at Royal Papworth Hospital.

""Papworth and St. Vincent's have both had a long history of innovation and research within our heart transplant programs,"" said Dr. Scheuer. ""We're always pushing the boundaries, partially out of necessity, and also out of a desire to offer transplantation to more people because, in many ways, it's the best treatment for end-stage heart failure.""

Dr. Stephen Pettit, a transplant lead and consultant cardiologist at Royal Papworth Hospital, said DCD heart transplantation is gradually spreading worldwide, increasing the use of hearts that otherwise could not have been donated.

""Families of potential organ donors, who must give permission before organs are donated in the UK, have been very supportive of DCD heart transplantation,"" Dr. Pettit said. ""The DCD process makes sense to families who sometimes struggle with the concept of brain death.""

Researchers are looking for biomarkers to help identify whether DCD hearts are in good condition before transplantation and exploring less costly options for preserving the donor heart (called perfusion) during transportation. A shift toward regenerative medicine is also on the horizon.

""We may get to the point where we put a heart on a perfusion or preservation device and spend the next few hours effectively improving the function of that organ,"" said Dr. Scheuer. ""I think we'll also get more clarity on the best method of preserving hearts during DCD transplantation.""

For now, she's gratified by the many lives changed by transplantation, including a St. Vincent patient who received a DBD heart as a teenager and, more recently, a second DCD heart in his 40s.

""We're at a point with heart transplantation where some patients will live a relatively normal duration of life,"" she said. ""I don't think we have any other treatment for heart failure that can offer that potential outcome.""

It's a common misconception that fluids with different flow rate requirements always need separate pumps. In reality, that's not necessarily the case.



Image Credit: Fluid Metering, Inc.

When working with two fluids that require different flow rates, there are alternative solutions worth considering. In some situations, using a single pump can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

This article explores practical options for handling different fluids with varying flow rates.

Some application examples may warrant the use of separate pumps for working with different fluids, but there are other options. For example, a duplex pump featuring two pump heads can be calibrated at different values.

These ‘2-for-1' pumps feature a single drive motor, despite being able to drive two different pump heads with two different mix ratios. These types of pumps are extremely beneficial to users looking to simplify their operations and save space within the lab environment.

The need for separate pumps or a single pump option depends largely on a specific application's needs, but a duplex pump can often be used to process different fluids at different flow rates.

If your application allows you to meter multiple fluids using a single pump, there are several potential benefits to consider. Here are some of the key advantages:

The most significant benefit of using a single pump is the simplification of the electrical system. Two pumps necessitate the use of multiple motor controllers to operate at independent speeds, adding to the system's complexity in terms of integration. Duplex pumps help to reduce the complexity of the fluidic system.

Using a single pump instead of two saves space within both the lab environment and within the instrument itself. As well as its reduced space requirements, this can help improve reliability, reduce maintenance requirements, and reduce downtime, effectively streamlining overall operations.

Using a single pump should also reduce its overall cost, especially when leveraging a single duplex pump rather than acquiring multiple units. Despite its versatility, the duplex pump will often cost less to manufacture than two standard pumps.

Applications requiring flow outputs in multiples of two may not be adequately served by a single pump. For example, increased complexity in the fluidic system can lead to increased system size, increased cost, and additional leak points.

The decision to work with one pump versus two separate pumps should always be based on the requirements of the application in question.

Fluid Metering, Inc. offers a range of duplex pump options able to accommodate applications where it is beneficial to use a single pump for processing different fluids at different flow rates. Various models with dual shaft or dual head options are available, from stepper base options to the QB series of pumps.

It is advisable to contact Fluid Metering prior to purchasing a pump solution to ensure the best combination of pump head and calibration is provided for the specific application.

It is important to note, however, that while this article primarily discussed the duplex pump, many other products in Fluid Metering's portfolio can be used for the same purpose.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have uncovered a unique ability of a special subtype of natural killer cells in the immune system, called adaptive NK cells, to remember ovarian tumors and effectively attack them. The discovery, published in Cancer Immunology Research, could pave the way for new, more powerful immunotherapies for difficult-to-treat cancers.

NK cells, or natural killer cells, are white blood cells that play a central role in the body's defense against viral infections and cancer. NK cells can identify and destroy unhealthy-looking cells, such as tumor cells, without prior exposure.

Adaptive NK cells, aNK cells, are a subset of NK cells that can remember past infections or tumors and react more strongly the next time they encounter the same threat. This ability makes them particularly promising for cancer treatment.

The study shows that aNK cells can remember tumor-specific signals, infiltrate and fight cancer cells, and cooperate with other immune cells to become even more effective, making them particularly attractive for cancer treatment.

""Our results demonstrate that aNK cells have great potential for treating cancer, especially for patients with difficult-to-treat ovarian cancer,"" says Dhifaf Sarhan, senior lecturer at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.

""The study also challenges previous perceptions of NK cells, which have historically been considered only innate immune cells with no memory function against cancer,"" she continues. ""This opens new opportunities for the development of innovative immunotherapies.""

The study involved comprehensive analyses of human immune cells and ovarian tumor tissues, utilising advanced RNA and gene expression mapping techniques at the single-cell level. This allowed the researchers to investigate how aNK cells interact with ovarian cancer tumor cells.

The next step in our research is to develop methods that increase the number and activity of aNK cells in patients, followed by clinical trials to evaluate their effect on patient survival rates.""

A century after early warnings, researchers now fear that yellow fever could erupt beyond its historical strongholds, posing an unprecedented threat to billions in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.

Study: Yellow Jack: a modern threat to Asia-Pacific countries? Image Credit: nechaevkon / Shutterstock

Early 20th-century quarantine efforts in Hawai'i successfully halted YFV outbreaks after infected ships arrived from South America, demonstrating the effectiveness of preemptive public health measures.

A recent study published in the journal npj Viruses proposed that global trends, including unprecedented urbanization, increased international travel, and the expansion of mosquito habitats, increase the odds of the geographic spread of the yellow fever (YF) virus (YFV).

YF, caused by YFV, is an acute viral illness in humans and several nonhuman primates. Unlike other mosquito-borne diseases, humans infected with YFV exhibit heightened viremia and are efficient amplifying hosts, allowing for inter-human transmission by mosquitoes. This makes YFV particularly capable of sparking urban epidemics, as infected people can efficiently infect mosquitoes that bite them. The YF mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is the primary urban vector, being anthropophilic and adapted to the human environment.

Both YFV and YF mosquitoes originated in African forests and were introduced into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade before or in the 1600s. During the colonial era in North America, Caribbean trading vessels imported yellow fever (YF) mosquitoes to coastal port cities in the eastern United States (US). Onboard YFV transmission could ensue, leading to quarantine.

Once an area was infested with YF mosquitoes, YFV infection followed soon, resulting in epidemics over the past three centuries. An effective YFV vaccine, developed in the 1930s, and the eradication of YF mosquitoes in the Western Hemisphere eventually led to the cessation of YFV transmission in the Americas. Nevertheless, enzootic cycles in nonhuman primates and sylvatic mosquitoes continued in the forest canopies of the American tropics and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Further, human-amplified urban YF epidemics have occurred recently in Africa. The reasons for the reemergence of YF epidemics are unclear but are believed to be due to various factors, including human population expansion, inadequate vaccine coverage, and a lack of effective mosquito control. The study notes that, for example, recent years (2016–2023) have seen an increase in YF spillover from sylvatic cycles in both Africa and the Americas, raising alarms about further geographic spread.

Historic U.S. epidemics, such as Philadelphia's 1793 outbreak that claimed 10% of the population, permanently altered societal behaviors, influencing urban planning and disease response strategies.

The paper is published on the 100th anniversary of epidemiologist H.R. Carter's original warning about yellow fever's potential to invade the Asia-Pacific region, and the authors stress that many of Carter's concerns are now more pressing than ever.

Notably, YFV has not been transmitted in Asia so far. However, studies suggest a possibility of YFV expansion to the Asia Pacific region. The paper emphasizes that over two billion susceptible people in the Asia-Pacific region live in areas infested by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, with no natural herd immunity to YFV. This was recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries but deemed unlikely due to logistical barriers. Nevertheless, the threat of YFV spread to Asia was underscored once Aedes aegypti was identified as a YFV vector in 1903. The present study reviewed the YF threat to the Asia Pacific.

The YF mosquito eradication program was initiated in the United States in 1962 and was abandoned seven years later due to repeated importations from countries without similar policies. Meanwhile, the persistence of YF mosquitoes in limited refugia has gradually led to reinfestation across the Americas, which continues to this day.

Yellow fever's “extrinsic incubation” period, the 10-day delay between a mosquito biting an infected host and transmitting the virus, was first documented in 1898, reshaping outbreak containment protocols.

Global trends have facilitated the resurgence and spread of YF, including population growth, urbanization, the emergence of megacities, rapid transportation, trade globalization, and the expansion of YF-carrying mosquitoes. For instance, it was estimated that over four billion people traveled internationally by airplane in 2019, and a 2016 study found that 60 million unvaccinated people traveled to or from YF-endemic countries to areas infested with yellow fever mosquitoes. Travel by unvaccinated individuals from or to YF-endemic areas increases the probability of the introduction of YFV to non-endemic countries infested with Aedes aegypti.

Besides, if YFV is introduced in a permissive country, the disease could first be misdiagnosed as dengue. This risk is heightened because early or mild YF cases can closely resemble other flavivirus infections, and cross-reactive immunity complicates laboratory diagnosis. However, some mitigating factors reduce the risk of YFV transmission, such as the World Health Organization's (WHO) “Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics” program, which aims to increase YF vaccine access and coverage. Another factor is that the severe form of YF is remarkable and easily diagnosed.

Besides, travel history raises suspicion about YF, and imported cases are likely to be recognized early. Nonetheless, the study warns that most countries infested with YF mosquitoes lack the public health infrastructure to effectively control mosquitoes, rapidly distribute vaccines, or manage a surge of clinical cases. As such, a large YF epidemic could cause chaos in a non-endemic country. The paper warns explicitly that the combination of high case–fatality ratio, hemorrhagic symptoms, and inadequate vaccine supply could rapidly overwhelm public health systems.

The fundamental question is why no YF epidemic has occurred in permissive urban centers of Asia-Pacific or tropical America. Moreover, recent pandemics of chikungunya, Zika virus disease, and dengue suggest ideal epidemiological conditions for the global and regional transmission of YFV. The article frames this as an “enigma,” noting that unraveling why YF has not yet spread in these regions can help in designing effective preventive measures.

Possible explanations for the lack of YF spread include cross-protective immunity from Zika, dengue, and other orthoflavivirus, demographic and geographic obstacles, non-adaptation of YFV lineages to the YF mosquito-human urban cycle, effective mosquito control in at-risk areas, good surveillance and rapid response containment, variable YF mosquito densities, variable host-vector competence, and plain old luck, among others. In particular, the article highlights that areas endemic for dengue and other flaviviruses may have populations with cross-reactive immunity, which could either reduce disease severity or suppress transmission, though this remains to be confirmed in humans.

Brazil's 1938 eradication of Aedes aegypti, achieved through door-to-door insecticide campaigns, collapsed by the 1970s due to funding cuts, allowing the mosquito to resurge globally.

Effective control and prevention of YF will require more information on the epidemiology, biology, and genetic diversity of YFV, as well as enhanced surveillance and improved tools to prevent, identify, and contain transmission. Although a highly effective and safe YF vaccine is available, its supply is limited, and significant upscaling will be necessary for widespread use. The study notes that current egg-based vaccine production is difficult to rapidly scale up in emergencies, contributing to shortages during outbreaks.

Further, while new mosquito control tools in the pipeline appear promising, none provide effective emergency and long-term control at the required scale. Moreover, public health infrastructure should be built to address Aedes-linked viral diseases. The article emphasizes the urgent need for research into new vaccine platforms, sustainable mosquito control strategies, antivirals, improved surveillance, and integration of vaccination with vector control. Thus, successful YF containment requires extensive capacity-building and research in most tropical urban centers.

In summary, the concern that YFV will spread to the Asia Pacific region, which was raised a century ago, remains equally pressing today, and the odds of such a catastrophe may be even higher now. The authors explicitly warn that if a yellow fever pandemic were to occur in today's world, its much higher lethality could make the COVID-19 pandemic pale by comparison, resulting in a devastating global public health crisis. Further, the risk in 2025 is amplified by ideal social, epidemiological, and ecological conditions for spreading and transmitting YFV and its mosquito vector. Moreover, it is unlikely that the global trends responsible for the elevated risk will abate.

To provide the right treatment for MS, it is important to know when the disease changes from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive, a transition that is currently recognized on average three years too late. Researchers at Uppsala University have now developed an AI model that can determine with 90 per cent certainty which variant the patient has. The model increases the chances of starting the right treatment in time and thus slowing the progression of the disease.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In Sweden, there are approximately 22,000 people living with MS. Most patients start with the relapsing-remitting form (RRMS), which is characterised by episodes of deterioration with intervening periods of stability. Over time, many people transition to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), where their symptoms instead get steadily worse, without obvious breaks. Identifying this transition is important because the two different forms of MS require different treatments. Currently, the diagnosis is made on average three years after the transition begins, which can lead to patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective.

The new AI model summarizes clinical data from over 22,000 patients in the Swedish MS Registry. The model is based on data already collected during regular healthcare visits, such as neurological tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and ongoing treatments.

""By recognizing patterns from previous patients, the model can determine whether a patient has the relapsing-remitting form or whether the disease has transitioned to secondary progressive MS. What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment. This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment,"" says Kim Kultima, who led the study.

In the study, now published in the journal Digital Medicine, the model identified the transition to secondary progressive MS correctly or earlier than documented in the patient's medical records in almost 87 per cent of cases, with an overall accuracy of around 90 per cent.

""For patients, this means that the diagnosis can be made earlier, which makes it possible to adjust the patient's treatment in time and slow down the progression of the disease. This also reduces the risk of patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective. In the long term, the model could also be used to identify suitable participants for clinical trials - which could contribute to more effective and individualised treatment strategies,"" Kultima concludes.

It sounds as if Hoffenheim want some financial compensation if Bischof is to join Bayern for the CWC.

In the summer, Bayern Munich will be participating in the inaugural summer edition of the Club World Cup. The tournament has been met with very mixed reception, but it will give incoming players a chance to immediately prove their mettle at their new clubs. Enter Tom Bischof, who has already agreed a free transfer to Bayern Munich for the summer. The 19-year-old Germany youth international will look to get a chance to prove he can compete with the likes of Joshua Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlović for a prominent role. 

However, there is a problem. Bischof's contract ends on the 30th of June, as is the nature of most contracts in European football, but the Club World Cup begins in mid June. If Bischof were to simply join in July, he would miss the group stages of the tournament, a very inconvenient situation indeed. Hoffenheim will need to release their youth academy graduate early from his contract, something their sporting director, Andreas Schicker, is willing to do. Still, a “good solution” will need to be found before Bischof can leave Hoffenheim: 

“Bayern have already contacted us. We won't stand in Tom Bischof's way. If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” Schicker tells reporter Dennis Bayer (via @iMiaSanMia). “I'm confident that a solution will be found.”

It sounds for all the world as if Hoffenheim want to receive a financial compensation in order to release Bischof from his contract, even though Hoffenheim will contest no matches during June. Would Bayern be willing to part with money to get Bischof in a few weeks sooner? We will have to see...

Which attackers could leave? Is Florian Wirtz truly the answer to Bayern Munich's problems? Let's talk about all that and more on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works — Weekend Warm-up Show.

La Gazzetta dello Sport reports Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid at the end of the season, which means he won't be on the Merengues' bench at the Club World Cup.

Former Italy international Ancelotti, the most successful coach in Real Madrid's history, will not coach the La Liga giants at the Club World Cup this summer.

The latest Gazzetta dello Sport report claims that Ancelotti will lead Real Madrid until the end of the season, but he will not be on their bench during the upcoming summer tournament, despite his contract expiring in 2026.

Xabi Alonso is seen as the most likely candidate to replace Ancelotti at the Bernabeu, while the Brazil Football Federation is still courting the Italian tactician ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Ancelotti said in one of his latest interviews that he “didn't want to know” about his future at Real Madrid, but insisted he would always be grateful to the club, regardless of any decision they made.

The Italian tactician returned to the Bernabéu for a second stint in 2021, winning the Champions League twice since then.

He had already lifted the most important European club competition in 2014 – the famous Decima – after two triumphs with Milan.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Al Hilal coach Jorge Jesus is confident João Cancelo will be fit for the FIFA Club World Cup after a hamstring injury ruled the Portuguese defender out for the rest of the AFC Champions League Elite Finals and Saudi Pro League season.

Limping off just before halftime, Cancelo's injury was the lone blemish on Al Hilal's thumping 7-0 win over South Korean side Gwangju FC in their ACLE quarterfinal on Friday, the 30-year-old having only just returned from a two-month layoff with a separate hamstring issue.

That earlier injury forced the former Manchester City star to miss Portugal's UEFA Nations League quarterfinal tie with Denmark in March, and this new issue casts a cloud on his ability to feature in Roberto Martínez's squad for their upcoming semifinal against Germany on June 4.

But while disappointed to lose him ahead of an ACLE semifinal meeting with fellow Saudi Arabian powers Al Ahli on Tuesday evening, his club coach is confident that he will have Cancelo available for Al Hilal's Club World Cup campaign, which will begin against Real Madrid in Miami on June 18.

""The only negative part [of the win over Gwangju] was the injury to João Cancelo,"" Jesus said through a interpreter.

""We lost a player who is very important to the team.

""We will not have him; he will be out of matches for between four to six weeks.

""So his season is going to be over, but he will be well prepared for the Club World Cup.""

A post shared by ESPN Asia (@espnasia)

The most successful side in the ACLE's history, previously becoming kings of Asia on four occasions -- most recently in 2021 -- Al Hilal will be seeking to qualify for a 10th continental final when they meet Al Ahli at the King Abdullah Sport City Stadium.

A very familiar opponent, Matthias Jaissle's Al Ahli are seeking their first Asian crown but will be able to take confidence from the last meeting, where a hat-trick from England striker Ivan Toney lifted them to a 3-2 win back in late February.

""That helps, definitely, to know and to feel that we are capable of beating Al Hilal,"" Jaissle said.

""The results over the last two seasons have always been tough and close matches where the details are deciding.

'[Al Hilal] is a club with a lot of quality, a really professional infrastructure. So, of course, we need to be at our best level.""

Made possible by the Asian Football Confederation doing away with the previous East-West segretation until the decider, three Saudi Arabian sides have reached the final four in this year's ACLE -- and received a further boost in their home country being tapped to serve as host for the new, regionalised staging of the quarterfinals through to the final.

On Wednesday, Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr will face J1 League outfit Kawasaki Frontale, who ensured that East Asia would remain represented in the competition on Sunday when Yasuto Wakizaka fired them to a 3-2 extra-time win over Qatari champions Al Saad.

""I think it proves that Saudi football is at a high level,"" Jesus said of the Saudi trio.

""If we have this number of Saudi teams in the semifinals, it's evidence that Saudi football is advancing more and more.

""This is proof on the ground that we have a very good level.""

...

Pep Guardiola has addressed recent reports claiming Kevin De Bruyne has no intention of representing Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup at the United States after being told he has no future at the Etihad Stadium.

De Bruyne will leave Manchester City at the end of the season after a decorated, trophy-laden decade in sky blue that has put him up there with the Premier League's best-ever imports and amongst the greatest midfielders to have played in England.

The 33-year-old was hopeful of a new deal to extend his stay at the Etihad Stadium but club bosses – including incoming sporting director Hugo Viana – relayed to the Belgium international that he does not feature in the club's plans next season.

     

Since his announcement confirming his impending departure earlier this month, De Bruyne has revealed in interviews he was left disappointed with the club's decision, admitting he was away from his family when Manchester City officials relayed their stance to the playmaker.

City are due to participate in the 32-club FIFA Club World Cup in the United States between June and July – between the end of their Premier League and FA Cup campaign(s) and the beginning of pre-season preparations for the 2025-26 campaign.

It emerged last week that De Bruyne has informed club bosses and Guardiola of his reluctance to travel with City to the United States for the Club World Cup amid fears of injury and a desire to take some time off to rest, recover and assess offers to make a decision on his future with his family.

After refusing to take questions on De Bruyne's future initially whilst speaking to the press ahead of Manchester City's FA Cup semi-final triumph over Nottingham Forest at the weekend, Guardiola was asked if there was any truth to De Bruyne's hesitation to play at the Club World Cup.

“I don't know any info about that,” said Guardiola, who kept De Bruyne on the bench for the entirety of Manchester City's 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Forest at Wembley on Sunday, with the Belgian expected to return to the lineup against Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Real Madrid is in one of the most critical stages of the season. With the final stretch of the competition in sight, decisions about the team's future are beginning to take shape. The most important: Carlo Ancelotti's future.

After a season of ups and downs and defeats in the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, the club would already be taking measures.

Although Carlo Ancelotti has a contract with Real Madrid until 2026, his future has been in doubt in recent weeks. The Italian, key in the club, has said he will respect Madrid's decision at the end of the season.

The latest setbacks, especially the eliminations in national and international competitions, have put his continuity on the line. According to Relevo, Madrid would have almost certainly decided to dismiss Carlo Ancelotti after La Liga, at the end of May.

This farewell could occur at Bernabéu, in a calm match, as the league options were reduced after the defeat against Barcelona.

If Madrid doesn't close the gap with Barcelona, May 25 against Real Sociedad could be the farewell of Ancelotti and his son, Davide.

With Carlo Ancelotti's departure, Real Madrid has already begun to think about the immediate future. One of the first challenges will be the Club World Cup, which will be played from June 14 to July 13 in the United States. According to reports from 'Relevo,' the club would have already spoken with Santiago Solari to take charge of the first team during this competition.

Solari, who is currently the Director of Soccer at Real Madrid, already has experience leading the first team. In 2018, when Julen Lopetegui was dismissed, Solari took on the responsibility of leading the team and achieved important victories, including the first major bet on Vinicius Jr.

Florentino Pérez sees Solari as the natural option for the Club World Cup, until hiring a long-term coach. The relationship between the Argentine and the club is solid, and his time with Castilla has allowed him to know Madrid's structure well.

This coaching change would be a provisional solution, as the club is searching for a coach for the next season. Xabi Alonso remains the favorite in the betting, although his situation at Bayer Leverkusen could complicate his arrival.

All eyes on the CWC because the Raumdeuter deserves a proper sendoff. 

With Thomas Müller's tenure at Bayern Munich coming to a close very soon, the attention is towards all the titles he can bag with the club before his departure. Müller's legacy at the club is unforgettable — he has played a pivotal role in the club's history. The trophies play testament — he is the second most decorated German player with 33 trophies after Toni Kroos. This statistic is however subject to change, with Kroos' retirement last year after bagging 34 trophies. 

However to Müller, titles do not mean everything. Per FIFA and @iMiaSanMia, he spoke on the upcoming Club World Cup. “It's not about titles. The title is just the piece of metal you get when you win the competition. But that's not what makes you happy,” he stated.

Further elaborating, he said that the journey matters more. “The journey there is what excites me. It's about constantly taking on the pressure, both physically and competitively – and winning,” he said. 

Looks like the Raumdeuter still enjoys winning but he just wants to do it in style. 

He explained his excitement about this tournament. “The attraction [of the competition], of course, is that it's a World Cup. In this format, it feels a bit more like a World Cup,” he described.

It goes without being said that all eyes will be on the CWC as it will be one last dance. For, the most unbelievable statement is now the truth — Thomas Müller will be playing his last game at Bayern Munich at the age of 35 years. The same age where the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Yann Sommer, Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski and Luka Modric were considered to still play at near-full capacity. Hell, they all bagged trophies at this age. One can only wonder what could have been, for it is only possible for us to enjoy the little time we have left with our own one club man.

The annual soccer calendar is approaching its business end, with title races across many of Europe's major leagues either already decided or close to being wrapped up (congratulations, Liverpool). However, there's still plenty of action to look forward to in the coming weeks and months.

The Champions League final is set for May 31, the Europa League final will be held 10 days earlier, and the newly revamped FIFA Club World Cup is also on the horizon.

Before any of that, though, comes the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup — the premier event in beach soccer.

Whether you're a seasoned beach soccer aficionado or a fan of the traditional game looking to try something new (and seriously exciting), here's everything you need to know about the upcoming tournament.

The 2025 Beach Soccer World Cup will be held in Mahé, Seychelles — a stunning island nation off the east coast of Africa.

The tournament, now in its 13th edition, kicks off on May 1 and concludes on May 11.

Sixteen teams will compete in the 2025 Beach Soccer World Cup, with representatives from every corner of the globe — from South America to Europe and, of course, the host continent, Africa.

Brazil, the reigning champion and the tournament's most successful nation with six titles, is the favourite to lift the crown once again, while Portugal and Italy are also expected to be among the main challengers.

Here's the full list of competing teams, along with their records in past tournaments.

The Beach Soccer World Cup kicks off on May 1 with the opening round of group stage fixtures. Each team will then play two more group stage matches—first on May 3, and again on May 5—with the top two teams from each of the four groups advancing to the quarterfinals on May 8.

The semifinals will take place on May 10, followed by the final and the third-place match on May 11.

All matches will be held at the Paradise Arena in Victoria, the capital of Seychelles. The purpose-built arena, which holds 5,000 spectators, was originally used for the 2024 tournament in Dubai, UAE. It was dismantled, shipped to Seychelles, and reassembled on a new sand and cement base as part of efforts to make the tournament as sustainable as possible.

Given that it's beach soccer, it probably comes as no surprise that the Beach Soccer World Cup has been held in some truly beautiful locations and stunning stadiums.

Among them is the iconic Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the inaugural tournament in 2005 as well as the 2006 and 2007 editions. Other notable venues include Nassau Stadium—also known as Malcolm Park—a $2.5 million state-of-the-art beach soccer arena in the Bahamas, and Estádio da Praia da Baía in Espinho, Portugal, a beachfront venue famous for its breathtaking views.

The 2025 Beach Soccer World Cup does not have an official broadcaster, but every game will be streamed for free on the FIFA+ website, which is available worldwide.

Losing the cup final to Barcelona was embarrassing enough, but Madrid went several steps further with their childish behaviour

In Japan, there is a philosophy that every person has three faces. The first is the one you show to the world, the one to be judged and build a public image upon. The second is what you portray to those closest to you. The third is who you keep to yourself, your true essence and personality, never to be cast upon by outsiders.

On Saturday in Seville, Real Madrid ripped off their third face like a mask and held it aloft, proudly or otherwise, as if it were Simba being raised up by Rafiki in the opening sequence of 'The Lion King'. Years, months, weeks and days of petulant nonsense came spewing out all ends before, during and after losing to Clasico rivals Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

It's bad enough being beaten by their nemesis from Catalunya on a normal day, but this was far from normal, even by these two raging crybabies' standards. What occurred in southern Spain this weekend will live on as infamous for Los Blancos, irrespective of how they will inevitably try and whitewash it from history.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Reds may have romped to a record-equalling 20th English championship, but there are doubts over their prospects of creating a dynasty

Jurgen Klopp was never in any doubt that the remaining members of the Liverpool side that ended the club's agonising wait for Premier League glory had another title in them - and he was right. Unfortunately for the German, it arrived the year after he stepped down as manager.

Klopp was nonetheless delighted to see his successor, Arne Slot, lead Liverpool to a record-equalling 20th English championship in the Dutchman's very first season at the helm.

And the Reds didn't just win the league, they absolutely ran away with it, opening up an unassailable 15-point lead over Arsenal with four rounds still remaining - which merely served to underline that sporting director Richard Hughes & Co. couldn't have picked a better replacement for Klopp.

However, despite the dominant nature of Liverpool's title triumph and the glorious success of their succession plan, many people are now wondering whether this is actually the end of an era of sustained success at Anfield rather than the dawn of a new dynasty...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Second Serve: How Madrid Open's extended format has split opinions of ATP and WTA players","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c8ep882y97ro","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:32:12 GMT","

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko weighs up the pros and cons of the extended Madrid Open.

With the two-week Madrid Open reaching the halfway point, it is the perfect time to revisit a thorny issue in tennis.

Stretching several ATP and WTA tournaments across a fortnight has caused some controversy - and it's debatable how successful the move has been.

The thinking was the elongated events would have greater gravitas - essentially creating 'mini Grand Slams'.

According to ATP and WTA bosses, that meant increased financial opportunities for more players.

Another benefit would be players having days off between matches, allowing for better recovery and, in theory, more high-quality matches.

Fans, in turn, would be more engaged and media coverage would increase, creating a buzz around them like the existing four majors.

For many, it has not panned out like that.

The players are certainly divided. In Madrid, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek both responded positively when asked what they preferred.

Sabalenka said she enjoys the longer format because she can ""rest"" physically and mentally between matches, while Swiatek added she doesn't ""think about it anymore"".

But the top stars - the ones who go regularly deep in these draws - are the players more likely to benefit from the days off.

Others further down the chain have voiced concerns.

The recent lawsuit lodged by the Professional Tennis Players' Association - which claimed to be on ""behalf of the entire player population"" - said that ""instead of providing professional tennis players more rest between tournaments to endure a longer season, the ATP and WTA have given them less"".

It was also telling that Novak Djokovic, who co-founded the PTPA, gave a lengthy answer about the subject in his pre-Madrid news conference.

Asked about Carlos Alcaraz saying he felt like a ""slave"" to the game, Djokovic referenced the negative effect of the extended events.

""Now we essentially don't have four Grand Slams - we have maybe 12 Grand Slams. It's a lot,"" he said.

Seven of the nine ATP Masters are now played over a fortnight, along with six of the 10 WTA 1000s.

The first week of the combined Madrid Open - a mixture of qualifying and main-draw matches -  felt like a slow burner.

The main stadiums at the Caja Magica were rarely full, although the grounds were swelled by hundreds of children on school trips. 

For many of those further afar, the disjointed scheduling can seem illogical and difficult to follow.

Will anything change?

ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi is committed to the format and, while the WTA insists the circuit is always under review, its chair Steve Simon also believes the structure does not increase workload.

It seems, as Swiatek basically said, everyone will just have to get on with it.

Emma Raducanu again had Mark Petchey in her coaching box at the Madrid Open. The British number two says she is happy with the ""informal"" arrangement"". 

Will Carlos Alcaraz be fit enough to defend his French Open men's singles title? The injured Spaniard hopes so, but is unsure whether he will be able to play beforehand after pulling out of Madrid.

The strange times continue for Novak Djokovic. The 37-year-old says losing his opening match of a tournament for the second time in a row is his ""new reality"".

While the rankings are not updated until after Madrid, the live standings show  a few interesting things.

Russia's Diana Shnaider is set to reach a new career high - and could break into the top 10 for the first time - if she goes deeper than the last 16.

In the men's rankings, Russia's Andrev Rublev will drop out of the top 10 after his Madrid title defence ended in the last 32, while Italy's Lorenzo Musetti is provisionally into the top 10 for the first time.

Most eyes this week will remain on the latter stages of the Madrid Open.

The prizes will be handed out at the weekend, with the women's singles final on Saturday and the men's on Sunday.

Attention will also increase over the coming days on another big story - Jannik Sinner's comeback.

Sinner, the men's world number one, is set to make his return from a three-month doping ban at next week's Italian Open.

World number six Jack Draper has led the British charge at the Madrid Open and was one of three men to reach the last 32.

Cameron Norrie has found a timely return to form after winning his first ATP main-draw matches since Indian Wells, while Jacob Fearnley - playing only his second tour-level clay-court event - came through qualifying.

The three British women who directly entered the main draw - Katie Boulter, Raducanu and Sonay Kartal - all won their opening matches before falling in the second round.

Francesca Jones fought through qualifying to reach the first round where - playing for the third straight day - she lost a tight battle to 2024 Australian Open semi-finalist Dayana Yastremska.

Boulter, playing alongside Daria Kasatkina, lost in the doubles first round, as did Olivia Nicholls with partner Tereza Mihalikova.

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.

As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.

As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.

Ben Shelton took out a chunk of the electronic advertising board at the Madrid Open during his clash with Jakub Mensik. The big-serving American star went down 6-1 6-4 to the recent Miami Open champion after a delay in proceedings during the second set.

Shelton, up 40-30 in the fourth game, faulted on his serve and the ball ended up hitting the board that had been displaying adverts behind Mensik. Play was momentarily stopped as it emerged that the small individual panel that Shelton hit had been damaged, displaying a black screen rather than the advertisement.

“The board has taken a bit of a hammering there,” Sky Sports commentator Nick Lester said. The panel had fallen out of the board, such as the power it was struck by, before an official came out to put it back into place.

Play soon resumed but Shelton, the world No. 13, had little joy and succumbed to defeat against Mensik. The Czech teenager is enjoying a breakthrough campaign, having beaten Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open final last month.

The board was not the only one to suffer issues in Madrid, with Shelton calling for the doctor in an error-laden opening set. He was able to continue, improving his form in the second, but ultimately could not compete with another heavy-hitting server in Mensik.

“Today was a good day in the office on my return,” the 19-year-old said after booking his place in the fourth round. “I know Ben can serve much better, but in this high altitude, it's always tough to break him.

“I knew that he was not feeling very well, me neither. But I still tried to reach my best level and that was the key. I'm glad I came out with the win.”

Mensik dropped just two of 28 points behind his first delivery and will next face Alexander Bublik in the last 16. While Shelton should be sticking around in the Spanish capital as he is due to play doubles with Rohan Bopanna.

Mensik is on an eight-match winning run at ATP Masters 1000s, having claimed his first title on tour in Miami. He could crack the top 20 this week with a positive run and will be buoyed by his 67-minute win over Shelton, improving to 6-1 against top 20 players this year.

“I enjoyed it a lot with my family, my friends, my close ones,” said Mensik of his upset in Miami against Djokovic. “But it's just one tournament. I'm trying to improve myself every week, the journey is still long and my goals are even further.”

The ATP Tour calendar currently has a heavy focus on clay, with the various events building up towards the French Open.

Casper Ruud is being tipped to win the French Open this year, but he is first eyeing success at the Madrid Open this week.

Carlos Alcaraz is capable of shining on clay in the absence of Rafael Nadal, although worryingly he was forced to withdraw from Madrid due to injury.

Nadal once dominated the clay courts, having won a record 14 French Open titles, with Alcaraz now aiming to take over from his idol.

Novak Djokovic meanwhile is still chasing an elusive 25th Grand Slam title on the ATP Tour, but his current form means that is unlikely to arrive at Roland Garros.

Djokovic suffered another early exit in his latest tournament in Madrid, with his struggles certainly suggesting that the changing of the guard is very much underway.

His fellow legends Nadal and Roger Federer have already retired, while the likes of young stars Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been enjoying huge success in recent seasons.

Moreover, a handful of regular top 10 players are now losing their places in the leaderboard to their younger counterparts.

Daniil Medvedev sits 10th in the current ATP Live Rankings, with Ruud in 14th, Andrey Rublev in 17th and Stefanos Tsitsipas in 18th.

Taking their places high in the rankings are the likes of 23-year-old Jack Draper, who is in sixth place, and 21-year-old Holger Rune in eighth.

Fellow youngsters Lorenzo Musetti, Ben Shelton and Arthur Fils meanwhile sit ninth, 12th and 13th respectively.

It is a change in men's tennis that has seemingly been coming for a while, but the constant battling of veteran names such as Djokovic and Medvedev helped delay the process.

But it seems that fans must now accept that the past is the past and the new generation have officially arrived, without even mentioning future superstars Joao Fonseca, Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien and Alex Michelsen among others.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Roland-Garros and Rafael Nadal have always been a love story written in red clay. Across two decades, the Spanish legend carved out an unparalleled legacy with 14 French Grand Slam titles, defining an era and earning his crown as the undisputed King of Clay. Now, as the 2025 tournament begins, that love story will be celebrated in unforgettable fashion with tickets and travel packages still available.

On Sunday, May 25, just one month from now and the opening day of this year's tournament, Nadal will be honoured in a special ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Following his official retirement in November 2024 after Spain's Davis Cup campaign, the 22-time Grand Slam champion is set to return – not to compete, but to be commemorated. French Grand Slam director Amelie Mauresmo announced the plans earlier this week, calling Nadal's contribution to the sport “deserving of the highest order of recognition.”

The tribute will take place during the day session in front of what is expected to be a capacity crowd. The ceremony will also honour 2000 women's champion Mary Pierce and French veteran Richard Gasquet, who is set to play his final Roland-Garros.

Carlos Alcaraz received flak from his agent, Albert Molina, and psychotherapist Juanjo Moreno for taking a trip to Ibiza midway through last season. Alcaraz felt the need for a little breather after a heartbreaking loss to Novak Djokovic in the French Open 2024 semi-final. Subsequently, he went to Ibiza, a well-renowned place for partying and nightlife. The decision reaped rewards for the Spaniard as he came back rejuvenated, with a hunger for victory.

The World No.3 was reprimanded by his agent Molina, but he knew what he was doing. The break immensely helped Alcaraz as he immediately won the Queen's title and then went on to take the momentum to attain the Wimbledon glory, by beating Djokovic in straight sets.

On the occasion of the release of ""Carlos Alcaraz: My Way"", a Netflix docuseries of the tennis sensation, his agent revealed what he suggested to his client back then.



""I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had a tournament at Queen's the following week and Wimbledon after that,"" Albert Molina told Netflix.

""I remember looking at Carlos and saying, 'Carlos, now's not the time. You're being selfish in the present with your future self.' And coming from Ibiza, he hadn't had enough time to prepare for Queen's to really guarantee a win,"" Juanjo Moreno said while echoing Molina's complaint.

While the experts he hired made all the sense and were talking in the best of Carlos Alcaraz's interest, Alcaraz went his way, and in hindsight, it could be gauged as the best decision.

Alcaraz narrated in the series that he took the call to have a short trip because the decision had worked before for him in the past.

""In 2023, I was already very mentally tired. It was 24/7, 100% thinking about tennis. And at Roland Garros, I lost to Djokovic in the semifinals. And I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends,"" Carlos Alcaraz said in his Netflix docuseries. ""I really made the most of it because I knew I might not get another three days like that. When I got back, I won Queen's and Wimbledon, of course.

""I'm not saying I won because of the partying but those days were good for me. And I believe if things are going well, you have to keep at it. I had to do it again this year.""

Carlos Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles till now, which is a towering feat at 21. He will be looking to augment the number this season, as he is seen as the heir who will take the glory of Big 3 forward.

Former world number one Andre Agassi is set to make his professional debut in the booming world of pickleball next week, teaming up with top-ranked star Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles event at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships.





Pickleball is an exciting paddle sport cum tennis-badminton fusion created in the year 1965 by a group of Americans. Played on smaller courts, using a perforated plastic ball, it has rapidly gained popularity across America and beyond.

 Agassi Joins Forces with Anna Leigh Waters



Anna Leigh Waters, who was projected to earn over $3 million last year as a professional pickleball player, found herself in need of a mixed doubles partner for this year's U.S. Open, which kicks off Saturday in Naples, Florida.

That's where Agassi entered the scene.



“Andre's goals are to grow the sport of pickleball, and that's a huge goal of mine,"" Waters explained.

 

She added, “I thought if we partnered together, this would be a really awesome way to grow the sport.""

 

 

 Agassi Brings Humor to the Court

Despite his legendary tennis credentials — eight Grand Slam titles and 60 ATP Tour victories — Agassi joked about his new role alongside Waters.

“She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play,"" Agassi quipped during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.

 

 

 Not a Full-Time Transition

While fans may be excited to see Agassi in pickleball, the 54-year-old clarified that he doesn't intend to pursue a professional pickleball career beyond this event.

“If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now,"" Agassi said, acknowledging that his life priorities have shifted.

 

 

The U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, Florida, are set to showcase not only the continued growth of the sport but also a unique crossover moment featuring one of tennis's most iconic figures.

The former “Break Point” star is prioritizing his privacy in the wake of the new series featuring Carlos Alcaraz.ByDavid KanePublished Apr 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 28, 2025

Daniil Medvedev is happy to entertain fans on the tennis court but is drawing the line at kind of 24/7 access Carlos Alcaraz gave to create his self-titled Netflix docuseries.Though Medvedev and Alcaraz participated in Break Point, an ensemble reality series that ran two seasons on the popular streaming service, the former was critical of his portrayal in the wake of the second season's release.“The series is not real life,” said the 2021 US Open champion of what fans and fellow players deemed his “villain edit,” and the experience appears to have soured him on the medium going forward.“I saw, for example, how Carlos's one was done, you know, and, damn, it's cameras all over you, all over the day,” Medvedev said at the Mutua Madrid Open on Sunday. “That's not me. That's just, I mean, I get, like when I'm on court I try to sign a lot of autographs. When I'm, let's say, even if you're in the official hotels or you're out on a holiday, a lot of people camp outside the hotels. And it's fine, I sign, I take pictures. But like when I'm having dinner, when I'm with my family I don't.“I sometimes can be, it's not rude, but people are like, ‘Oh, let's take a photo,' when I'm eating dinner. And I'm like, ‘Nope.' After dinner's it's okay. So I'm pretty, I can be pretty rude with my personal space.”

Medvedev eased through his first match in Madrid on Sunday after getting a walkover into the third round.

Alcaraz's series, entitled My Way, dropped last week and chronicled the Spaniard's 2024 season with featured interviews from coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, idols like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal and members of his family—Medvedev citing the latter as a primary reason for his reluctance.“If I give it to the documentary I'm going to get nuts, like because, especially when you give your permission to them, they want more. They want to film your daughters, they want to film your wife, they want to ask them questions, they want to ask you more about your personal life.“I remember I saw an interview of Jack Harlow, and he said that people around you, not your friends, like fans and everyone, they want to know everything about you. They want to know who you date, who, how, what you have for dinner, if you take your shower for 5 or 15 minutes. But you need to keep something for yourself, otherwise they take all your life away.“So that's probably why I will never do a documentary, but let's see, I never say never.”Perhaps Medvedev takes the camera into his own hands and launches a YouTube channel, but few can argue the former world No. 1, who is looking to complete a set of Masters 1000 semifinal appearances at the Caja Magica this week, doesn't already give us plenty of content.

🇵🇹 The Millennium Estoril Open is taking a one-year break as an ATP Challenger 175 event before returning to the ATP Tour in 2026. But given the field, you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise.Leading the event on the clay in Portugal is Felix Auger-Aliassime, who received a wild card into the main draw.

""None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires,"" Scott Pelley said at the end of Sunday's broadcast.


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


	Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes ended by addressing executive producer Bill Owens' surprise departure last week.


	In the show's “The Last Minute” segment, correspondent Scott Pelley took a moment to address Owens' resignation as executive producer, a position he'd held since 2019. 




	Noting that 60 Minutes has covered many controversial stories during its nearly six-decade run, Pelley gave Owens credit for making sure those stories “were accurate and fair. He was tough that way.”

	He continued: “But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”

	Pelley noted that Owens had been with CBS News for 40 years — 26 of those at 60 Minutes — and that “no one here is happy about” his departure. Owens was only the third executive producer in the history of the CBS newsmagazine. Last year, he added oversight of CBS Evening News to his plate.


	Owens announced his shock resignation last week. In an email to staff, he cited an inability “to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes.”


	“Over the past months, it has…become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it,” Owens wrote. “To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience. So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.”


	Read Pelley's full comments on 60 Minutes below:


In tonight's last minute, a note on Bill Owens, who until this past week was executive producer of 60 Minutes. He was our boss.


Bill was with CBS News nearly 40 years, 26 years at 60 Minutes. He covered the world, covered combat, the White House. His was a quest to open minds, not close them.


If you've ever worked hard for a boss because you admired him, then you understand what we've enjoyed here. 


Bill resigned Tuesday. It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us and you.


Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial. Lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration.












Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way. But our parent company, Paramount is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it.


Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.


No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.

The two-time Oscar winner screened 2017's 'Downsizing' on the Lido. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Two-time Oscar-winning director Alexander Payne (The Holdovers, Sideways, Nebraska) will head up this year's Venice Film Festival international jury, Venice unveiled Monday.


	Payne will oversee the jury of film professionals that picks the Golden Lion for best film at the 82nd Venice festival, which runs Aug. 27 to Sept. 6.




	“It's an enormous honor and joy to serve on the jury at Venice,” Payne said in a statement. “Although I share a filmmaker's ambivalence about comparing films against one another, I revere the Venice Film Festival's nearly 100-year history of loudly celebrating film as an art form. I couldn't be more excited.”

	Venice Festival director Alberto Barbera said Payne “belongs to the small circle of filmmakers-cinephiles whose passion for cinema is fueled by knowledge of films of the past and curiosity about contemporary cinema, without boundaries or barriers of any kind. These qualities — along with his experience as a screenwriter — make him an ideal candidate to preside over the work of the Venice Jury, which is called upon to evaluate films from around the world. I am grateful to Alexander for accepting my invitation, which seals an acquaintance that goes back to the days of his graduation short film at UCLA.”

	Payne's films have racked up a total of 24 Oscar nominations, including four best picture and three best director nominations. His two Oscar wins have come for best adapted screenplay, for Sideways (2004) and The Descendants (2011). His last feature, The Holdovers (2023), won best supporting actress for Da'Vine Joy Randolph.


	Payne has only once screened a film in the Venice competition, with Downsizing debuting on the Lido in 2017.

Bella Ramsey breaks down their toughest scene, which came during the third episode of season two on Sunday. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Bella Ramsey‘s Ellie experiences quite a bit of action, heartbreak and turmoil in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. 


	But a quiet scene from Sunday's third episode was actually the toughest for them to shoot. 




	Ramsey recalled that the scene where Ellie weeps over the loss of Joel (Pedro Pascal) while smelling one of his jackets in the closet was the scene they were most worried about pulling off.


	“Oh God, in the closet, that was the hardest [scene],” the 21-year-old Emmy nominee said. “So I really struggle with crying in scenes. I can get a tear out, but that's different to crying. And even getting the tear, it doesn't come easy for me. I don't cry in front of people in my everyday life. A very, very limited amount of people in my life will see me cry. And so having to do that on a set full of people with the monitor and then more people watching the monitors…it's virtually impossible for me. So I was really worried about that scene, and that was the toughest one for me to shoot.”

					Pedro Pascal Calls J.K. Rowling a ""Heinous Loser"" for Latest Trans Comments		
			









	But Ramsey eventually pulled it off, and what worked was rather ironic. 


	“I've tried [before in crying scenes] to think about something really sad in my own life and try and evoke emotions that way,” Ramsey said. “That doesn't really work for me because it takes me out of the truth of the situation for Ellie. So I was remembering the happiest of memories that I have with Pedro.” 


	“The thing that is always the saddest for me is remembering the happy things,” they continued. “I was remembering us the first few times that we met and the whole of shooting season one together, and the funniest moments. I was remembering all of that and through the lens of losing him — not just Joel and Ellie, but like me and Pedro — because the memories of me and Pedro and Joel and Ellie are so intertwined for me.” 


	During last week's The Hollywood Reporter cover story, Ramsey elaborated on their feelings about parting ways (in the workplace, at least) with Pascal. 


	“Understanding [from the show's outset] the limited time me and Pedro have together has made us really cherish each other more,” Ramsey says. “It was something that we got quite emotional about while we were shooting. We'll be in each other's lives forever, and we'll be in each other's hearts forever.”

	











	Ramsey also discussed what it was like ascending to become the HBO hit's sole lead now that Pascal's character was killed off. 


	“I would never consider myself a leader,” Ramsey says. “But there's something that happens when I'm given responsibility where I really like the feeling and I take the responsibility very seriously. I'm very happy to lead a set and have a lot of influence over the tone and dynamic, especially given there's preconceived ideas about a young person who's No. 1 on the call sheet…. Everybody should know they're valued as a crewmember, as a castmember, and that we're all equals.”

The special, set to run May 1, will also feature reports from Jacob Soboroff on the impact of the DOGE cuts.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle will host a primetime special featuring an audience of federal workers whose jobs were slashed by DOGE.


	“100 Days of Trump: A Town Hall With Forced Out Federal Workers,” will air Thursday, May 1 at 9 p.m.




	“It has been like drinking from a fire hose, whether it's executive orders, deportations, tariffs, and what's happened to all the federal workers because of the DOGE situation,” Ruhle tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. “We thought DOGE and this enormous impact on federal workers would be a great way for us to press pause and show people what's happening.”

	Ruhle says that the audience of the town hall will feature a range of former federal workers, including some forced out by Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, Veterans Affairs and other agencies.




			Related Video		







	“I'm viewing our audience as part of this conversation, not just there to stand up and ask questions the way you often see a traditional town hall,” Ruhle says. “I see every person in that room as also an important guest, an important voice, because this is not about partisanship. This isn't about this administration. This is about America, because much of what the President is trying to do right now is reshape the way we live, the way we work, the way we see our country, the way other countries see us.”


	Jacob Soboroff, meanwhile, will deliver stories about how the cuts will impact different parts of the country.


	He's headed to West Virginia next week to show what these jobs are and where they are,” Ruhle says. “Think about West Virginia. It is a state that has been crushed in terms of its economy. It's one of the lowest ranking states in terms of health care, in terms of education, and now we're going to see massive job cuts.


	“Take a state like Alabama, a deep red state, I don't think people would realize that the largest employer in the state of Alabama is the University of Alabama, which is obviously tied to their hospital system,” Ruhle adds. “It's why you've got Republican senator Katie Britt in Alabama urging the President not to have these sweeping cuts, because when you take cuts like that, you're going to impact millions and millions and millions of potential lives if we're cutting off medical research.”


	For Ruhle, who frequently covers business and economics given her background as a financial reporter, the cuts are part and parcel of the sweeping tariffs announced earlier this month as part of an effort to reshape the economy. Though she notes that many Americans do want to shake up what had been the status quo.

	











	“It's a lot of chaos. But there is some boldness to it if you want to shake up the status quo, and most people would argue they have some appetite for shaking up status quo, right?” Ruhle says. “But there's a difference between shaking up the status quo, optimizing the government, optimizing what we do and how we spend. There's a large gap between that and where we are right now.


	“When people think about federal workers, they just think bloated D.C. And you know, there is a big positive appetite for the idea of DOGE,” Ruhle says. “You can speak to people at any income level, any demographic, any political affiliation, and people will say the government is too big, the government is too bloated, the government doesn't work for me. And that led way to the openness to the idea of DOGE. Then DOGE came, and what it's actually doing is having a sweeping effect on all different parts of this country and our economy, and we want to shine a spotlight and show it, because it's not something that's just happening in DC.”

Van will oversee both the business and editorial teams, with Billboard editor-in-chief Hannah Karp now reporting to him directly.

	Paul Grein



Chubby Checker, whose “The Twist” was a global smash in 1960, has been eligible for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame since the first class was inducted in 1986, but he was never even nominated until this year. Despite having been ignored for decades, he made it in his first time on the ballot.


	So did first-time nominees Bad Company, Joe Cocker and Outkast, as well as Cyndi Lauper and The White Stripes, who had each been nominated once before, and Soundgarden, which had been nominated twice before. These seven acts were all inducted in the performer category.

	











	The inductees were announced by Ryan Seacrest on ABC's American Idol on Sunday night (April 27).

	There are six other inductees this year in other categories. Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon are set to receive the musical influence award; Philly Soul producer Thom Bell, English studio pianist/organist Nicky Hopkins and studio bass guitarist Carole Kaye (who was part of the fabled Wrecking Crew of top L.A. studio musicians) will receive the musical excellence award; and producer and label executive Lenny Waronker will receive the Ahmet Ertegun Award.


	Sadly, several of these people didn't live to see their inductions. Hopkins died in 1994 at age 50; Zevon in 2003 at 56; Chris Cornell of Soundgarden in 2017 at 52; and Bell in 2022 at 79.


	Checker had to wait even longer for induction than Cher, who was finally inducted last year, 59 years after Sonny & Cher's breakthrough smash “I Got You Babe.”


	With Outkast and Salt-N-Pepa both being inducted this year, this is the sixth consecutive year that one or more rap acts has been in the induction class.


	With Lauper, Salt-N-Pepa, Meg White of The White Stripes and Carol Kaye being inducted this year, this is the fourth consecutive year that four or more female acts were in the induction class.


	Bell won the first Grammy Award ever presented for producer of the year, non-classical, in 1975. By coincidence, Waronker was among the other nominees in the category that year. Waronker was also nominated for record of the year that year for producing Maria Muldaur's classy and sexy “Midnight at the Oasis.” Waronker's many other hits as a producer include Gordon Lightfoot's Hot 100-topping “Sundown,” Rickie Lee Jones' “Chuck E.'s in Love” and Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.,” which Dawes performed as the opening song on this year's Grammy telecast.

	











	Carol Kaye, 90, is this year's oldest inductee. Checker and Waronker are both 83, but will both be 84 by the time of the Nov. 8 induction ceremony.


	All of the artists who were induced in the performer category have landed top five albums on the Billboard 200. Three of them reached No. 1: Bad Company (Bad Company, 1974), Outkast (Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, 2003) and Soundgarden (Superunknown, 1994). Three more reached No. 2: Chubby Checker (Your Twist Party, 1962), Joe Cocker (Mad Dogs and Englishmen, 1970) and The White Stripes (Icky Thump, 2007). Lauper climbed as high as No. 4 twice, with She's So Unusual in 1984 and True Colors in 1986.


	Both of the artists who are receiving musical influence awards made the top 10. Salt-N-Pepa reached No. 4 with Very Necessary in 1994. Zevon hit No. 8 with Excitable Boy in 1978.


	Lauper won the Grammy for best new artist in 1985. She's the sixth artist who was a past winner of that award to go on to a Rock Hall induction.


	Outkast won the Grammy for album of the year in 2004 for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. André 3000 was nominated again in that category at this year's ceremony for New Blue Sun.


	Two of the inducted acts are duos – Outkast (André 3000 and Big Boi) and The White Stripes (Jack White and Meg White).


	The other seven nominees in the performer category were denied admission to the Rock Hall – this year, anyway. Oasis and Mariah Carey were both passed over for the second year in a row. Both were surprising snubs – Oasis is reuniting for a global tour in 2025; Carey's profile, never low, has been boosted in recent years by her status as the uncontested Queen of Christmas. Of the other passed-over artists, Joy Division/New Order were previously on the ballot in 2023; this was the first time on the ballot for The Black Crowes, Billy Idol, Maná and Phish.

	











	The voters showed no love for brother acts this year. Oasis includes Liam and Noel Gallagher; The Black Crowes includes Chris and Rich Robinson.


	Maná was vying to become the first rock en español act to make the Rock Hall. Joy Division/New Order was vying to join the short list of two related acts being inducted in tandem, following Parliament/Funkadelic in 1997 and The Small Faces/Faces in 2012.


	Phish, which won this year's fan vote, has never landed a Hot 100 hit, but the band is a powerhouse live attraction, as evidenced when it played the Sphere in Las Vegas in April 2024.


	Idol was a mainstay of early MTV – as was Lauper, who did get in. In an interview with Vulture, Idol said of his guitarist Steve Stevens, “Because of our special relationship, if I get in, they will induct him as well.” This would have echoed Pat Benatar's induction three years ago, where the Rock Hall inducted both Benatar and her husband and musical partner, Neil Giraldo. But it's academic, as Idol didn't make it this year.


	The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction will be live on Saturday, Nov. 8 at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The 2025 ceremony will once again stream live on Disney+, with a special airing on ABC at a later date and available on Hulu the next day. The 2024 ceremony aired on New Year's Day.


	Here's the full list of 2025 inductees:

	To celebrate Minogue's latest accolade, several leading artists and industry peers shared tributes to her career and influence. Longtime collaborator, Neighbours co-star Jason Donovan, praised her “dedication and focus to her craft,” describing her as “a hardworking and authentic Melbourne girl who is proud of her Australian heritage.” 

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Fellow Australian songwriter Kylie Sackley declared, “Kylie Minogue walked so the rest of us Australian music makers could run,” hailing her as “an innovator and an inspiration.”


	Ben Lee reflected on Minogue's lasting cultural impact, calling her a “mirror” through which audiences see themselves, and Gretta Ray credited Minogue with making the path toward pop stardom less daunting for emerging Australian artists. “She has inspired me to be courageous in my creativity,” Ray said.


	Missy Higgins noted Minogue's remarkable longevity: “She continues to tour consistently and remain exciting and relevant,” while The Wiggles, who once collaborated with Minogue when she portrayed the honorary “Pink Wiggle,” applauded her “unstoppable artistry” and “special Kylie-magic.”


	Minogue's career, spanning over four decades, has earned her international acclaim. She has amassed 10 ARIA No. 1 albums, including her most recent project Tension, which debuted atop the Australian Albums Chart in September 2023. Minogue made history on the Billboard charts when “Padam Padam,” the lead single from Tension, became her first solo track to reach the top 10 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart in 2023.


	Minogue's influence on generations of artists remains unmatched. Julian Hamilton of The Presets, who curated a special performance for the APRA Awards night, said, “With so many hits to her name, it hasn't been the easiest of tasks.”


	Tim Nelson of Cub Sport summed it up best, calling Kylie “a true global icon who has filled countless lives with joy, expression and a sense of belonging for decades.”

The Tool singer says he's ""preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best"" in regard to July's Back to The Beginning concert in England.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan has expressed an air of concern about what to expect from Ozzy Osbourne's final performance this July.


	Keenan and his Tool bandmates are one of the many acts scheduled to appear at the Back to the Beginning concert, which takes place in Birmingham, England on July 5. The event will feature names such as Osbourne's own Black Sabbath performing their final-ever show, while acts such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, and myriad others join the bill.


	While Osbourne hasn't performed a full set since Dec. 31, 2018 – two months before his diagnosis of Parkinson's – he's previously tempered expectations for the upcoming gig, noting he isn't “planning on doing a set with Black Sabbath,” but rather “little bits and pieces” with the group. “I am doing what I can, where I feel comfortable,” he explained.

	Despite this, Osbourne told fans only last week that he's been undertaking “endurance training” ahead of the gig in an effort to “wake up” his body after years spent recovering from numerous surgeries. “I haven't done anything for, this will be seven years, and so I've been through all this surgery,” he explained. “It really is like starting from scratch.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	While Osbourne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October 2024 as a solo artist (he was previously inducted as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006), Keenan was on hand with the likes of Wolfgang Van Halen, Billy Idol, and Jelly Roll to perform a tribute set to honor his legacy. 


	Speaking to the Loudwire Nights podcast recently, Keenan noted that his experience with Osbourne at the induction ceremony has left him unsure of what to expect at the July event.


	“I think for me, seeing Ozzy moving around at [the Rock Hall ceremony], the idea of him playing a show at all, if we're being honest, the conversation about going to do the song was just like, ‘We'll have this conversation, but, ahh… I don't know that this [concert] gonna happen,'” Keenan told the podcast..


	“And even now, I'm cautious about saying, ‘Yeah! All in, he's gonna do it.' Because man, I don't know what kind of modern miracles we'll come up with to get him on stage to do the songs, but this is gonna be a challenge for them.”


	Keenan closed by noting he feels privileged to be included in the forthcoming event, though added he's “preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.”

	











	Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello will be the musical director for the show that will mark Osbourne's first time on stage since a brief 2022 set at the NFL Kickoff in Los Angeles; his last full show was in December 2018 at the Forum in L.A. as part of his No More Tours 2 outing. 


	Other acts slated to perform at the final Sabbath blowout include: Halestorm, Gojira, as well as appearances by Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan, Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan and Slash, Wolfgang Van Halen, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, Lzzy Hale, Disturbed's David Draiman, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Sammy Hagar and many more.

	A day before the kick-off of her anticipated Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, Beyoncé gave the Beyhive a preview of the outings massive set. In a dramatic 16-second greyscale video titled “SHE COMING” the camera slowly pans from the darkness inside the concourse of Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium into the light of the empty arena.


	As it crests and dips down toward the floor, viewers get a brief glimpse of the elaborate stage set-up, which appears to feature a large star-shaped stage bisected by a long runway in the middle and what looks like a big screen across the back. The tour in support of Queen Bey's 2024 Grammy Awards album of the year winner Cowboy Carter LP is slated to kick off on Monday night (April 28) with the first of five dates at SoFi Stadium. From there, the singer will play three nights at Soldier Field in Chicago (May 15, 17, 18) and five shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (May 22, 24, 25, 28 and 29).

	The outing will then jump to Europe for six shows at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London (June 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 16) and three in Paris at Stade de France (June 19, 21 and 22) before she hops back stateside for two gigs in her hometown at Houston's NRG Stadium (June 28, 29). The tour is slated to wind down in July with a pair of shows in Washington,D.C. four nights at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta and two gigs at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on July 25 and 26.

					By Justin Kroll 

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Following his work on Best Picture Oscar nominee Conclave, director Edward Berger looks to have zeroed in on his potential next project and is teaming with one of the town's biggest stars. Sources tell Deadline that, following a competitive situation, A24 has landed the hot package The Riders with Academy Award winner Brad Pitt on board to star and Berger set to direct. David Kajganich will adapt Tim Winton's novel. 


	The novel follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling through Europe for two years, winds up in Ireland with his wife and daughter. And on a mystical whim of his wife Jennifer, they buy an old farmhouse that stands in the shadow of a castle. While Scully spends weeks alone renovating the old house, Jennifer returns to Australia to liquidate their assets. When Scully arrives at Shannon Airport to pick up Jennifer and their 7-year-old daughter, Billie, it is Billie who emerges — alone. There is no note, no explanation, not so much as a word from Jennifer, and the shock has left Billie speechless. In that instant, Scully's life falls to pieces.

	











	Scott Free's Ridley Scott and Michael Pruss will produce the film alongside Kajganich and Berger's nine hours, and Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner for Plan B Entertainment. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Scott Free has been developing the script for some time after Kajganich brought the 1994 novel to the company a decade ago, with the prodco at one point considering it as a potential directing vehicle. It recently caught the interest of Berger, who worked with Scott Free TV on AMC's The Terror, which Kajganich created and Ridley Scott executive produced. The script eventually landed in front of Pitt, and once he gave his commitment, it soon became one of the top packages to hit the market this year. And given the pedigree and star power, A24 was aggressive in its pursuit, ultimately landing the project.


	Production will commence in early 2026 and shoot in multiple locations across Europe. A24 will finance and handle the worldwide theatrical release of the film. 


	Pitt is expected to shoot The Continuing Adventures of Cliff Booth for Netflix next. The pic featuring one of Pitt's most iconic characters has David Fincher directing from a script by Quentin Tarantino.

	











	As for Berger, the Oscar-nominated All Quiet on the Western Front director had a number of options following the success of his Oscar-nominated Vatican thriller Conclave. He did recently attach himself to the Evan Gershkovich package that landed at United Artists, but with Pitt on board and The Riders a go script, this will likely be his next film.


	Next up for Pitt is the tentpole F1, which bows in June and was directed by Joseph Kosinski. Berger has the Netflix drama The Ballad of a Small Player bowing this fall. Colin Farrell is set to star, and the film is expected to be another contender this awards season.


	Pitt is repped by CAA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners, Berger is repped by CAA, Range and Casarotto Ramsay and Kajganich is repped by UTA and Anonymous Content.

EXCLUSIVE: Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings) and Domhnall Gleeson (Ex Machina) have joined Kate and Rooney Mara in Werner Herzog's Bucking Fastard, which wrapped filming in Europe this past weekend.


	Marking the first time the Mara sisters have appeared on screen together, the film charts the story of Jean and Joan Holbrooke, “two sisters who are so close to each other that they speak in unison, love the same man, and have the same dreams. They even make the same slip of tongue in unison. In search of an imaginary land, the Orkneys – where true love is possible – they start digging a tunnel through an entire mountain range.”

	HanWay Films has boarded the project to rep worldwide sales and will be sharing first footage from Dublin, Sligo (Ireland) and Slovenia with buyers at Cannes.


	The private equity-backed film is produced by Clara Wu Tsai, Ariel Leon Isacovitch and Agnes Chu, with Kieran Corrigan, Emanuele Moretti and Andrea Bucko. 


	Herzog reteams with key creative collaborators with whom he has worked on previous projects, including Peter Zeitlinger (Bad Lieutenant) as DoP, Marco Capalbo (The Fire Within: A Requiem for Katia and Maurice) as editor, and Ernst Reijseger (Rescue Dawn) as composer.


	Legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog spoke for the first time today about the project: ”Bucking Fastard is a film that, for me, completes a circle in an operatic triptych with my previous films, Fitzcarraldo and Grizzly Man. We cannot see the world as Jean and Joan Holbrooke see it, but we do see how the world reacts to them — through the courts and the press, through those that want to help and those who want to use them, through the eyes of beasts both tame and wild, and even through their own echoes in the core of the earth.”


	Gabrielle Stewart, CEO HanWay Films, added: “Werner has surpassed himself in crafting something truly original with surprising notes of humour and fantasy. We are excited to be unveiling exclusive footage of Bucking Fastard to buyers in Cannes.”


	Herzog is represented by Gersh; Kate Mara is represented by CAA, Mosaic Media Group and Sloane, Offer; Rooney Mara is represented by WME, Entertainment 360 and Sloane, Offer; Bloom is represented by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Felker, Toczek; Gleeson is represented by Paradigm, The Agency and Goodman Genow.

EXCLUSIVE: Following her star-making performance in the FX series Shōgun, Anna Sawai looks to have found her big follow-up. Sources tell Deadline that the Emmy winner is set to co-star in Amazon MGM Studios' How to Rob a Bank, from director David Leitch, Imagine Entertainment and 87North Productions. Sawai joins previously announced stars Nicholas Hoult and Pete Davidson, and sources say the film will be released in theaters. 


	Plot details are being kept under wraps, but given Leitch's track record of delivering on big thrills and fun set pieces in films like Bullet Train, Deadpool 2 and most recently The Fall Guy, expect something similar in scope.

Carrie Underwood may have been crowned the “American Idol” season 4 winner, but she admits that there's still one aspect of the show that gives her anxiety. Find out why she feels a little bit of PTSD every time she hears the iconic theme song.

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In an April 21 Instagram post, Underwood revealed how the “American Idol” theme song makes her feel, all these years later. Spoiler alert: it's stressful for her.

“The ‘Idol' theme song gives me anxiety. For real!” she explained in the caption.

In the video, Underwood shared, “For the record, the ‘American Idol' da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da baaa-errr, the music, like gives me anxiety.”

The singer added, “I get like this flash of fear in my heart, like nervousness, because it's the same! PTSD.”

A post shared by Luke Bryan Official (@lukebryan)

The “Idol” alum is putting her PTSD aside and carrying on with the job at hand however.

In an interview with ET Online after the April 21 live show, Underwood shared what her experience has been like as a judge so far. “It's a lot of fun. More than anything, I love to just like be a fan,” the country singer said. “I love sitting out in the audience, and there's a song I know, and everybody's having fun with it, it's fun for me! I'm having a blast.”

In addition to the fun, however, the judges have work to do and that can prove challenging, given all the talent on the show.

“It was one of those things where we try to think of what people want to see, the talent is insane and somebody's gotta be voted off,” she explained.

Underwood added, “I don't take it lightly that we have people's futures in our hands, and I really would like just America to vote. I don't want to be put in that position again, so it's up to you guys. You have to vote for your favorites.”

When the interviewer noted, “I heard you had a rough night,” Underwood agreed, responding, “I did. I mean, my night was paling in comparison to the contestants that are no longer a part of the competition, but it is an extremely tough spot to be in.”

She added, “I really just wanted to pass the buck off to Luke [Bryan] and Lionel [Richie], but I feel like we were on the same page.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","First Look at Helen Mirren's Netflix Mystery Movie from ‘Harry Potter' Director (PHOTOS)","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/new-helen-mirren-drama/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 02:08:19 GMT","

“Excalibur” star Helen Mirren teams with Pierce Brosnan in “The Thursday Murder Club,” coming to Netflix at the end of Summer 2025. Here's a preview of the project and everything we know so far.

The story follows a group of four aging but sprightly friends who enjoy solving cold case murders as a hobby. The retirement home residents find themselves pulled into their most intense adventure yet when a mystery death takes place uncomfortably close to home. A thrilling whodunit unfolds as the group's just-for-fun sleuthing turns into a high stakes search for the killer. 

The tale is based on Richard Osman's bestselling 2020 novel, which has sold over 1 million copies and spent 57 weeks at the top of the original fiction charts. Osman talked in a 2024 “This Morning” interview about his inspiration for the book and how he felt about bringing it to the screen.

Osman said observing his mother's life in a retirement home made him think, “I have to write about this generation and the extraordinary things they've done. And the life that's still in them, and the adventure that they have.” 

On bringing his work to life on Netflix, Osman said “anyone who likes ‘The Thursday Murder Club' will like it. Viewers can expect “British humor and a few tears,” according to the author.

The movie features an impressive cast. Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan, the fifth actor to portray James Bond, are joined by Celia Imrie, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Tom Ellis, Jonathan Pryce, David Tennant, Paul Freeman, Geoff Bell, Richard E. Grant, and Ingrid Oliver.

Katy Brand and Suzanne Heathcote wrote the screen play. The project is directed by Chris Columbus, who famously directed two films from the “Harry Potter” universe: “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,” and “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” 

The movie's executive producers are Jo Burn, Richard Osman, Eleanor Columbus, Holly Bario, Jeb Brody.

Pierce Brosnan previously worked with “The Thursday Murder Club” director Chris Columbus on 1993's “Mrs. Doubtfire.” According to a People report, he's enthusiastic about teaming back up. The outlet says he told them when he got the call from the director about appearing in the Netflix mystery, “I was halfway there already. By the time I'd read the book by Richard Osman I was completely hooked.”

The film will hit Netflix on August 28, 2025. Subscription plans currently star at $7.99.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Brittany Cartwright Talks Jax Taylor's Reaction to Son's Diagnosis: ‘He Loves His Son'","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/brittany-cartwright-jax-taylor-cruz/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 01:57:48 GMT","

“The Valley” star Brittany Cartwright is opening up about co-parenting her son, Cruz, 4, with her estranged husband, Jax Taylor. 

In an April 2025 Access Hollywood interview, Cartwright referenced that their son was diagnosed with autism in late 2024. According to Cartwright, the diagnosis was “a little bit harder for Jax to accept than it was for [her] to accept.” She clarified that Taylor adores Cruz. 

“He loves his son,” said Cartwright, who filed for divorce from Taylor in August 2024. 

She also said she “deal[s] with all the doctors and the therapists” for Cruz. She said while Taylor “doesn't see as much as [she] see[s] that goes into it,” he is “learning” about autism. 

“We're both learning. It's brand new. It hasn't always been easy. It hasn't been but I wouldn't change anything about Cruz. Ever,” said Cartwright to the publication. 

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

While speaking to Access Hollywood, Cartwright explained why she went public with her son's diagnosis. 

“I can use my platform for something amazing. And I can help other families that are going through this,” said Cartwright during the interview. 

In addition, she said she wants to spread the message that “early intervention is so important” for children with autism. 

“With other families that are going through it, they need to realize that early intervention is so important to give their child the best life they can have,” said Cartwright. 

During an April 2025 interview with People magazine, Cartwright said her son attends preschool with a therapeutic companion and goes to speech and occupational therapy. Cartwright stated that she is “trying to do everything [she] possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever.” 

“I just make sure that he never misses a class, never misses a therapy session. If I have to work, I have the most amazing nanny in the entire world, she is literally my family. I don't know what I would do without her. Sometimes Jax will take him,” said Cartwright to the publication. “I want him to learn things as well, but the majority of the time, it's me. And I feel like I need to be there, I need to be learning what's going on, so that I can really work with him at home as well.”

A post shared by Brittany Cartwright 💛 (@brittany)

In a different April 2025 interview with Access Hollywood, Taylor spoke about his son. He said he decided to receive mental health help and get sober for the sake of Cruz. He then referenced his child's autism diagnosis. 

“My little boy needs me more than ever. And I feel like it's just a sign from God. Brittany and I are really coming together about this. Our little boy is our priority and making sure that he has the best life possible. And knowing that me and his mom will love him more than anything,” said Taylor to Access Hollywood.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tributes Pour in for Late ‘RuPaul's Drag Race' Star Jiggly Caliente","https://entertainmentnow.com/reality-tv/tributes-drag-race-star-jiggly-caliente/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:02:10 GMT","

Drag entertainer and “RuPaul's Drag Race” alumni Jiggly Caliente, also known as Bianca Castro-Arebejo, passed away on Sunday, April 27, following a “serious health set back” that led to the amputation of her right leg. Since Jiggly's passing was announced by her family on Instagram, “RuPaul's Drag Race” stars from around the world have paid tribute to the late queen's legacy. 

“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Bianca Castro-Arebejo, known to the world and cherished by many as Jiggly Caliente,” wrote her family in a private statement, adding that “Biance passed away peacefully on April 27, 2025 at 4:42 am, surrounded by her loving family and close friends.

“A luminous presence in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, Jiggly Caliente was celebrated for her infectious energy, fierce wit, and unwavering authenticity,” the statement continued. “She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world. Her legacy is one of love, courage, and light. Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain forever.”

In the hours following the news of Jiggly's passing was announced, fans and fellow drag queens alike have released heartfelt tributes in her memory. 

Ginger Minj, who competed alongside Jiggly on “RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 6,” responded to the news on Instagram, writing, “Jiggly was one of the fiercest, funniest, most loyal friends I've ever had. Over the past 11 years she taught me to stand up for myself, held me accountable when necessary, and never failed to make me laugh til I cried…Grateful I got to say goodbye, heartbroken I had to.”

“My jiggles,” added “Drag Race” judge Michelle Visage, “The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious. You were and remain so loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high.” 

Jiggly originally appeared on Season 4 of “RuPaul's Drag Race” in 2012 where she placed 8th. The queen later returned to compete on “All Stars 6” in 2021, where she placed 12th. In 2022, Jiggly was confirmed as a rotating judge for the spin-off series “Drag Race Philippines” and was set to join the judging panel for the upcoming series “Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.”

“Drag Race Philippines” judge Kalad Karen similarly paid tribute to Jiggly following her passing, writing, “Thank you for everything my dearest sister. Rest in power. ‘Drag Race Philippines' wouldn't be the same without you. I love you.”

World of Wonder, the company that produces “Drag Race” and its various spin-offs around the world, also released a statement paying tribute to the late queen. “We are devastated to hear of the passing of Bianca Castro, aka Jiggly Caliente. Jiggly's humor, love, and light touched so many in the ‘Drag Race' family and beyond. Her legacy will continue to uplift the communities she advocated for,” wrote the production company. 

The news of Jiggly's passing comes just days after her family shared a devastating health update, telling fans that “due to a severe infection, she was hospitalized and, as a result, has undergone the loss of most of her right leg,” adding that the 44-year-old queen's recovery would be “extensive.” 

In addition to her appearances on “Drag Race,” Jiggly has also had roles in series like “Broad City” and “Pose” as well as co-hosting “Translation,” the first major talk show on a major network (Out TV) hosted by an all-transgender cast. Jiggly co-hosted the show with fellow trans “Drag Race” contestants Carmen Carerra, Peppermint, and Kylie Sonique Love. 

Jiggly Caliente, 44, is the second “Drag Race” queen to pass away in 2025, following  “RuPaul's Drag Race UK” Season 1 winner The Vivienne, who passed away in January following a cardiac arrest that resulted from a ketamine overdose.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Who Was Eliminated Last Night on ‘American Idol'?","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/2025-top-12-results-eliminated-contestants/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:20:19 GMT","

As the competition field narrows on season 23 of “American Idol,” two more talented contestants were sent home on April 27, 2025. For the first time this season, viewers had less than two hours to cast their votes during the live show, during which contestants sang tunes originally performed by Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame inductees. 

In the last moments of the episode, host Ryan Seacrest announced that 19 million votes had been cast in that short timeframe and revealed that the two singers with the least amount of votes were Amanda Barise and Desmond Roberts. 

For her April 27 performance, Barise sang a jazz-infused version of Michael Jackson's “Can't Help It,” which was a hit with the judging panel but not with viewers. Celebrity mentor James Taylor marveled at her scatting and judge Carrie Underwood called Barise's rendition “incredible.”

Judge Luke Bryan told her, “Pro moves, pro singing, you went to a new level and crushed it.” 

Barise was one of the very first contestants viewers got to know in season 23, as her audition was featured on the March 3 preview episode that aired right after the 2025 Oscars. The 27-year-old jazz, blues, and R&B singer has blown the judges away with each round of competition, but they had to save her from elimination on the April 21 live show when she didn't receive enough viewer votes to advance to the top 14. 

Barise has repeatedly expressed her gratitude for the experience on social media. On April 28, she posted a final thank you note on Instagram, writing in part, “This experience has been nothing short of life-changing. Walking onto that stage week after week, sharing my voice with all of you, and pushing myself further than I ever thought possible — it has transformed me forever. I'm walking away not just a stronger artist, but a stronger human being.”

Barise lives in Manhattan but hails from nearby New Jersey, according to her sE Electronics profile. She started singing at the age of five, per Arts Global, and developed a love for covering Jazz, Blues and R&B/Motown classics. Barise has grown an impressive social media following as she posts various performances of her cover tunes. Her performance of Radiohead's “Creep” at a Brooklyn house show in June 2024 has been viewed 3.6 million times on TikTok.

Roberts took the risk of performing a Commodores song, “Jesus is Love,” on the April 27 episode, admitting it was “intimidating” to do in front of judge and former Commodores lead singer Lionel Richie. 

“I don't mind you singing the song,” Richie teased Desmond after his performance, “but you found some octaves I didn't sing! It's obvious that you're not only comfortable, but you tried to take my song. That is a very hard song to sing, but you did it – that was really risky.”

Bryan was a bit more critical, telling Desmond, “You have a really dynamic voice. Still, remember to edit – you don't have to maybe go to all those falsettos. Make sure you don't go out of your comfort zone all the way.” 

Desmond, who grew up in Orange County, California, is a music teacher at the School of Rock in the Fairfax District of Los Angeles. He earned a degree in songwriting from the prestigious Berklee College of Music in 2021 and describes himself in his Instagram profile as a “Professional Sad Boi and Sara Bareilles Fan.”

“American Idol” airs again on April 28 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, when another two contestants will be sent home based on viewers' votes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Ben Affleck Gushes Over Ex, Former ‘Idol' Judge Jennifer Lopez","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ben-affleck-gushes-praise-for-jennifer-lopez/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 13:54:56 GMT","

Actor Ben Affleck has gushed praise for his ex-wife Jennifer Lopez, despite their broken marriage.

Affleck made it clear that he still has a very high opinion of the singer/actress and former “American Idol” judge.

The pair has a long history together. They famously dated years ago before becoming engaged and then breaking off the engagement. They then reunited after marrying and divorcing other people, and Lopez even created a documentary and movie about their romance.

Although that romance has now ended, Affleck had only positive things to say about Lopez, even calling her “spectacular,” according to “Entertainment Tonight.“

Affleck made the comments to “Entertainment Tonight” when he was interviewed on the red carpet at his premiere of the new movie “The Accountant 2.” He indicated in that interview that he and Lopez have tried to prioritize their kids, who get along well with each other.

“For the record, Jennifer Lopez is spectacular, great to my kids, great ongoing relationship with them,” he continued. “I love her kids. They're wonderful. She's [an] enormously important, tremendous person of a lot of integrity who I adore and am grateful to.”

Affleck has three kids with his ex-wife Jennifer Garner, and Lopez has two kids with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.

“It's a great night. The kids are here, Jen's kids are here. I'm very, very excited,” Affleck, 52, told Entertainment Tonight on April 16. “I'm proud of the movie, I love the movie and I love when all the kids come out. It's really fun. It's exciting.”

Affleck, Lopez and also Garner have been hit with constant headlines since the couple broke up. However, Affleck told “Entertainment Tonight” that he doesn't pay much attention to that kind of media noise.

“Listen, I don't read the stuff online much, and sometimes I get the sense that people perpetuate this idea of, I don't know, they wanna find something negative to talk about.”

Rather, Affleck said, he is enjoying focusing on fatherhood, and he spoke gushingly about his kids.

“The relationships that you can have with children like that, it's the joy of my life,” Affleck said in the interview. “And those kids are amazing, and I'm glad that this is a movie they want to come to.”

Episode 2 of “The Rehearsal” Season 2 saw Nathan Fielder engaging in the kind of elaborate simulation of a social interaction that has become his trademark in recent years. But rather than a bar trivia dispute or an uncomfortable cockpit moment, this rehearsal saw the comedian prepare to tackle a real problem from his own professional life: the removal of the Summit Ice episode of “Nathan for You” from Paramount+. 

Officially titled “Horseback Riding/Man Zone,” Season 3, Episode 2 of “Nathan for You” saw Fielder use his outlandish tactics to solve a variety of small business problems. The most notable storyline from the episode involved Fielder learning that the brand Taiga had published a tribute to a Holocaust denier, prompting him to start his own outerwear brand, Summit Ice, which placed Holocaust remembrance front and center. While the episode found humor in Fielder convincing a sporting goods store owner to let him build an elaborate display of information about Hitler's atrocities next to the jackets, Summit Ice has continued to operate as a real brand that donates all of its proceeds to Holocaust remembrance organizations.

Fielder has since moved on from “Nathan for You,” but “The Rehearsal” brought the show back to the public consciousness this week when Fielder revealed that the Summit Ice episode is no longer available on the show's streaming home. He traced the move back to a decision from Paramount+'s German division, which he claimed cited “sensitivities” over the “Nathan for You” episode's engagement with the Holocaust as a reason to pull it. The decision appeared to have ripple effects throughout the massive entertainment conglomerate, and the episode is now unavailable around the world.

Fielder used the episode's removal to make a broader point about the availability of Jewish content on Paramount+. “Currently on the Paramount app, there are 50 results for ‘nazi,' 10 for ‘Hitler' and zero for ‘Judaism,'” he said at one point during “The Rehearsal” episode. “We've been erased.”

Fielder admitted that he was in an awkward situation. Although he was no longer making “Nathan for You” for Paramount, the company backed his Showtime series, “The Curse,” which has yet to be renewed for Season 2. But even if the confrontation carried professional risk, Fielder was prepared to get to the bottom of the situation by hiring actors to help him prepare for a meeting with the head of Paramount+ Germany.

 










“Horseback Riding/Man Zone” is currently streaming on Max along with all episodes of “Nathan for You.” A Paramount+ spokesperson confirmed to IndieWire — following The Hollywood Reporter — that the “Nathan for You” episode was removed from the streaming service following a “standards review.” IndieWire has reached out for additional comment.

Brad Pitt is now an A24 star. The actor/producer will lead Oscar-winning “Conclave” director Edward Berger‘s latest film “The Riders,” based on Tim Winton's 1994 novel. “Bones and All” scribe David Kajganich, who's also writing the Zendaya-led Ronnie Spector biopic “Be My Baby” for A24, will adapt the book. Deadline first reported the project.

“The Riders” follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling Europe with his wife, Jennifer, and seven-year-old daughter, Billie, purchases a farmhouse in rural Ireland. Jennifer and Billie then return to Australia to finalize their affairs, only for Billie to return to Ireland alone after traveling across the globe, with Jennifer now missing. Fred is left to make sense of his wife's disappearance in a story that takes a mystical turn.

A24 landed the film after a competitive situation, as IndieWire can share. Kajganich brought the novel to Ridley Scott‘s Scott Free banner more than a decade ago; Berger worked with Scott Free TV on AMC's “The Terror” with creator Kajganich.

Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner, and Dede Gardner will produce for Plan B Entertainment, with Scott Free's Scott and Michael Pruss producing alongside Kajganich and Berger's nine hours. A24 will finance and distribute the film worldwide. 

Production will commence in early 2026 and shoot in multiple locations across Europe.

In the meantime, Pitt will lead the “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” sequel for Netflix, reportedly titled “The Continuing Adventures of Cliff Booth.” David Fincher will direct from a script by Quentin Tarantino. Pitt also leads Joseph Kosinski's upcoming race drama “F1,” out in June 2025.

Berger already has another Netflix film in the works, following the Oscar-winning success of “All Quiet on the Western Front,” with “The Ballad of a Small Player,” led by Colin Farrell. Tilda Swinton co-stars in the con artist drama based on Rowan Joffé's novel, though a release date or festival berth has not yet been set. Production wrapped in August 2024.

Producer Scott has a slew of projects in the works, including the adaptation of the novel “The Dog Stars” with Jacob Elordi, who replaced Paul Mescal. The “Gladiator II” star is now prepping to play Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes' Beatles movies for Apple and Sony.

“Wuthering Heights” fans are already up in arms over Emerald Fennell‘s adaptation of the Emily Brontë novel. 

Controversy ensued when the two “Wuthering Heights” leads were first announced, with Jacob Elordi reuniting with his “Saltburn” writer/director to play Heathcliff and Margot Robbie (who produced Fennell's prior two films through her LuckyChap banner) as Catherine. Was Robbie too old to play teen Catherine? Was Elordi the wrong casting for a character described in the novel as being “dark-skinned gipsy in aspect”? Add in the historically inaccurate wedding gown that Robbie wears in a first look at the film, and it seemed for some that the Brontë adaptation skewed from its source.

Now, “Wuthering Heights” casting director Kharmel Cochrane is defending her picks — and warning audiences that future reveals could social media into even more of a tizzy.

“There's definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy,” Cochrane said while at the Sands Film Festival in St Andrews, Scotland, per Deadline. “There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot. But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don't need to be accurate. It's just a book. That is not based on real life. It's all art.”

Cochrane added, “Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.” 

As for the alleged whitewashing, Cochrane said that she prefers racially blind casting. 

“If something is clearly written as white, for example, a script reads ‘she tied her blonde hair back,' but there's no specific reason for it, I will just put people on tape,” Cochrane said. “And then it's almost like I dare someone to question why I've done it, and they don't. So then it just becomes normal. Years ago, I would get people saying, ‘Did you read the brief?' And I'd say yeah, and this is my interpretation of it, just like when you can read a book.”

Hong Chau, “Saltburn” alum Alison Oliver, and Shazad Latif also star in “Wuthering Heights.” Warner Bros. opens the film February 13, 2026.

Cochrane said that along with Fennell, her favorite directors to work with include Robert Eggers, Alex Garland, and Lena Dunham.

 










“We've just got a really good thing going. And I genuinely feel safe in my workplace with them,” she said. “I feel like I can say to them, ‘Oh, look what if we do this,' and I'm not worried about getting fired, because that is a real fear, especially when you're on some of the studio stuff. I got fired recently. I don't want to work like that. I can't do my best work if I'm scared to offer an opinion.”

Zach Cregger is citing how Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 drama “Magnolia” inspired his “horror epic,” “Weapons.” Sure, it may seem like the iconic star-studded “Magnolia” doesn't have much in common with Cregger's (albeit secretive) sophomore film “Weapons,” but the writer/director is crediting how “Magnolia” gave him “permission” to think big.

“I just like that kind of unapologetic, ‘This is an epic,'” Cregger told Entertainment Weekly of the “Magnolia” effect. “I love that movie. I love that kind of bold scale. It gave me permission when I was writing this to shoot for the stars and make it an epic. I wanted a horror epic, and so I tried to do that.”

Even the aesthetic choices in “Weapons” have nods to PTA's masterpiece: Cregger said that “Weapons” star Alden Ehrenreich has a mustache for the role as a reference to John C. Reilly's “Magnolia” look.

While little is known about Cregger's latest horror/thriller, New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner described the film as being “batshit insane.” Cregger agrees with that categorization, saying that the mystery of missing kids will “propel you through at least half of the movie, but that is not the movie.” He teased, “The movie will fork and change and reinvent and go in new places. It doesn't abandon that question, believe me, but that's not the whole movie at all. By the midpoint, we've moved on to way crazier shit than that.” 

Cregger added that the bidding war for “Weapons” after his 2022 debut hit “Barbarian” put the pressure on to deliver. “It was stressful,” Cregger said. “People might think from the outside looking in that I was flinging dollar bills in the air and calling enemies and saying, ‘Fuck you.' The truth of the matter was it's a very high-pressure thing, and people were getting pissed and it was stressful. I didn't totally get to unclench and appreciate what happened until maybe a week later when the dust settled and the adrenaline subsided.”

He continued that compared to “Barbarian,” “Weapons” is “more ambitious in almost every way.” 

“I don't just mean in terms of the budget, but I just mean creatively,” Cregger said. “The story is weirder and it's twistier and it's bigger. I have way more actors to fit into this thing. The set pieces are definitely bigger. It's just a bigger, weirder movie than ‘Barbarian' is.” 

 










“Weapons” premieres August 8 in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 3. For earlier coverage, check out last week's review.]

It didn't take long for Gail to become a survivalist all-star. For her “Last of Us” debut, Catherine O'Hara's cynical therapist walks into a session with Joel (Pedro Pascal) half in the bag and with another glass of whiskey at the ready. Then she accepts payment via weed, which she judges almost as harshly as she does Joel — cursing at him, refusing to hear his “boring” problems, and calling him a liar. Turns out, Gail had good reason to be angry with the soon to be deceased: He killed her husband, Eugene — presumably, after Eugene became infected, but still. That's a tough pill to swallow, no matter how stiff the drink to help it down.

In Episode 3, Gail's heroics continue. She's the last line of defense between Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and the cold world waiting outside her hospital room. She raptly observes the town council meeting where Ellie pleads to send a 16-person posse to Seattle to avenge Joel's death. She sits in the outfield of a Little League game, drinking beer from her own cooler, and writes an early epitaph for our 19-year-old protagonist: When Tommy (Gabriel Luna) asks how to best protect Ellie, his de facto niece, Gail's advice boils down to a simple, dire sentiment: “Some people just can't be saved.”

I don't want to believe Gail, but history tells me I should. Not only do I like Gail — she seems like an ideal hang during the post-apocalypse — I'm also meant to like Gail. Clue No. 1: She's played by Catherine Freaking O'Hara. Clue No. 2: Therapists in TV shows are often wise, trustworthy figures. Their voices are respected and their opinions reliable. When a patient listens to them, things seem to get better, and when they don't, well, they don't. 

But Gail isn't your typical therapist. There's the drinking (before sessions, during sessions) and the smoking (“as much weed as I can”), sure, but those are symptoms of larger issues. Gail is mourning the loss of her husband, which is still a raw, recent tragedy, amid the broader, longer-term tragedy of society's ongoing collapse. Jackson offers community — and a better version of it than we've seen anywhere else — but it's not a replacement. It doesn't have everything for everyone, even if it offers certain services that feel like luxuries. 

 










I mean, what post-apocalyptic story features survivors sitting down to protect their mental health? Just this one, and that's great for them, but what about Gail? “I'm supposed to see a shrink myself, to help process it all — [but] I'm the only one here,” she says in Episode 3. Earlier, she acknowledges that she's overwhelmed with appointments. If any of them go like the one we saw with Joel, than “brutal” wouldn't just describe her workload. It would describe the treatment, too. 

So what does that mean for her assessment of Ellie? Clearly, some of it is spot on. Ellie lies often enough and convincingly enough to be described as “a liar,” rather than just someone who lies. She lies to Gail's face at the hospital. She wants out, she wants to go after Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), and she's not going to think twice about it — no matter what Gail asks. She's made up her mind already, and Gail won't change it. “Your final moment with someone doesn't define your whole time with them,” Ellie says. “It shouldn't,” Gail says, “but it often does.” 

That warning feels prescient as Ellie embarks on her revenge mission, despite losing the council's support. At the start of the episode, when she first wakes up in the hospital, she sees Joel dying and she screams. And she screams, and she screams. Three months later, the screaming has stopped, but there's no reason to think the visions have quieted. She still sees Joel dying, her final moments with him, and she's still fixated on killing the person responsible. 

 










Little by little, throughout Episode 3, she collects his mementos and assumes his role. She takes his gun from his room to use on Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). She becomes the gruff, silent type on the trail with Dina (Isabela Merced), asking for silence while her companion cracks jokes and plays game. Ellie even admits to attempting to “sound like a badass,” like she's trying on a persona she admired and lost. She's becoming Joel as a way to remember him, but that's exactly what Tommy is worried about. 

“I just don't her to go down the same paths that Joel did,” he says to Gail — and here's where Gail's advice gets dubious. “Turns out nurture can only do this much,” she says, gesturing to a small amount. “The rest is nature. If she's on a path, it's not one Joel put her on. … Take it from a psychotherapist of 40 years, some people just… some people just can't be saved.”

Whether or not we believe Gail's assessment now becomes the central question in “The Last of Us” Season 2. Is Ellie already doomed to repeat Joel's mistakes, or can she make different decisions? Broadening that out, are we all doomed to repeat the past, or can we still save our future? The town council meeting offers an interesting perspective there, seeing that the board votes against revenge, even when there are adamant, persuasive pleas to seek vengeance. If everyone in that room got a vote, would it have gone down the same way? Or would Seth (Robert John Burke) have convinced the room to act out of fear? To lash out at others as a means of protecting themselves? To follow their instincts rather than act with sense and compassion? 

 










The latter option is voiced by Carlisle (Hiro Kanagawa), and watching his thoughtful sentiments get drowned out by vitriol feels sadly familiar. “People came and killed Joel, so why wouldn't we want to take our vengeance?,” he says. “Well, because we're not supposed to: forgive and be forgiven. No grudges, no revenge. … That's what separates us from the raiders and the murderers: our capacity for mercy.”

Right now, Ellie has none. Can she find it in Seattle? Can she find it before it's too late? Or is Gail right about her? Some people, perhaps, just can't be saved.

“The Last of Us” Season 2 releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

• The visual and audible combination of Ellie crying into one of Joel's old shirts and Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting score has to be a slight nod to one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinematic history, which featured the same character action and the same composer. (Honestly, the moment was so evocative of “Brokeback Mountain,” it pulled me out of it. But I still have to respect the homage.)

• OK, the Scars — the whistling band of travelers who all have long, angular cuts on their faces — seem slightly creepy, but the “wolves” seem much, much worse. After all, the Scar father told his daughter they were on their way through the woods to get “distance” from “war,” and yet the W.L.F. forces caught up with them anyway. A coincidence? Seems unlikely. Seems much more likely the wolves went hunting. Why? Who knows, but we'll certainly see more of each in Seattle, given the many, many W.L.F. soldiers shown at the end of the episode. 

 










• Is Dina a tease, or should Ellie make a move already? Discuss amongst yourselves.

The Beths have signed to Anti- Records, and, with that announcement comes plenty more news. The New Zealand indie-rockers are heading out on a lengthy tour of North America and Europe, and they've shared a video for the new song “Metal.” It's the first new music the Beths have released since the expanded edition of their 2022 album, Expert in a Dying Field. Watch the clip, and see their full list of tour dates, below.

In a statement, singer-guitarist Elizabeth Stokes said “Metal” is about living in a human body and her personal “health journey” as of late: “For parts of the last few years, I kind of felt like my body was a vehicle that had carried me pretty well thus far but was breaking down, something I had little to no control over. All of the steps in the Rube Goldberg machine of life are so unlikely, and yet here we are in it. I have a hunger and a curiosity for learning about the world around me, and for learning about myself. And despite all the ways that my body feels like a broken machine, I still marvel at the complexity of such a machine.”

She continued: “I can hold that knowledge in one hand, and yet with the other hand I can point to my reflection and just be like ‘you are shit.' Or ‘ugly.' Or ‘worthless.' I can reliably respond to any suggestion that I might be able to achieve any small thing with ‘no.' And these are variations of the ‘short word' referenced in the song.”

The Beths' tour begins in Dublin, Ireland, on September 18. From there, they'll perform across Europe and the United Kingdom before heading to North America to perform in dozens of cities in the United States and Canada. Opening select concerts are Phoebe Rings, Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie, Squirrel Flower, and Illuminati Hotties.

Felix Manuel, the DJ and producer better known as Djrum, has a way with sleights of hand. In an interview with Resident Advisor, he explained some of his favorite mixing techniques. One is using an ambient record to stage a dramatic shift in energy. Another is the crab, an old-school hip-hop trick where you use your thumb and three fingers to tickle the crossfader, teasing the next record in tiny, rapid-fire slivers. Moves like these allow Manuel, armed with nothing more than a bag of records, a mixer, and three turntables (set up battle style), to nimbly move through dubstep, drum'n'bass, breakcore, house, techno, hip-hop, trip-hop, drone, jazz, soul, classical, gabber, whatever—all in one set. Jump to any point in his recent BBC essential mix, which blitzes through 62 records in two hours, and you'll get the idea. Has anyone else ever scratched Arthur Russell's voice over galloping kick drums?

Under Tangled Silence, Manuel's third album, pulls off a similar feat, but to subtler, more poetic effect. Like his DJ sets, it draws from all corners of his musical universe, channeling his classical piano training as much as his life-changing moments at London squat raves. But unlike the rowdy melee of his DJing, Under Tangled Silence distills these sounds into something fluid, seamless, and technically virtuosic. His rhythmic finesse drives most of the album, but this isn't exactly a dance record; it's a mercurial survey of what sound like Manuel's deepest emotions, delivered with a level of nuance that's rare in club music.

At the heart of the album is a deft synthesis of wholly different musical traditions. Manuel has played piano since the age of seven, but only gradually wove the instrument into his records. In 2016, he told an interviewer that the piano parts on his Forgetting EP had been “very much composed rather than improvised,” adding that improvisation had “yet to filter its way into my production properly.” Here, piano is the album's lead instrument, much of it seemingly off the cuff. (Manuel says that “Waxcap,” the album's second track, began as a jazzy improv he later developed further.)

There are other live instruments, too. Manuel plays harp, percussion, and mbira, and calls in past collaborator Zosia Jagodzinska for silky swoops of cello. But the melding of jazz, classical and dance music runs deeper than instrumentation, right down to the arrangements, both in individual songs and across the album as a whole. While most dance music works in phrases of eight or 16 bars, luring the listener into a hypnotic groove, Under Tangled Silence rarely repeats itself for more than a few measures at a time. Sloping and swerving, dipping and soaring, Manuel's compositions move like a murmuration of birds.

The album has the same under-the-hood quality that makes Manuel's genre-hopping DJ sets work: a pace and energy that's bold but gentle, a sense of narrative that's unpredictable but intuitive. Each song traces its own meandering path, then joins seamlessly with the next to form a larger, beautifully winding shape. If you graphed the album's arc, it would look like calligraphy, all leaps and loops and elegant curves.

Yet the path it follows is carefully plotted. “A Tune for Us” and “Waxcap” set the stage, blending Alice Coltrane–style spiritualism (shimmering cymbals, woodblocks, silky strings) with UK club signifiers (post-dubstep beats, a bassline several shades subtler than a Reese). “Unweaving” consists of little more than Manuel on piano, complete with the sound of the pedals moving. That track is a palate-cleanser for a middle section driven by slow-rolling beats, part dancehall (“L'Ancienne”) part gqom (“Galaxy In Silence”), though by this point in the album, traditional genre signifiers have lost any real relevance.

Another respite—or “Reprise,” as Manuel calls it—brings somber notes of Sigur Rós or Stars of the Lid before embarking on the album's final run. In the closing suite of tracks, Manuel performs his greatest trick yet: using elements of dance music's most chaotic styles to make something that's by turns lighthearted, romantic, and mournful. “Three Foxes Chasing Each Other” and “Let Me” flirt with elements of breakcore and gabber, all blazing tempos and machine-gun kick drums—but also mbira, piano, and the sound of children playing. The loose dubstep rhythm of “Out of Dust” offers a quick breather, but then the pressure builds up like a kettle boiling. The album ends with “Sycamore,” a 170 BPM, 11-minute epic that's at once frenetic and soothing, rhythmically mind-bending and emotionally rich, swerving and zig-zagging but always a smooth ride.

That kind of delicate balance is the essence of this album, and it's something Manuel only recently perfected. His records throughout the 2010s were immaculately produced and richly imagined, but often signaled potential they didn't quite reach. Some hewed close to UK club conventions that felt beneath him (but were not without their highlights, e.g. 2016's “LA”). More often, their attempts at emotion and vulnerability simply overshot the mark. The sad-strings-and-club-beats combo could feel a little melodramatic. Some of the spoken-word samples—of which there are none on this album—laid it on too thick (“I'll show you my scars/You'll show me the stars”).

Looking back, his previous work seems like a long, patient journey toward an ambitious goal, one that Manuel inched closer to with each new record—until suddenly, he'd arrived. Maybe that seeming leap had to do with him losing nearly an album's worth of work during COVID and being forced to start from scratch. Maybe it was just a case of years of work and dedication to a sound finally paying off. In any case, Meaning's Edge, released last October on Houndstooth (the label arm of London's fabric nightclub, which also released this album), represented a sea change in his music. That was his best record up to that point, and it was outdone a month later by what may remain his single best track: a 10-minute, multi-tempo, multi-genre remix of Objekt's “Ganzfeld” that one DJ called “the bohemian rhapsody of the electronic music scene.” With Under Tangled Silence, Djrum has outdone himself again. It is a balm, a daydream, a reliable portal to a lovelier place, and one of the most dazzling electronic albums in years.

In an alternate universe, Nazar's 2020 debut album Guerilla could have been one of the electronic music success stories of the decade. Alas, it was released on March 13, two days after the World Health Organization proclaimed COVID-19 a global pandemic and lockdowns cascaded around the world. This was not a great time for dance music, even dance music as unusual as Guerilla, which was inspired by Nazar's father's role in the Angolan Civil War and laced with iPhone recordings made on road trips across the Southern African country. Guerilla was what Nazar called “rough kuduro,” taking the unsteady gait of Angola's greatest musical export and spiking it with adrenaline, sweat, fear, and the nocturnal unease of fellow Hyperdub producer Burial. Then he all but disappeared.

Nazar has a remarkable backstory. His father was a general and diplomat for the UNITA rebels (and now second biggest political party) who fought, assisted by the U.S., against the ruling MPLA. Guerilla was based on Nazar's father's memoirs, its album cover taken from a film circulated by the MPLA to humiliate UNITA. The war drove Nazar and his mother into exile in Belgium, where Nazar worked to piece his father's life together from afar before returning to Luanda, a personal journey that culminated in Guerilla. Making that album, and criss-crossing the war-torn country, was a physical and spiritual ordeal. Nazar contracted tuberculosis, which flared up after a bout with COVID, upending and almost taking his life. If Guerilla was a document of a civil war, its follow-up, Demilitarize, is the record of Nazar's own internal struggle after making it.

Instead of the rugged landscape of Angola, Demilitarize surveys Nazar's mind. It's brighter and more spacious than Guerilla, an inversion of that album's olive camo-toned world. Here, the kuduro is a little less rough, almost woozy, more like Nazar's version of a bedroom pop record: close, whispery, introspective. The music comes in fits and starts, like listening to a half-conscious sleepyhead try to recall their dreams—it's easy to imagine Nazar, stricken for an entire year by disease, stuck in bed and coming up with new rhythms in his head. “I let my drums pass the message,” he mutters on “Mantra,” as if the extent of his communication is now limited to music.

Nazar's central presence is the most striking change on Demilitarize. His own voice is everywhere—singing, mumbling, and talking to himself, telling a story or stuck looping in a fever dream. He sounds like a warbly James Blake on opener “Anticipate,” wheezy and almost off-putting, uncomfortable footing steadied by the organ-led R&B lilt of “Core.” The rhythms on Demilitarize are by turns irregular and majestic, made all the more stunning by their rawness: The ticking trap hi-hats on “Unlearn” feel like they were haphazardly soldered to keep the whole thing together, lending a kind of raw, DIY beauty. The colors are bright and the synths are like a cool breeze—but it's the kind of cold that can suddenly turn bitter, as on “Heal,” a mood-swingy track about being stuck in bed that compresses a mental-health episode into five riveting minutes.

The lyrics are hard to make out, but they're powerful even in fleeting turns of phrase. “War Game” is a wordy tale of infection and treatment, using the language of war for the body: “10 pills for 6 months as artillery/Neutralise who I be/What's saving is what's killing me,” Nazar mutters, while on “Open,” he sings of trenches and blowing up bridges. He compares his illness with his family's collective trauma over a zippy, barely there beat, with inaudible sub-bass that quakes the soundscape like PTSD flashbacks of far-off shelling. He settles on the lovely phrase, “being open just feels nice,” as the music behind him morphs and twists, like the way 40 used to flip the beat inside out on old Drake guest verses.

The production is astounding, from the heavy percussion offset by iridescent swells of synth on “War Game” to voices smudged like watercolor paints in the background of “Heal.” Demilitarize weaves its dreamworld from gossamer and taffeta, then comes down on it all with 20-ton drums that somehow don't disturb the peace. The cliched warlike percussion samples of guns cocking and shells falling to the ground sound more like a soldier laying down his arms than preparing for battle. It's nimble music wearing body armor, making impossible moves.

Demilitarize has something of a happy ending, but it also scans as resolve to keep the fight going. “As I face the void/I reload my ghost,” he sings; “I reset the tone.” This reset brings Nazar closer to kuduro's party-starting origins than the falling-shrapnel thud of Guerilla—but kuduro's history is intertwined with conflict, even used as a tool of soft power and electioneering by the MPLA. Nazar's new position feels closer to the wounded romance and turbulence of the Príncipe crew, expats far away from their ancestral home who also make mutant strains of kuduro and related sounds. There's a longing in all of this music, a sense of history that's both felt and lived. Alternately atmospheric and gut-punching, Demilitarize embodies these contradictions for a record even more searing—but also touching—than its civil war-inspired predecessor.

Nilüfer Yanya has shared the new song “Cold Heart.” Co-written with her creative partner Wilma Archer, it was one in a collection of tracks that the British singer-songwriter re-approached after wrapping up her most recent tour. “Cold Heart” is also her first new music since releasing My Method Actor, her third studio album, last year. Give the single a listen below.

“This one turned out pretty different to how I imagined it,” Yanya said of the new song. “The initial melody felt very spacious, like there's room for anything to happen. It felt like a kind of experiment.”

Yanya has a busy summer ahead of her, as she will be on the road touring in support of My Method Actor. Included on her tour route are performances at Glastonbury, Green Man, All Points East, and many more music festivals.

	Will Hermes



	Driven by dubious metrics, fumbling with clearly baked-in blind spots and biases, in recurring corrective mode (see Sister Rosetta Tharpe) when it musters the will, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is always missing much of the real action in its attempts to canonize music that, if it sticks around long enough to be canonized, has often lost the fire if not the whole plot.


	Yet somehow we still care about the Hall's verdicts, shaking our fists, occasionally pumping them. Hell, even Lou Reed — a man with as finely calibrated a bullshit detector as any rock musician ever, was inducted with the Velvet Underground and again (posthumously) for his solo work — even he cared. (Full disclosure: I've never been part of the nominating cabal, but I have been a voter for years, proud to have disgruntledly scrawled “New York Dolls” in red Sharpie as a graffiti write-in candidate on more than one ballot.)


	Despite a history of getting things wrong, and with due respect to the 2025 inductees, I was still flabbergasted that Phish — finally nominated this year — were snubbed, dissed, left at the alter. Unrivaled in the jam-band realm, godfathers to multiple generations of black-hole-spelunking rock noodlers, they've filled arenas, sheds, stadiums, motorway racetracks, decommissioned military bases, and Native American reservations. As New Yorker writer Amanda Petrusich pointed out this month in an admiring, super-sized profile of the band, Phish's 1999 New Year's Eve show at the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation, on the precipice of a supposed Y2K apocalypse, was attended by more people than any concert in the world that night. They smoked Metallica, Eminem, and Jimmy Buffet — all three Rock Hall of Famers — who also hosted premature end-times parties that night.

	











	To judge by more criteria you'd think would signify to Rock Hall voters, the band has, depending on your math, roughly 16 studio albums (six gold, one platinum) and over 50 physical live albums, a largely meaningless number for a band that's made every concert it's played since 2002 available online. Many of the studio LPs are good, some (Lawn Boy, Billy Breathes, Joy, Round Room) could be called great. Trey Anastasio belongs on any list of the best rock guitarists (including Rolling Stone's); drummer Jon Fishman keeps it tight and plays a mean vacuum cleaner; Mike Gordon and Page McConnell are master craftsmen, and crucially, the collective is more than the sum of their parts. After a drug-related hiatus worthy of a Behind the Music (another industry benchmark they somehow never clocked), Phish arguably came back better than ever — and are still at it, full-tilt and by all reports in full bloom, 40-some years after they began playing bars in Burlington, Vermont.

	I mean, seriously: Last I checked, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland has Phish's iconic hot-dog chariot — a stage prop as famous as the Rolling Stones' inflatable mid-Seventies penis — hanging in their damn lobby. I thought dudes woulda been a shoe-in.


	“But the music,” you say. Oh, it's not good enough? It doesn't “rock” enough? Take a look at the full list of the Rock Hall's inductees, measure Phish's music against everything you see represented there, and get back to me. Honestly, such measurement is impossible — because Phish's kaleidoscope oeuvre, much of it invented in real time on stages, never to be repeated the same way, can't really be quantified, even if most of the concert recordings exist. To understand it, as the old saying goes, you really had to be there.


	Fun fact: That oeuvre, alongside all of their original material, includes the band's numerous, fairly letter-perfect re-creations of entire albums by other Rock Hall inductees over the years, many (but not all of them) part of an ongoing series of “musical costume sets” for their Halloween shows. They've done the Beatles' White Album, Exile on Main Street, Quadrophenia, Ziggy Stardust, Dark Side of the Moon, Loaded. Talking Heads Remain in Light has been maybe my favorite so far. They also covered the classic live album Waiting for Columbus by Little Feat, another band shamefully never inducted into the Hall. Phish revere the traditions the Hall of Fame poobahs promote as much as they do, maybe more.

	Granted, Phish aren't a singles band. They've never had a real hit, although “Free” — as perfect an evocation of being super high at an arena rock show as any band has managed — hit Number 11 on the U.S. mainstream rock chart in 1996, among scattered lesser Phish chartings. And granted, the band is divisive, for reasons as much cultural as musical. You can't pick your fans. Plenty of Phish-heads may be annoying, but so are plenty of Deadheads, metalheads, hip-hop heads, yacht-rock ironists, Springsteen fanatics. But hatas especially love to hate on Phish, so much so that it's virtually part of their brand. Even the The New Yorker slipped a snarky subhead under the headline of that honorific Phish feature: “People who love Phish do so with a quasi-religious devotion. People who dislike Phish do so with an equal fervor.”


	Full disclosure number 2: I wouldn't call myself a Phish fan, not really. At least not in the way I'd call myself a Deadhead. Certain Phish songs make me smile; certain Grateful Dead songs can make me weep. It's partly a generational thing, but also an apples-and-oranges thing. For all of the lazy — and a number of valid — comparisons between the bands, they do different things. The Dead zero in on eternal verities, cosmic consciousness, storytelling archetypes. Their jams are scuba dives in warming oceans that wash you up on shore with a sense of wonder. As I see it, Phish dig the absurd, grok human folly, love to wow and wig-out their congregation. Their shows are amusement park rides, roller-coaster carts chugging past funhouse mirrors and over tilting floors, dropping through trap doors, dumping you into the parking lot minus one earring and maybe your car keys. Consider that the Dead's premiere jam journey is titled “Dark Star,” while Phish's is called “Tweezer.” 

	











	Yes, there's overlap between these generalizations, and I'm sure even lay Phish fans could school me how I've got it wrong. I've only been to a handful of shows. The first was at the St. Paul Civic Center, 1995, and thanks to the band's remarkable recordkeeping, I recall the hijinks: their what-just-happened? transformation into an ad hoc bluegrass band during the first set, the sweet cover of Bowie's “Life on Mars?,” a choogling “Chalk Dust Torture,” a woozy detour into Pink Floyd's “Breathe” (the first-ever, I now know). It was fun. I'm not sure I stayed for the full second set.  


	My reckoning came when I caught one of their signature Madison Square Garden New Year's Eve shows — in 2002 > 2003, the first following a portentous two-year hiatus, which had fans flying in from all over.  As I wrote then with vestigial skepticism: “Yep, the drummer still wears a housedress. The band still pause mid-song for the occasional ‘silent jam.' And the shows still draw more dreadlocked whiteys than Amsterdam during Cannabis Cup weekend.” But the music got its hooks into me that night. By the time the clock struck midnight and fake snow began falling on every part of the dark arena — like it was falling faintly through the universe, per James Joyce — and the band was spiraling through “Seven Below,” a Caribbean-tinged songlet that sounds like a mid-period Brian Eno sketch, I had the sensation you can get under a streetlight in a winter storm, when you seem to be rising up while the snowflakes stand still.


	I was probably very high. But it was objectively magical, a perfectly conceived and executed performance, totally delightful. The sort of thing the band has been doing consistently for decades: creating uniquely scripted parties packed with musical improvisation every night, compelling fans to travel hundreds of miles to attend dozens of shows, and spurring even folks with no natural grace to dance their asses off. This is what truly makes Phish great: not just songs or albums or concert recordings, but memorable lived experiences. The shows. The community.

	Plenty of great artists cultivate this sort of culture; see Taylor Swift and Tyler, the Creator. The Grateful Dead blueprinted it — and it's worth noting that when the surviving members did their 50th anniversary “farewell” shows in 2015, Trey Anastasio was the Jerry Garcia stand-in. I thought he acquitted himself beautifully, singing and playing the songs reverently but not slavishly, as much a fan of the band as anyone in the audience.

	











As one pundit put it after the announcement of Phish's Rock Hall nomination, the band itself is a damn Rock Hall. And like countless other great uninducted acts, they'll continue building their own, every night they play, and fans will vote 'em in again and again and again.

	Kristine Kwak



	Within three years of releasing their first single, the rising global girl group XG were at Coachella to help close out the festival at the Sahara Tent. Members Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya, and Cocona delivered an electrifying set that spanned their discography from fan-favorite tracks like “LEFT RIGHT” and “IS THIS LOVE,” which had a viral moment due to their “Glitch Dance,” to powerful all-rap anthem “WOKE UP,” which showcases XG's strengths as rappers. 


	Despite being one of the final acts to perform both weekends, XG drew a sizable crowd, with fans chanting “XG! XG! XG!” ahead of the members taking the stage in their signature, avant-garde fashion and makeup looks. They always bring something out-of-the-box and original on stage, a mission that stems from their label, XGALX, making their performances truly a sight to see. 


	The group is currently finishing up their first world tour, known as the first HOWL, which kicked off in 2024 in their home base of Japan, and spanned across Asia, Europe, and North America, with a number of additional shows added this year in Europe, South America, and the U.S, and grand plans to wrap the tour at the renowned Tokyo Dome on May 14. The conclusion of the tour will come with new music, with the release of their single “MILLION PLACES.” The track draws inspiration from XG's journey across the globe throughout their world tour and reflects on the love they've received from their fans, ALPHAZ. 

	











	XG sat down with Rolling Stone to reflect on their journey thus far, dive into what makes them “Xtraordinary”, and share their goals for the future.


What was your reaction when you heard you were performing at Coachella? Hinata: At first, we couldn't believe it — we all froze and were like, “Wait, what?” It was a dream stage for us, so the fact that we were able to stand on it this early was such a surprise, and we were just filled with happiness.


Do you remember who the first person you told was when you found out?Hinata: I wanted to keep it a surprise from my family, so when the announcement came out, I got tons of messages — they were honestly so shocked!

Being based in Japan, what did you know about Coachella before?Cocona: Every year, we always set aside time to watch Coachella performances together. We've watched primarily Main Stage performances, but since we were performing on the Sahara Stage this time, we went back and watched past performances from that stage as well. 












What was your impression of the festival before, and what is your impression now that you've seen it in person?Cocona: I hadn't been in person, so preparing based only on imagination was quite challenging. Once we actually arrived, we realized how much the wind could vary from day to day — it could get really strong — and the air was super dry, which made performing difficult in many ways.


How was that? I remember the wind was crazy for week one, especially during “IN THE RAIN.”Cocona: Doing a show in such a different environment was tough, but it also taught us a lot and turned out to be an incredible experience. I want to take everything I learned from this and keep pushing forward toward even more growth!


Were there any challenges or surprises while preparing for your set?Jurin: I think this was the period of our careers when we faced the most challenges ever — from last-minute setlist changes to editing and adding audio, as well as adjusting costumes.


You definitely never know what to expect with big performances like this, especially in unique environments like Coachella. Another thing about festivals is that you're given the opportunity to reach audiences who may not be familiar with your music yet. What do you want people who don't know XG to think after watching your performance?Harvey: We'd be so happy if the visual and auditory impact leaves them thinking of us as a seven-member group of aliens. [Smiles.] We hope they can feel the bond that unites us as one, witness the strength of our unity, and see how much we truly enjoy music — and we'd love for the fans to share and resonate with that moment together with us!

If you had to describe XG as a group in three words, what would they be and why?Juria: “Xtraordinary,” just like our name, XG [Xtraordinary Girls]. I believe our style is all about making our own path without being bound by norms, standards, or common sense. “Aliens” — when you think of XG, I think “aliens” definitely comes to mind. We've always believed in them ever since we were trainees, and we really, really want to meet them! Aliens have no limits — there's nothing they can't do, and that makes them the strongest in my eyes. I want to become just like them. [Laughs.]  And “wolves.” Our unity and collective strength are just like that of a wolf pack.  We're always moving as one, supporting and helping each other every step of the way — that kind of teamwork really reminds me of wolves!

	











To that point about acting and moving as a pack, how has your teamwork grown over the past couple of years? Chisa: Over the past year on our world tour, we naturally started gathering more frequently for meetings and had so many more chances to talk about each other's strengths and roles within the group. I truly feel our bond has grown stronger and our teamwork has improved so much.


What do your members mean to you?Chisa: To me, my members are like people who understand me as well as I understand myself— and I think it's one of our biggest strengths that we all feel that way about each other. We're like a real family, like sisters — always together, whether we're having fun, feeling down, or facing anything in between. I can confidently say that I understand their joys and pains better than anyone. They're the ones I connect with the most in my life right now. They're pure love… love you so much! [Smiles.] 


You flew to Seattle between weekend 1 and weekend 2 of Coachella for a tour stop — how do you stay energized with such a busy schedule? Juria: I think it's really important to refresh ourselves by doing things like going shopping or enjoying delicious local food!


Any fun memories in particular thus far? Juria: The day after Coachella, we all went to In-N-Out Burger — it was so good, I was seriously about to cry from how delicious it was. [Laughs.] We also did a lot of shopping at Sephora!


Now that you've performed at Coachella, what are some goals you have, personal or as a group? I know you have a Tokyo Dome show coming up very soon, so exciting!Hinata: We have so many goals! Topping the Billboard Hot 100, performing on the main stage at Coachella, winning a Grammy — there are so many dreams we want to make come true. But more than anything, we want to enjoy the journey and use our music and performances to bring courage and love to people all around the world!


And what's something you've learned during your careers since debut? Whether it be a technical skill or something you've learned about yourselves.Cocona: That of course, the opinions and evaluations from others are important, but what matters most isn't that. What's truly important is our dreams and goals. “What do we, as XG, want to achieve? What do we want to leave behind in this world?” Keeping that at the core and moving forward with that mindset every day is something I believe is really important.

	











	I also feel more and more how vital communication is. In the past, most of our communication was just between the members and our producer Simon, but now that we have a much larger team and so many staff involved, we're constantly working on how to share ideas more effectively and efficiently. We're always learning and adjusting how we communicate to keep everything running smoothly.


	There's so much to learn every day. And while it can be challenging at times, I'm truly grateful to be in an environment where we can keep growing and learning together.

And looking to the future, what are areas you want to grow in in the future?Maya: There are so many areas in which I want to grow in the future. Both as a group and as an individual. I feel like there's never a time when I feel 100 percent satisfied with my performance, but I don't take that as a negative thing because nobody's perfect and there's always a place for improvements. And that's totally normal. That's why I like to be honest with myself and make sure I have time to reflect.


	Everyday is a new day because there's always so many different things to learn. I want to challenge myself into doing new things and learn so I can grow and do better in the future!

	When Mariah Carey received her second nomination for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year, the institution's foundation chairman John Sykes issued a statement celebrating the latest batch of nominees. “These remarkable nominees have each created their own musical style and attitude impacting generations of music lovers,” he wrote. Carey appeared on this year's ballot alongside Phish, Outkast, Oasis, Billy Idol, Cyndi Lauper, Joy Division/New Order, Soundgarden, the White Stripes, Joe Cocker, Bad Company, Black Crowes, Chubby Checker, and Maná.


	Carey was on the ballot in 2024, too. That time, she appeared alongside Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, Oasis, Sinéad O'Connor, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Dave Matthews Band, Eric B. & Rakim, Foreigner, Peter Frampton, Jane's Addiction, Kool and the Gang, Lenny Kravitz, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the time, Sykes shared another iteration of his celebratory statement: “These artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps,” he said.

	











	The criteria expressed in these statements were no less true in 2024 or 2025 than they were in 2016, when Carey first became eligible for the prestigious honor. In fact, it barely took a decade after the release of her debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990 for her influence to begin crafting a new generation of pop divas who would take charge arranging their own vocals in the studio with the same authority they'd wield onstage. And yet, for the second year in a row, the singer, songwriter, and producer has been shut out from being inducted. Bad Company, Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, OutKast, Soundgarden, and the White Stripes will join the Class of 2025. With each passing year, the legacy Carey has crafted only becomes more indisputable. What else does the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame want from her? 


	Last year, Carey admitted to being slightly disappointed when she wasn't selected to be part of the Hall's class of 2024. “Everybody was calling me going, ‘I think you're getting in!' and so I was excited about it,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “But then it didn't happen.” She felt a similar sense of inevitability when her 1995 opus Daydream racked up six nominations at the Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. “One Sweet Day,” “Always Be My Baby,” and “Fantasy” — all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 — were up for awards. “All those songs in a row ended up being so big,” she said, surely at least one would win, right? “Then I sat there the whole time and I didn't get anything. I was like, ‘This is not fun. But what can I do?'”

	Those three songs make up only a fraction of the 19 Number One singles Carey has earned in the past 35 years, 18 of which she is credited with co-writing. By 1998, she had enough hit singles to release her first greatest-hits compilation, Number 1's, featuring the 13 she had accumulated in only eight years. The musician is currently in the midst of celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Emancipation of Mimi, an album that caught an entirely new generation of pop listeners up to speed on her prowess as a hitmaker. It gave us “We Belong Together,” “Shake It Off,” “Don't Forget About Us,” and “It's Like That,” small pieces of what Carey told Rolling Stone in 2024 became “my favorite body of work that I've done.” 


	In the history of the Hall, some artists, like Patti Smith and Solomon Burke, were nominated between seven and nine times before being inducted. Chic has been nominated 11 times and has yet to be inducted (though Nile Rodgers was inducted into the Hall in 2017, receiving the Award for Musical Excellence). It took Janet Jackson and Joni Mitchell three nominations in three years long after their eligibility periods began to make it in. For Donna Summer, it was five nominations in five years. Even Brenda Lee, whose “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” goes head-to-head on the charts with “All I Want for Christmas Is You” each year, wasn't inducted until 2002, after three nominations. Like many of these artists, Carey should never have needed more than one.

	In 2022, Carey was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Her speech played up the dramatics that she's known for, but it also emphasized the years she spent “walking by myself and coming up with melodies and writing words in a book.” That accolade in particular meant a lot. She's “constantly” having to remind people that she's a songwriter, she said. But it was more than that. Questlove explained why. “That's the power of success, especially at Mariah Carey's level,” he said, “because you can be overlooked in certain respects and people will forget that you are an artist. People forget, and suddenly you just become the product.” 


	There's always been a prominent thread of resilience woven throughout Carey's career. She never lingers in the dark for long before stepping back into the spotlight (or the twinkling lights every holiday season). She's encountered her share of both real and contrived rivalries — par for the course for most pop stars — but never anything explosive enough to disrupt her unbothered aura of tranquility. She's released 15 studio albums and won six of her 34 career Grammy Award nominations. Her legacy was built on a concrete foundation of personal strength and one of the most singular voices music has ever known. Mariah is in the same vein as Janet and Whitney. Mariah is at the root of Christina and Ariana. One of one. 

	











	“There truly are no words that suffice. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this dream come true and for sprinkling your brilliance and magic on my little song,” Grande said when Carey, “the one and only, queen of my heart and lifelong inspiration,” appeared on the remix of her single “Yes, And?” in 2024. This is what Carey always wanted. “I don't want to just be categorized as ‘of this era.' My goal is to have a career that stands. Otherwise, what's the point?” she told Vibe in 1998. This is what she worked for. “[Sony] would put out like only four singles from one of my albums,” Carey said. “Where, like a Janet, would put out, like, seven, and they'd be working the same album for, like, two years. But with me it was like, ‘Get in the studio! More records! Sing! Sing!'”

	More than 1,200 artists, historians, and industry professionals — the Hall of Fame's voters — shape music history with boxes checked on a nominee ballot. The Hall selection criteria is meant to take into account an artist's impact on music culture, like Carey's trailblazing success as a female pop producer and songwriter in the face of corporate misogyny. It's also the influence an artist has had on other musicians, like Latto repurposing “Fantasy” into a hit for the 2020s with “Big Energy,” or Megan Thee Stallion boasting, “I feel like Mariah Carey/Got these niggas so obsessed” on her Number One single “Hiss.” The Hall also values range and longevity as they relate to both an artist's career and their body of work, reflected in Carey's positioning at the intersection between pop, R&B, and hip-hop (she even has a secret alt-rock/grunge album sitting in a vault somewhere).


	Whatever it is they're looking for, Carey has it. It's in her voice, it's in her songs, it's in her legacy. She's checked all the boxes. Now, it's the Hall's turn. Maybe the third time will be the Charmbracelet, but it's already overdue.

	The Hall, the Hall will tear us apart. Again. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has announced its new crop of inductees, revealing that New Order got rejected this year. The Hall nominated Joy Division and New Order as one band, which meant that Hall voters had a chance to nab two legendary bands with one vote. Both Joy Division and New Order are ridiculously overqualified for the Hall of Fame as individual units — two of the most influential bands of the past 50 years. But they don't even go in combined? How did this happen?


	In terms of history, this is one of the Hall's biggest whiffs ever. The Eighties art-punk goth-disco pioneers have been not getting into the Hall for 20 years now, despite the fact that they've been eligible since the year Olivia Rodrigo was born, and despite their massive impact on post-punk, synth-pop, and dance music. One of New Order's best tunes is “Confusion,” one of Joy Division's best tunes is “Disorder,” and that seems to be the case here. As Ian Curtis used to sing, “Where will it ennnnd? Where will it ennnnd?”

	











	Joy Division/New Order got nominated in 2023, and didn't make the cut then, either. Yet it's an even bigger surprise this time, since they looked like a slam dunk on this year's decidedly underwhelming ballot of candidates. You are guaranteed to see the Unknown Pleasures album cover on a T-shirt this week. That's not gonna happen with Chubby Checker, sorry.


	Like the Smiths, the Pixies, or the Replacements, they're an iconic Eighties band even more influential and beloved now than they were in the Eighties — talk about cultural staying power. But as far as the Hall is concerned, these bands are all below the Chubby Line. For years, Hall voters held the fort against the Eighties, especially Eighties U.K. New Wave, always one of their least favorite genres. But they caved in 2019, when the Cure got in, and gave the best induction interview of all time. (Q: “Are you as excited as I am?” Robert Smith: “By the sounds of it, no.”) Depeche Mode went in the next year, followed by Eurythmics and Duran Duran. So the door was wide open for the Hall voters to finally catch up with New Order. Too soon, I guess. Was their timing that flawed?

	New Order were the ultimate Eighties band: four antisocial kids who rose from the ashes of punk rock, dabbled in electro beats, then accidentally turned into global dance-floor innovators. If they'd quit after original frontman Ian Curtis died in 1980, they'd still be remembered as Joy Division, for “Love Will Tear Us Apart.” If they'd quit after the 1982 single “Temptation,” they'd be remembered for the most achingly emotional nine-minute New Wave synth-disco 12-inch of all time. If they'd broken up after Low-Life and Brotherhood in 1986, they'd be remembered as the Eighties' most inventive electro-vampire goth-twit OG's. But nothing seems to stop New Order, a phenomenal live band to this day. In fact, since Peter Hook split off — we'll get to that — they're two phenomenal live bands.

	











	Joy Division came from the northern English industrial interzone of Manchester in the late 1970s, finding a dystopian sound for the urban bleakness around them. They shocked the world — especially themselves — with the dark grandeur of their debut, Unknown Pleasures. Tortured poet Ian Curtis turned his nightmares into cries from the heart, from “Disorder” to “New Dawn Fades” to “She's Lost Control.” There's also that classic album cover, which Rolling Stone named as the greatest ever — a haunting image of a pulsar, lonely out in space, 978 light years away.


	Their sound has been imitated ever since — Bernard Sumner's staccato guitar, Stephen Morris' robot-twitch drums, and the lead instrument, Peter Hook's elastic bass. “Love Will Tear Us Apart” was their huge U.K. hit in 1980 — but tragically, it was a posthumous hit. Curtis died by suicide in Manchester, the night before the band's first American tour. The group left behind classic singles like “Dead Souls,” “Atmosphere,” and “Transmission,” where Curtis pleads, “Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio,” as if it's a scream for salvation.

	His mates could have given up. Yet they stuck together, renamed themselves New Order, brought in Morris' girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert, to play keyboards, and started from scratch, refusing to play Joy Division material. None of them could sing, so Sumner got stuck with the job. Shell-shocked from the loss of their friend, they started tinkering with primitive synths and drum machines. Yet somehow, their daft experiments blew up into worldwide club hits like “Blue Monday,” “True Faith,” and the eternal floor-filler “Bizarre Love Triangle.” The bigger they got, the weirder they got. “The Perfect Kiss” is all late-night club-land desperation; Sumner speaks for generations of lonely kids when he sings, “Tonight I should have stayed at home/Playing with my pleasure zone.”


	Even their disasters are legendary. They started the Hacienda club in Manchester, a famous fiasco of the acid-house era. (Hook's hilarious book about it is titled How Not to Run a Club.) With designer Peter Saville, they released the 1983 “Blue Monday” in a 12-inch package so expensive, they lost money on every copy sold — but of course, it went on to become the biggest-selling 12-inch in history, influencing dance music ever since. I have at least one friend who owes her life to the fact that her parents got together on a Miami dance floor when “Blue Monday” came on in the club. But in a way, we're all children of “Blue Monday.” 

	











	My favorite New Order record will always be the Factus 8 1981-1982 EP, a half-hour groove of post-punk guitar jitters, synth whooshes, and urgent drums, with five of their best songs. They never topped the original nine-minute “Temptation,” their disco celebration of social anxiety, with the chant “Up, down, turn around, please don't let me hit the ground!” There's a heart-stopping moment right at the 5:36 point where Hooky's bass leaps up an octave for a few hyper-emotional throbs, right after Barney yelps “I'll always try to break the circle that's been placed around me.” The brotherly call-and-response is so moving, especially from two guys who famously hated each other. The moment only lasts a couple of seconds, but once you hear it, it's in your soul forever.


	Their best full album is Brotherhood, with the open-hearted surge of “Weirdo” and “Broken Promise.” Then it's Power, Corruption, and Lies (especially Side Two), Low-Life (especially Side One), Technique (especially “All the Way”), Movement (especially “Chosen Time”), Waiting for the Siren's Call. By the Nineties, they were riding a post-Ibiza acid-house club wave that couldn't have happened without them. Their whole career is full of Hall of Fame-worthy moments. The scratchy guitar break that explodes halfway through “Age of Consent.” The playful harmonica in “Love Vigilantes.” The Gilbert synth sparkles of “Thieves Like Us.” The massive climax of “Disorder,” where Curtis yells “Feeling feeling feeee-liiiing” as Morris slams it home with three gigantic cymbal crashes.


	OK, the lyrics. I was hoping you wouldn't bring those up. You got me there. I can't argue New Order belong in the Hall of Fame for poetry like “I would like a place I can call my own/Have a conversation on the telephone.” Sumner sang terrible lines and brilliant lines, often in the same song, yet part of his boyish charm is that he could never tell the difference. “I feel so low, I feel so humble, sometimes in life we take a tumble” — if you ever sang those words into a microphone, you'd not only erase the tape, you'd burn down the studio and execute any witnesses. 


	But New Order reveled in that kind of thing. It became part of their mystique — the “Did he say that?” factor never stops. “Every time I see you falling, I get down on my knees and pray” is a genius chorus; “Oh, God, Johnny, please don't point that gun at me” is a godawful one; there's no evidence to suggest anyone in the band cared either way.

	If they ever go into the Hall, with all four in the same room, there will be some weapons-grade drama on that stage. Hook and the other three haven't been on speaking terms in years. When he left, he formed his own band to play this catalog, the Light. Sumner and Hook both wrote memoirs going into detail about why they despise each other. The first time they got nominated, Hook mused, “Maybe this is the olive branch that we may need.” But this might take more than an olive branch — probably an act of God. Still, hope we get to see it happen someday. Maybe they'll play “No Love Lost.”


	Joy Division/New Order are definitely one of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's biggest omissions — but it's not just them. The voters have a long-running fear of the Eighties Other, especially if it involves synths, big hair, or British accents. And forget the Nineties, most of whose major rock stars have never even been nominated, an era the Hall is desperate to avoid even though it's the all-time peak for rock artists in terms of cultural and commercial clout. For the Hall voters, any rock after 1980 is still bad company, and the Hall does not [wukka-WHAM wukka-WHAM wukka-WHAM] feel like makin' love. The Hall of Fame will keep scrounging for Sixties/Seventies ham-and-eggers as long as they can, and why not? Everyone loves to complain about the Hall — that's what it's there for. (Luther Vandross? Never nominated! Seriously! Fiona Apple? Ditto!) But it's only a matter of time until the voters catch up with the inescapable legacy of Joy Division/New Order. Really, the whole story of pop music is contained in their evolution. They're the band that crawled from the wreckage of the Seventies, and ended up inventing the Eighties.

George Lucas broke down the origins of Yoda's “very distinctive way of talking” at a 45th anniversary screening of The Empire Strikes Back at the 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival last week.


	Lucas was asked about Yoda's particular patter, which often found the character doing away with typical sentence structure and essentially delivering his heady insights and mighty koans backwards. For example: “Luminous beings are we”; “Anger, fear, aggression — the Dark Side are they”; and, “Wars not make one great.”


	All of that was done intentionally, Lucas said, to make sure audiences were paying attention. “If you were speaking regular English, people don't listen that much,” Lucas said. “But if you have an accent, or it's really hard to understand what he's saying, they focus on what he's saying.”


	The Star Wars creator continued, “He was basically the philosopher of the movie, so he was talking about all the things. I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12 year olds.”

	Yoda first appearance in the Star Wars universe came in The Empire Strikes Back, when Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) seeks out the Jedi Master to learn the ways of the Force. Yoda was voiced and “portrayed” (or controlled) by the legendary puppeteer and actor Frank Oz, who reprised the role in Return of the Jedi and continued to voice Yoda in the Star Wars prequel and sequel movies.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In a 2021 interview with Rolling Stone, Oz spoke about playing Yoda, and all the different creatives who helped build the character. “It was really George [Lucas] and Larry [Kasdan] who wrote it. And [designer/make-up artist] Stuart [Freeborn] made it,” Oz said. “Jim [Henson] helped to a degree, and other people. But at the end of the day, what I did was put it together as a living, breathing thing. But I couldn't have done it without those people. I'm the only one who's ever done Yoda. So I feel good about that.”

Beyoncé is all saddled up and ready to get her rodeo on the road. In a few hours, the musician will kick off the Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles, the first of 32 stadium shows scheduled in support of her country opus. On the eve of opening night, Beyoncé shared a preview of the elaborate stage design planned for the tour, paired with the caption: “She's Coming.”


	The video begins high in the rafters. As the camera moves forward, the expanse of SoFi Stadium comes into view. It captures crew members still hard at work assembling the set. The base of the stage is built in the shape of a star with three additional catwalks extending from there. It appears as though there are four additional risers and sections in place on the floor. 

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)


	Also known as the Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, the run of live shows follows 2023's Renaissance world tour. Beyoncé offered the first taste of Cowboy Carter live when she headlined the NFL Christmas Game Day halftime show, dubbed the Beyoncé Bowl. Her set that night included the ballads “16 Carriages” and “Blackbiird,” performed alongside country singers Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts. She called back to the Renaissance era with “My House” and welcomed collaborators Shaboozey and Post Malone to the field.

For reference, the Renaissance tour set spanned between two and a half and three hours.


	The Cowboy Carter tour will extend through July 11. Beyoncé will make stops in Chicago, New Jersey, London, Paris, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.

From its cavernous domed bazaar to its ravishingly muscular museum, the Uzbek capital has one of the world's wildest collections of modernist gems. Will its bid for world heritage status succeed?

A pair of huge turquoise domes swell up on the skyline of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, perching on the jumbled horizon like two upturned bowls. One gleams with ceramic tiles, glazed in traditional Uzbek patterns. The other catches the light with a pleated canopy of azure metal ribs. Both recall the majestic cupolas that crown the mosques of the country's ancient Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara. But here, they cover structures of a very different kind.

The ribbed metal dome crowns the home of the state circus, its futuristic-looking big top seeming to have been crossed with a UFO. Built in 1976, it's big enough to hold an audience of 3,000. The ceramic dome, meanwhile, looms over the bustling chaos of the city's main market, Chorsu Bazaar, built in 1980 as a wonderworld of fruit, meat and fish, sprawling across an area the size of two football pitches. Both are dazzling works of Soviet modernism, and part of a remarkable group of buildings that the country has just submitted to Unesco, in the hope of having them granted world heritage status.

“People tend to think of Uzbek heritage as our ancient Islamic monuments,” says Gayane Umerova, chair of the country's Art and Culture Development Foundation (ACDF). “But we need to realise that we are in danger of losing the more recent layers of history, due to urban development. We have to act now.”

Over the last few years, the ACDF has been highlighting Tashkent's unique postwar heritage, hosting conferences, commissioning expert research, and now publishing two hefty books about the period, as well as putting the topic in the global spotlight with an exhibition at the Venice architecture biennale, opening shortly. This push was triggered in 2018, following a public outcry over the demolition of a beloved cylindrical concrete movie theatre, the House of Cinema, built in 1982. It was hastily bulldozed to make way for a $1.3bn commercial development, a bloated cluster of generic glass towers known as Tashkent City.

“It was a big loss for our society,” says Umerova. “It wasn't just about the building –people had grown up with the cinema as a place to go on dates, see friends, hang out. Its sudden loss made us look at what else might be in danger.”

In the line of fire, potentially, is one of the most unusual collections of modernist buildings anywhere in the world. About 2,000 miles from Moscow, Tashkent occupies a fascinating position in the history of the Soviet Union as a showcase city, bridging east and west. It was designated a “beacon of socialism in the east”, conceived as a vast vitrine to display the successful socialist transformation of a non-Russian city. Its image of prosperity, abundance, leisure and progress would show how communism could be adapted to the diverse, far-flung populations of Central Asia – and therefore to the rest of the world.

An earthquake in 1966 provided a convenient excuse to raze much of the historic city and impose a masterplan of wide avenues dotted with grand, orientalist structures that would speak of Tashkent's new role as the modern gateway to Asia. The buildings are a fascinating mix, combining the latest technologies and construction techniques of international modernism with ornamental details that hark back to the 15th-century architecture of the Timurid dynasty. That became adopted as the official national style, and remains so to this day, despite it being of little historic relevance to Tashkent.

“Interestingly, the buildings designed for Tashkent in Moscow were much more decorative and ‘orientalist' than those designed locally,” says Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Russian architect whose Milan-based practice Grace has been leading the preservation strategy. “It was like they were trying to present an imaginary, exoticised image of Tashkent back to local people.”

She is standing outside the former Lenin Museum, now the state history museum, a gleaming white marble jewellery box. Wrapped with supersized latticework screens, it appears to float above a recessed glass lobby on a hidden steel frame. The building was created in 1970 by the snappily titled Central Scientific Research and Experimental Project Institute for Entertainment and Sport, an elite Moscow bureau that delivered prestige projects across the USSR. Despite the bold modernist form, its design consciously draws on tradition, with the geometric screens referencing vernacular Uzbek panjara, or latticework grilles that provide shading and ventilation, as well as Islamic patterns (a fact not mentioned at the time). “The design was criticised locally for being superficial,” says Golovatyuk. “But it launched a new direction. Gradually, this would become the language of modernist Tashkent.”

The domed circus is a striking example of how these aesthetic attitudes evolved. It was first drawn up in the early 1960s, by architects Genrikh Aleksandrovich and Gennady Masyagin, as a brutalist flying saucer, studded with porthole windows. Construction began in 1965, but was halted by the earthquake. As time went on, the space-age design became historicised, clothed in traditional fancy dress. The inspiration was no longer a UFO, but an Uzbek piala, or teacup. Decorative concrete sunshades were added, in a form that echoed ancient Kufic script. The interior is a surreal mashup, where concentric cosmic rays radiating from the doorways became encrusted with traditional ornamentation, like a spaceship decked out in chintzy wallpaper.

Other experiments to celebrate the regional context focused less on decoration than on local typologies. One of the most radical projects of the era is the Zhemchug (or Pearl) housing block, designed as a vertical expression of the traditional mahalla courtyard homes. Built in 1985, the 16-storey tower features a pair of communal courtyards every three storeys, providing space for children to play, while elderly residents sit out playing chess and drinking tea. Front doors are reached via outdoor galleries that look down into these back yards in the sky.

“I love its uniqueness,” says Dilara, who has lived here for decades. “We've used the courtyards for weddings, barbecues and drinking beer together. There is a strong sense of community.” A rooftop swimming pool, now a pond, was added to increase stability in the event of an earthquake. It is surrounded by mushroom-shaped sunshades that double as ventilation for all the kitchens down below.

Sadly, this inventive design didn't take off. “It was the first building in Uzbekistan to use sliding concrete formwork,” says Golovatyuk, referring to a system where the moulds are moved up while concrete is poured continuously. “It was supposed to be cheaper and faster, but it turned out to be slower and much more expensive.” Still, its occupants seem to love it. They've even curated a little exhibition about its female architect, Ophelia Aydinova, in the lobby.

Cost may have deterred any repeat, but money was no object when it came to symbols of national pride. As the planned economy began to falter in the 1980s, the baubles of Soviet pomp became ever grander. As Golovatyuk puts it: “When a regime isn't doing so well, the need for representation gets even bigger.” She is standing outside a prime example, the gargantuan Palace of People's Friendship. Unveiled in 1981, its ornate hall seats over 4,000 in a pharaonic temple of culture, dripping with gilded ceramics and crystal chandeliers.

Designed by the team behind the Lenin Museum, led by Yevgeny Rozanov and Elena Sukhanova, it is a tour de force of Uzbek modernism. Raised on a plinth, the museum is wrapped in a muscular facade of panjara-inspired grille-work, crowned with a colossal frieze of abstract muqarnas, the sculptural stalactite motifs found inside the domes and niches of Islamic architecture. Inside, the ceiling of its triple-height atrium groans with pearly chandeliers, evoking dangling branches of cotton bolls, while the walls are lined with fluted blue tiles and expressionistic ceramic sculptures by Alexander Kedrin. The floors, meanwhile, writhe with geometric marquetry. It has the look of an immense marble Transformer, seemingly about to unfold into a great robotic creature and march towards the circus.

There are more wonders dotted throughout the city, beautifully photographed by Karel Balas for a Rizzoli coffee-table book, and meticulously examined in a 900-page tome for Lars Müller, with pictures by Armin Linke. The metro system is a particular treat, especially Kosmonavtlar (or Cosmonauts) station, built in 1984 as a cosmic fantasy of blue tiled walls, green glass columns and celestial light fittings, evoking the wonders of space exploration.

Perhaps the most spectacular of all lies an hour outside the city, perched on a hillside in Parkent. Looking like something dreamed up by a Bond villain, the Sun Heliocomplex is an astonishing sight, a 20-storey convex cliff of mirrors, able to channel the sun's energy to a temperature of 3,000C. Completed in 1987, it was designed to test the resistance of materials to nuclear explosion and develop heatproof ceramics for the Soviet military. Since the collapse of the USSR, it has hobbled along, working with agriculture, textile and mining industries. Although it was a classified project, off-limits to most, it was intended as a showcase of applied arts, featuring sculptural ceramic screens and dazzling planetary chandeliers by artist Irena Lipene. A seven-tonne example will be shown in Venice, capturing in crystal the end-of-the-world glamour of the nuclear age.

Sergo Sutyagin, a leading Uzbek architect, hailed this “cosmic architecture”, praising how it “poetically and fantastically emerges” from the hillside, “prompting philosophical reflections on the reality of the unreal, on the possibility of the impossible”. The space race having moved elsewhere, you can now visit the complex and harness the immense power of the sun to boil a kettle or fry an egg.

If you happened to be in Europe on March 24th, 2025 and you looked up into the night sky, you may have seen something quite surprising.

A giant swirl of blue light appeared, leaving many people mystified.

Was it aliens?

No. Instead it is said to be from the launch of SpaceX's NROL-69 Mission, which is classified.

SpaceX did confirm that this launch took place on their website, saying:

“On Monday, March 24 at 1:48 p.m. ET, Falcon 9 launched the NROL-69 mission from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This was the second flight for the first stage booster supporting this mission, which previously launched a Starlink mission.”

According to a 2024 Reuters interview, SpaceX is working with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on technology that could be used to help with spy satellites. SpaceX may be sending up large numbers of smaller satellites that are able to coordinate together in a swarm in low-Earth orbit. They can then be used to image the Earth.

The launch was successful, but the fuel from it spread across the skies in this blue spiral, making it quite a spectacle to see. The spiral pattern is caused by the Falcon 9 rocket's exhaust system. This was explained on a post on X:

“We've received many reports of an illuminated swirl in the sky this evening. This is likely to be caused by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launched earlier today. The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky.”

Similar patterns have been seen during previous launches, though typically not as bright due to differences in the time and location of the launch. In a statement after a previous launch, geophysicist Don Hampton (Poker Flat Rocket Range chief scientist) explained:

“It is likely either exhaust from a rocket burn to bring the second stage down over the Pacific, or perhaps dumping extra rocket fuel after that burn. The spiral pattern indicates that the second stage was spinning when it exhausted the gasses. Any water vapor would turn into ice at these altitudes, and the ice would reflect sunlight where the rocket was, and make a bright cloud visible on the ground in Alaska where the sun was well below the horizon. It looks really bright in those pictures, but it is likely just a few pounds of water.”

So, while not as exciting as aliens, the bright light certainly was beautiful and will likely be something that is seen more in the future.

If you weren't lucky enough to catch it in person, you can see it in this brief YouTube video:



I wish I had seen it.

Then I could decide for myself.

If you thought that was interesting, you might like to read about the mysterious “pyramids” discovered in Antarctica. What are they?

This circus coming to Minnesota quite literally isn't for everyone, but it is bound to be a frightfully good time.

A relatively new brand of circus will be making a handful of stops in Minnesota this spring, including Duluth, St. Cloud, the Twin Cities, and Rochester, and if you enjoy the paranormal and other creepy things, this show is for you.

Picture it if you dare...you're under a black and red big-top tent where illusionists, mysterious creatures, aerial acrobats, and ""freaky"" performers assemble a show that combines circus, theatre, and cabaret into an experience that will ""scare, amuse, and surprise"".

This animal-free show is wildly imaginative, transporting you to what might feel more like a dark, twisted dream than what you're used to when you think of a circus. Here's a little taste from a show a few years ago:

Paranormal Cirque has an explicit ""R-rating"" on their website due to adult language and content in the show that's not intended for children.

Organizers warn that anyone under the age of 18 will need to be accompanied by an adult. Those ages 13-17 are welcome, as long as they are accompanied by someone 21 or older.

This isn't the first time this experience has come through Minnesota. Maybe you caught one of their 2023 shows, and you want to experience what is new this time around - or maybe you are just hearing about it for the first time.

Paranormal Cirque will be touring through Minnesota in May and June, making several stops along the way. Each stop will see the big top tent set up in a mall parking lot, starting with a stop in Rochester and ending their Minnesota tour in Duluth.

Here's where they'll be:

Rochester, MN at The Apache Mall: May 2-5, 2025 (Show details)

Albertville, MN at the Albertville Premium Outlets: May 9 - 12, 2025 (Show details)

Saint Paul, MN at the Maplewood Mall: May 16 - 19, 2025 (Show details)

Saint Cloud, MN at The Crossroads Center: May 23 - 26, 2025 (Show details)

Duluth, MN at the Miller Hill Mall: May 30 - June 2, 2025 (Show details)

UFO sightings are the most common instance of paranormal activity in Butler County, followed by cryptid sightings of creatures like Bigfoot, so says paranormal professional Daniel Hageman. The earliest sighting of his life was when he was 5 years old, and he claims to have spotted multiple paranormal phenomena throughout life.

“Butler is a hotbed for UFO sightings,” Hageman said.

Hageman, creator of the Butler Organization for Research of the Unexplained, said that while his primary interest is UFOs and aliens, his cause has grown to include other forms of paranormal activity. It all culminates in a yearly event, the Butler Paranormal Festival, which took place this year on Saturday, April 26 at the Tanglewood Center.

The 18th annual Butler Paranormal Festival included vendors and self-described experts who presented their research on aliens and UFOs, ghosts, Bigfoot, spirits, astrology and all kinds of paranormal creatures and beliefs. Other features of the event were activities like psychic and tarot readings.

Hageman said interest as grown in paranormal activity since he first got involved in the 1970s and '80s. Events like the festival were not common back then, but now, there's something like it happening somewhere every weekend.

Hageman said this is true even around Butler. His organization originally started as the “Butler UFO Group.” But as residents expressed interest in other phenomena and beliefs beyond strictly extraterrestrial activity, the organization grew into the Butler Organization for Research of the Unexplained. Hageman said the organization now has around 100 members.

“Because of my involvement with UFOs, it's led to interest in paranormal activity in general,” Hageman said. “Bigfoot, ghosts, Mothman, Dogman, we cover all the facets.”

The conference, Hageman said, normally gets about 400 visitors each year. Hageman said he wants the conference to be a place where people can come and express their curiosity, adding that “we've been lied to all our lives” by governments around the world.

Bryan Seech, who runs an organization called the Center for Cryptozoological Studies, presented his research on a number of unexplained incidents, including sketches of gargoyles that he said were sighted near Chicora. The sketch shows that some type of creature would have taken three 11-foot-strides to run across Route 68.

Seech said it's easy to get involved in the world of paranormal activity, whether it be from going down a rabbit-hole of information or being inspired while growing up.

“As a kid in the '70s, we would watch ‘In Search Of' with Leonard Nimoy,” Seech said. “I grew up watching all these shows, collecting all these UFO magazines, that's how I got into all this stuff.”

In addition to theories about aliens and cryptids, other people at the paranormal conference showed their work in areas surrounding energy and healing, including through astrology and crystals. Melanie Krneta, who studies homeopathy, showed visitors her mandala stones, meant to create relaxation.

Similar to those presenting research on the supernatural, she said alternative medicine has also drawn a lot of curiosity.

“I think people have lost trust in the medical profession, I think there's a lot of people that have been not healed,” Krneta said.

At the conference, visitors could meet with tarot card readers and psychics to receive readings. Two of the psychics and guest speakers, Jean and Suzanne Vincent, grew up in Butler and were raised in the Catholic church.

The sisters Vincent said their interest started when they were children, when they thought a ghost was haunting their basement. Since then, the sisters have made a career out of investigating paranormal activity, and have even assisted law enforcement.

Despite being self-described experts of paranormal research and metaphysical activity, the Vincent sisters said some things still catch them off-guard.

“Some of the activity you see, it's so unusual,” Suzanne Vincent said. “I have the tools now to understand things. I went through a learning curve, but I'm not gonna stir things around.

“There's some weird stuff out there.”

The universe is filled with countless galaxies, stars and planets. Astronomers may find life one day, but they will need extraordinary proof. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi

The detection of life beyond Earth would be one of the most profound discoveries in the history of science. The Milky Way galaxy alone hosts hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets. Astronomers are using powerful space telescopes to look for molecular indicators of biology in the atmospheres of the most Earth-like of these planets.

But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers—including the paper's authors—aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. A detection of life would be a remarkable development.

The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" in regard to searching for alien life. It conveys the idea that there should be a high bar for evidence to support a remarkable claim.

I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. But to reach this threshold of finding life beyond Earth, a result needs to fit several important criteria.

There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up?

First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide.

On Earth, dimethyl sulfide is associated with biology, in particular bacteria and plankton in the oceans. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life.

Second, the detection needs to be strong. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.

The K2-18b detection has a significance of 3-sigma, which means it has a 0.3% probability of arising by chance.

That sounds low, but most scientists would consider that a weak detection. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range.

The ""gold standard"" for scientific detection is 5-sigma, which means the probability of the finding happening by chance is less than 0.00006%. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013.

Third, a result needs to be repeatable. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated—ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism.

In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars.

Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability.

Lowell was misled by his visual observations, and he was engaging in wishful thinking. No other astronomers could confirm his findings.

In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite.

However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. That extraordinary claim has dissipated.

More recently, astronomers detected low levels of methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily—but not exclusively—by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another.

The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. And in the absence of definitive evidence that this very low level of methane has a biological origin, nobody is claiming definitive evidence of life on Mars.

Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular.

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has been underway for 75 years. No messages have ever been received, but in 1977 a radio telescope in Ohio detected a strong signal that lasted only for a minute.

This signal was so unusual that an astronomer working at the telescope wrote ""Wow!"" on the printout, giving the signal its name. Unfortunately, nothing like it has since been detected from that region of the sky, so the Wow! Signal fails the test of repeatability.

In 2017, a rocky, cigar-shaped object called 'Oumuamua was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. 'Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. However, the object has already left the solar system, so there's no chance for astronomers to observe it again. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet.

While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan.

These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study.

A cautionary tale comes from attempts to show that the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Cosmologists call this event inflation, and it is invoked to explain why the universe is now smooth and flat.

In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. Within a year, however, the team retracted the result because the signal had a mundane explanation: They had confused dust in our galaxy with a signature of inflation.

On the other hand, the discovery of the universe's acceleration shows the success of the scientific method. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Physicists were startled by this result.

Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.

On scales large and small, astronomers try to set a high bar of evidence before claiming a discovery.

A team of astronomers recently made the bold claim that they had found ""the strongest evidence yet"" that life exists anywhere else besides Earth – setting off a media frenzy.

By studying data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers at the University of Cambridge announced April 17 that they had found possible biosignatures hinting at the existence of microbial organisms on a distant exoplanet.

That star-orbiting exoplanet, K2-18b, has long fascinated astronomers who consider it among the best ocean worlds to search for signs of extraterrestrial life.

But one independent researcher is already casting doubt on the recent sensational discovery.

Jake Taylor, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, took another look at the Webb telescope data used in the study and came to a much different conclusion: Taylor found no evidence of the atmospheric clues that were so integral in the Cambridge study's findings.

“I don't personally think that this is a detection of life on K2-18b,” Taylor said in a skeptical video shared on TikTok. “We need way more observations.”

K2-18b, which orbits a red dwarf star more than 120 light-years from Earth, has for years intrigued astronomers who believe it exists in what they refer to as the ""habitable zone"" – where conditions could be right for water to pool on the surface.

Observations have allowed scientists to conclude that the exoplanet, which is 8.6 times bigger than Earth, could be a Hycean world covered by ocean water underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

The latest findings on K2-18b came from a team of researchers led by Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge in England.

The team studied data from Webb's infrared instrument to study the light from K2-18b's parent star as the exoplanet passed in front of it from Earth's vantage. That's what led Madhusudhan and his team to detect hints of sulfur-based gases dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere – both molecules from the same chemical family.

On Earth, the gases are only produced by life, primarily microbial life such as marine algae like phytoplankton, according to the researchers.

But according to Taylor, those molecules can also be produced naturally including, for instance, by comets.

Taylor was also critical in the TikTok video of the researchers' decision to compare the molecules found to nitrogen-rich atmospheres like Earth, as researchers aren't certain how those molecules would behave on a world with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

“The data they use are not appropriate for these type of atmospheres,” Taylor said.

In his own study, published to arXiv, Taylor used a common data model for exoplanet studies and found no conclusive traces of either sulfur-based gases.

""I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features,"" Taylor wrote in the study.

Taylor and Madhusudhan, however, may agree on one point: Additional analysis is needed of K2-18b to determine if anything does indeed live on the planet.

Madhusudhan readily acknowledged that his team's observations could have occurred by chance or could be the result of previously unknown chemical processes at work on K2-18b.

“It's important that we're deeply skeptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,” Madhusudhan said in a statement announcing his own findings. “That's how science has to work.”

Independent scientists are sure to analyze the data soon to see if they come to the same conclusion.

Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Peter Dutton? Charisma has been linked to electoral victory (just ask Bob Hawke), but defining it can be difficult

For all the gen Z slang that has been thrown around by politicians in recent months, one term has been largely absent from the election campaign: “rizz”. Oxford University Press's 2023 word of the year is defined as “style, charm or attractiveness”; in gen Z parlance it refers specifically to romantic appeal.

On the campaign trail, neither major party leader, thankfully, has deployed the term to cringeworthy effect. But a trait to which rizz is inextricably linked – charisma – has historically been linked to electoral victory.

As a quality, charisma can be difficult to pin down: you know it when you see it, but articulating why someone possesses it is a more difficult endeavour. Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, had it in spades. As does – depending on who you ask – Barack Obama, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.

The German sociologist Max Weber is credited for the term charisma in its modern usage, which he defined as an individual “treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary.”

In the past, Weber's definition has been taken to mean that leaders intrinsically possess a preternatural je ne sais quoi – an interpretation that Alex Haslam, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland, takes issue with. “Actually what he says is: it's about being regarded as having those things,” Haslam says.

Charisma, Haslam argues, is in the eye of the beholder, rather than an innate trait. “Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Is Peter Dutton charismatic? It depends on who you ask. We treat charisma as if it's a property or a thing that they possess, but it's clearly based on our relationship with them,” he says.

“We perceive people as charismatic to the extent that they represent us, we see them as one of us, we see ourselves in them.”

Michael Platow, a professor of psychology at the Australian National University, agrees. “It's not something that you are born with,” he says. “The idea that there's something about you that was always predestined to get other people to engage with you and follow you is just wrong,” Platow says, referring to the “great man” theory that was popularised by historians in the 19th century, which assumed that leaders innately possessed traits that set them apart from the masses.

In Haslam and Platow's book, The New Psychology of Leadership, co-authored with Prof Stephen Reicher, they characterise charismatic leaders as those who are most successful in creating a sense of shared social identity – a sense of “us-ness”. Leaders must articulate not only their policies to voters, Platow says, but also “a vision of us collectively. Politicians try to place themselves at the centre of that ‘us'.”

Platow cites Trump as an example of charisma being conferred by followers rather than an inherent quality of a leader. “There are a lot of people who think he's their saviour, and … there are millions who don't,” he says. “He's trying to define what America is in particular terms … and he is succeeding in many ways in doing that for a subset of the population.”

One way researchers measure charisma is simply to ask people what they think of someone. “It's subjective,” Platow concedes. “But in the end, voting is subjective.”

Ample evidence supports the idea that charisma is not a fixed, innate trait. Studies show that success contributes to perceptions of charisma. Research has found that for a given description, a business executive is perceived as more charismatic if people are told the performance of their company improved. “If Anthony Albanese were to win this election, then his supporters would perceive him to be much more charismatic,” Haslam says.

A linked phenomenon in politics is the incumbency effect: “If the economy is doing well or if other macroeconomic factors are good, then people like who is currently in office, because they basically attribute the success to that person,” says Lisa Lu, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, whose dissertation focuses on leadership and charisma.

Success is only one ingredient in the secret sauce, however. One analysis of five Australian prime ministers from Gough Whitlam to John Howard, based on monthly public opinion polling, found that “Bob Hawke was the only one of the five to exhibit significant charisma; his approval rating was over 10 percentage points higher during his period of office than would otherwise have been expected by his economic or political performance.” Keating, it found, “was the least charismatic, by about the same margin”.

Central to Hawke's public image was that of a quintessentially Australian beer-skolling, sports-loving larrikin. Charismatic leadership has been characterised by some researchers as being grounded in values, “beliefs and symbolism”, as well as emotive and expressive communication. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2020 survey of political scientists and historians ranked Hawke first among Australian prime ministers for “communication effectiveness”, as well as his “relationship with the electorate”. His overall performance as prime minister rated second overall after John Curtin.

“As we move into the election, watch how each candidate defines ‘us', how they position themselves as being the ‘prototypical' Australian,” Platow says. “It's not just kissing babies, it's working at Bunnings selling sausages … it's having a beer at the pub.”

Perceptions of charisma are also bound up in factors an individual cannot change. How tall one is, for example: height is associated with greater charisma in male leaders, and US presidents have been much taller than the average American man. Some studies have found that followers attribute greater charisma to women than men, but Assoc Prof Jessica Flanigan has pointed out that these tracked perceived emotional intelligence rather than overall likability.

The historical dearth of female heads of state is “a product of the fact that we live in a sexist world”, Haslam believes. “When I was growing up, you were presented with almost no plausible female candidates that we were encouraged to perceive as charismatic … I think that's different now.”

Given charisma isn't innate, what should a leader desperate to increase their appeal do? One sure-fire but drastic way is to die. Research co-authored by Haslam studied 48 heads of state who died in office between 2000 and 2013. The study found that the leaders were twice as likely to be described as charismatic in death.

Haslam attributes the effect to a posthumous focus on the leader's social contributions over personal shortcomings. “You can think of all the things they did for us,” he says. “In a way, you get this very pure, undistilled image of them as a group member.”

In life, charisma can be taught, other research suggests. Associate Prof Philippe Jacquart of EM Lyon Business School and Prof John Antonakis of the University of Lausanne have identified nine rhetorical and three non-verbal strategies commonly used by leaders considered charismatic.

Looking at nomination speeches of US Democratic and Republican presidential candidates between 1916 and 2008, they measured use of the verbal strategies – including metaphors, stories and anecdotes, demonstrating moral conviction and sharing sentiments of the collective – as a marker of charisma. The more charismatic candidate, as defined by their model, won 23 out of 24 US presidential elections they studied.

Even a cursory survey of history's autocrats – Hitler and Mussolini among them – and cult leaders like Jim Jones reveals the dark side of charisma. “It's pretty obvious that in toxic groups, where they have those kinds of leaders, that's going to be a problem,” Haslam says.

As Lu says, charisma is “a tool that can be used for good or for bad … even if you can develop it in people, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody should.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

Four Supernatural stars reunited over the weekend in a very fitting location, five years after the show ended. For fifteen seasons, Supernatural covered the fantastical adventures of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) as they stepped into the family business of monster hunting. The series developed a passionate and dedicated fanbase over the course of its run, and even now, it remains one of the most popular shows online. Recently, Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins, who played the angel Castiel, were scheduled to appear at The Road So Far... the Road Ahead convention in Minneapolis from April 25 to 27.

Now, in an Instagram post shared by Collins, the three Supernatural stars were joined by another surprise guest in Dean's trademark black 1967 Chevrolet Impala, nicknamed Baby. Ruthie Connell, who played Rowena on the show, can be seen sitting in the backseat with Collins. As teased in the caption, their ""innocent"" reunion took a turn in the third photo. Check out the post below:

This year's convention featured several members of the Supernatural cast beyond the four shown above, including Mark Sheppard (Crowley), Jim Beaver (Bobby Singer), and Alexander Calvert (Jack). Conventions have become a popular place for actors to interact with both their fans and their former co-stars, and in the case of Supernatural, they have helped to keep passion for the series alive even well after the show's completion. It is clear that this is a show that will live on for a very long time.

Even though Supernatural ended in 2020, the series still occupies a place in the cast's and fans' hearts. Recently, it has been confirmed that Padalecki, Ackles, and Collins will all appear in The Boys season 5, though it isn't yet clear what roles they will all play beyond Ackles, who already has the part of Soldier Boy. Their desire to keep working with each other shows how much they enjoyed their time on Supernatural. While there's been no official announcement about a reboot, creator Eric Kripke and the series' leads have all expressed interest in revisiting the Winchesters' world.

 It evokes a lot of feelings seeing Sam and Dean sitting in the Impala again with Castiel in the backseat. Even though the four stars are not posing for the show specifically, they are perfectly in character. The ""Baby"" reunion is very Supernatural-flavored; given Castiel's record of being tempted by demons, women, and such, it's not shocking that he would develop a particular interest in Rowena, who is in charge of Hell by the time of Supernatural's ending. 

Ackles and Padalecki also reacted to the development similarly to how their characters would've reacted on the show. Overall, it seems that the core cast had a lot of fun during the convention weekend, and honestly, there haven't been enough Supernatural reunions since the show ended. Hopefully, The Boys will provide many more.

At 11, with zero experience and nothing to lose, Bella Ramsey stormed onto Game of Thrones and stole every scene they were in. As Lyanna Mormont, they left us all asking: Who is this kid? A decade later, they're not a kid anymore—they're leading HBO's latest juggernaut, The Last of Us, as Ellie, a sharp-tongued survivor with the fate of humanity on her shoulders. Kit Harington knows Ramsey's power firsthand, but when he called up his former Thrones costar, work was just the beginning of their conversation.

THURSDAY 6 PM FEB. 27, 2025 LONDON

KIT HARINGTON: Hey!

BELLA RAMSEY: Hello!

HARINGTON: How are you?

RAMSEY: Good. I haven't seen you in a long time.

HARINGTON: I was trying to figure out when I last saw you.

RAMSEY: I was 14 when we did the last season of Game of Thrones and now I'm 21, so a long time.

HARINGTON: Did I not see you in between? I feel like I have.

RAMSEY: I think you saw me when you were in a taxi. I remember walking down the street and you leaning your head out and yelling, “Bella!” It was terrifying, and then I saw that it was you and it was very sweet.

HARINGTON: Blimey. How have you been? 

RAMSEY: Busy. All grown up now.

T-shirts The Arc. Pants Maxime Studio.

HARINGTON: Are you still based in London?

RAMSEY: Yeah, I just moved here in October. Before, I was still up in Leicestershire with my parents, so it's pretty new. You're not in London? 

HARINGTON: Sometimes, but I'm sort of in the countryside. I've done the opposite thing. Me and Rose [Leslie, Harington's wife] have moved out. We're now little country mice. It's very domestic. 

RAMSEY: Where are you right now? 

HARINGTON: I'm in Paris at the moment. I'm doing a film out here.

RAMSEY: Ooh.

HARINGTON: It's been quite delightful. I never really got Paris until this trip, and now I'm slightly obsessed with it.

RAMSEY: I feel like I haven't got Paris yet either. I've only been there for interviews, magazine things. Normally I'm ready to leave after I've done those things.

HARINGTON: That was my experience of this city. I'm whisked here to do something, I saw the inside of a hotel room, it was all a blur, and then I left. This time, I came a few days early and Rose came out and joined me and we just did all the tourist things and it's great.

RAMSEY: Nice.

HARINGTON: Yeah, really nice. Anyway, I'm meant to be interviewing you. I'm so nervous about this. I've written a list of questions. 

RAMSEY: I did one of these for a friend a few months ago and it was really scary.

HARINGTON: Don't expect the most insightful, hard-hitting questions from me. It's pretty basic. I guess I wanted to reminisce about how we met and what that was like for you. And I'm sorry if you've been asked this a million times.

RAMSEY: I actually haven't. People don't really ask me about Game of Thrones anymore.

HARINGTON: Good. What do you remember of that time?

RAMSEY: I would've been 11 when we first met. It was my first job ever, so I had no reference point for what it would be like. I weirdly wasn't nervous at all, because I never knew that I wanted to be an actor, so I didn't have a bunch of expectations. I was coming into it very much blind.

HARINGTON: I remember meeting you—it was the first thing you did where we had to come and address you, asking for soldiers.

T-shirt Rose Murdoch. Shorts Margaret Howell.

RAMSEY: Oh yeah, I remember that.

HARINGTON: I'm going to blow a bit of smoke here, so I'm sorry, but there was a real feeling of you being a different entity of child actor. We were like, “Oh, they're good.”

RAMSEY: Aw, that's sweet.

HARINGTON: You brought a confidence and clarity that was quite unusual for a young actor. It didn't feel like working with a child. It felt like working with a very experienced actor.

RAMSEY: I remember not feeling like a child, but now I see 11-year-olds and realize how tiny they are, so it's weird to me that I was that size and that young, because I didn't feel that tiny. I don't know whether you remember this, but I remember it quite vividly and have some remorse for it now, but during that scene I was mouthing your lines to you.

HARINGTON: Yes!

RAMSEY: Now I'm like, “Oh my gosh, how awful.” But at the time it came from a very innocent place of being like, “Kit's struggling with his line and I know it, so let me just mouth it to him.”

HARINGTON: I do remember you helping me out and it being quite humiliating. [Laughs] But yeah, thanks for that. I've probably chosen to forget it.

RAMSEY: You're welcome. No, I think I need to forget it, because that's so annoying. Like, how annoying is that?

HARINGTON: It wasn't at all. If anything I was like, “Oh god, I've got to up my game. I came here not really being comfortable enough with my lines, in the arrogance of however old I was, thinking I'm just opposite some child. And then that child actor is wiping me off the screen.” Not that it's a competition, but you're like, “Oh, I've got a bit too comfortable in my Jon Snow-ness.”

RAMSEY: You had six seasons of it by then, so fair enough.

HARINGTON: Yeah, it was a long slog. How's The Last of Us circus been? I don't mean the actual filming of it, I mean all the stuff around it, which I kind of know of.

RAMSEY: That's a good question. I knew that I was going to be introduced to the circus around big TV shows and films with The Last of Us. I never really had that experience before. I always managed to be in stuff not quite enough to have to do all the press. But now, I feel like it came at a time at which I was prepared to deal with it. I mean, I sort of dread it all, but this time around I feel like I really know what it is and care about it a lot less than I did the first season.

HARINGTON: Right.

RAMSEY: It's always felt quite trivial, and I've never really enjoyed it, but I can just accept I'm going to go and do it, it'll be what it will be, and then it will be done. I was so terrified of signing on to The Last of Us and the idea of reaching a level of fame that doesn't go away, not being able to backtrack from that. But I realize now that actually, you reach this level of fame that stays for a few months while the show's coming out, and then it does sort of die off. If you don't do anything to maintain that level of fame, the world moves on, which I'm so grateful for.

HARINGTON: Yeah, I remember that with my time on Game of Thrones. While the show was on, it was quite intense. I was like you, I think. My soul didn't respond well to it in a strange way, and I had different coping mechanisms which weren't good or healthy. 

RAMSEY: Yeah.

HARINGTON: But you're right. You kind of go, “Oh if, there wasn't another season it will just drift away.”

RAMSEY: Yeah, exactly. It's quite nice. 

HARINGTON: So is this the first time you've lived alone?

Shirt, Tank Top, and Jeans Celine by Hedi Slimane.

RAMSEY: I lived alone during season two in Vancouver, but this is my first time living alone where I'm not away somewhere for work.

HARINGTON: It's a big thing.

RAMSEY: Yeah, I like it. I did live with a few housemates before, and I much prefer living alone. It can be lonely, but now I've found friends in London close by, which is helpful. A lot of my friends are older than me and already have their lives and their friends that they've had since they were young, so I'm kind of on the outskirts of their life and their friend groups. It's nice to have people around who are a similar age to me. Less lonely, for sure. 

HARINGTON: I had this close group of friends when I was doing Game of Thrones who kept my head on the straight and narrow a bit, just by the virtue of them taking the piss out of me all the time.

RAMSEY: That's good.

HARINGTON: Are you doing anything outside of The Last of Us? Are you trying to choose roles in a career sense or are you reading things and going on gut instinct?

RAMSEY: I go off my gut instinct for sure. What seem to be the things that I'm responding to are low-budget independent films, I think because of the contrast to The Last of Us. I'm about to do a film, Sunny Dancer, up in Scotland, and the idea of going and doing that for six weeks as the show is coming out is a relief. It's just such an escape. And then outside of that, I'm writing.

HARINGTON: What are you writing?

RAMSEY: Scripts. I've written a feature which is sort of ready to be properly made now. It's in a really good place, I think.

HARINGTON: Any parts for a bearded 38-year-old man? 

RAMSEY: Actually maybe. I need a dad.

T-shirt The Arc. Shirt Margaret Howell. Jeans Gucci. Hat Bella's Own.

HARINGTON: Oh, I'm in that category now. 

RAMSEY: [Laughs]. Although you're not quite old enough. Could you be a dad to a 14-year-old? 

HARINGTON: Scarily, I actually could. Send it to me, will you?

RAMSEY: I'll keep you in mind.

HARINGTON: That's great you're writing. I think that's awesome.

RAMSEY: Have you ever done any of that? 

HARINGTON: Do you know what? I've just written and directed a short film.

RAMSEY: That's cool.

HARINGTON: I'm a restless person and sometimes wonder why I've chosen to be an actor, where we sit around for so long. But as a director, you're constantly answering questions, running around, doing things. 

RAMSEY: It's nice to do something that's self-motivated. It's way harder than just being a cog in a machine.

HARINGTON: Right. I've run out of my questions, but they gave me some. Do you want to hear some of their questions?

RAMSEY: Absolutely. Pick a good one.

HARINGTON: You played a lot of characters who are wise beyond their years. Why do you think that is, and do you ever long to play someone who's a little more lost?

RAMSEY: Very good question. Interestingly, in playing all these people who are wise beyond their years, most of the time there's an element of them being very lost inside, but I don't really long to play someone who's entirely lost. I long to play someone who's a Hannibal Lecter type.

HARINGTON: Like proper psychotic.

RAMSEY: Yeah. I think I'm really craving some psychosis in a character.

HARINGTON: I guess maybe what that is—I have that—but it's essentially because you've been playing heroes.

Jacket and T-shirt Miu Miu.

RAMSEY: Ah.

HARINGTON: You're on a continual sort of hero's journey at the moment, with most of the parts you've played, and then maybe there's that inkling, like, “I want to play the messed-up person.”

RAMSEY: That's actually a really good point. I hadn't made that connection. Something that I meant to talk to you about was that I remember you not having social media, and admired that so much and thought you were the coolest person to ever walk the earth. I was like, “I don't want to get social media, because Kit doesn't have it.” And then I did end up having to get it because there were people making fake accounts pretending to be me when I was 12, and posting inappropriate stuff. But now, I've just deactivated my Instagram and my Twitter. I've reached a point where I don't actually need this anymore. People know that a fake account pretending to be me isn't me.

HARINGTON: When did you deactivate it? 

RAMSEY: A few weeks ago, and it wasn't even this big dramatic thing. Nothing really happened. I just got so sick of it, and it was detrimental more than helpful. I feel wonderful. 

HARINGTON: I'm proud of you. I have WhatsApp to text friends and that's it, really. I think you put the nail on the head about it being more detrimental than it is helpful. I've always felt that it would be very damaging to me. I have a personality type in which it would be addictive. It's the wisest thing I've ever done and I've done some really fucking stupid things in my life. 

RAMSEY: Well, it was inspiring to me. 

HARINGTON: I'm glad. Let's spread the word. 

RAMSEY: I think so.

HARINGTON: It's that double-think thing. It says this will help you communicate with more people more often, and I don't think it does. I think it opens you to a load of weirdos and randomness, but it doesn't actually help you communicate. We weren't built to communicate with more than a hundred people.

RAMSEY: Exactly. Any communication is transactional. It's a like, or a comment, or a reaction to a story. I was also very addicted to it. I would actually lose sleep. I categorically couldn't have TikTok on my phone because there was one night that I was literally on it until the sun rose. My personality type is too susceptible to the frickin' dopamine hits that it gives you. It was really bad.

HARINGTON: Dopamine is something that you run out of; it's a drug that leaves your system. I think the quickest way of losing your ability to produce it naturally is to have something like social media. Well done. I'm glad to think I played a small part in that choice.

RAMSEY: You absolutely did.

HARINGTON: Good, good, good. Well it's been awesome chatting with you.

RAMSEY: Yeah, you too.

HARINGTON: Let's not let it go six years again. I'd love to see you sometime.

RAMSEY: That would be good.

HARINGTON: I'll give you my number. In fact, I'll put it in the chat now so you've got it.

RAMSEY: Perfect.

In Richard Seymour's Disaster Nationalism, he attempts to diagnose the apocalyptic nature of conservatism around the world. 

A woman wearing a sweatshirt for the QAnon conspiracy theory gestures during a pro-Trump rally on October 11, 2020, in Ronkonkoma, New York.   

I've never known quite what to do when a conspiracy theory is shared with me. Having grown up in a conservative-talk-radio family, I confess that a mild paranoia about the liberal world is a given for me. The ravings included things like the death of Vince Foster, Barack Obama's birth certificate, and FEMA's malevolent incompetence. My uncles would forward me chain e-mails about hoarding gold, Agenda 21, and the “Great Replacement.” Hillary Clinton's Benghazi debacle was a persistent obsession. That's over three decades' worth of theories, a steady drip of feverish claims spanning the years from Bill Clinton to Joe Biden, that found their way to my e-mail inbox or into casual conversations. The latest, kindly shared by one of my parents in the weeks before the 2024 election, was particularly florid: Chinese soldiers, I learned, had been funneling fentanyl over the Mexican border during the Biden years.

This capacity for delusion, once relegated to the fringes, has come to define the cultural environment of the right. During the Trump era, such fantasies went mainstream. You can probably recite them from memory: There was the “rigged” election of January 6, 2020, as a false-flag event, the specter of antifa in all corners of American life, and the Covid-19 “Plandemic.” We might be inclined to ignore, or endlessly debunk, these outlandish tales. They are silly, specious beliefs, after all, worthy of our scorn and maybe even our pity.

It's time, I think, to reevaluate this reaction. In my own life, looking back at the conversations with my family's lunatic fringe, it's clear that I've never been able to identify where this collective psychosis emerged from. A logic that our liberal shibboleths are unable to comprehend is in the air. What if the right's fantasies of violent overthrow and death weren't the byproducts of social media poisoning, susceptibility to misinformation, or delusions born of boredom and complacency, but manifestations of something deeper, darker, and altogether more cogent?

This is the question that Richard Seymour attempts to answer in his new book, Disaster Nationalism. The phenomenon we've been witnessing this past decade as the far right surges globally, Seymour believes, reflects a broad psychological transformation in the conservative psyche. Run-of-the-mill nationalist politics, if there can be such a thing, is now an ever stranger beast—the reactionary patriotism we're so familiar with is now infected with an apocalyptic mindset. If nationalism tends to focus strictly on things like immigration and demographics in its effort to build a pure ethno-state, disaster nationalism can be said to make use of every paranoia in the book—natural disasters, climate change, class anxieties, sexual and racial panics—to achieve the same end. “It links an already pervasive anxiety to a series of phobic objects (Muslims, Communists, Globalists, Jews, and so on),” Seymour writes. For groups experiencing social decline (not to be confused with the working poor), disaster nationalism can be thought of as an easy-to-use framework—an ideological hunting scope might be more accurate—to process the chaos of the world. “For those confronting the demons in their heads,” Seymour continues, “it names a worldly demon which can be assaulted.”

This is essentially the phenomenon we tend to file under terms like “populism,” “grievance politics,” and “racial resentment.” But these low-definition renderings haven't helped us better understand an emerging political attitude that shows no signs of fizzling out: This year, from Canada to France to Germany, so-called right populists are poised to take the reins of power, on the backs of supporters who see, like those in this country, a need for closed borders and crueler immigration policies.

Seymour wants us to understand that something more insidious and terrifying is at play—a “far greater cataclysm” is in the offing. What we're witnessing is a toxic system of belief, capable of overriding material self-interest and logic because the main offering is revenge. But Seymour is not talking about the shallow emotional fix of winning elections or “sticking it to the libs.” It's not so much a hatred for any one group, he suggests, but a “hatred of civilization” itself and the shallow rewards it promised: pluralism, self-determination, enfranchisement.

It's important to realize that material interests can easily be tossed aside when people are certain that the only choice left to them is to burn everything down and start over. Seymour likens disaster nationalism, in this sense, to a kind of deranged self-help program, offering its practitioners a chance to get in on the action. “It offers the balm of vengeance,” he writes, “the promise of national self-love and the cure of restoring society to a more pristine, harmoniously hierarchical state through condign violence.” What emerges from the rantings and ravings of the fringe is not merely inchoate babble, then, but the performance of a deep-seated desire.

Like Seymour's previous book, The Twittering Machine, in which he psychoanalyzed our compulsive relationship to social media, Disaster Nationalism is an attempt to diagnose the far right's emotional pathology. To do so, he draws heavily on Freud's concept of Traumarbeit (or “dreamwork”), which famously proposed that dreams are manifestations of subconscious human desire. Seymour expands Freud's concept to the entire tangled mesh of conspiracy theories, techno-paranoias, and apocalyptic fictions that make up the right's fantasy realm. This “political dreamwork,” as Seymour calls it, is both a staging ground and exercise and a dangerous structure of coping, capable of organizing “economic, emotional and erotic miseries into a building tidal wave of vengeful violence.”

But why the dreams of death and destruction? And why does discontent so often lead to violent solutions? “Belief,” Seymour suggests, “is never innocent.” Something inside of a conspiracist wants the border to be overrun by Chinese invaders, desires “white extinction,” and craves totalitarian scenarios. “That something,” he writes, is the “existential void” opened up by any of the real disasters roiling us: the collapse of the neoliberal order, climate change, and widespread social depression.

If the idea of filling an existential void with this kind of garbage sounds a bit like soothing a stomach ache with fast food, that's kind of the point. Disaster nationalism offers an emotional sugar high masquerading as a political program. It's a brutally efficient tool to exploit and manipulate the most powerful of human passions: resentment. This “addictive emotional swamp,” as Seymour describes it, is being effectively weaponized by nationalist demagogues to unleash a “politically enabled passion for persecution.”

Though Seymour's relentless psychologizing can come off at times like the overheated musings of a Marxist academic, the insight at the center of Disaster Nationalism is a powerful political reading. All the paranoid murmurings of the right—the inarticulate apocalyptic visions, the culture-war cruelty, the racist tropes, the low-simmering rage, and the harebrained conspiracist conjectures pushed out over the Internet—amount to a towering structure of feeling, an emotional clearinghouse for pleasure, excitement, participation, and violent satisfaction that has no comparison on the left. To stop the far-right surge and protect liberalism itself, it is this asymmetry that must be urgently addressed.

The potency of this argument is diluted at points in Disaster Nationalism, however, mainly because Seymour tries to plug his theory into as many contemporary crises as he can fit on the page: lone-wolf terrorism, incel culture, militia movements, QAnon. Disaster nationalism is so ubiquitous and so amorphous in this telling that Seymour often has to spell out what it is not. For starters, it is not fascism. (This is “not yet fascism,” Seymour clarifies.) Nor is it a well-organized tactical force on the ground (even though the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and various death squads around the world embrace its principles, and the Proud Boys appear to be back in action). It's a political system that isn't preoccupied with colonialist expansion (though Israel is one massive exception, Seymour grants). Its “strongman” leaders are not true despots but instead “far-right celebrities,” he writes. As a political ideology, disaster nationalism isn't concerned with things like class, anti-capitalism, delivering material change, or revolutionary upheaval, even though it is commonly mistaken for being pro-worker. And even though it might appear to present a critique of neoliberal economic policy, at its core it offers nothing more than old-fashioned “muscular capitalism,” unshackled by labor protections or human rights laws, delivered to the approved social groups.

Disaster nationalism is a style of politics, in other words. It's exaggerated, loud, contemptuous, and unambiguous. It's a style that can be easily understood, adapted, and spread across our networked societies. It is cross-pollinated by inputs derived from social and political content. As content, it's spring-loaded for virality and sure to be imitated. Oddly, though, Seymour never describes it as a style, perhaps because his unified theory of today's conspiratorial right would sound a bit like a prior generation's unified theory of the conservative psyche, as delineated in Richard Hofstadter's “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.” Written in 1964 about the dispossessed fringes rallying around then–presidential candidate Barry Goldwater, Hofstadter's essay was the first major psychological profile of the “paranoid spokesman,” consumed by conspiratorial thought and fantasy, and the “apocalyptic terms” that Goldwater's insipid movement favored. Much like Seymour's disaster nationalists, these mid-century paranoids were “always manning the barricades of civilization” in a desire to “fight things out to the finish.”

The similarities in the psychological portraiture some 60 years apart prove that not much has changed in the left-liberal intellectual's grappling with the vengeful right. What do we do with this picture—or with the knowledge that these dispossessed masses can't be talked out of their hardcore positions? (Could we at least hear some tactical strategies? Cutting off their access to the Internet, perhaps?) Seymour doesn't dismiss the people embracing this style of politics, as Hofstadter did when he predicted that his paranoids would forever be a “modest minority” of the public. Rather than delivering character judgments or social criticism, he focuses on the phenomenon itself: the “molecular flow” of society's reactionary energies, as he puts it. It's an approach that leads Seymour to avoid the kind of liberal-minded magical realism that likes to see itself as immune from fascist or conspiratorial desire. If the conditions are right, anyone can end up a paranoiac looking to beat up on an outsider. “We all have our jackboots,” Seymour cautions.

This is a political style that is better understood at a systems scale—as a force set loose by the collapse of neoliberalism. With one ideological era closing and a vacuum of belief opening in its wake (the “crisis of authority,” as Gramsci called it), disaster nationalism might be the political belief system most capable of filling the void, a rare enchantment in a dismal time. It's only somewhat ironic that, for all its brio and bluster about burning down civilization, disaster nationalism is designed to perpetuate and maintain crumbling political systems.

To take one example of this, there is Israel, to which an entire chapter of Disaster Nationalism is devoted. Titled “Genocide,” the chapter features Seymour's effort to speed through a history of the Zionist project, from the European settler movement to the genocidal war machine that Israel is today. Israel's drift to the far right can be explained, he thinks, by its embrace of free-market neoliberal doctrine, which, beginning in the 1970s, effectively yanked off the restraints on Zionism's ethnonationalist urges. Hollowed-out unions, crippled welfare systems, and an ineffectual liberal opposition allowed a far-right ruling coalition to gain control of Israeli society without dissent. Yet, despite (or perhaps because of) this, crises abound there. Israel is among the most unequal societies in the Western world. A sense of hyper-victimization is rampant in the populace. The country's “liberal” democracy is a contradictory sham, no more than a two-tiered apartheid system permitting only second-class citizenship to Arabs. Worst yet, Zionism's promise to deliver an ethnically pure “homeland” to Jews is a delusional lie, in part because Palestinians continue to persist in both their opposition and their sheer existence. As a result, endless war is the only political program on offer. (It's the only thing capable of delivering “moral regeneration,” as Seymour puts it.) For flailing states like Israel, disaster nationalism is a way in which to “metabolise” the dysfunction. This is the dreamwork that keeps afloat the fantasy of ever-growing economies, of safer borders, of purer societies, and of returning to the way that things once supposedly were. What is less clear, after the deaths of over 50,000 Palestinians and the near-total destruction of Gaza, is whether any number can quench these urges once the dreamwork is fully set in motion.

Can the left psychoanalyze its enemies into oblivion? Obviously not—and Seymour concedes as much. As for solutions, his approaches are fuzzy at best. Seymour is skeptical that we should offer the so-called “bread and butter” fixes that the left usually argues for: higher wages, full employment, and expanded social safety nets. What he argues for instead is a vaguer and appropriately more psychological mix of proposals, one being that the left “let go” of the “resignation” that has defined it over these past 30 years. Another loftier suggestion is the formation of “mass ideals,” renewed social energy, and the “eros of collective action,” which looks more concretely like the development of a countercultural movement, forged through egalitarian ideals like unionism, to counteract the “paranoid, anti-social and vengeful passions” of disaster nationalism.

It's clear that the right has mastered the politics of libidinal satisfaction. And it continues to deliver to its followers dopamine-spiking wins, all while wrecking their material conditions. Most seem pleasantly satisfied with the arrangement because, at least on its face, they can join in. Meanwhile, the electoral left seems intent on offering as little satisfaction to people as possible. Faced with a rising tide of resentment—born from the panics of economic stagnation, crippled institutions, and the evaporation of civic life—liberals made a sterile plea in 2024 to defend the abstraction of democracy and maintain the status quo. Nearly 7.1 million Democratic voters opted to sit out the presidential election in response. Now, as President Trump and his pet billionaire, Elon Musk, dismantle the federal government, the leaders of the opposition party are busy insisting to their base that they are powerless to do anything about it. Their mounting losses, they insist, are the result of a “messaging problem.”

To blunt the rise of political styles like disaster nationalism, an entirely new structure of feeling will need to be constructed on the left—one offering the same kind of libidinal satisfaction to its followers in the face of crumbling systems and institutions. This would mean addressing the collapse of the neoliberal order, acknowledging the unfolding polycrisis, and speaking to the mass discontent warping the American spirit. It could mean harnessing things like the societal rage and the strange coalitions shaped in the aftermath of Luigi Mangione's assassination of a health insurance executive. But above all, building this structure of feeling would require the left to reclaim political emotions it has long ceded to the right—such as hate, which the anthropologist and political anarchist David Graeber once argued could be a form of virtue. Hate, when directed at things like injustice or militarism or nationalism, can be a righteous political tool, one capable of powering societal change, crafting broad political coalitions, and neutralizing the mass manipulators of our age. It's the fuel necessary for any political dreamwork. “To absolutely exclude hatred from politics,” Graeber wrote, “is to rip the fiber out, to deny the main motor of social transformation, ultimately, to reduce it to a flat plane of hopeless cynicism.”

For those of us who haven't fallen under the spell of disaster nationalism, this sounds like a pretty accurate description of the political moment. Productive emotion, let alone something like hate, has been notably absent on the left in these first months of Donald Trump's second presidential term. Meanwhile, a soft fascism appears to be sprouting up in the White House—animated by Nazi tributes, open racism, and, as always, the miasma of conspiracist belief. The right is currently the standing winner and direct beneficiary of liberalism's grand crisis in America and beyond. Scorn, empathy, pity—these aren't feelings capable of combating violent fantasies made flesh. Decades of losses have made as much clear: Only an equal and forceful opposite reaction will suffice.

The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.

Trump's catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.

At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.

In just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.

We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.

""Does anyone else think that maybe just maybe all those Drones flying around New Jersey may have had something to do with this big Forest fire going on right now,"" says one April 23, 2025 post on Facebook.

The post -- and other similar messages blaming drones for the historic blazes that ravaged New Jersey in April -- come after reports of unidentified aircraft flying over the northeastern state dominated social media in late 2024 and early 2025, stoking fears among residents.

Some posts have claimed these drones ignited the blazes using directed energy weapons, which harness concentrated electromagnetic energy and are being developed in the United States for drone and missile defense.

The wildfires erupted April 22 in the pine forests of New Jersey and grew to 15,000 acres, devastating one of the largest protected areas on the east coast and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. The state was put under drought alert in March (archived here).

But the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said in an April 24 statement that ""the cause of the fire was determined to be incendiary by an improperly extinguished bonfire,"" alleging that a 19-year-old resident set wooden pallets on fire and then left the area without it being fully extinguished.

Authorities charged the individual with aggravated arson.

New Jersey's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Shawn LaTourette, told AFP in an April 23 email that they ""have not received any credible report of mysterious drone activity and we are not aware of any legitimate evidence that suggests such activity, if it exists, is related to the cause of the Jones Road Wildfire.""

The claims about directed energy weapons ignited the blazes are also baseless -- and echo conspiracy theories previously shared about similar disasters.

In an article on the technology, Iain Boyd, director of the University of Colorado's Center for National Security Initiatives explained that ""the power level needed to ignite vegetation with a high-energy laser from the sky would require a large power source installed on a large aircraft"" (archived here and here).

As of time of publication, 65 percent of the fire had been contained and evacuation orders fully lifted.

Drones are not allowed to fly during fire emergencies. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service has repeatedly reminded its residents to refrain from flying recreational drones in fire zones.

""Please remember, 'No Drones in Fire Zones - If YOU fly, WE can't!'"" the agency said on Facebook April 25 (archived here).

The video shared in some of the posts on social media faulting drones for the fire has been online for months, reverse image searches revealed. The clip dates to at least December 2024, when public hysteria over the drone sightings peaked.

Despite assurances from the Biden administration, narratives about foreign attacks and UFOs gained massive traction in late 2024.

In December, the Department of Defense said an investigation concluded: ""To date, we have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent"" (archived here).

Just after taking office, the Trump administration also responded to the situation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a January 28, 2025 press briefing: ""The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) for research and various other reasons,"" (archived here).

""Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones,"" she said, adding: ""It got worse due to curiosity, this was not the enemy.""

AFP has previously debunked similar claims about wildfires and directed energy weapons.","{'href': 'https://www.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","other"

Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered ""smoking gun"" evidence of a hidden feeding supermassive black hole in a distant spiral galaxy.

Scientists have long believed that monster-sized supermassive black holes lurk at the heart of all large galaxies. That means that the failure to detect such a cosmic titan at the heart of the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, officially known as Messier 83 (M83), has been a frustrating conundrum.

Now, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers may have cracked this puzzle, finding the first evidence of a supermassive black hole at the heart of M83, also known as NGC 5236, a spiral galaxy located around 15 million light-years away.

""The JWST is revolutionizing our understanding of galaxies,"" team member Linda Smith of the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a statement. ""For years, astronomers have searched for a black hole in M83 without success. Now, we finally have a compelling clue that suggests one may be present.""

Related: Did the James Webb telescope really find evidence of alien life? Here's the truth about exoplanet K2-18b.



Supermassive black holes have masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun. Situated at the hearts of distant galaxies, these black holes are pretty conspicuous when they are actively feeding and surrounded by gas and dust that they heat, causing them to glow brightly.

These regions, known as ""active galactic nuclei"" or ""AGNs,"" can often be seen even in galaxies that are otherwise too distant and too faint to be detected.

This has led scientists to speculate that either the supermassive black hole at the heart of M83 is dormant (not actively feeding on matter), or that the AGN it powers is hidden by a thick shroud of dust.

That second explanation is favored by new data from the JWST which takes full advantage of the $10 billion space telescope's unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution.



Clumps of highly ionized gas were the ""smoking gun"" hinting at the presence of an obscured AGN at the heart of M83.

""Our discovery of highly ionized neon emission in the nucleus of M83 was unexpected,"" team leader Svea Hernandez, a European Space Agency (ESA) scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said. ""These signatures require large amounts of energy to be produced, more than what normal stars can generate.

""This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN that has been elusive until now.""

Even the explosive death of massive stars in supernovas couldn't provide enough energy to create the signature spotted by the JWST. That makes an AGN the most likely suspect. But, not the only suspect.

The team behind this discovery now needs to eliminate other possible candidates for the creation of highly ionized neon gas, such as shockwaves travelling through the gases that exists between stars, the ""interstellar medium.""

—Newly 'awakened' black hole is releasing 100 times more energy than scientists have ever seen before

—Black holes can destroy planets — but they can also lead us to thriving alien worlds. Here's how.

Astronomers will now follow up the investigation of M83 with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In the meantime, this research proves how effective the JWST is at discovering hitherto unseen structures in the cosmos.

""This discovery showcases how the JWST is making unexpected breakthroughs,"" Smith concluded, ""Astronomers thought they had ruled out an AGN in M83, but now we have fresh evidence that challenges past assumptions and opens new avenues for exploration.""

The team's research was published April 17 in The Astrophysical Journal.

Our current AI systems may one day evolve into a superintelligent entity, but scientists aren't yet certain what this might look like and what the implications are.

Rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting people to question what the fundamental limits of the technology are. Increasingly, a topic once consigned to science fiction — the notion of a superintelligent AI — is now being considered seriously by scientists and experts alike.

The idea that machines might one day match or even surpass human intelligence has a long history. But the pace of progress in AI over recent decades has given renewed urgency to the topic, particularly since the release of powerful large language models (LLMs) by companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, among others.

Experts have wildly differing views on how feasible this idea of ""artificial super intelligence"" (ASI) is and when it might appear, but some suggest that such hyper-capable machines are just around the corner. What's certain is that if, and when, ASI does emerge, it will have enormous implications for humanity's future.

""I believe we would enter a new era of automated scientific discoveries, vastly accelerated economic growth, longevity, and novel entertainment experiences,"" Tim Rocktäschel, professor of AI at University College London and a principal scientist at Google DeepMind told Live Science, providing a personal opinion rather than Google DeepMind's official position. However, he also cautioned: ""As with any significant technology in history, there is potential risk.""

Traditionally, AI research has focused on replicating specific capabilities that intelligent beings exhibit. These include things like the ability to visually analyze a scene, parse language or navigate an environment. In some of these narrow domains AI has already achieved superhuman performance, Rocktäschel said, most notably in games like go and chess.

The stretch goal for the field, however, has always been to replicate the more general form of intelligence seen in animals and humans that combines many such capabilities. This concept has gone by several names over the years, including “strong AI” or “universal AI”, but today it is most commonly called artificial general intelligence (AGI).

""For a long time, AGI has been a far away north star for AI research,"" Rocktäschel said. ""However, with the advent of foundation models [another term for LLMs] we now have AI that can pass a broad range of university entrance exams and participate in international math and coding competitions.""

This is leading people to take the possibility of AGI more seriously, said Rocktäschel. And crucially, once we create AI that matches humans on a wide range of tasks, it may not be long before it achieves superhuman capabilities across the board. That's the idea, anyway. ""Once AI reaches human-level capabilities, we will be able to use it to improve itself in a self-referential way,"" Rocktäschel said. ""I personally believe that if we can reach AGI, we will reach ASI shortly, maybe a few years after that.""



Once that milestone has been reached, we could see what British mathematician Irving John Good dubbed an ""intelligence explosion"" in 1965. He argued that once machines become smart enough to improve themselves, they would rapidly achieve levels of intelligence far beyond any human. He described the first ultra-intelligent machine as ""the last invention that man need ever make.""

Renowned futurist Ray Kurzweil has argued this would lead to a ""technological singularity"" that would suddenly and irreversibly transform human civilization. The term draws parallels with the singularity at the heart of a black hole, where our understanding of physics breaks down. In the same way, the advent of ASI would lead to rapid and unpredictable technological growth that would be beyond our comprehension.

Exactly when such a transition might happen is debatable. In 2005, Kurzweil predicted AGI would appear by 2029, with the singularity following in 2045, a prediction he's stuck to ever since. Other AI experts offer wildly varying predictions — from within this decade to never. But a recent survey of 2,778 AI researchers found that, on aggregate, they believe there is a 50% chance ASI could appear by 2047. A broader analysis concurred that most scientists agree AGI might arrive by 2040.

The implications of a technology like ASI would be enormous, prompting scientists and philosophers to dedicate considerable time to mapping out the promise and potential pitfalls for humanity.

On the positive side, a machine with almost unlimited capacity for intelligence could solve some of the world's most pressing challenges, said Daniel Hulme, CEO of the AI companies Satalia and Conscium. In particular, super intelligent machines could ""remove the friction from the creation and dissemination of food, education, healthcare, energy, transport, so much that we can bring the cost of those goods down to zero,"" he told Live Science.

The hope is that this would free people from having to work to survive and could instead spend time doing things they're passionate about, Hulme explained. But unless systems are put in place to support those whose jobs are made redundant by AI, the outcome could be bleaker. ""If that happens very quickly, our economies might not be able to rebalance, and it could lead to social unrest,” he said.

This also assumes we could control and direct an entity much more intelligent than us — something many experts have suggested is unlikely. ""I don't really subscribe to this idea that it will be watching over us and caring for us and making sure that we're happy,"" said Hulme. ""I just can't imagine it would care.""

The possibility of a superintelligence we have no control over has prompted fears that AI could present an existential risk to our species. This has become a popular trope in science fiction, with movies like ""Terminator"" or ""The Matrix"" portraying malevolent machines hell-bent on humanity's destruction.

But philosopher Nick Bostrom highlighted that an ASI wouldn't even have to be actively hostile to humans for various doomsday scenarios to play out. In a 2012 paper, he suggested that the intelligence of an entity is independent of its goals, so an ASI could have motivations that are completely alien to us and not aligned with human well-being.



Bostrom fleshed out this idea with a thought experiment in which a super-capable AI is set the seemingly innocuous task of producing as many paper-clips as possible. If unaligned with human values, it may decide to eliminate all humans to prevent them from switching it off, or so it can turn all the atoms in their bodies into more paperclips.

Rocktäschel is more optimistic. ""We build current AI systems to be helpful, but also harmless and honest assistants by design,"" he said. ""They are tuned to follow human instructions, and are trained on feedback to provide helpful, harmless, and honest answers.""

While Rocktäschel admitted these safeguards can be circumvented, he's confident we will develop better approaches in the future. He also thinks that it will be possible to use AI to oversee other AI, even if they are stronger.

Hulme said most current approaches to ""model alignment"" — efforts to ensure that AI is aligned with human values and desires — are too crude. Typically, they either provide rules for how the model should behave or train it on examples of human behavior. But he thinks these guardrails, which are bolted on at the end of the training process, could be easily bypassed by ASI.

Instead, Hulme thinks we must build AI with a ""moral instinct."" His company Conscium is attempting to do that by evolving AI in virtual environments that have been engineered to reward behaviors like cooperation and altruism. Currently, they are working with very simple, ""insect-level"" AI, but if the approach can be scaled up, it could make alignment more robust. ""Embedding morals in the instinct of an AI puts us in a much safer position than just having these sort of Whack-a-Mole guard rails,"" said Hulme.

Not everyone is convinced we need to start worrying quite yet, though. One common criticism of the concept of ASI, said Rocktäschel, is that we have no examples of humans who are highly capable across a wide range of tasks, so it may not be possible to achieve this in a single model either. Another objection is that the sheer computational resources required to achieve ASI may be prohibitive.

—AI can now replicate itself — a milestone that has experts terrified

More practically, how we measure progress in AI may be misleading us about how close we are to superintelligence, said Alexander Ilic, head of the ETH AI Center at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Most of the impressive results in AI in recent years have come from testing systems on several highly contrived tests of individual skills such as coding, reasoning or language comprehension, which the systems are explicitly trained to pass, said Ilic.

He compares this to cramming for exams at school. ""You loaded up your brain to do it, then you wrote the test, and then you forgot all about it,"" he said. ""You were smarter by attending the class, but the actual test itself is not a good proxy of the actual knowledge.""

AI that is capable of passing many of these tests at superhuman levels may only be a few years away, said Ilic. But he believes today's dominant approach will not lead to models that can carry out useful tasks in the physical world or collaborate effectively with humans, which will be crucial for them to have a broad impact in the real world.

Companies are expected to raise prices in response to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.

While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day."" On April 2, he announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from most countries, except Canada and Mexico. China faces even higher rates of up to 245% on some goods, the White House said on April 16. Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US.

""April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,"" Trump said during his remarks.

Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce.

""The tariffs are larger than forecasters expected, certainly larger than we expected in our upside case,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. ""Our role is to make sure this will be a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process.""

Powell said the Federal Reserve is monitoring how much prices rise, which is still unclear.

Beginning at the end of 2024, some companies warned that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. While it's still possible they could absorb some of the costs of the tariffs, here are the companies that have warned of price increases.

The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: ""Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up.""

""To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025,"" Shein's statement said.

Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping.

In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole.

Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs.

Ford, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates ""the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production."" Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now.

On April 14, Trump told reporters that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the US.

Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.

Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico.

It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains ""volatile"" and changes hourly.

According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports.

The company said it would provide more details on its pricing changes in response to the tariffs by mid-April.

Kjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive officer, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices.

""Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex,"" Barry said. ""We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.""

Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce.

""Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,"" Cornell said.

Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: ""Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months.""

Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating ""a variety of different scenarios"" to plan for new tariffs under Trump.

""And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market,"" Allan said, adding that ""there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price.""

Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on November 19 that the company will likely raise prices if Trump's tariff proposals are implemented.

""We never want to raise prices,"" he said. ""Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.""

The company's CEO, Doug McMillan, said during a February earnings call that ""tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that.""

Tim Boyle, the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, told analysts on an October earnings call that the company was ""very concerned about the imposition of tariffs. "" He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, ""trade wars are not good and not easy to win.""

Boyle also told The Washington Post in October that the company was ""set to raise prices.""

""It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans,"" he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that ""we need some surety about what is going to happen"" before making price changes.

Philip Daniele, the CEO of the auto-parts company AutoZone, told analysts on a September earnings call that tariff policies had ""ebbed and flowed over the years,"" and if Trump implemented more tariffs, ""we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer.""

""We generally raise prices ahead of that,"" Daniele said, adding that prices would gradually settle over time. ""So, that's historically what we've done,"" he said.

Trump's 25% tariff on car imports is expected to increase manufacturing costs by anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.

P&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products.

CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC price hikes are ""likely.""

""We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L,"" P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters.

The company is evaluating ""exactly what is the right plan by brand, by market, what combination of pricing, over what period of time,"" Schulten added.

Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2.

The change was made ""based on the preliminary information currently available regarding the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA,"" the company said.

Eric du Halgouët, executive vice president of finance at the company, told analysts on a call in April that Hermès, the luxury retailer known for its iconic Birkin handbags, hadn't yet been impacted by the tariffs, but said the company would raise prices in the US in May.

""The price increase that we're going to implement will be just for the US. Since it's aimed at offsetting the increase in tariffs, that only applies to the American market,"" du Halgouët said on the call.

While Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console won't see a price hike over tariffs, Nintendo said accessories for the Switch 2 ""will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions.""

""Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions,"" the company added in its announcement.

The company also delayed preorders for the Switch 2 in the wake of the tariffs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","“60 Minutes” Host Rebukes Paramount Over Encroachment on Show's Independence","https://truthout.org/articles/60-minutes-host-rebukes-paramount-over-encroachment-on-shows-independence/","Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:43:20 GMT","

Host Scott Pelley explained that corporate influence on the show's editorial direction led to Bill Owens's resignation.

On Sunday evening, Scott Pelley, cohost of the CBS News program “60 Minutes,” gave a rare rebuke to the network's parent company, Paramount, over moves that prompted the resignation of the show's former executive producer, Bill Owens.

Ahead of a desired merger with Skydance Media, which is owned by billionaire David Ellison, Paramount has sought to limit the journalistic independence of “60 Minutes,” viewing its coverage as too critical of President Donald Trump. Any merger deal that Paramount makes with Skydance will have to be approved by the Trump administration. 

Paramount's moves to encroach upon the independence of “60 Minutes” ultimately led Owens to decide he could no longer work at the program. In a memo to staff last week, he wrote:

Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,' right for the audience…. Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.

Staff were reportedly saddened over Owens's departure and the reason behind it. In the final minutes of “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Pelley paid tribute to Owens.

And now, a note on Bill Owens who, until this past week, was the executive producer of 60 Minutes. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes.

Calling Owens's work a “quest to open minds, not close them,” Pelley highlighted how the former producer worked for the network for nearly four decades, spending a quarter of a century at “60 Minutes.” Pelley recognized that the program covered “controversial” stories, such as issues relating to the Trump administration and “the Israel-Gaza war,” which the network has sought to limit reporting on — particularly segments that are critical of Israel's genocidal military campaign against Palestinians.

Pelley defended past reports on those subjects, noting that Owens “made sure they were accurate and fair,” adding that “he was tough that way.”

Without directly rebuking Paramount, Pelley made it clear that the parent company was using its corporate influence to threaten the program's journalistic integrity.

“Our parent company is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways” as a result, Pelley explained to viewers. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”

Pelley added:

No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead “60 Minutes” all along.

As CBS News and other corporate news media have taken steps to limit their reporting on the Trump administration, independent media has become more important than ever in combating attacks on democracy and the rise of fascism, Truthout's board president and editor-at-large Maya Schenwar, editor-in-chief Negin Owliaei, and executive director Ziggy West Jeffery wrote in an op-ed earlier this year.

“As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations — either through need or greed — rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump's wishes even before his inauguration, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models,” the trio said.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.
