                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Italian philosopher and essayist Andrea Colamedici released Ipnocrazia: Trump, Musk e La Nuova Architettura Della Realtà (Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the New Architecture of Reality), he wanted to make a statement about the existence of truth in the digital age. The book, published in December, was described as “a crucial book for understanding how control is currently exercised not by repressing truth but by multiplying narratives, making it impossible to locate any fixed point,” according to a description by Tlon, a publishing house Colamedici cofounded. While the book attracted buzz in philosophy circles, Italian magazine L'Espresso revealed in April that the book's purported author, Jianwei Xun, did not exist, after one of its editors tried and failed to interview him. Initially described as a Hong Kong–born philosopher based in Berlin, it turned out that Xun was actually a hybrid human-algorithmic creation. My aim was to raise awareness,” he tells WIRED. He says the point of the book was to help readers understand AI and invent a new concept for this era. “From figures like Trump, Musk, and other world leaders to the ways in which digital platforms grab our attention, Xun unveils the mechanisms by which power shapes our perception of reality. It is a clear and disturbing analysis that goes beyond traditional critiques of digital society to reveal how reality itself has become a political battleground,” its description reads. Jianwei Xun, the first “ghost thinker” created with artificial intelligence. However, the controversy surrounding the decision to use AI to author it, and initially withhold that information, has now become a major part of the discourse around it—and that's what Colamedici wanted. I deeply regret that, but it was necessary,” he says. “Some people have said, ‘I wish this author existed.' If we don't, the far right will monopolize the narratives, create myths, and we will spend our lives fact-checking while they write history. We can't allow that to happen.” WIRED interviewed Colamedici in a conversation that explored the nuances of his project. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Andrea Colamedici: First of all, I teach prompt thinking at the European Institute of Design and I lead a research project on artificial intelligence and thought systems at the University of Foggia. Working with my students, I realized that they were using ChatGPT in the worst possible way: to copy from it. I observed that they were losing an understanding of life by relying on AI, which is alarming, because we live in an era where we have access to an ocean of knowledge, but we don't know what to do with it. I'd often warn them: “You can get good grades, even build a great career using ChatGPT to cheat, but you'll become empty.” I have trained professors from several Italian universities and many ask me: “When can I stop learning how to use ChatGPT?” The answer is never. We must keep our curiosity alive while using this tool correctly and teaching it to work how we want it to. It all starts from a crucial distinction: There is information that makes you passive, that erodes your ability to think over time, and there is information that challenges you, that makes you smarter by pushing you beyond your limits. This is how we should use AI: as an interlocutor that helps us think differently. Otherwise, we won't understand that these tools are designed by big tech companies that impose a certain ideology. They choose the data, the connections among it, and, above all, they treat us as customers to be satisfied. If we use AI this way, it will only confirm our biases. The second challenge was how to describe what is happening now. For Gilles Deleuze, philosophy is the ability to create concepts, and today we need new ones to understand our reality. Just look at Trump's Gaza video—generated by AI—or the provocations of figures like Musk. Without solid conceptual tools, we are shipwrecked. A good philosopher creates concepts that are like keys allowing us to understand the world. What was your goal with the new book? I deeply regret that, but it was necessary. Some people have said, “I wish this author existed.” Well, he doesn't. If we don't, the far right will monopolize the narratives, create myths, and we will spend our lives fact-checking while they write history. We can't allow that to happen. I want to clarify that AI didn't write the essay. Yes, I used artificial intelligence, but not in a conventional way. I didn't ask the machine to write for me, but instead it generated ideas and then I used GPT and Claude to critique them, to give me perspectives on what I had written. Everything written in the book is mine. Nam June Paik, a great artist of the 1990s, said: “I use technology in order to hate it properly.” And that is what we must do: understand it, because if we don't, it will use us. Why did you choose to present yourself as a translator rather than an author? However, I wrote the book in Italian. I didn't translate it from Chinese—I don't know Chinese—or from English (the other language that the fictional Jianwei Xun knows). We cannot just say “AI, give me more, more, more.” We must be neither techno-enthusiasts who accept everything uncritically, nor technophobes, because it is impossible to live without technology today. AI is here to stay and we must understand it. If AI can create a convincing philosophical treatise, what is left for human authors? You have said that “we must think, we must be critical.” So what is the way forward for today's intellectual? But we should look at this from another angle, not from the neoliberal perspective that turns all of life into a competition where it is all about winning. We must seek our own personal fulfillment, find a way to express ourselves, with or without AI. What does it matter if someone else can draw better than me? What matters is that I can learn to draw better and improve my abilities—working with AI or with another person (I recommend with people, but if you choose AI, that's fine). Nor are we even the centre of life on Earth: more than 99% of the biomass is plants, trees, other life forms. Even among humans, we aren't a whole. That doesn't have to be understood as a tragedy, it can be viewed as a liberation. Why did you choose that title for your book? And while we're at it, let's delve some into the Trump-Musk relationship that you analyse in the book. Yes, I talk about a hypnocracy because what is happening is not a power physically acting on our bodies nor even on our minds, but instead on our very state of consciousness. This is what is happening to us: They are manipulating, through algorithms, our way of perceiving the world. We think we inhabit the same world as others, but our reality is shaped by our biases, opinions, and political positions. We need contact with those who think differently, but these filter bubbles and echo chambers only show us our own reflection. If not, we are heading for civil war. The other will become a threat, when in fact they are first and foremost a mystery—and perhaps even something to be treasured. That should be our first thought when confronting difference. Today, Trump and Musk multiply realities with AI. The technology allows us to create infinite narratives, parallel versions of the world, and they play with that. Can AI have an original point of view, or does hypnocracy simply recycle human thoughts through algorithms? But at the same time, I couldn't have generated this concept without AI. It's a creative codependency: just as I would need a conversation with another person to develop an idea, I needed that dialogue with artificial intelligence. It requires prompts and stimuli while humans think autonomously. If we do not respect it for what it is, a tool, we will end up degrading our own humanity. To give an example: If we are used to saying “Alexa, turn off the light” in an impersonal tone, we will end up talking to our partner or friends in the same way. I'm not saying that we need to thank Siri as if she has feelings, she doesn't, but that we should make sure to preserve our ability to express kindness in real life. Some intriguing studies indicate that when we order an Uber through an app, we treat the driver worse than when we call for a car by phone. This is dangerous and confusing these different categories of exchanges can dehumanize us. Do you consider AI to be simply a tool for humans, or how would you define its ontological status? AI is a human tool, no question. It's a product of our past, a type of collective consciousness that we created and that helps us understand why we are here. But here's a paradox: While AI can tell us the weather, recite verses from ancient poets, or suggest possible solutions to problems, it can never help us understand the meaning of life. What other thinkers from other cultures, would you recommend I look at in order to broaden my understanding?” The West is exhausted. We need to find other radical connections: with Native American philosophies, the Vedas, and other distant cultures. What led to the choice of Jianwei Xun's nationality and the specific cultural context for this fictional philosopher? Was it your decision, the result of AI, or maybe a strategy to challenge certain Western narratives? The world needs to understand that Western culture must look outside itself. Western civilization has a serious problem: It still believes that it is at the centre of the universe, the only one capable of solving problems, and it treats other cultures as only being able to produce mere copies at best. Today, that which is truly revolutionary—the ideas that may fundamentally change our perspective on the world—will not come from the West. It's possible that they might come out of China, but even more likely they will come from one of those spaces on today's frontier where different cultures meet. And we need to beware that even the concepts of East and West are absurd simplifications, but I use them for now. I wanted to create a perspective that sits outside of this Western narcissism. Something that combined the new with old but forgotten ways of thinking. In Italy, for example, we have a crazy situation: The government demands that schools teach that only we have a history. The book has become a publishing phenomenon. What do you attribute this success to? It's true that we've had three printings already, although I don't remember whether they were 2,000 or 3,000 copies each. In total, the book has sold between 4,000 and 5,000 copies. But the strangest thing was when a journalist from [the Spanish newspaper] El País contacted me and asked: “Did you use a pseudonym to sell more copies?” It's actually the other way around! In Italy my books already sell well; I don't need to invent other names. Play is not a trivial thing: If we don't play, then what are we living for? When El País learned that the philosopher and coauthor of this book wasn't real, they decided to remove their review of the book from their website. Do you think this reflects our inability to handle the ambiguity between fiction and truth in the age of AI? Their first instinct is to attack something they see as an “impostor” and erase all traces of it. It's an understandable reaction, even necessary in some cases, because we must protect journalists. They are crucial to uncovering the truth and restoring trust in experts. She admitted that tech moves faster than regulation, and that legislating is complex because innovation doesn't wait. El País could have gone deeper into that. Instead of deleting the review, they could have created something more nuanced along the lines of “Yes, the author is fictional, but his analysis of AI is relevant because ...” People are exhausted and scared, but curiosity generates energy. We need more complex discourses, not simplifications driven by fear. The game, if you will, behind the book exposes a paradox: Readers connected to the fictional philosopher despite knowing he was a creation and not a real person. Doesn't this demonstrate that, in the age of AI, we crave believable stories more than real facts? We'll see how the public reacts now that they know the book is more complex than it first appeared. I have read articles in Italian media that embody an absurd contradiction. Otherwise, we feed a tendency to simplify ideas and sow mistrust. We have a huge responsibility to readers. A possible more nuanced headline could be “An AI Philosopher or a Reflection of Our Times?” But instead we prefer the easy click. Our world now revolves around the immediate reward even when we should encourage slower pursuits—meditation and productive boredom. As Walter Benjamin said: “Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.” You have to sit on the egg and wait for it to hatch. Do you see other similar collaborations with AI in the future or was this a one-time thing, a way of questioning what it means to be an author in our time? I'll continue to publish works as Jianwei Xun—he's a bridge between the human and AI—but it won't be my only voice. It would be dangerous to start thinking that I can only express myself through algorithms. I need to write with and without AI, because I must preserve my ability to dive into myself without intermediaries. Not everyone sees it right now, but in a year or two we will understand the risks of this moment. The paradox is that AI itself, used properly, can be an antidote. It's like a fire that, when it burns in a controlled way, warms us but doesn't harm us. When readers discover that this “philosopher” is, in fact, a fusion of AI and human thought, many say they are puzzled and even disappointed. What would you tell them about the value of this hybrid creation? It's a fascinating question, because it's not about percentages—Jianwei Xun is not 30 percent AI and 70 percent human, for example. I'd tell readers to enjoy the journey and allow yourself to be amazed, because a sense of being amazed is what we lack today. As Plato said in The Theaetetus, philosophy is born from thaumazein, a Greek word that means both wonder or amazement and terror. It's choosing to see beyond the abyss, knowing that we may be lost, but we are not alone. True freedom—and our defense against manipulation—lies in actively choosing to embrace mystery and the unknown, even when it is scary. What do you see as the future of philosophy in the age of AI, and why do you think it's urgent that we reflect on these issues now? The future of philosophy is found in the cracks between what we might call “normality.” Intersectional feminism has taught us that all truth has layers—not only in the struggle around gender, but in every aspect of reality. One last thing: We have been measuring intelligence with our own yardstick for centuries, ignoring that forests have memories and octopuses dream. Meanwhile, AI infiltrates our refrigerators and the locks on our homes as stealthily as some modern trickster god. It is the myth of Thoth revived: Plato warned that writing, that “poison of memory,” would make us sages only on paper. Today, AI repeats the paradox: It promises knowledge while emptying the act of knowing of its meaning. It is something that will wake us up from the technocratic dream with more pointed questions than those posed by any algorithm. This interview was originally published by WIRED en Español.

It also notes that Android will continue to have a presence at I/O in keynotes and technical sessions for developers. Whether that's because there's “too much news” or because Google decided Android's news didn't require as high a billing as in previous years remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intel is likely finalizing software support for Panther Lake. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. An update by Intel to the perfmon platform has added support for upcoming Panther Lake CPUs, listing their core architecture codenames and CPUID, via InstLatX64. This commit unofficially confirms that Panther Lake will employ Cougar Cove Performance (P) cores, while Darkmont will serve to power its Efficiency (E), and likely Low Power Efficiency (LPE) cores as well. Hence, it wouldn't be surprising if the bulk of Panther Lake arrives in Q1 next year, similar to how Meteor Lake rolled out. Current rumors indicate Panther Lake variants will sport up to 18 hybrid cores (6P+8E+4LPE) and 12 Xe cores, based on Intel's upcoming Celestial (Xe3) graphics architecture. According to leaks, most Panther Lake systems will include traditional SODIMM/soldered memory, while some laptop designs might even support next-gen LPCAMM, combining fast and upgradeable RAM. Based on their TDP (rumored: up to 64W), Panther Lake chips are expected to power a wide range of devices, including entry-level laptops, handhelds, and gaming laptops. The company is even eying bringing this architecture to automobiles. Panther Lake has been marked with the "GenuineIntel-6-CC" identifier, assigning it to CPU Family 6, Model 204 (0xCC). In addition, the patch reports the Cougar Cove and Darkmont architectures for Panther Lake's Performance (P) and Efficiency (E) cores, respectively. Likewise, the rumored E-core path is Skymont (ARL/LNL) to Darkmont (PTL/WCL) and Arctic Wolf (NVL). Once again, these are based on preliminary assumptions and a compilation of several leaks, so take them with a heavy dose of skepticism. I'm curious to see how much Panther Lake laptops will cost compared to Lunar Lake, which was entirely manufactured by TSMC. With Computex just weeks away, we expect Intel to share finer architectural details at the show. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's international divisions will continue to oversee future European sales. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. PC cooling mainstay Scythe has officially announced the shutdown of its European division due to ongoing financial difficulties. However, the company reassured that Scythe-branded products and customer service will remain available in Europe through its network of distributors and online e-commerce platforms. The company acknowledged that during this transitional phase, there could be some “unfinished matters,” which likely refers to potential service delays or ongoing warranty claims. Apologizing for any inconvenience to customers, Scythe also added that it will continue to uphold the principles of "responsibility and integrity," by protecting customer rights in accordance with the law. For now, if you are looking for Scythe products in Europe, you should still be able to purchase them through offline and online retail stores. After-sales service will be routed through the company's international support teams. Customers who need assistance with existing Scythe products are advised to reach out via the company's official support emails or its Facebook page. Meanwhile, Scythe's operations in Europe will now be handled through its Japan, USA, and Taiwan divisions. The closure follows earlier reports from Germany where Scythe EU GmbH was placed under provisional insolvency proceedings. The insolvency phase typically allows a few months for auditing and restructuring, but Scythe has ultimately opted to shut down its European division altogether. Scythe has long been a respected name in the PC cooling market, earning praise for its price-to-performance ratio and reliable designs. However, the closure sheds some light on the growing pressure of smaller hardware manufacturers that are struggling to stay afloat amid escalating production costs, global supply chain disruptions, and stiff competition, particularly from cheaper Chinese alternatives.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A classic springtime storm setup could unleash dangerous weather across the Upper Midwest today, including damaging tornadoes, large hail, and strong winds, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC). The SPC has issued a Moderate Risk—its second-highest threat level—for parts of southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin. “The most dangerous period is likely during the late afternoon and evening,” the SPC warned in its latest forecast, “when strong tornado potential should be maximized.” Warm, moist air is surging northward ahead of a sharp dryline—the boundary between moist and drier area along which storms form. An incoming jet streak—fast winds high in the atmosphere—will supercharge developing storms. The greatest threats from the system are supercells capable of producing intense tornadoes, large hail (think golf balls and bigger), and damaging gusts of wind. Farther south, from central Oklahoma into parts of Texas, another round of supercells could form along the dryline. These storms will also carry a risk of large hail, particularly in the evening hours, the NWS bulletin stated. If you're in the affected area—especially where the worst weather is expected—keep track of updates from your local National Weather Service station.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People routinely try to recycle dirty yogurt cups or toss plastic in the aluminum bin. It all makes recycling more expensive because, ultimately, someone has to manually pick out the unwanted stuff. In response, several companies have been building automated systems to sort recyclables, including Glacier, a 6-year-old company that has developed inexpensive robotic arms controlled by computer vision to identify over 30 different types of materials. The startup has deployed its robots in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, and now Seattle. The job is so undesirable that one MRF operator told Hu-Thrams that, even though his wages were higher, he was concerned about losing workers to a new warehouse set to open nearby. “Would you rather stand at a conveyor belt and sort through people's trash, or would you rather be lifting boxes in an air-conditioned warehouse?” Hu-Thrams said. Glacier offers its robots to customers as outright purchases or on a lease-to-own model. For those that would rather not, the startup offers maintenance packages. Glacier is also offering a data product, in which MRFs and other stakeholders like consumer products companies and government agencies can pay for access to insights about the waste stream. For an MRF, that might mean identifying where on a line it's losing valuable aluminum cans to the landfill. For a company or regulator, it might mean auditing the waste stream to determine whether packaging that's designed to be recycled is actually getting recycled. “AI is getting really powerful, being able to distinguish beyond what people can even notice.” From coding tests to billion-dollar startups, Ali Partovi's eight-year experiment is paying off Best bookmarking apps to help organize and declutter your digital life Bezos-backed Slate Auto debuts analog EV pickup truck that is decidedly anti-Tesla Government censorship comes to Bluesky, but not its third-party apps … yet</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When all smartphones are huge slabs that look like iPhones, tech companies really need to go hard with eye-catching designs. Carl Pei's Nothing has been turning heads with its transparent phones and wireless earbuds since 2021, and last year the company's sub-brand, CMF, surprised everyone with its unapologetically plastic and modular Phone 1. The fact that I can't remember a damn thing about the Phone 1's tech specs but vividly recall how fun it was to unscrew the back plate to install a card case, kickstand, and neck lanyard should tell you what CMF prioritized for the budget phone. Nearly a year later, CMF is back with the Phone 2 Pro. I've only had the device for a weekend, so not enough time for a full review, but you can expect it on Gizmodo in the coming days. CMF beefed up the specs—a slightly faster processor, higher-resolution cameras including telephoto and ultra-wide lenses, more battery life— and even added the physical Essential button for accessing what's basically an AI memory that was introduced on the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro. The first thing I did after unboxing the Phone 2 Pro was see which of CMF's official Phone 1 accessories worked. However, the card case wallet, which requires attaching a special magnetic plate that also secures into the round wheel, didn't. And because the Phone 2 Pro's back is sealed and no longer removable, any Phone 1 back plate “cases” aren't compatible, either. If you own extra Phone 1 back plates or the card case wallet, you're shit out of luck. It's not completely bad news… if you own a 3D printer. Thanks to CMF retaining the four easily removable screws, you can still design and 3D print your own accessories or buy them from makers off marketplaces like Etsy. I wouldn't be surprised if the flourishing DIY community is why CMF is breaking compatibility with some Phone 1 accessories so soon. The Phone 2 Pro is a decent-looking phone that feels solid—refreshingly lightweight (185g) and thin (7.8mm) compared to other phones with a similar-sized display. The screen is more than bright enough, and Nothing OS 3.2 (Android 15) is responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. Nothing sent me the light green that you see in these photos. It has a satin-like sheen when viewed at different angles. But the phone also comes in white, black, and orange. Photo and video quality will have to wait until I can snap enough photos to make an evaluation, but at the very least, you can get more zoom reach and a wider field of view in your shots. I admit I wasn't expecting to find the Essential key below the right-side power button. I thought Nothing would gatekeep it for its more expensive phones, but perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised, since Nothing plans to charge a subscription to use the AI feature in the near future. Gotta get the button onto as many phones as possible if you wanna turn it into a subscription business! Press and hold the Essential key, and you're taken to the Essential Space, where all your screenshots live, but also where generative AI organizes and helps make sense of all those captures. It's a nifty idea for a “second brain” or “memory recall” function where you can just dump everything into the Essential Space and let AI sort it all out, but its usefulness is pretty limited right now. There isn't even a way to search your screenshots (yet). For a budget phone, the CMF Phone 2 Pro packs in a lot while still keeping some modularity. Nothing's primarily targeting India and Europe with this phone: £219 in the UK, €249 in Europe, and ₹18,999 for 8GB of RAM + 128GB of storage. Like always, U.S. consumers can get the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage model—the only variant shipping to America—through Nothing's Beta program for $279. You'll have to convert the currency yourself if you plan to import them, since they won't be available in the U.S. or India. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The Dough Spectrum Black 32 stands out among its peer group of excellent premium OLED monitors with record-low input lag, superb video processing, tremendous flexibility and a stunning picture courtesy of Gorilla Glass. Lowest input lag of any monitor I've ever tested at 480 Hz Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. The thing I like most about OLED gaming monitors is how consistent they are in performance. In my experience so far, I have yet to find a bad one. They all deliver a crisp bright image with deep blacks and saturated color, in QHD or UHD resolution. With so many monitors nearly identical in gaming feel and appearance, how is one to choose? Other OLEDs do with shiny plastic, which is fine, but the optical properties of glass are superior. Dough takes it even further with unmatched performance and tweakability. Made to compete with the best gaming monitors, the Spectrum Black 32, delivers Ultra HD resolution in a 32-inch panel fronted by Gorilla Glass. It also boasts a 240 Hz refresh rate with a 480 Hz FHD mode for even faster response and lower input lag. Video processing includes Adaptive-Sync, blur reduction and many options for adjustment. The Spectrum Black 32's OLED panel includes two standout features. It's extremely crisp thanks to the glass's optical purity. The picture truly pops, even when compared to other premium OLEDs. But in a side-by-side comparison, Gorilla Glass adds something extra that can easily be seen. MLA stands for Micro Lens Array, and it is literally an array of tiny lenses placed in front of the OLED layer. It's there to increase light output and the Spectrum Black 32 has that in abundance. I measured over 700 nits for a 25% window which is about 40% more light than most of the 32-inch UHD OLEDs I've reviewed. While this is far from a deal breaker, it is possible to buy an OLED that covers nearly 110% if it's the Alienware AW3225QF. The Dough is certainly colorful, but a few others are more so. Dough calibrates each sample at the factory and mine measured within a whisker of perfect in its Display P3 and sRGB modes. Full calibration can be accomplished with the included gamma presets and color temps. For brightness control, you get a fixed option where the output level remains the same regardless of content, plus two levels of variable brightness. HDR also has two options for its luminance curve called Accurate and Maximum. Gaming is the Spectrum Black 32's primary skill and to that end, Dough has covered every possible base with video processing options. You also get a 480 Hz mode that runs at FHD resolution. Motion is blur-free at 240 Hz, but you'll need a stout video card to hit that frame rate in Ultra HD. Physically, the Spectrum Black 32 sports solid build quality but not much else. I got the version without a USB hub, and there are no internal speakers or LED lights. There is a USB-C port but it's only for firmware updates. The Spectrum Black 32 is not a small purchase. The top model adds USB and DisplayPort 2.1 for $1,300. You can save a few bucks and get the matte screen model with no USB for $900. I've reviewed many OLEDs and upon receiving the Spectrum Black 32, I noted that its carton is smaller than typical. Granted, only the panel and an external power supply are inside, but there isn't a whole lot surrounding it. My sample arrived safely with the stand in a separate box. There are no video cables, only the power supply, and a calibration data sheet. There's no room for a logo here which improves the perception of an image that floats in front of the user. If you'd rather use an arm, there's a 100mm VESA mount in the back but you'll need to provide your own fasteners. Movements are firm but there is a bit of wobble at the base. The ports face backwards and include two HDMI 2.1 (24 Gbps) and a single DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). For an extra $200, you can get the Spectrum Black 32 with a DisplayPort 2.1, two HDMI 2.1, three USB-C and two USB-A ports. The Spectrum Black 32's OSD is loaded with every conceivable option for video processing and image adjustment. There is a lot to see here so let's dive in The Picture menu has four image modes termed by their color gamuts. The Spectrum Black 32 accurately renders sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3 and Display P3. DCI stands for Digital Cinema Initiative, and it is different from Display P3 in its color temp and gamma, which Dough gets right. If you need a post-production monitor for color grading, the Spectrum Black 32 is fully qualified. This menu also has Brightness Control which affects how light output is managed according to content. In fact, the brightness slider does not affect output in this mode, it's set at 200 nits although you can lower the contrast slider if you want to reduce brightness. Tempered and Standard modulate output to make highlights pop more. I found the most dynamic image in Tempered and even though it shifts with content, it maintains accurate gamma. The Spectrum Black 32 is extremely accurate out of the box but if you want to tweak, there are four fixed color temps and gamma presets too. In HDR mode, you get Accurate and Maximum Brightness options. I'll tell you more about those on page five. I had no need for this thanks to a GeForce RTX 4090 that can run Ultra HD at 240fps. But if you run variable frame rates, it is a useful tool to keep the action smooth. You can also reduce blur with black frame insertion and its minimum strobe frequency slider. Frame rates over 200 won't benefit from this option because they're blur-free already. You'll see on the next page what a difference that makes. Decide which mode you'll use before starting a game for best results. Rather than task-oriented picture modes, Dough simply includes three user memories which can be set however you'd like. You can also reset the Spectrum Black 32 back to factory specs here. It makes accessing commonly used functions a one-press affair. The Custom button is handy for switching refresh modes. The Spectrum Black 32 has a huge array of care options like logo detection, pixel orbiter and the like. You can also run refresh routines to balance pixel use. I turned all of them off for testing, but I recommend using the Screen shift and occasionally running OLED wear compensation. I've never seen burn-in on any OLED in my possession including a five-year-old LG TV and a computer monitor that is used many hours per day. If you want maximum color for all content, go with Display P3. Calibration is possible in any mode, but I could not improve upon the out-of-box results. The choices are, therefore, brightness level and color spec. If you pick Uniform, it maintains constant brightness around 200 nits. For more control of the light level, choose Standard where you can dial it down to 2 nits if you like. The monitor is fussy about its USB-C interface and requires a thumb drive formatted to FAT32 and smaller than 32GB in size. There are some considerations when preparing the Spectrum Black 32 for optimal gaming performance. Then you can run in Ultra HD at 240 Hz and get smooth motion with low input lag. If you run below 200 fps, the Black frame insertion option with Minimum strobe frequency at 75 keeps blur at bay with only minimal light output reduction. My PC did this automatically but yours might not. I programmed the extra control key for this. If you do it in game, the title may crash requiring a visit to the Task Manager or a restart. With these things done, I settled in for some very enjoyable gaming sessions. I have played on every type of gaming monitor available using all manner of screen tech, refresh rates, video processing options, sizes and shapes. I still maintain that there is nothing that is more fun to play on than a fast OLED. But the feel factor is something that must be experienced. And nothing delivers clarity on the level of an Ultra HD screen at 240 Hz. Only something like a GeForce RTX 4090 will match the Spectrum Black 32's potential. If you can do this, it is a true weapon. And at 480 Hz, it is the fastest monitor I've ever tested. The FHD 480 Hz mode has pluses and minuses. On the plus side, it is incredibly fast and smooth. You will never see motion blur and input lag is essentially non-existent. On the downside, it's FHD resolution from a 32-inch 16:9 panel. But for competitors needing every possible edge, it is a great option. Apart from gaming, the Spectrum Black 32 is a superb display for all uses. SDR content looks best when Brightness control is set to Tempered. I set 200 nits peak using a 25% window and never felt a need to lower the brightness or contrast sliders. The Spectrum Black 32 comes with a properly executed factory calibration and I could not improve upon it. Ergonomically, I appreciated the tall stand that let me set the panel high with my eyepoint at center screen. Build quality is solid and the Spectrum Black 32 has a premium feel when navigating the OSD or adjusting its position. I didn't mourn the lack of USB ports but if you need them, Dough has a version with lots of connectivity available. Though I can't quantify its benefits with tests, it compares favorably with other OLED screens in a side-by-side comparison. Not only do the test results on the next page support this but I could feel and see it when I played Doom Eternal and other familiar titles. Though my skills are not at competition level, I can't imagine any pro player not wanting to add this monitor to their toolkit. On top of that, it delivers perfect out of box accuracy and a stunning image suitable for any task from word processing and web browsing to pro-level video post production and color grading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The use of 3GB GDDR7 memory could help Nvidia add more VRAM to its GPUs. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It has only been a few months since Nvidia officially announced its RTX 50-series graphics cards, but rumors are already pointing to a potential Super series refresh. According to a post on the Chiphell forums, a hit-and-miss source for hardware leaks, Nvidia might already be working on an RTX 5080 Super with 24GB and an RTX 5070 Super with 16GB of VRAM. The key enabler behind these rumored memory configurations is said to be Nvidia's use of 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. These modules essentially allow for more flexible VRAM amounts than the traditional 8GB or 16GB increments. By leveraging 3GB chips, Nvidia can gain the ability to offer configurations like 18GB (6×3GB) and 24GB (8×3GB) VRAM for its desktop class GPUs without making any major PCB redesigns. This can also help Nvidia make refreshes or upgraded versions (like the aforementioned Super variants) easier to deliver without changing much hardware or firmware. With the higher amount of VRAM, these graphics cards will potentially have the ability to handle larger textures at higher resolutions, and more complex scenes with fewer performance drops. Before this raises any expectations, it's important to note that there's currently no official confirmation from Nvidia, and these rumors should be treated as entertaining speculation. Given how early it is in the RTX 50-series lifecycle, a refresh at this moment seems unusual, but is not entirely out of the question. Prior to the launch of the RTX 50-series, there were similar reports around Nvidia's plans to use 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. It was also speculated that the RTX 5080 would arrive in a special 24GB VRAM flavor. However, the company ended up using conventional 2GB memory chips, possibly due to higher costs. Notably, these 3GB modules are being used for Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPUs, as well as the laptop variant of the RTX 5090 which comes with 24GB of VRAM with a 256-bit memory interface. While the discussion around these models is still at a very preliminary stage, it is possible that Nvidia is experimenting internally or possibly working on contingency plans. Although, we don't expect Nvidia to bring a Super refresh for the RTX 50-series as soon as Computex 2025, for example, they would more likely arrive late in 2025 or even for CES 2026. For now, though, it would be best to view the RTX 5080 Super and RTX 5070 Super as interesting possibilities rather than inevitable products. We'll be watching closely for any reliable updates or official hints from Nvidia in the coming months. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. EliteBook is HP's business laptop brand—“real power for real work”—and a quick peek at the price reveals a fairly universal truth about business-focused hardware: It's more expensive than consumer-grade gear. With a $2,429 MSRP (though already discounted to $1,999), the EliteBook Ultra G1i is the priciest laptop I've tested in over a year, except for Apple's MacBook Pro, which had its specs blown out. The EliteBook Ultra G1i has relatively tame tech under the hood, a modest configuration that would barely merit a raised eyebrow amongst its Windows competitors. The big sell is security: HP Wolf Security for Business adds several extra layers of protection on top of existing anti-malware features, and it's hard not to notice them right away. For example, one feature of Wolf emerges when you attempt to install any software. Wolf pops up to alert you if the software is not on its authorized list (nothing was, during my tests), and asks if you really want to install it. Additional features of Wolf Security include anti-phishing protection, a BIOS tamper-prevention feature, Windows OS hardening/resilience features, and much more, with extras geared toward IT fleet management. Much of this is overkill for the consumer, but if your business needs this kind of protection and added manageability, well, you probably already know it. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. Beyond all that, there's the actual hardware, which is buttoned up. Matte black, with curved corners but generally crisp edges, nothing about the design will surprise any user who's worked on a corporate laptop in the last decade, save perhaps for the screen, which opens to a lie-flat 180 degrees. The magnesium cover has a moderate amount of give, but the thinness does help keep weight down to a svelte 2.6 pounds, and thickness at 19 mm. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. Specs are not bare-bones but are far from luxe; the 14-inch touchscreen has a 2,880 x 1,800-pixel resolution, and the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V CPU. That's a few steps up from the basic processor model, but still a step down from higher-end options you typically find at this price. None of the benchmarks I ran were any more impressive than I've seen on slower, cheaper machines running Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2 processors, and many of the scores I saw were below even those uninspired levels, albeit only slightly. All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. I did appreciate the keyboard on the device, which has just enough travel and responsiveness to make for easy data entry, while also being fairly quiet. The touchpad is spacious but just short of being too large. AI Companion purports to let you take fuller advantage of the onboard neural processing unit, though it requires an active internet connection to work and wasn't any faster than any online tools available. You're also getting double AI duty here, as pressing the Copilot button on the keyboard still brings up a standard Microsoft Copilot interface. The temporary sale price of $1,999 makes the EliteBook Ultra G1i a better deal, but it still doesn't measure up on a price-to-performance basis against competing systems. It does, however, provide a much stronger value proposition for its security and manageability benefits, though again, I doubt many of these features have much utility outside of large, corporate environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the additional levels of internet connectivity this subscription model requires can increase drivers' exposure to government surveillance and the likelihood of being caught up in police investigations. A cache of more than two dozen police records recently reviewed by WIRED show US law enforcement agencies regularly trained on how to take advantage of “connected cars,” with subscription-based features drastically increasing the amount of data that can be accessed during investigations. WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. “Each manufacturer has their whole protocol on how the operating system in the vehicle utilizes telematics, mobile Wi-Fi, et cetera,” one law enforcement officer noted in a presentation prepared by the California State Highway Patrol (CHP) and reviewed by WIRED. “If the vehicle has an active subscription,” they add, “it does create more data.” The CHP presentation, obtained by government transparency nonprofit Property of the People via a public records request, trains police on how to acquire data based on a variety of hypothetical scenarios, each describing how vehicle data can be acquired based on the year, make, and model of a vehicle. The presentation acknowledges that access to data can ultimately be limited due to choices made by not only vehicle manufacturers but the internet service providers on which connected devices rely. One document notes, for instance, that when a General Motors vehicle is equipped with an active OnStar subscription, it will transmit data—revealing its location—roughly twice as often as a Ford vehicle. Police may be able to rely on AT&T to help identify certain vehicles based on connected devices active in the car but lack the ability to do so when the device relies on a T-Mobile or Verizon network instead. Other car manufacturers listed in the CHP presentation, including Ford, did not respond to a request for comment. “And this is a dynamic we've seen in other areas of tech. Police analysts can then comb through this data and attempt to identify a culprit, often using surveillance footage or witness testimony about a vehicle's color, make, or model. Nearly all subscription-based car features rely on devices that come preinstalled in a vehicle, with a cellular connection necessary only to enable the automaker's recurring-revenue scheme. The “tower dump” technique is becoming increasingly unpopular in US courts following the US Supreme Court's acknowledgement in 2018 that location data raises significant Fourth Amendment concerns. While the Supreme Court specifically avoided addressing tower dumps in its landmark US v. Carpenter decision, a Fifth Circuit ruling last year placed the capability in great jeopardy, concluding that a warrant to “geofence” an area and collect evidence from a wide variety of individuals is inherently unconstitutional. “Location data is some of the most sensitive, revealing information that is generated by our devices, including our cars,” the EFF's Crocker says. You can paint a very clear picture of someone's life with just a list of all the places they've been in their car. The police documents reviewed by WIRED alone demonstrate the arbitrary nature of vehicle surveillance upon this shifting legal landscape, with police noting, for instance, that while Verizon will refuse to allow police to define their own radius when requesting cell tower data, its competitors impose no such limitations. Another document notes that while AT&T will conduct “pings,” locating a device in real time, it will only do so for “voice devices.” What is also clear from the documents is that US police are aware of the control corporations have over their ability to acquire vehicle location data, expressing fears that they could abruptly decide to kill off certain capabilities at any time. In a letter sent in April 2024 to the Federal Trade Commission, US senators Ron Wyden and Edward Markey—Democrats from Oregon and Massachusetts, respectively—noted that a range of automakers, from Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, among others, are willing to disclose location data to the government in response to a subpoena without a court order. Volkswagen, meanwhile, had its own arbitrary rules, limiting subpoenas to fewer than seven days' worth of data. The senators noted that these policies stood in contrast to public pledges previously made by some automakers to require a warrant or court order before surrendering a customer's location data. “The other car companies do not tell their customers about government demands for their data, even if they are allowed to do so.” AT&T spokesperson Jim Kimberly says: “Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and other lawful discovery requests. In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid. We require a search warrant based on the probable-cause standard for all government demands for real-time or historical location information, except in emergency situations. “Especially now, with American civil liberties eroding rapidly, people should exercise great caution in granting new surveillance powers to law enforcement,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the police documents reviewed by WIRED contained substantial detail about car surveillance that appear to be publicly unavailable, suggesting that corporations are being far more open with law enforcement than they are with their own customers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on Wired are independently selected by our editors. Two years ago, astronomers believe they detected a star devouring one of its planets. The only noted way for a star to consume its own planets is for the star to increase significantly in size. This happens when a main sequence star, like our Sun, runs out of hydrogen to fuse and swells to many times its original size, becoming a red giant. Experts are studying this process with interest because the solar system itself is likely to face it. In 2023, the Gemini South observatory observed a nova 12,000 light-years away. It was initially suspected to be a red giant consuming one of its nearby planets. However, two years later, a more detailed analysis with the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared instrument revealed that the star was still in its main sequence phase, fusing hydrogen—the star had not aged and expanded into being a red giant. According to a recent study published in the Astrophysical Journal, this nova is the most convincing direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star. The same researchers had already posited that this nova was evidence of a planet being engulfed in another report, published in Nature a couple of years ago. This provided new data on the star's luminosity and ejected dust debris, and gave the team of astronomers a better idea of what might have happened in that solar system. Not all of the scientific community is convinced by this explanation. One of the main counter-hypotheses says that the star only looks young, because it is could be surrounded by a dense cloud of stellar dust, dampening its luminosity. If it turns out that the age or type of star is different from what is hypothesized, then there may be another explanation for the nova. New measurements with more powerful telescopes will measure this star's brightness better, and will hopefully provide more evidence as to what happened. It's also possible that more “suicide” planets will be found in future in other places, revealing that the scenario is more common than thought.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Deepankar Rustagi last raised money for OmniRetail in 2022, excitement was high for African startups addressing the supply chain and operational challenges in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. At one point, these startups received more capital than all sectors, except fintech. Yet for Rustagi, OmniRetail isn't just another B2B commerce platform; it's an ambitious effort to reshape informal retail across Nigeria and West Africa using technology and embedded finance in a scalable, profitable way. Retailers use the app to order inventory, access working capital, and make digital payments. A similar story is unfolding in Egypt, where another B2B e-commerce platform, Cartona, owes its push toward profitability to the model. Both CEOs have noted that Africa's informal market is vast and made up of suppliers and distributors that don't need to be displaced or competed against, but rather made more efficient with the tech tools provided by their platforms. Better occupancy in warehousing, smarter logistics routes, and deeper category penetration will all improve margins, he added. “For years, goods have been moving from point A to point B, but the lack of transparency has hindered financial inclusion and caused inefficiencies in the process,” said Bagaria. “By building an ecosystem that streamlines this entire landscape, we can solve these problems.” Once a startup reaches critical mass, Bagaria adds, it becomes easier to layer additional services, such as payments and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), on top of its existing infrastructure. Unlike other startups that jumped into offering credit products too early or mistimed the launch, OmniRetail waited until it had significant distribution scale and data. Thanks to this strategy, OmniRetail processed over ₦1.3 trillion (~$810 million) in transactions last year, with Omnipay, its BNPL product, disbursing ₦19 billion monthly (~$12 million) in inventory credit, boasting near-zero defaults, according to the company. Acquiring Nigeria-based merchant solution platform Traction Apps in 2024 further strengthened OmniRetail's strategy. Our plan is to dive deep into the value chain and maximize margins. International players have done well in their markets, and we're bringing that model to Nigeria today.” While it no longer publicly discloses GMV figures, shifting away from the metric that has long been a key performance indicator in the sector,  it reports a 35% increase in net merchandise volume (NMV) and a 40% bump in revenue over the past year, all while maintaining profitability despite its expansion. With $20 million in fresh capital, OmniRetail plans to continue growing its retailer base and expand into new product categories like personal care, home care, and cold storage. As such, some of its next moves include a debt raise for inventory finance and strategic acquisitions, according to Bagaria. For Norfund, OmniRetail represents more than just a fintech or commerce bet; it's infrastructure. “Embedded finance is one of the most transformative tools for small business growth in Africa,” said Norfund Investor Director Cathrine Conradi. “OmniRetail's model brings capital to areas where traditional systems haven't reached.” Meanwhile, Timon Capital, which backed OmniRetail from its seed stage, sees this as a breakout moment for the company. “OmniRetail has now hit an inflection point in distribution, payments, and credit, showing just how much profitable growth they can generate with their expanding footprint,” the firm said.
