Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) on Monday filed the first articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump in his second term.

Thanedar, who also received a second primary challenger on Monday, filed seven articles for alleged abuse of power, constitutional violations, and tyranny.

“Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as president and represents a clear and present danger to our nation's constitution and our democracy,” Thanedar said in a statement. “His unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act.”

A resolution outlining the seven articles filed by Thanedar cites allegations that include denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, misuse of the Justice Department, bribery and corruption for dismissing criminal cases and soliciting foreign emoluments, threatening military invasion against sovereign nations, and dismantling congressionally established agencies.

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG? DC JUDGE AT CENTER OF IMPEACHMENT FIGHT OVER TRUMP IMMIGRATION PLANS 

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats are in the minority in the House and Senate, so the prospect of any impeachment against Trump is unlikely unless they win back power in the 2026 midterm elections.

This is a developing story.</p>

Comedian Mick Thomas joins Fox News Saturday Night to give his take on actress Rosie O'Donnell announcing on TikTok that she has decided to relocate to Ireland. Thousands of people participated in a march against Ireland's mass migration policies in the country's capital of Dublin on Saturday. UFC champion Conor McGregor – who is considering a potential presidential bid in his native Ireland – posted a video message beforehand from Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, where the march began hours later. April 26th, 2025 - A big day here for our country. "A historic month for Ireland since 1916," McGregor said, referring to the recent anniversary of the Easter Rising against British rule. "Over 100 years ago, our brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live free today. So let us remind ourselves why we are here. And also why we are not here," McGregor said. "We are not here to build hatred amongst each other. We are not here to sow division. We are here to commemorate the valiant heroes who went before us. Thousands of protesters opposed the Irish government's mass migration policies in a march through in Dublin City centre on Saturday April 26, 2025. McGregor said the protest would be intended "to shine our light on the failure of Ireland's government and our full disapproval of it." "Because together, we will be heard, and as one, we will be victorious in our mission. To those leading their march and speaking for the tens of thousands standing behind you: be calm, be clear." "Speak with dignity - we want to hear your voice. The large-scale demonstration kicked off on Saturday afternoon in the garden, as crowds carrying tri-color flags headed down O'Connell Street. Some protesters carried placards reading "Irish Lives Matter" and "Ireland is Full," and many wore green hats with the message "Make Ireland Great Again." Irish police, known as gardaí, showed a heightened presence in the capital, maintaining a cordoned-off line between the marchers and a smaller group of counter-protesters who gathered in front of the General Post Office (GPO). "Over 106,000 Irish men, women and children attended yesterday's rally," McGregor wrote on X Sunday, sharing aerial photos of protesters waving tri-color flags. "Not one social order incident to report. Protesters march against mass migration on April 26, 2025 in Dublin, Ireland. A placard reading "Irish Lives Matter" is seen during a march against mass migration policies in Dublin, Saturday April 26, 2025.

A sign against mass migration is seen on April 26, 2025 in Dublin, Ireland. A crowd waving tri-color flags marches against mass migration in Dublin City centre. Police later said "no major incidents" happened Saturday, though three people had been arrested for "public order offenses," according to the Irish public broadcaster RTE. They held banners that read, "Boycott Apartheid Israel" and "Dublin Stands Against Racism," according to photos from the scene. McGregor first announced his interest in running for president of Ireland after meeting with President Donald Trump on St. Patrick's Day, though the fighter has suggested the country's nomination process is stacked against outsiders like himself. Those who spoke at the march included Dublin City councilors Gavin Pepper, Philip Sutcliffe and Malachy Steenson and Fingal councilor Patrick Quinlan, according to Breakingnews.ie. "The fact of the matter is we're bringing in thousands and thousands of people and putting them up in hotels while our own people are being left to rot… We've had enough of this in Ireland," Pepper said to a cheering Dublin crowd, according to a video shared on X. "Irish people come first in our own country. The traitors of Sinn Féin do not care." The prime minister of Ireland, who holds the title of taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told reporters on Sunday that he did not "accept the negativity from those who spoke yesterday in respect of where modern Ireland is today," according to a video shared online by Susanne Delaney, a contributor to the anti-globalist outlet Irish Inquiry. "The big social issue of our day is housing, but we're focused on solutions to that and less so on the rhetoric of it." Story tips can be sent to danielle.wallace@fox.com and on X: @danimwallace.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the nonstop airstrikes on 'Special Report.' The Trump administration sanctioned three vessels and their owners for providing support to the Houthis – the Iranian regime's network of terrorist proxies and partners, Fox News Digital has learned. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions Monday, following the Houthis' efforts to deploy missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and naval mines to attack commercial shipping interests in the Red Sea – activities that "threaten global freedom of navigation and the integrity of international commerce." "Today's action underscores our commitment to disrupt the Houthis' efforts to fund their dangerous and destabilizing attacks in the region," Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender said Monday, adding that the department will "continue to leverage" its tools and authorities "to target those who seek to enable the Houthis' ability to exploit the people of Yemen and continue their campaign of violence." The State Department designated the Houthis as a specially designated global terrorist in February 2024 and redesignated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in March. "Providing material support to the Houthis not only carries acute sanctions risk, but also exposes vessels and crew members to serious safety risk from potential Houthi attacks," a Treasury Department official told Fox News Digital. A Treasury official told Fox News Digital that the Houthis control the strategic Yemen Red Sea ports of Hudaydah, Ras Isa and Al-Salif, and are funneling millions of dollars derived from port revenues and the seizure of refined petroleum products to fund a "reckless attack campaign against U.S. interests and those of our allies in the region." The official said the group sells refined petroleum products at "exorbitant prices" on Yemen's black market, which enables the Houthi operatives to "purchase military materials, create an artificial shortage of essential goods for average Yemenis, and fuels rampant corruption among Houthi leaders." It also has been used to transport petroleum products on behalf of Iran. The British-registered cargo ship Rubymar is seen sinking on March 3 after it was targeted by Yemen's Houthi forces while traveling in the Red Sea. The Maisan also has been involved in the export of Russian crude oil and petroleum products from Russian ports since February 2023, according to a Treasury official. The move comes after President Donald Trump officially informed Congress in March that he had directed the Department of Defense to move additional combat forces into the Middle East, as U.S. forces carry out military strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen. Those strikes have been conducted in an effort to stop attacks on American forces and commercial ships in the Red Sea. "I will no longer allow this band of pirates to threaten and attack United States forces and commercial vessels in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world," Trump wrote March 28. "We will act to keep Americans safe." Yemeni Coast Guard ships affiliated with the Houthi group patrol the sea on Jan. 4, 2024. International shipping has been disrupted by their presence. He said the U.S. will continue striking until the group no longer poses a threat to navigation or U.S. personnel. The strikes have been from Navy ships, Air Force bombers and drones targeting Houthi weapons, leadership and command centers. The airstrikes began after renewed Houthi threats against Israeli ships and attacks on U.S. forces, including seven Reaper drones brought down since March 3. They've claimed responsibility for targeting U.S. warships and have so far avoided hitting Chinese and Saudi ships, raising questions among defense officials about their strategic aims.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain and Portugal are racing the setting sun as they respond to a massive, unexplained power outage that knocked out traffic lights, caused chaos on roads and in airports, and threatened to plunge tens of millions of people into darkness on Monday. Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian Peninsula, and in parts of France, shortly after midday. It could be several hours until power is fully restored, Spain's grid operator said, meaning families and businesses around the country could be without energy come nightfall. The cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs were shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of around 60 million people, hastily arranged emergency meetings to co-ordinate a response. Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to clear the roads for emergency workers. Portugal's grid operator said restoring power was a “complex operation.” By Monday evening, both Portugal's and Spain's grid operators said the supply of energy was gradually being restored in pockets of both countries, although Portugal's operator said it would still take several hours for Lisbon, the capital, to be reconnected. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said authorities are still not sure what caused the power outage. “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process – the total reestablishment of the electrical supply – will take several hours, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red Eléctrica, Spain's national grid operator, told broadcaster La Sexta. Portugal's prime minister blamed his neighboring nation for the scenes. Luis Montenegro said his government did not yet know what caused the cut, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” that the problem started in Spain. João Faria Conceição, head of REN, said Portugal was badly affected because it imports electricity from Spain in the morning, because Spain is one hour ahead and electricity produced by its solar plants is cheaper than producing it internally, during those hours. “We are peripheral,” Conceição told a news conference Monday evening. While Spain received support from France and Morocco, Portugal had no country to turn to for emergency supplies of electricity. Monday's blackout hit a huge and busy swathe of southern Europe. Two of the five busiest airports in the European Union in 2023 were Madrid's and Barcelona's, according to EU data. For a few hours, modern routines were suspended: cash replaced card payments, police officers used arm signals to direct traffic, and restaurants, supermarkets and stores closed their doors. Spain's nuclear sites were declared operational and safe, while Portugal's National Institute for Medical Emergencies said it had “activated its contingency plan,” running its telephone and IT systems through a back-up generator. Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there. Flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in lines, with no air conditioning or running water. Shops were only accepting cash, she told CNN. And darkness suddenly descended in subway tunnels; video posted on social media showed blackened subway cars stuck in standstill on platforms in Madrid, where the metro was suspended and entrances to stations were taped off. Some parts of southern France, near the Spanish border, felt a more sporadic impact. Emilie Grandidie, a spokeswoman for France's electricity transmission operator RTE, told CNN there was “a small power cut” in the French Basque Country; “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” she said. For several hours on Monday, tens of millions of people were asking each other when power would return, and why it was knocked out in the first place. But once power returns, it could still take days to untangle the damage caused by Monday's worrying blackout. Spain's transportation minister said medium and long-distance trains won't resume service until at least Tuesday, and the impact of a huge backlog in flights could stretch throughout the week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colin Carroll, the deputy defense secretary's former chief of staff who was fired weeks ago, characterized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as being unpredictable in meetings and switching between well-mannered and “agitated.” Carroll was fired along with senior Hegseth adviser Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick due to allegations that the trio leaked information to the media. On Saturday, he sat down with Megyn Kelly for an interview about the secretary. He then recalled Hegseth's allegedly different behavior in internal meetings, saying he would raise his voice, focus on “weird details,” and become “very agitated.” Some of the fixation on small stories has become public, such as when Hegseth's team faced backlash last week over alleged changes to the green room, with CBS News reporting that Hegseth ordered the space to be retrofitted into a “makeup studio” for television appearances. Despite other major stories happening that day, including news that Hegseth shared details of a military operation in another private chat featuring his wife, as well as a campaign in Yemen, his team continued to post about the makeup studio all afternoon. “So it's like a tale of two Petes,” Carroll told Kelly. Carroll's interview with Kelly comes days after reports were published about officials close to Hegseth calling the defense secretary's behavior “erratic” and saying that he yells at staff, according to NBC News. The officials also shared that Hegseth has become more “insecure” about the status of his job after recent controversies, though President Donald Trump has repeatedly backed Hegseth. Caldwell, another fired official, appeared on Tucker Carlson's show, on which he denied claims that he leaked sensitive information to the press and blamed his firing on his disagreement with Hegseth over the handling of Iran.</p>

Gerry Connolly (D-VA) will not seek reelection in 2026 and will step down from his position as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee due to a recurrence of cancer. Connolly, 75, announced in November last year that he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. He said in a statement after “grueling treatments” that the cancer has returned. “The sun is setting on my time in public service, and this will be my last term in Congress,” Connolly said Monday. “I will be stepping back as Ranking Member of the Oversight Committee soon. With no rancor and a full heart, I move into this final chapter full of pride in what we've accomplished together over 30 years.” Connolly defeated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in December last year for the ranking membership. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, had been one of several younger Democrats seeking a generational shift in leadership following losses in the 2024 election. The Washington Examiner reached out to Ocasio-Cortez for comment. He won reelection in 2024 with 66.7% of the vote.</p>

While Heather Graham feels confident in the choices she's made over the last 55 years of her life, she often wonders what life would've been like had she taken a different path. In a new interview, the "Austin Powers" star opens up about her conscious decision not to have children and admitted that she sometimes questions her choice. Heather Graham said she sometimes questions her decision not to have children. (Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images for The Mediterrane Film Festival) "I do think it's awesome now that more women are expressing their desire to not have kids," the actress and director added. "Again, she says, it is almost people pleasing on a big scale. The culture says: ‘You need to have kids.' This isn't the first time Graham has expressed her feelings about not pursuing parenthood. "I think we all have different paths," she told People magazine in 2023. But at the moment, not having kids, I do feel free. And I get a lot of sleep. "I do feel like, as a woman, culturally, you're not allowed to say, 'I didn't want to have kids.' Because it's like, 'What's wrong with you?'" "I think as a man it's like, 'Oh yeah, cool, you didn't want to have kids.' Now, women are getting more free to just make their own choices." These days, Graham – whose new movie "Chosen Family" premiered last year – said she's learned the importance of dropping the "people-pleaser" label. and make myself happy," she told The Guardian. There were moments where I feel like I could have stood up for myself more," she said. Graham, who has been estranged from her family for 30 years, said cutting ties with her parents and sister was a "huge relief." Graham hasn't spoken to her parents in over 30 years. "It didn't feel like a healthy dynamic. I stopped talking to them and, I have to say, that was a huge relief," she told the outlet. "I felt like, at that moment, my life opened up with a freedom. I didn't need to please them." "Sort of like a detective, I went through my past and looked at how I developed certain ways of thinking that weren't the healthiest, and basically just went on a journey to be happier." "Before, I was more: ‘What do other people think?'" Christina Dugan Ramirez is an entertainment writer for Fox News Digital.

Princeton senior Danielle Shapiro joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss how anti-Israel protesters disrupted a campus lecture by a former Israeli prime minister, shouting anti-Semitic chants and targeting students. EXCLUSIVE – Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called on his alma mater, Princeton University, to dismiss a former high-level Iranian regime official because he is allegedly making students feel unsafe amid recent outbreaks of antisemitism at the New Jersey university. The ex-official for the Islamic Republic of Iran, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, who is a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at the university, is under pressure on many fronts from congressional representatives, Princeton students and experts on antisemitism. His presence at Princeton makes students feel justifiably afraid for their safety. Princeton's decision to keep employing him shows they care less about their students, and more about providing a platform for pro-regime and anti-American propaganda. That kind of reckless institutional ideological bias is exactly why the Trump administration is reassessing federal funding for Princeton," Cruz told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement. Fox News Digital previously reported that Mousavian expressed support for the U.S.-designated terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, and appeared to pay tribute to the global Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani in 2020 when he attended his funeral. Mousavian has declined to renounce his support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran's fatwa (religious decree) to assassinate the British-American writer Salman Rushdie. The Iran-backed Hezbollah was responsible for a 1983 bombing that murdered 241 U.S. military members in Beirut. Maximillian Meyer, president of Princeton Tigers for Israel, and an undergraduate at the university, told Fox News Digital, "I commend Sen. Cruz for raising urgent concerns about Princeton's employment of Mousavian, whose career has been defined by shilling for the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Credible reports linking Mousavian to the oversight of Iranian dissident assassinations in Europe – alongside his endorsement of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie – are deeply alarming." Seyed Hossein Mousavian, , who was then head of the Iranian delegation, speaks to journalists at the International Atomic Energy Agency, Nov. 29, 2004 in Vienna. Mousavian is presently a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at Princeton. However, the former Iranian ambassador previously told Fox News Digital that "This accusation is a big lie," and "The 398-page verdict is published, and everyone can have access to it. The Berlin court verdict does not contain any direct or indirect allegations against me. Yet, Iranian dissidents and human rights experts uncovered testimony from Abolghasem Mesbahi, a former senior-level Iranian intelligence official, who told the Berlin court during the Mykonos trial, "Mousavian participated in most of the [Iranian regime's] crimes that took place in Europe." Mousavian did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries, WhatsApp messages and telephone calls for this article. Meyer, the Princeton undergraduate student, said, "Anyone who has served in senior roles for the repressive Islamic Republic of Iran poses a clear threat to American national security. His continued employment at Princeton is a damning indictment of the anti-Americanism festering within so-called ‘elite' institutions." Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber, who recently said he would defy Trump's efforts to stop antisemitism via federal funding cuts to the wealthy university, did not respond to Fox News Digital email press queries and telephone calls about Mousavian. Fox News Digital recently reported that pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian agitators stormed a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at Princeton, sparking criticism from Jewish students at Princeton. In a statement to Fox News Digital over the incident, Eisgruber said he was "appalled" at reports of antisemitic language used during Bennett's visit. Christopher Eisgruber, president of Princeton University, during an interview in New York, on Oct 11, 2023. It is unclear if Eisgruber suspended or expelled students who prevented Bennett from speaking. Mousavian has faced criticism for stoking antisemitism since Hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans. A Fox News Digital examination of Mousavian's X account shows a high number of Persian and English posts attacking the Jewish state, including comparing Israel with Nazi Germany. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the former chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, asked Eisgruber in a statement to Fox News Digital: Why does the university continue to protect Mousavian at a time of raging antisemitism and what is he still doing there? Anti-Israel protesters at Princeton disrupt a speech by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Cooper said on Eisgruber's watch "It is a shameful chapter that must end the right way." Cooper accused Eisgruber of "stoic silence or indifference to antisemitism" and "stonewalling" efforts to hold Mousavian accountable for his alleged crimes and antisemitism. Cooper continued that Eisgruber owes it to Jewish students and faculty, Iranian-Americans, and Iranian dissidents to answer basic questions about Mousavian. Eisgruber has not obstructed any law enforcement efforts to investigate Mousavian's alleged crimes. Cooper also called on Princeton and Mousavian to submit his Ph.D. for examination. Fox News Digital has learned that neither Princeton University nor the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, where Mousavian allegedly obtained his Ph.D. in 2002, were willing to produce a copy of his dissertation. Gary Hughes, a spokesman for the University of Kent, told Fox News Digital, "Data protection principle also means that neither myself nor any other colleague across the University can disclose personal data about this or any other current or former student." The FOI office denied a request and later said after Fox News Digital appealed that, "We are currently conducting an internal review in relation to your request." Kent University's Open Research team wrote in one email, "I am afraid we have no record of Mr. Seyed Hossein Mousavian's thesis in the library catalogue." Fox News Digital searches for Mousavian's Ph.D. in American, British and German academic databases showed no results. The Swedish-Iranian author Iraj Mesdaghi told Fox News Digital that he sought to obtain Mousavian's Ph.D. in 2013. Shirley M. Tilghman, the former president of Princeton University when Mousavian was hired in 2009, declined to answer a press query about whether she vetted Mousavian and his alleged Ph.D. Fox News Digital reporter Louis Casiano contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar says television networks reporting outside the White House should “blur” the faces of illegal immigrants showcased on lawn signs, which were placed on Sunday evening. The 100 lawn signs showcase mug shots of illegal immigrants who have been detained, along with the alleged crime listed below their photo, with an MSNBC anchor noting that the signs were set up “directly behind the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn.” In reacting to this predicament given to the press, Kumar argued “we don't know” if the illegal immigrants were given due process, and suggested the faces on these signs should be censored. “The press right now, we are absolutely under attack,” Kumar stated. “Our job is always to have our true north, to make sure that we're presenting balanced news, and making sure that we are not putting folks that are potentially in danger and having that representation of those pictures in the background, we can't allow that to basically for us to carry the water of potentially innocent people.” Kumar acknowledged that “live shots are tough” but still pressed for the faces on the illegal immigrant signs to be censored, concluding that “we know better.” “We will hunt you down,” the White House's X account wrote. Oh, and your mug shot may just end up on a yard sign at the White House.” You will be deported — and you will never set foot on American soil again.Oh, and your mugshot may just end up on a yard sign at the White House. As part of the White House's fight against illegal immigration within the United States, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer warned governors last week that they could lose their federal funds if they extend unemployment benefits to illegal immigrants. Earlier this month, the Social Security Administration undertook an effort to label illegal immigrants as dead, stripping them of Social Security benefits.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain and Portugal are racing the setting sun as they respond to a massive, unexplained power outage that knocked out traffic lights, caused chaos on roads and in airports, and threatened to plunge tens of millions of people into darkness on Monday. Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian Peninsula, and in parts of France, shortly after midday. It could be several hours until power is fully restored, Spain's grid operator said, meaning families and businesses around the country could be without energy come nightfall. The cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs were shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of around 60 million people, hastily arranged emergency meetings to co-ordinate a response. Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to clear the roads for emergency workers. Portugal's grid operator said restoring power was a “complex operation.” By Monday evening, both Portugal's and Spain's grid operators said the supply of energy was gradually being restored in pockets of both countries. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said authorities are still not sure what caused the power outage. Earlier, Antonio Costa – president of the European Council and Portugal's former prime minister – said although the cause of the outage is not clear, there are “no indications” of a cyberattack. “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process – the total reestablishment of the electrical supply – will take several hours, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red Eléctrica, Spain's national grid operator, told broadcaster La Sexta. “We could be talking about six to 10 hours, if everything goes well, until we reestablish supply to every last customer,” said Prieto, who was speaking in the early afternoon. Portugal's Prime Minister blamed his neighboring nation for the scenes. Luis Montenegro said his government did not yet know what caused the cut, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” that the problem started in Spain. Monday's blackout hit a huge and busy swathe of southern Europe. Two of the five busiest airports in the European Union in 2023 were Madrid's and Barcelona's, according to EU data. For a few hours, modern routines were suspended: cash replaced card payments, police officers used arm signals to direct traffic, and restaurants, supermarkets and stores closed their doors. Spain's nuclear sites were declared operational and safe, while Portugal's National Institute for Medical Emergencies said it had “activated its contingency plan,” running its telephone and IT systems through a back-up generator. Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there. Flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in lines, with no air conditioning or running water. Shops were only accepting cash, she told CNN. And darkness suddenly descended in subway tunnels; video posted on social media showed blackened subway cars stuck in standstill on platforms in Madrid, where the metro was suspended and entrances to stations were taped off. Some parts of southern France, near the Spanish border, felt a more sporadic impact. Emilie Grandidie, a spokeswoman for France's electricity transmission operator RTE, told CNN there was “a small power cut” in the French Basque Country; “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” she said. For several hours on Monday, tens of millions of people were asking each other when power would return, and why it was knocked out in the first place. But once power returns, it could still take days to untangle the damage caused by Monday's worrying blackout. Spain's transportation minister said medium and long-distance trains won't resume service until at least Tuesday, and the impact of a huge backlog in flights could stretch throughout the week. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Jack Guy, Kara Fox and Saskya Vandoorne contributed reporting</p>

Philadelphia GM Howie Roseman said that giving Saquon Barkley an extension was a part of their "culture of rewarding players who do unbelievable things." Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley slammed those who criticized him for hanging out with President Donald Trump ahead of the team's visit to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win. Barkley was spotted at Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, and then flew back to Washington on Air Force One with the president. President Donald Trump walks with Philadelphia Eagles' Saquon Barkley before boarding Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport, Sunday, April 27, 2025, in New Jersey. "lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT," Barkley tweeted on Monday. "Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day." Barkley is going to be among the Eagles players and personnel who will celebrate their Super Bowl title win at the White House later Monday. President Donald Trump with his grandson, Theodore Kushner, fourth from left, talks to Philadelphia Eagles football player Saquon Barkley, left, and other guests as he arrives at the White House, Sunday, April 27, 2025. A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital in early March that an invitation from the president had been sent and that the team had "enthusiastically accepted." During that time, Trump rescinded the invitation to host the Eagles after several players said they would not participate in the visit because of his previous criticisms of national anthem protests. Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is interviewed after defeating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX at Caesars Superdome. But this month, Eagles team owner Jeffrey Lurie called it "a time-honored tradition" that the team was looking forward to. Fox News' Paulina Dedaj contributed to this report.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The president's economic policy has put unions in an awkward position. Yet Trump has received support from a seemingly unlikely source: Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, who staunchly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and previously called Trump a “scab.” A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad. ”We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,” Fain said when Trump announced tariffs on foreign-made cars late last month. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country's largest labor unions, also endorsed Trump's policy, going so far as to support not just specific levies but across-the-board tariffs. But that doesn't mean all unions or their members are enthused. Other leaders and rank-and-file members have criticized the president's blanket approach to import tax. And Liz Shuler, the president of AFL-CIO, a federation of unions in the United States, issued a statement criticizing Trump's overall policy. “We support use of some tariffs on automotive manufacturing and similar industries. We do not support tariffs for political games about immigration or fentanyl,” he said in an address to UAW members after Trump announced his full tariff plan earlier this month. “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.” For decades, unions, particularly those representing manufacturing workers, have argued against free-trade agreements and in favor of more protectionist policies, including tariffs, which they believe will help save American jobs in their industries. So where does this leave the long-standing union talking point that tariffs would be good for American workers? Manufacturing jobs in the United States have been declining for decades, and free trade — where countries can export and import goods without restrictions — is often said to be the culprit. Trump's tariffs might be “chaotic,” as Fain told NPR earlier this month. “But, you know, we've sat here for the last 30-plus years, with the inception of NAFTA back in 1993–‘94, and watched our manufacturing base in this country disappear.” NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the US, Canada, and Mexico. That outcome is why unions opposed NAFTA from the start. Estimates vary on how many jobs have actually been lost. About 700,000 positions were eliminated directly as a result of NAFTA, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and many more as a result of other trade agreements. You can see the manufacturing industry's decline reflected in union membership. As a result, unions see NAFTA and other free trade agreements as a roadblock to higher wages and long-term job security, which is why they have often advocated for more protectionist policies. In the post-NAFTA era, the prevailing consensus among economists is that free trade has enjoyed broad political support from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington, while free trade might hurt some industries, its benefits outweigh the costs. Overall, free trade is still largely viewed as a driver of global economic growth. As workers' wages and job prospects struggled, evidence of the downsides of trade liberalization — particularly the widening pay gaps between workers and bosses — was hard to ignore, even by some free trade proponents. “The combination of changing patterns of trade, in which more activity takes place with low-wage economies, and new research has altered economic thinking on trade,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote in 2015. “The consensus view now is that trade and globalization have meaningfully increased inequality in the United States by allowing more earning opportunities for those at the top and exposing ordinary workers to more competition, especially in manufacturing.” When President Barack Obama rallied to get support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement between countries in the Pacific Rim — in 2015, he faced fierce opposition from unions but also skepticism from politicians, some of whom had long railed against free trade and others who changed their minds. Trump famously opposed the policy, as did Sen. Bernie Sanders during their 2016 presidential campaigns. And Hillary Clinton, who initially praised the proposed accord, came out against it during that election season. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated to replace NAFTA during his first term, received union support because it included better labor protections than its predecessor. But in general, union opposition to unfettered free trade has continued. “Even though in [Fain's] heart of hearts he realizes that Trump has rolled these [tariffs] out in a — pick your adjective — disjointed, sloppy, incoherent manner, he believes that a lot more needs to be done to protect and preserve manufacturing in the US,” said Steven Greenhouse, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. “He rightly says that free trade has been very bad for manufacturing in the US. And in Fain's mind, an effective way to rebuild manufacturing is through tariffs.” Tariffs can indeed be part of a solution to bolster manufacturing industries in the United States, as long as they're implemented strategically and coupled with a more coherent vision for boosting American industry, which would include subsidies and investments aimed at spurring growth in certain sectors. But Trump's policy is too broad, inconsistent, and lacking in clear objectives. So while some unions and their members might support the idea of tariffs to help shore up certain industries, it's not clear that Trump's policy will get Republicans more union support in the long run, especially if the forecasts about how Trump's tariffs would impact the economy turn out to be true. And at the end of the day, it's difficult to see how Trump's blanket tariff policy will, on its own, revive American manufacturing. As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, the American economy has changed, transitioning from manufacturing to services, and the idea that we can reverse that trend is a “false promise.” “It's really hard to get back those millions of manufacturing jobs.” This story was featured in the Within Our Means newsletter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drummond, a declared candidate for governor, is seeking to block the creation of the nation's first taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school when justices hear oral arguments on April 30. One of his most discussed talking points opposing the school rests on a slippery slope argument, claiming that if the state allows a Catholic charter school to open, it would be forced to fund “Sharia law or even Satanism.” Kevin Stitt (R-OK) has maintained a friendly posture toward religious freedom in the state. But religious freedom experts who are critical of Drummond's approach say it reeks of fearmongering and hypocrisy, pointing out that Catholic organizations already receive public funds in Oklahoma for hospitals, foster care, and other services. … Charter schools are schools of choice,” said Nicole Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School whose research focuses on education law and religious liberty. Earlier this month, Stitt, who is unable to seek reelection after his second term ends next year, issued an executive order directing state agencies to “root out” laws and regulations that exclude religious individuals or institutions from public programs, funds, and benefits. Drummond's opposition also puts him sharply at odds with Republican senators such as Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and James Lankford (R-OK) — powerful figures whose endorsements he would likely court in his gubernatorial bid. All three joined a Senate amicus brief urging the court to side against Drummond, arguing that excluding religious organizations from public charter school eligibility “would set a dangerous precedent.” Drummond's posture in the case has raised eyebrows in GOP circles, not just for its substance but also its timing as he makes his bid for higher office. Just three weeks ago, Drummond posted a photo at the White House on April 8 after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House. Religious charter schools have become a top priority for Republicans nationwide, fueled by court victories for religious freedom activists that have chipped away at 20th-century court interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause and free exercise clause. One area of great consistency among the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority has been cases involving conflicts to the free exercise of religious freedoms. Thomas Fisher, executive vice president and litigation director for EdChoice, told the Washington Examiner he believes one of St. Isidore and the charter school board's main legal pitches is that “this case is materially indistinguishable from Carson.” “A decision suggesting that states can transform private actors into governmental ones by slapping the label ‘public' on them would also threaten the autonomy and religious liberty of private organizations that receive government funds to advance a range of public goals, including poverty alleviation, social services, healthcare and many others,” Garnett wrote for the Wall Street Journal. When asked whether Fisher had any concerns about possible applications for extremists, such as Drummond's concerns, he noted there would still be a high bar to obtain a religious charter that would likely deter any of his hypothetical dilemmas concerning satanic schools. “States have very rigorous requirements, and they can still have all those rigorous requirements and quality controls and insistence on demonstrations of the ability to deliver quality education, and somebody who's just trying to pull a stunt with some offensive sounding scary type of charter school is not going to have the resources for that sort of thing,” Fisher added. More than 50 elected officials, scholars, and advocacy groups have backed the school's creation. In a joint statement organized by Stitt, they argue that denying a religious charter school is itself discriminatory and violates the free exercise clause. Drummond's stance is so unusual for the Trump era of conservatism that he also finds himself aligned with progressive groups, such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which also filed suit against the school. Oklahoma's top education official since 2023, Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, defended against Drummond's efforts to stymie his own work reinterpreting the state's role in public education. Walters's work has focused primarily on addressing the state's historically troublesome quality in public education, defending rights to present Christian values in schools, and implementing Trump's education agenda on the state level. While Walters has not made any declaration for a governorship, he has long been rumored to announce a run, which would raise the stakes of this court hearing as the justices determine which side has correctly interpreted the law. Oklahomans “understand that the Bible, Christian father, play a major role in American history and they think America should go back to protecting their communities, to go back to not running Christians out of education, out of our schools,” Walters said, noting he believes “you're seeing an AG out of step with conservatives and Oklahomans.” But that line is one that advocates of recent shifts in religious freedom interpretations at the high court say has long been used as an exclusionary device against people of all religious backgrounds.
