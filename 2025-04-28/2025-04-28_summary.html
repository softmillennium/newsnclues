Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons if faced with 'unfriendly actions,' Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu claimed in an interview with TASS state news agency on April 24.

Shoigu said Moscow was "closely monitoring" the "military preparations" of European countries, as they seek to ramp up defense spending and production in the face of the U.S. reducing its military presence on the continent. 

"In case foreign states commit unfriendly actions that threaten the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, our country considers it legitimate to take symmetrical and asymmetrical measures necessary to suppress such actions and prevent their recurrence," he said.

"Nuclear deterrence is carried out against states and military coalitions that regard Russia as a potential adversary, possess weapons of mass destruction, or have significant combat capabilities of general-purpose forces," he added.

Shoigu also said that any European future peacekeeping forces deployed to Ukraine to monitor a ceasefire would also be seen by the Kremlin as a provocation. 

"Sensible politicians in Europe understand that the implementation of such a scenario could lead to a direct clash between NATO and Russia and subsequently to World War III," he said. 

In November 2024, Russia updated its official nuclear deterrence policy. According to the changes, the Kremlin reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in response to aggression against itself or its closest ally, Belarus, even if the attack involves non-nuclear weapons.

Russia has repeatedly made nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The threats have failed to materialize, and Russia continues to wage its all-out war without using its nuclear arsenal.

The statement came as U.S. Vice President JD Vance repeated warnings that the U.S. might drop its peace efforts if both sides refuse to accept a "very explicit proposal," which includes recognizing temporarily occupied territories as Russian.

Ukraine agreed to relinquish its nuclear arms after signing the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which also saw the country join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

In exchange, Kyiv received security assurances from major powers, including the U.S., the U.K., and Russia. These guarantees failed to prevent Moscow's aggression in 2014 in Crimea and Donbas and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Budapest Memorandum has been sharply criticized by today's Ukrainian leadership over its lack of strong security guarantees.

Revealed: Sources say bosses at R&A, which organises the annual golf tournament, were quizzed about 2028 event

Senior Whitehall officials have asked golf bosses whether they can host the 2028 Open championship at Donald Trump's Turnberry course after repeated requests from the US president, sources have said.

Officials had asked senior people at the R&A, which organises the world's oldest major golf championship, what the hurdles would be to hosting the 2028 Open at Turnberry.

One source described the talks as direct lobbying from the government, although others said officials had asked about hypothetical problems with the idea, rather than insisting that it happen.

One person with knowledge of the discussions said: “The government is doing everything it can to get close to Trump. One concrete thing is that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have been involved in pushing for the Open to return to Trump-owned Turnberry.”

Both the DCMS and Trump Turnberry declined to comment.

Two other people briefed on conversations between the US president and Keir Starmer said Trump had asked the prime minister multiple times about hosting the Open at Turnberry, which the Trump Organization has owned since 2014.

Trump has previously lobbied publicly to host the Open at the Ayrshire course, saying in 2023: “Everybody wants to see the Open championship here.”

King Charles acknowledged the course's importance to Trump when he wrote to him offering a visit to one of his Scottish estates should the president already be in the country visiting Turnberry.

Hosting the Open could provide a welcome financial boost for SLC Turnberry, the course's operating company, which is run by the president's sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. Last year the company lost £1.7m, having made £571,000 in the previous year – its only profit in 10 years.

The R&A has a list of nine or 10 historic courses it would consider for hosting the Open, including famous venues such as St Andrews and Royal Birkdale. Turnberry is on that list, having hosted the championship in 2009. However golf experts point out that the event has grown substantially since then. While the 2009 Open attracted 123,000 people, the event at Royal Troon last year was attended by over 250,000.

The R&A previously said it would not host the tournament at Turnberry in the wake of the January 6 attack by Trump supporters on the Capitol in 2021. Last November, the then head of the organisation, said he did not want “media noise” detracting from the game.

Since then however the R&A has changed leadership. And in an apparent shift of position Mark Darbon, the new chief executive, said last week he would like to see the championship return to Turnberry “at some point”.

Those briefed on the discussions between government officials and the R&A say they have mainly focused on the logistical challenges to hosting the Open at Turnberry. They said the main problems would be getting the sheer number of spectators in and out of the site by road, rail and air, given Turnberry is a two-and-a-half hour train trip from Glasgow, or a one-hour drive along a single A-road.

Darbon said last week: “At Turnberry, there are definitely some logistical and commercial challenges that we face around the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure. We're doing some feasibility work around what it would look like to return to that venue and the investment that it would require.”

One minister told the Financial Times earlier this year the venue would need “tens, or hundreds, of millions of pounds of investment” to make it easier to reach and to provide enough high-quality hotel accommodation in the area.

A spokesperson for R&A said: “We regularly engage with government and local government regarding venues. We have explained the logistical challenges around Turnberry to the government and they are aware of the position.”

Host Scott Pelley explained that corporate influence on the show's editorial direction led to Bill Owens's resignation.

On Sunday evening, Scott Pelley, cohost of the CBS News program “60 Minutes,” gave a rare rebuke to the network's parent company, Paramount, over moves that prompted the resignation of the show's former executive producer, Bill Owens.

Ahead of a desired merger with Skydance Media, which is owned by billionaire David Ellison, Paramount has sought to limit the journalistic independence of “60 Minutes,” viewing its coverage as too critical of President Donald Trump. Any merger deal that Paramount makes with Skydance will have to be approved by the Trump administration. 

Paramount's moves to encroach upon the independence of “60 Minutes” ultimately led Owens to decide he could no longer work at the program. In a memo to staff last week, he wrote:

Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,' right for the audience…. Having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.

Staff were reportedly saddened over Owens's departure and the reason behind it. In the final minutes of “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Pelley paid tribute to Owens.

And now, a note on Bill Owens who, until this past week, was the executive producer of 60 Minutes. We'll be back next week with another edition of 60 Minutes.

Calling Owens's work a “quest to open minds, not close them,” Pelley highlighted how the former producer worked for the network for nearly four decades, spending a quarter of a century at “60 Minutes.” Pelley recognized that the program covered “controversial” stories, such as issues relating to the Trump administration and “the Israel-Gaza war,” which the network has sought to limit reporting on — particularly segments that are critical of Israel's genocidal military campaign against Palestinians.

Pelley defended past reports on those subjects, noting that Owens “made sure they were accurate and fair,” adding that “he was tough that way.”

Without directly rebuking Paramount, Pelley made it clear that the parent company was using its corporate influence to threaten the program's journalistic integrity.

“Our parent company is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways” as a result, Pelley explained to viewers. “None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”

Pelley added:

No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead “60 Minutes” all along.

As CBS News and other corporate news media have taken steps to limit their reporting on the Trump administration, independent media has become more important than ever in combating attacks on democracy and the rise of fascism, Truthout's board president and editor-at-large Maya Schenwar, editor-in-chief Negin Owliaei, and executive director Ziggy West Jeffery wrote in an op-ed earlier this year.

“As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations — either through need or greed — rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump's wishes even before his inauguration, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models,” the trio said.

We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply. And communities across the country are coming together to raise the alarm on ICE raids, inform neighbors of their civil rights, and protect each other in moving shows of solidarity.

It will be a long fight ahead. And as nonprofit movement media, Truthout plans to be there documenting and uplifting resistance.

Section is responsible for enforcing laws designed to prevent voter discrimination, raised alarm about voting rights enforcement

Donald Trump's appointees at the Department of Justice have removed all of the senior civil servants working as managers in the department's voting section and directed attorneys to dismiss all active cases, according to people familiar with the matter, part of a broader attack on the department's civil rights division.

The moves come less than a month after Trump ally Harmeet Dhillon was confirmed to lead the civil rights division, created in 1957 and referred to as the “crown jewel” of the justice department. In an unusual move, Dhillon sent out new “mission statements” to the department's sections that made it clear the civil rights division was shifting its focus from protecting the civil rights of marginalized people to supporting Trump's priorities.

Tamar Hagler, the chief of the voting section, which is responsible for enforcing federal laws designed to prevent voter discrimination, and five top career managers were all reassigned last week to the complaint adjudication office, a little-known part of the department that handles employee complaints, according to people familiar with the matter. A career line attorney in the section has also been reassigned to the complaint adjudication office.

The voting section had seven managers in January overseeing around 30 attorneys. Of the two other managers, one retired and another was detailed to work on an antisemitism task force.

Political appointees have also instructed career employees to dismiss all of their active cases without meeting with them and offering a rationale – a significant break with the department's practices and norms.

The justice department did not return a request for comment.

Taken together, the changes have raised significant alarm about what the future of voting rights enforcement will look like for the federal government at a moment when states continue to pass restrictive voting measures.

It also raises concern about future political interference. The justice department's civil rights division has long had resources and a credibility that private plaintiffs can't match. And much of that reputation is driven by the fact that the day-to-day work is carried out by non-political, career staff, whose work is supposed to be apolitical.

“The career managers established norms and standards and made sure that the section spoke consistently, over time, with one voice,” said a former justice department employee. “That is destroyed by gutting all the career managers.”

The voting section dismissed its last active case on Monday – a challenge under the Voting Rights Act to how the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, elects its city council. In March, it also dismissed a similar case in Houston county, Georgia. (The department technically has one voting case that is still active, but a judge paused the case this week).

The changes are part of a larger wave of about a dozen reassignments of senior personnel in the civil rights division this week. Several other components of the division, including the special litigation section, have also been hit with significant losses in personnel. The moves came a week ahead of a 28 April deadline for employees to decide whether to accept a deferred resignation offer.

Reassigning the most experienced managers to low-level duties appears to be an overt push to crush morale, make it clear management is not going to bring civil rights enforcement cases, and get lawyers to accept the offer to leave the department, department veterans say. Many of the division's lawyers are expected to accept the offer.

“This is what you do when you don't really know what the section does and just want to create chaos in the simplest way possible that doesn't involve you reading anything,” said one former voting section attorney. “It is extremely clear that the intent is to get absolutely nothing done. And the effect will be that absolutely nothing gets done.”

Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his effort to try and overturn the 2020 election, has called for mass firings in the civil rights division. “Every lawyer in the Voting Section and likely in the Civil Rights Division needs to be terminated. They are not supportive of Pres Trump or MAGA. There has to be a reckoning. These are leftwing activists who have come from and should return to their leftwing organizations,” she wrote in a post on X shortly after the election.

The American Accountability Foundation, a dark money group that created a “DEI watch list” of federal employees, also sent a letter to the attorney general, Pam Bondi, last year urging her to fire certain lawyers in the voting section.

Removing the career managers is hugely consequential in the justice department. In addition to having decades of experience, they act as a buffer between the political attorneys in a section's front office and the apolitical career line attorneys. They review investigations and justification memos arguing for bringing cases or not, and present them to the political appointees.

They also handle hiring. While there's currently a hiring freeze, removing the career managers could pave the way for politicized hiring and a “partisan and ideological capture” of an agency that is supposed to be non-partisan, a former department employee said.

“Demolishing the line between career and political employees is very possible, because the people who run the hiring process are normally the career managers, but if you replace all the career managers and then have new political people they could staff up very differently,” the former department employee said.

Since the start of the Trump administration, the justice department has dismissed big cases challenging a sweeping voting law in Georgia and a major case challenging electoral districts drawn in Texas. It has also dismissed cases in Virginia and Alabama that sought to stop the states from being too aggressive in removing people from their voter rolls.

Before the Texas redistricting case was dismissed, there was a perfunctory meeting between political appointees and career staff in which political appointees had not bothered to read materials in advance, according to the former department employee. They have refused meetings to discuss dismissals since, the person said, and political appointees have not even bothered to learn the names of career attorneys.

“Even if you don't think that some claims should have been brought, it's not plausible that every case in the hopper is unmerited, by any interpretation of the rules,” said Justin Levitt, a former top official in the civil rights division during the Obama administration. “An instruction to drop a case without an explanation of why is just a decision to refuse to enforce the law.”

“Dropping those cases without explanation is simply arbitrary – and ‘arbitrary' is exactly what you don't want from the country's lead agency of law enforcement,” he added.

In some cases, justice department leadership has publicly antagonized the work of career personnel. On 31 March, Bondi issued a press release announcing she had ordered the department to dismiss its challenge to the Georgia voting law, saying the Biden administration had “fabricated a narrative”. Chad Mizelle, the department's chief of staff, called the suit a “disgrace”.

People familiar with the voting section emphasized that the administration's approach is significantly different from the way the section was run during the first Trump term. Even though the voting section's work slowed considerably during Trump's first term, and it switched positions in some major cases, there was a general respect and collegiality for the career employees. Eric Dreiband, who led the civil rights division from 2018 to 2021, resigned after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.

Democratic governor of Illinois declares Republicans ‘cannot know a moment of peace' in New Hampshire speech

Illinois's Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, scorched Donald Trump's administration on Sunday night, calling for “mass protests” and declaring that Republicans “cannot know a moment of peace” during a fiery speech in New Hampshire that immediately sparked presidential speculation.

“It's time to fight everywhere and all at once,” Pritzker said to a ballroom filled with Democratic activists, officials and donors. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now.”

The billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune addressed more than 800 people at the New Hampshire Democratic party's annual McIntyre-Shaheen dinner – a state traditionally crucial to the early cycle of presidential primaries and a launching pad for anyone with White House ambitions.

“These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” Pritzker said. “They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have.”

Pritzker's appearance marked the first major foray by a potential 2028 presidential contender into an early primary state, though Pritzker insisted he remains focused on 2026 midterm elections.

Unlike some other Democratic governors who have adopted more piecemeal approaches toward Trump, Pritzker is now positioning himself as the standard-bearer for unflinching opposition, calling out both the president and fellow Democrats who advise moderation.

Many Democratic activists appear to align more with the Pritzker approach, as more than 1,000 protests across the US and Europe hit the streets at the beginning of the month specifically focused on calling out Trump. Protesters have been estimated to number in the tens of thousands in Washington alone.

Trump is now also sitting through cratering polls ahead of his 100 days in office benchmark tomorrow – the lowest approval rating for a new president in that time period over the last 80 years.

“Fellow Democrats, for far too long we've been guilty of listening to a bunch of do-nothing political types who would tell us that America's house is not on fire, even as the flames are licking their faces,” he said. “We need to knock off the rust of poll-tested language, decades of stale decorum.”

The Illinois governor saved his sharpest attacks for Trump's cabinet, describing the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, as “a weird nepo baby who once stashed a dead bear in the back seat of his car” and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, as “a washed-up Fox TV commentator”.

“Stop thinking we can reason or negotiate with a madman,” Pritzker told the crowd, adding that Republicans enabling Trump should “feel in their bones that when we survive this shameful episode of American history” their portraits will be relegated “to the museum halls reserved for tyrants and traitors”.

Pritzker's confrontational stance contrasts with potential rivals like the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and the Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, who have advocated for bipartisan collaboration with Trump while representing pivotal swing states. Whitmer was photographed in the White House earlier this month, at one point hiding her face from the cameras.

His speech also comes as Democrats nationwide search for new leadership after Kamala Harris's defeat in November, as it is still not clear if Harris will run again. Anne Caprara, Pritzker's longtime chief of staff, told the New York Times that his approach stems from family history – his ancestors fled pogroms in Ukraine.

“What we're seeing right now is 1930s Germany,” Caprara said. “The only way to actually stop that from happening is to be very loud and vocal about the pushback.”

The proposal comes as the Trump administration pursues a $1 trillion military budget for the next fiscal year.

Congressional Republicans on Sunday released legislation that would pump an additional $150 billion into the Pentagon — a morass of waste and profiteering — over the next decade as part of a sweeping reconciliation package that's also expected to include deep cuts to Medicaid and tax breaks for the wealthy.

The House Armed Services Committee, a major target of weapons industry lobbying, unveiled the plan for what it called “a historic investment of $150 billion to restore America's military capabilities and strengthen our national defense.” The panel said the legislation was developed “in close conjunction” with Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump, who is separately pursuing a $1 trillion U.S. military budget for the next fiscal year.

The legislation would direct the new Pentagon funding toward a number of initiatives backed by the president, including a “Golden Dome” missile defense system that experts have called a massive boondoggle that could benefit Elon Musk.

The bill, which is scheduled for a committee markup on Tuesday, also includes $4.5 billion to speed production of the B-21 stealth bomber, a Northrop Grumman-made aircraft capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

William Hartung, a senior research fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, said Sunday that the GOP's proposed Pentagon spending increase is “a glaring example of misplaced priorities.”

“This is no time to throw more money at a weapons manufacturing base that is already maxed out,” said Hartung. “Any additional money pumped into this system is likely to be wasted. The only beneficiaries will be weapons contractors, who will be glad to accept the new funds whether they can use them effectively or not.”

“Given that the Pentagon and its contractor network are having a hard time spending existing funds well,” Hartung added, “Congress should think twice before sending more taxpayer money their way.”

The Republican push for additional Pentagon funding comes as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing calls to resign for sharing plans for a U.S. military attack on Yemen in at least two private group chats.

Earlier this month, as Common Dreams reported, Hegseth endorsed Trump's push for a $1 trillion U.S. military budget, which would mark the highest level of spending since the Second World War.



We've borne witness to a chaotic first few months in Trump's presidency.

Over the last months, each executive order has delivered shock and bewilderment — a core part of a strategy to make the right-wing turn feel inevitable and overwhelming. But, as organizer Sandra Avalos implored us to remember in Truthout last November, “Together, we are more powerful than Trump.”

Indeed, the Trump administration is pushing through executive orders, but — as we've reported at Truthout — many are in legal limbo and face court challenges from unions and civil rights groups. Efforts to quash anti-racist teaching and DEI programs are stalled by education faculty, staff, and students refusing to comply.

Using fitness and sports as entry points into neo-Nazi ideologies, ‘youth club' chapters are proliferating across US

A national network of American neofascist fight clubs is endorsing youth-oriented offshoots aimed at grooming the next generation of racist activists.

So-called “active clubs” have proliferated across the US and are a combination of fitness and mixed martial arts groups that often espouse neo-Nazi and fascist ideologies, openly taking their historical cues from the Third Reich's obsession with machismo and European soccer hooliganism.

Active clubs have emerged as perhaps the most dangerous form of far-right political organizing today. With links to other militant organizations, including Patriot Front, they encourage a seemingly mainstream version of masculinity, layered with ideologies promoting a US race war and using the popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as a gateway to recruiting.

Earlier this month, their main Telegram account, endorsed “youth clubs”, which are chapters beginning to spring up online across the country, showing pictures of 18-year-olds and under engaging in mixed martial arts, racist meme-ing, and posts referencing genocidal and bigoted literature.

“Youth clubs are for those under 18 that still want to get active,” said the recent active club post with thousands of views, linking to the central account of all youth clubs.

By all appearances, these youth clubs are proliferating. On Telegram alone, there are accounts showing nationwide chapters with photos of teens between the ages of 16 to 18 in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, the New England states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Washington DC, lowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Michigan, among others.

The chapters have close to a thousand followers in total and in some cases list the same recruitment contact, suggesting a certain level of national coordination and vetting – an important aspect of far-right recruiting done to prevent against police or antifascist infiltration.

“Unapologetically Pro White”, posted one of the youth clubs, adding they were also “American Nationalist”.

Combined with the massive popularity among teen boys of the Tate brothers, mixed martial arts enthusiasts in their own right, young men and boys have emerged as the prime targets for far-right recruitment in recent years.

“The youth clubs are part of the same concept of active clubs' white supremacism ‘3.0' strategy: a decentralized movement focused on combat sports, fitness, propaganda activities, and building local groups,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst of the American far right who has documented its rise for nearly 10 years.

“The youth clubs are self-described white nationalist activist groups for young men 18 and younger who train in combat sports and participate in extreme right propaganda activities.”

Their direct links to active clubs aren't a secret or hidden, either.

Fisher-Birch continued: “Several youth club Telegram channels have also shared posts from active club-affiliated accounts. Additionally, youth club chapter logos are modeled on active club symbols. The logos are nearly identical in some cases.”

The network of active clubs' original founder, Robert Rundo, pleaded guilty in 2024 to conspiracy to riot at 2017 political rallies in California. During that period, he was the leader of the Rise Above Movement, a violent neo-Nazi gang that promoted combat sports and physical assault of perceived enemies. Four of its members were charged for their part in the infamous 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Rundo and other members of the active clubs network made it clear in the past that they saw young men and boys as the next and important frontier for building the new American fascist movement.

Writing in a 2022 post on one of its main websites Rundo and others described how their “tools of persuasion” can draw underage boys to join them. Along with flyers and stickers of local areas with their Nazi propaganda they told followers to “target boxing and MMA tournaments, gyms, and motocross courses”, but then went further.

“Ground-level intelligence collection might then inform that same activist crew that changing demographics at a local high school have led to gang-beatings of minority White youth,” they said. “The cunning and resourceful activists see this news as [an] opportunity for a campaign focusing on the importance of a Brotherhood of young White men having each other's backs.”

During the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler made it a staple of his regime to create the Hitler Youth organization for minors to learn combat and survivalism skills under the guise of self-improvement and nationalist pride. Ever since, modern neofascists and Nazis like active clubs, have always placed particular emphasis on securing the next generation of white supremacy.

“You will grow up to be men,” Hitler once said at one of his German rallies for his young acolytes.

Ukraine seized a foreign vessel allegedly involved in transporting stolen Ukrainian grain from Russian-occupied territories, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said on April 25.

Russia had looted millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from occupied territories, with at least 180,000 tons stolen through Mariupol alone, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Oct. 8, 2024.

According to the SBU statement, the ship, allegedly part of Russia's so-called "shadow fleet," was detained in Ukraine's internal Black Sea waters. 

Investigators said the vessel had loaded around 5,000 tons of stolen Ukrainian wheat from the Russian-occupied port city of Sevastopol in late 2024 and attempted to disguise its operations by sailing under the flag of an Asian country.

During the search, authorities discovered documents, navigation equipment, and other evidence allegedly confirming the ship's role in smuggling Ukrainian agricultural products, the SBU said.

The ship and its crew have been detained, and an investigation is underway to identify all parties involved, according to the statement.

The operation was carried out by the SBU in cooperation with Ukraine's Navy and maritime border units, under the supervision of the Prosecutor's Office for Crimea and Sevastopol.

Russia's theft of Ukrainian grain and repeated attacks on agricultural infrastructure have caused severe damage to Ukraine's farming industry, once among the world's top wheat producers. The situation worsened after Moscow withdrew from the Black Sea grain deal in July 2023, although Ukraine later established a new maritime trade corridor.

Evidence collected by human rights investigators also suggests that the Kremlin planned to weaponize food supplies and disrupt Ukraine's agricultural output months before launching the full-scale invasion.

Despite the losses, Ukraine managed to export nearly 100 million tons of goods from January to September 2024.

Russia insists on the international recognition of its hold over Crimea, as well as the entirety of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson oblasts, as a condition for peace negotiations, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Brazilian news outlet O Globo published on April 28.

This demand, reinforced last week by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, underscores how Russia continues to push its maximalist demands despite the U.S. efforts to broker a peace deal.

Russia illegally declared the four Ukrainian oblasts as annexed in 2022 following widely condemned sham referenda, but it does not fully control the territories. Crimea, occupied by Russia since 2014, was also included in Moscow's territorial claims.

The U.S. is reportedly considering a de jure recognition of Russia's control over Crimea as part of a potential peace deal and de facto control over other occupied territories. At the same time, U.S. officials are said to have rejected a demand for Ukraine's complete withdrawal from the other four regions.

Asked about Russia's conditions to enter peace talks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also named a ban on Ukraine's entry into NATO, the country's demilitarization, and changes to Ukraine's legislation that would restore the position of the Russian language, culture, and religious organizations.

These conditions are effectively the same as the initial demands raised by Moscow at the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Lavrov also said that Ukraine's ban on direct negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin must be lifted. Previously, the Kremlin said that Putin would be ready to enter talks with Kyiv without "any preconditions" once this restriction was removed, seemingly contradicting Lavrov's later statements.

Ukraine has ruled out ceding its territory as part of any peace agreement, and both Kyiv and its allies have rejected demands for a reduction of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. 

"All of Kyiv's commitments must be legally guaranteed, have enforcement mechanisms, and be permanent," Lavrov said, adding that Russia also demands the lifting of Western sanctions, the abolition of international lawsuits and arrest warrants against Russian officials, and the return of frozen Russian assets.

Western governments have already begun using money linked to those assets to support Ukraine. In October 2024, the Group of Seven (G7) approved nearly $50 billion in loans for Kyiv, to be repaid using interest earned on frozen Russian funds.

Additionally, Lavrov said Moscow would demand "reliable security guarantees" from NATO, the European Union, and their member states against supposed future threats on Russia's western borders.

Lavrov said Russia remains open to negotiations but claimed "the ball is not on our side," accusing Kyiv of lacking "political will for peace." He also said that the U.S. "has begun to better understand" Russia's positions, hinting at the foreign policy shift brought about by U.S. President Donald Trump.

It has been more than 45 days since Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire first introduced in March. Moscow rejected the plan, demanding a complete halt to Western military aid to Ukraine.

Despite claiming to support de-escalation, Russia has continued offensive operations along the front lines. Moscow has also intensified its attacks on civilian infrastructure, most recently killing 13 people in an attack on Kyiv on April 24.

Meanwhile, a separate partial ceasefire covering Ukraine's energy infrastructure, brokered during talks in Saudi Arabia in late March, has also been repeatedly violated.

According to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, Russia has breached the energy truce more than 30 times since it came into effect on March 25, targeting critical power infrastructure across the country.

The USMCA currently obliges Canada, the U.S. and Mexico to give one another three months' notice before starting free-trade talks with a 'non-market country.' U.S. President Donald Trump, right, and first lady Melania Trump arrive in Newark, N.J., on April 26.Evan Vucci/The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump will seek even more restrictions on Canada's ability to sign trade agreements with China when Washington and Ottawa start renegotiations on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, an international trade expert predicts.

David Collins, who specializes in international trade and investment law at City St. George's, University of London, says he expects the United States will seek to toughen up Article 32.10 in the next United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

This unusual feature of the USMCA obliges Canada, the United States and Mexico to give one another three months' notice before starting free-trade talks with a “non-market country.” The United States has refused to recognize China as a market economy even 23 years after the Asian country joined the World Trade Organization.

Prof. Collins said the United States and China are trying to force countries to pick sides in the Washington-Beijing trade war and the Trump administration can be expected to extend this to trade agreements.

“The China clause of the USMCA is going to be even stricter. That is going to be beefed up,” he said of a renegotiated deal.

Under the existing article, Canada or other partners must also disclose to other USMCA signatories “as much information as possible” on objectives for their negotiations with a country deemed to have a non-market economy. Washington argues the Chinese economy is too distorted by state subsidies to be considered a market economy. This U.S. policy makes it easier for American trade regulators to find Chinese companies guilty of dumping goods.

The article says USMCA signatories must give each other 30 days' notice before signing a deal with a non-market economy. Finally, Washington or other partners can withdraw from the trilateral North American pact within six months of one of them inking a deal with a non-market economy.

In March, China's ambassador to Canada told The Globe and Mail his country is open to negotiating a free-trade agreement with Ottawa and co-operating on a research station in the Arctic – extending an invitation to repair strained ties as Canada's relations with the United States worsen.

Prime Minister Mark Carney, running as Liberal Leader in Monday's federal election, announced last month that Mr. Trump had agreed to begin negotiations on a new economic and security relationship after the federal election with whoever is prime minster. Mr. Carney said his preference would be a renegotiation of the USMCA.

The United States, currently in a trade war with China, is conducting trade negotiations with allies such as Japan, South Korea and India as these countries seek to resolve tariff threats from Washington. The U.S. is looking for allies in its dispute over what it considers China's unfair trading practices, and is seeking to isolate Beijing. “Everyone is coming to the table, and basically, China, is surrounded,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News earlier this month.

China, separately, has been warning other countries it will retaliate against them if they align with the United States against Chinese interests.

“The U.S. and China are jockeying to bring countries in their sphere of influence by intimidating countries not to deal with the other party - so the world is cleaving down the middle,” Prof. Collins said.

Lawrence Herman, a Toronto-based international trade lawyer, said he expects Canadian negotiations with Mr. Trump's administration will be difficult. He said Ottawa cannot agree to any U.S. request to restrict Canada's future trading relationships with a third country.

“The U.S. is going to demand certain things from its trading partners, including Canada. They're going to put on the table what we could call a diktat: ‘Here's what we want, and we expect you to agree to it,'” Mr. Herman predicted.

“Frankly, any demand that we cannot negotiate trade agreements with any other country is unacceptable to Canada.”

NEW YORK, April 27. /TASS/. Sodium perchlorate used in solid rocket fuel could be the cause of an explosion at Iran's Shahid Rajaee port, The New York Times reported, citing a source in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC, the elite unit of Iran's armed forces).

However, the source did not specify what might have caused the substance to explode.

On Saturday morning, a powerful explosion occurred in Iran's Shahid Rajaee port on the Persian Gulf coast. According to the latest reports, at least eight people were killed and more than 750 injured. Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni arrived at the scene. The cause of the explosion has not yet been officially announced.

            Yemen's Houthi rebels on Monday alleged a US airstrike hit a prison holding African migrants, killing at least 68 people and wounding 47 others. The US military had no immediate comment.
    


            The strike in Yemen's Saada governorate, a stronghold for the Houthis, is the latest incident in the country's decadelong war to kill African migrants from Ethiopia and other nations who risk crossing the nation for a chance to work in neighboring Saudi Arabia.
    


            It also likely will renew questions from activists about the American campaign, known as “Operation Rough Rider,” which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.
    


            The US military's Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. The strikes have drawn controversy in America over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.
    


            “To preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,” Central Command said. “We are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we've done or what we will do.”
    


            It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press about the alleged strike in Saada.
    


            Graphic footage aired by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the site. The Houthi-run Interior Ministry said some 115 migrants had been detained at the site.
    


            The rebels' Civil Defense organization said at least 68 people had been killed and 47 others wounded in the attack.
    


            Footage from the site analyzed by the AP suggested some kind of explosion took place there, with its cement walls seemingly peppered by debris fragments and the wounds suffered by those there.
    


            A woman's voice, soft in the footage, can be heard repeating the start of a prayer in Arabic: “In the name of God.” An occasional gunshot rang out as medics sought to help those wounded.
    


            Ethiopians and other African migrants for years have landed in Yemen, braving the war-torn nation to try and reach Saudi Arabia for work. The Houthi rebels allegedly make tens of thousands of dollars a week smuggling migrants over the border.
    


            Migrants from Ethiopia have found themselves detained, abused and even killed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen during the war. An Oct. 3, 2022, letter to the kingdom from the U.N. said its investigators “received concerning allegations of cross-border artillery shelling and small arms fire allegedly by Saudi security forces, causing the deaths of up to 430 and injuring 650 migrants.”
    


            Saudi Arabia has denied killing migrants.
    


            Monday's alleged strike recalled a similar strike by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis back in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a United Nations report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the U.N. said. The Saudi-led coalition sought to justify the strike by saying the Houthis built and launched drones there, but the U.N. said it was known to be a detention facility.
    


            “The coalition should have avoided any attack on that facility,” the U.N. report added.
    


            That 2022 attack was one of the deadliest single attacks in the years long war between the coalition and the Houthi rebels and came after the Houthis struck inside the UAE twice with missiles and drones, killing three in a strike near Abu Dhabi's international airport.
    


            Meanwhile, US airstrikes overnight targeting Yemen's capital killed at least eight people, the Houthis said. The American military acknowledged carrying out over 800 individual strikes in their monthlong campaign.
    


            The overnight statement from Central Command also said “Operation Rough Rider” had “killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders,” including those associated with its missile and drone program. It did not identify any of those officials.
    


            “Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis,” the statement said. “The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime.”
    


            “We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,” it added.
    


            The US is targeting the Houthis because of the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are also the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.
    


            The US is conducting strikes on Yemen from its two aircraft carriers in the region — the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea and the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea.
    


            On April 18, an American strike on the Ras Isa fuel port killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others in the deadliest-known attack of the American campaign. Central Command on Monday offered an explanation for why it hit the port.

            “US strikes destroyed the ability of Ras Isa Port to accept fuel, which will begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities,” it said.
    


            Meanwhile, the Houthis have increasingly sought to control the flow of information from the territory they hold to the outside world. It issued a notice Sunday that all those holding Starlink satellite internet receivers should “quickly hand over” the devices to authorities.
    


            “A field campaign will be implemented in coordination with the security authorities to arrest anyone who sells, trades, uses, operates, installs or possesses these prohibited terminals,” the Houthis warned.
    


            Starlink terminals have been crucial for Ukraine in fighting Russia's full-scale invasion and receivers also have been smuggled into Iran amid unrest there.

The world is witnessing a new kind of global race—not for authority in space but for control over the global nuclear energy market. Nuclear power had long been considered risky owing to major accidents and budget overruns, hampering its large-scale adoption. But within the past decade, nuclear energy has been making a comeback thanks to the development of small modular reactors. China and Russia are seizing the lead, expanding their domestic capacities as well as exporting nuclear technology and constructing nuclear power plants across a variety of emerging economies.

Russia now leads the world in nuclear power plant construction. Its state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom, is constructing six new domestic reactors and is helping build 19 reactors in six foreign countries. Over the past ten years, meanwhile, China has inked contracts to help construct nine reactors in four countries while maintaining an unparalleled rate of expansion in its domestic nuclear industry. Both countries have been particularly quick to grasp the potential of small modular reactors, which typically can generate up to a third of the power produced by conventional nuclear plants. Compared with traditional large reactors, SMRs can be deployed quickly to areas that lack resilient electric-grid capacity, and their modular designs make them more affordable.

The need for affordable new power sources is growing as the world rapidly electrifies. Global electricity demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of around four percent over the next several years, and developing countries will account for an estimated 85 percent of that new demand. Among the major powers, China and Russia have been by far the most proactive in recognizing this need and responding to it with nuclear power exports. Both nations are actively targeting developing countries.

That effort, in turn, may well transform the global energy landscape and shift the balance of geopolitical power. The United States once dominated nuclear technology development. But since around the 1970s, it has ceded this leadership because of public opposition, rising costs, and regulatory challenges. Now, it is paying the price. The surging need for electricity to power AI, coupled with developing countries' desire for energy access, means that countries capable of exporting SMRs quickly and affordably will become increasingly influential partners to other nations. China and Russia are already leveraging their nuclear energy investments abroad to deepen their economic and political influence over the countries buying their technology.

To prevent authoritarian regimes from commanding the future nuclear energy market, the United States must continue updating its regulatory framework that governs reactor licensing and redirect federal investment toward its own SMR industry. It will also need to coordinate with democratic allies in Europe and Asia to diversify the advanced nuclear energy market. Only a collaborative effort—ideally, in the form of a multilateral nuclear energy organization—can offer emerging economies competitive funding packages that rival those proffered by China and Russia. If Western countries do not urgently rethink their international nuclear energy strategies, autocratic regimes may well use nuclear power to steer the trajectory of the world's economy and politics before democracies realize it is too late to catch up.

China's and Russia's appetites for exporting nuclear energy are growing fast. In July of last year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia to explore peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and Uganda is considering partnering with Russia to build its first nuclear power plant. This month, Rosatom began the preparatory site work to construct a nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan, which will be the first nuclear reactor in Central Asia and Russia's first SMR export. The nuclear agency is also at work on a nuclear project in Bangladesh. China, for its part, has in the past 15 years signed nuclear energy agreements with Argentina, Hungary, Nigeria, and Pakistan. And each country is specifically investing in SMRs: Russia deployed the world's first commercial SMR in 2020. China's high-temperature gas-cooled modular pebble-bed reactor, which began operating in 2023, is the first of its kind.

Other countries are attempting to get into the game. But unlike the private companies now working on nuclear power, Beijing's China National Nuclear Corporation and Moscow's Rosatom are both state-owned and benefit from a supply chain that integrates manufacturing, construction, and fueling, as well as more streamlined decision-making and operations. These efficiencies allow China and Russia to build reactors fast and at relatively low costs. China's nuclear industry is powered by thousands of highly skilled staff members operating with remarkable speed. These efficiencies are not simply a byproduct of authoritarian control: they are the result of deliberate choices by Beijing and Moscow to elevate nuclear energy to a national priority. Both nations have made licensing processes to construct reactors more efficient without compromising safety.

China and Russia have also elected to provide abundant and strategic state financing for nuclear energy. To accomplish Beijing's nuclear goals, the Energy Research Institute at China's National Development and Reform Commission has estimated that China must—and can—make over $1.3 trillion worth of investments by 2050. Typically, most Chinese projects are backed by state loans at interest rates as low as 1.4 percent, significantly lower than global averages. Russia has committed more than $26 billion to domestic nuclear projects and offers multibillion-dollar export financing packages. Other countries also have state-backed nuclear institutions, but none are yet attempting to match the scale of China's and Russia's export drives.

Both China National Nuclear Corporation and Rosatom often cover as much as 85 percent of an overseas project's costs in the form of loans with favorable interest rates. And both offer “build-own-operate” contracts, or agreements that allow them to own the reactors they construct abroad for a set period, thereby reducing burdens—such as managing spent nuclear fuel—for buyer nations. CNNC also provides foreign buyers with comprehensive services including the design, construction, and operation of its nuclear plants. By working closely with engineers and scientists in buyer countries, Beijing invests in developing peer-to-peer relationships that cement its bilateral ties.

Emerging economies are thus turning to China and Russia for their power needs, especially for assistance in deploying SMRs. SMR technology was initially developed in the 1950s, primarily for military applications. For decades, SMRs were viewed as niche technologies. But advances in design and more supportive government policies—coupled with the ballooning need for electricity around the world—has elevated their profile. Unlike conventional large reactors, SMRs' diverse sizes and forms offer greater flexibility, allowing them to meet smaller energy demands and more specialized applications in a wider variety of geographical locations.

SMRs' streamlined manufacturing processes and shorter construction timelines could also allow buyer nations to bypass many of the daunting financial and logistical challenges inherent in building conventional nuclear power plants. Experts have estimated that SMR projects could take three to six years compared with the ten or more years it takes to deploy conventional reactors. If the SMR projects already underway in China and Russia succeed at expanding nuclear energy access at a lower cost, that may increase SMRs' appeal to emerging economies aiming to break into energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and data centers.

Additionally, SMRs can do things that conventional nuclear plants cannot. Certain advanced designs can achieve higher operating temperatures, enabling them to generate process heat for industrial applications such as steelmaking and producing ammonia for fertilizer. These uses are critical: in 2022, the industrial sector accounted for approximately 37 percent of global energy consumption.

Some analysts remain skeptical of SMRs' novelty and point to the history of expensive, over-budget conventional nuclear projects. But China and Russia believe they will transform the energy market: with huge investments, by 2030, China hopes to export 30 reactors to its Belt and Road Initiative partner countries, and Russia aims to capture 20 percent of the global SMR market. As the world's electricity demand rises, so will the strategic value of nuclear energy, which offers far greater power density than other sources: just one uranium fuel pellet produces as much energy as a ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas.

The comprehensive financing packages and efficient production that Beijing and Moscow are offering make nuclear power much more accessible for developing nations. But these agreements also risk creating long-term dependence, ensuring that buyer countries remain indebted to China and Russia and reliant on their operational expertise for decades. Despite this threat of dependence, emerging economies—as well as developed countries that want to generate more nuclear power—have few compelling alternatives to Chinese and Russian nuclear energy. The American company NuScale Power has signed agreements to deploy SMRs in Ghana and Romania, but the projects remain in the planning phases. Another American company, Westinghouse, is helping Poland build its first nuclear power plant. But these efforts lag far behind those made by Beijing and Moscow.

Although some unique efficiencies help centralized, statist governments fast-track nuclear energy projects, there is no inherent reason why the United States and its allies cannot support the development, production, and export of reactors at a rate that competes with their authoritarian counterparts. From the 1960s through the 1990s, the United States supplied much of the world's nuclear manufacturing, reactor designs, and supply chain expertise. China's and Russia's ambitious, state-backed funding models, however, have edged out U.S. companies. U.S. government policy bears some responsibility: export laws have erected onerous barriers to countries interested in purchasing U.S. reactors. Before the United States transfers nuclear technologies and materials to another country, it demands that the partner country sign a peaceful nuclear energy cooperation agreement, referred to as a 123 agreement. Such agreements adhere to strict nonproliferation safeguards, but Washington often seeks additional commitments—such as requiring partners to forgo enriching their own uranium or reprocessing spent fuel that can make U.S. technology less attractive to potential buyers.

Furthermore, U.S. regulatory inefficiencies act as a bottleneck to progress. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission often takes five years or more to approve a reactor project and imposes burdensome fee structures on applicants. Kairos Power's Hermes reactor is the only licensed SMR actively under construction in the United States; this slow pursuit of SMRs reflects long-standing institutional challenges at the NRC, including an internal culture that has struggled to align with innovation.



The race to provide advanced nuclear power is not simply a symbolic technological competition. It is a geopolitical struggle for influence and economic competitiveness in a rapidly electrifying world. Beijing and Moscow will steadily gain more soft power as the countries with which they have nuclear energy deals are incentivized to align with their economic ambitions and political ideals. This is happening already: for instance, Rosatom is expanding Hungary's nuclear power capacity; nuclear energy now generates about 44 percent of the country's electricity. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban vehemently opposed including Russian nuclear power in the EU's sanctions on Russian nuclear energy, achieving an exemption.

In the future, countries could even use their leverage over the reactors they build to coerce or punish buyer nations by turning the reactors off or seizing them. Such a threat is hardly without precedent. In 2014, Russia shut off its gas supplies to Ukraine for months after annexing the Crimean Peninsula, causing economic and social disruption. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity cannot be stockpiled, making the shutdown of a nuclear power plant devastating for a nation's power grid and economic stability.

The United States is not the only country falling behind. Other major powers with advanced nuclear industries have not done enough to offer the accessible financing and turnkey project models that developing countries need. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development requires its member states to impose higher interest rates and longer repayment durations for nuclear projects than China and Russia do. And most multilateral development finance institutions, such as the World Bank, refuse to help fund the construction of nuclear plants. All these barriers force developing nations to turn to Chinese and Russian nuclear export programs.

Maintaining geopolitical balance in the nuclear energy market requires the United States and its allies to adopt more competitive strategies, particularly when it comes to SMRs. In July 2024, the U.S. Congress passed the ADVANCE Act, which aims to modernize nuclear regulation, accelerate licensing, and support advanced reactor deployment. It requires the NRC to update its regulatory framework and authorizes funding for these goals. The act is a good start, and Congress should use its provisions to maximize efforts directed toward SMR development. It should also consider adopting greater flexibility in how it negotiates enrichment and reprocessing terms: rather than insisting partners fully renounce these capabilities, Washington could allow them under strict oversight, balancing nonproliferation objectives with the need to compete in the nuclear export market.

These steps, however, will not be enough. The main problem for Western countries is how to equal or better the efficient construction and funding that China and Russia now offer. Last year, the energy analyst and former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state Todd Moss proposed that the World Bank hire experts who can evaluate nuclear energy within recipient countries' energy mix, but the idea will likely still face opposition from the bank's antinuclear shareholders. A separate proposed initiative to make nuclear energy financing more accessible and competitive, the International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure, began too broadly by asking 50 countries to create an entirely new financial institution and has now stalled.

It would be more promising to establish a global nuclear energy cooperative that, to start, coordinates policies between a small and politically aligned group of pro-nuclear nations committed to accelerating strategic nuclear power exports. Existing partnerships such as the Sapporo 5—composed of Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States—have already begun to strengthen and diversify the world's nuclear fuel supply chain. A similar kind of collaboration is urgently needed for power plant construction. This cooperation could be coordinated by a new agency or a dedicated arm of an established institution such as the International Atomic Energy Agency; it should leverage each country's strengths, such as Canada's preeminence in uranium mining and the United States' extensive reactor design portfolio. A cooperative could also boost each member country's domestic nuclear industry—including its ability to develop SMRs—by encouraging the sharing of expertise and infrastructure. And it would afford its members leverage to reform development finance frameworks that exclude nuclear power projects from consideration.

Such an organization could offer competitive funding and technologies tailored to developing nations, rivaling Chinese and Russian deals. By pooling their strengths, democracies can help address emerging economies' rising demand for power while enhancing their own energy security and diplomatic independence. The nuclear power contracts arranged by such an organization could even best those offered by China and Russia. They could offer developing countries a greater stake in operating their reactors, including by investing more resources in training the local workforce and helping buyer countries establish strong nuclear energy regulatory frameworks. A cooperative could also strengthen public-private partnerships, bolstering support for private advanced nuclear technology companies to accelerate economies of scale and resulting cost declines. And a nuclear energy cooperative would provide the West with a crucial platform to continue influencing nonproliferation safeguards by creating better balanced technology export standards that maintain nuclear safety without deterring buyers.

Developing nations may nonetheless decide to source nuclear energy technologies from China and Russia. But they need to be able to make a real choice. The United States and its allies still have a chance to counterbalance China's and Russia's expanding influence over the nuclear energy sector. The stakes are rising daily: the decisions that Washington and its allies make now, in the early days of a new nuclear age, will dictate the direction of energy security, the global economy, and the shape of power for decades to come.

TOKYO, April 28. /TASS/. Kim Jong Un believes that North Korean forces' participation in the operation to liberate Russia's Kursk Region from Ukrainian troops was "a sacred mission" aimed at strengthening friendship with Moscow, the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea said in a statement.

"Kim Jong Un determined that the participation of our armed forces in the war was a sacred mission aimed at cementing the traditional friendship and solidarity between the two countries, guaranteeing the development and prosperity of both countries and protecting North Korea's honor," the statement reads, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Kim decided that the situation required the enactment of Article 4 of the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between North Korea and Russia and ordered the forces of the Korean People's Army "to defeat and eliminate Ukrainian neo-Nazi invaders and liberate certain areas of the Kursk Region in coordination with the Russian Armed Forces."

According to the KCNA, Kim hails North Korean troops that took part in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region as heroes who fought for justice. He announced that a memorial to the North Korean soldiers who participated in the operation would soon be established in Pyongyang.

On April 26, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Army General Valery Gerasimov reported to President Vladimir Putin that the operation to liberate the Kursk Region from the Ukrainian forces that had invaded the region in August 2024 was over. Gerasimov particularly highlighted the role of North Korean soldiers.

Article 4 of the Russia-North Korea Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership says that if one of the parties comes under armed attack by another country or group of countries, the other party will immediately provide it with military and other assistance.

Vancouver's acting police chief said that Saturday was the city's darkest day. It was also the darkest for Canada's dynamic and growing Filipino community.

The vehicle attack that killed 11 people at a street festival Saturday night left its roughly one million members reeling. 

“We will feel this for a long time,” said RJ Aquino, chair of Filipino B.C. His voice broke as he described how panicked messages and calls poured into his phone after the attack on the festival, Lapu-Lapu Day.

Sitting next to him at a press conference, B.C. MLA Mable Elmore spoke of the “mad scramble” that followed. Before that, “it was a sunny day, it was a beautiful day for a celebration. Everyone was happy.”

She, too, was in tears as she described the aftermath for survivors and for the broader community. “We are in incredible pain,” she said.

But she also spoke of the community's resilience. So did others. “Even in the face of sorrow, our community's spirit remains unshaken. We will continue to celebrate our culture, not just as a tradition, but as a powerful expression of resistance, pride, and hope,” said Marites de Jesus, director of National Filipino Heritage Canada, in an e-mail message. 

Mr. Aquino of Filipino B.C. referred to the “bayanihan spirit,” a willingness to pull together in times of trouble.

By Sunday, groups across the country were already starting online campaigns to raise money for the victims' families. Across social media, Filipinos rallied to raise awareness about blood donations in the Vancouver area. 

One of the victims was Rizza Azzir, according to online posts. Police are not identifying the others yet, though they said the victims ranged in age from 5 to 65. 

Ms. Azzir was identified in Facebook posts and a GoFundMe campaign started by her cousin, Shelby Pacumio.

Ms. Azzir and her husband moved from the Philippines to Winnipeg “in search of a better life,” the GoFundMe page says.

Sydney Roa, who was at the festival but left before the attack, set up a GoFundMe page on behalf of a Vancouver-based organization that she runs, Tadhana Toys, which provides clothes, books and games to children in hospitals, low-income families and new immigrants.

“Filipinos like to help each other,” she said. “You know, you see a Filipino, I don't know, at the mall, and you say ‘hi,' they're more than happy to say ‘hi' back. There's this universal connection. “

Others spoke of the community's contribution to Canada. British Columbia Premier David Eby pointed out there were probably few in the province who were not touched by care given by a Filipino, whether it is in long-term-care homes, hospitals, child care or schools.

In a statement in June marking a month-long celebration of Filipino heritage, Diversity Minister Kamal Khera said that “due to their recognized expertise in nursing and health care,” Filipino Canadians were “strengthening Canada's health care system and supporting the well-being of Canadian families.”

Filipinos began arriving in Canada in large numbers in the 1960s. Thousands of Filipinas came under the government's live-in caregiver program, often working long hours so they could send money home to their families.

By the 2021 census, 957,355 people reported being of Filipino ethnic origin. Greater Toronto had the biggest community, at 272,470, followed by Vancouver (141,230), Calgary (83,815), Winnipeg (81,140), Edmonton (77,085) and Montreal (39,020).

The community continues to boom. A Statistics Canada report from 2023 said that “over one-third of Canadians reporting Filipino roots living in Canada in 2021 arrived within the previous decade.”

Most are Roman Catholics. On Sunday, flags at St. Mary's Parish in Vancouver flew at half-mast as the largely Filipino congregation filled the church.

Father Joseph D'Souza asked for a moment of silence in recognition of what he called the “tragic incident” on Saturday night. After the service, Angelo and Jennifer Tuazon reflected on what had happened.

“It's a sad day. It was the second year for that festival and instead of joy, now it's going to be remembered differently,” Mr. Tuazon said as the couple and their 13-year-daughter and five-year-old son left the church.

Mohamad Sariman, a food truck operator at the Filipino festival that was attacked on Saturday night, says he initially thought the incident which left 11 dead was an explosion.

They see wealth inequality in a reduced economy leading to possible mass social disorder and spreading mental health challenges as people sink into despair.

In the report's words: “In 2040, upward social mobility is almost unheard of in Canada. Hardly anyone believes that they can build a better life for themselves, or their children, through their own efforts.”

The prognostications are dire, and it's tempting to dismiss them as exaggerations from pessimistic researchers rather than accept the possibility of such a bleak future. In reading the report, it's evident that the prophecies are based on visible socioeconomic trends. The wealth gap is quickly widening while frustrated young Canadians are abandoning hope of home ownership or prosperity in their future.

The top two parties in contention for the leadership of Canada aren't proposing the kind of radical policy changes required to head off the grim conjectures of Policy Horizons. To turn Canada from its trajectory, the government must shrink and deregulate to draw both human capital and foreign investment into the nation. The government must take on trade unions, crony capitalists, and environmental activists to facilitate broad economic development.

Those sorts of policy proposals, however, send chills down the spines of political strategists who want anything but conflict with the aforementioned groups during an election campaign. So we are left hoping that whoever forms the next government has a hidden agenda of reform, which will be quickly implemented upon assuming power.

Housing is a most basic need. Especially in a climate as harsh as Canada. Despite years of promises and countless government-sponsored programs, home ownership remains out of reach for a growing number of Canadians, while low housing supplies lead to rising rent. The report predicts existing homeowners could become future aristocrats as they expand property holdings to hand down to their children, while an underclass locked in the world of renting can't get ahead. Canada could devolve into a class-based society with “social siloing,” separating citizens based on their economic standing.

Social division and a shrinking economy with wealth concentrated in the hands of a smaller number of people could start a chain reaction as skilled and ambitious people emigrate to jurisdictions offering better opportunities for upward social mobility. If younger people flee, the social systems caring for the older population will become further strained. The demographic balance of the nation could tilt, leaving older Canadians cash-rich but resource-poor due to overburdened health and senior care resources.

Those remaining in the country could find themselves seeking alternative ways to meet their needs. People could form housing, health, and food production cooperatives to make ends meet. While that may be effective, it also would lead to a form of tribalism and social introversion for large groups of people. These groups would be distanced from government influence and likely would harbour strong distrust of state institutions. They could become hubs of dangerous discontent.

People may take out their ire upon scapegoats such as immigrants or other identifiable groups if they aren't blaming the government itself. The potential for social conflicts will grow and could blossom into general violence.

While the world envisioned within the report may hold appeal for hardcore ideological libertarians, it would be a rough and miserable place in reality.

Almost all the frightening scenarios packed within the report are already happening. It's just a matter of degree. If current trends continue, the predictions could become reality in short order.

Ironically, this is one of the few times we can hope the parties vying to run in the election are being disingenuous as they offer grander versions of the current government path. Perhaps they understand the gravity of the situation and the report, but don't feel they can effectively campaign on the solutions.

Just this once, let's hope they are blowing smoke while they maintain a hidden agenda of reform. Because if they stay on the current trajectory, our future looks dark indeed.

Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) on Monday filed the first articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump in his second term.

Thanedar, who also received a second primary challenger on Monday, filed seven articles for alleged abuse of power, constitutional violations, and tyranny.

“Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as president and represents a clear and present danger to our nation's constitution and our democracy,” Thanedar said in a statement. “His unlawful actions have subverted the justice system, violated the separation of powers, and placed personal power and self-interest above public service. We cannot wait for more damage to be done. Congress must act.”

A resolution outlining the seven articles filed by Thanedar cites allegations that include denial of due process, unlawful deportations, defiance of court orders, misuse of the Justice Department, bribery and corruption for dismissing criminal cases and soliciting foreign emoluments, threatening military invasion against sovereign nations, and dismantling congressionally established agencies.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Democrats are in the minority in the House and Senate, so the prospect of any impeachment against Trump is unlikely unless they win back power in the 2026 midterm elections.

This is a developing story.

Comedian Mick Thomas joins Fox News Saturday Night to give his take on actress Rosie O'Donnell announcing on TikTok that she has decided to relocate to Ireland. 

Thousands of people participated in a march against Ireland's mass migration policies in the country's capital of Dublin on Saturday. 

UFC champion Conor McGregor – who is considering a potential presidential bid in his native Ireland – posted a video message beforehand from Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, where the march began hours later. 

"Hello everyone in Ireland. April 26th, 2025 - A big day here for our country. "A historic month for Ireland since 1916," McGregor said, referring to the recent anniversary of the Easter Rising against British rule. 

"Over 100 years ago, our brave men and women made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live free today. So let us remind ourselves why we are here. And also why we are not here," McGregor said. "We are not here to build hatred amongst each other. We are not here to sow division. We are here to commemorate the valiant heroes who went before us. We honor their spirit, we honor their fight."

McGregor said the protest would be intended "to shine our light on the failure of Ireland's government and our full disapproval of it." 

"Be respectful, be proud, be united," McGregor said. "Because together, we will be heard, and as one, we will be victorious in our mission. To those leading their march and speaking for the tens of thousands standing behind you: be calm, be clear."

"Speak with dignity - we want to hear your voice. Together we rise, together we win," he added. "God bless us all. God bless Ireland."

The large-scale demonstration kicked off on Saturday afternoon in the garden, as crowds carrying tri-color flags headed down O'Connell Street. 

Some protesters carried placards reading "Irish Lives Matter" and "Ireland is Full," and many wore green hats with the message "Make Ireland Great Again." 

Irish police, known as gardaí, showed a heightened presence in the capital, maintaining a cordoned-off line between the marchers and a smaller group of counter-protesters who gathered in front of the General Post Office (GPO). 

"Over 106,000 Irish men, women and children attended yesterday's rally," McGregor wrote on X Sunday, sharing aerial photos of protesters waving tri-color flags. "Not one social order incident to report. Tremendous! Onward for Ireland!"

Police later said "no major incidents" happened Saturday, though three people had been arrested for "public order offenses," according to the Irish public broadcaster RTE. Police declined to provide additional information. 

The counter-protest was organized by United Against Racism and was backed by members of opposition parties including Sinn Féin, Labor, People Before Profit, the Social Democrats, the Socialist Party and the Green Party, according to The Irish Times.

McGregor first announced his interest in running for president of Ireland after meeting with President Donald Trump on St. Patrick's Day, though the fighter has suggested the country's nomination process is stacked against outsiders like himself. 

Those who spoke at the march included Dublin City councilors Gavin Pepper, Philip Sutcliffe and Malachy Steenson and Fingal councilor Patrick Quinlan, according to Breakingnews.ie.

"The fact of the matter is we're bringing in thousands and thousands of people and putting them up in hotels while our own people are being left to rot… We've had enough of this in Ireland," Pepper said to a cheering Dublin crowd, according to a video shared on X. "Irish people come first in our own country. It's time for mass deportation. The traitors of Sinn Féin do not care." 

The prime minister of Ireland, who holds the title of taoiseach, Micheál Martin, told reporters on Sunday that he did not "accept the negativity from those who spoke yesterday in respect of where modern Ireland is today," according to a video shared online by Susanne Delaney, a contributor to the anti-globalist outlet Irish Inquiry. 

"The level of opportunity in modern Ireland today again is far in excess of anything previous generations experienced in terms of educational completion and so on," Martin, who also met with Trump in the Oval Office earlier in March, said. "The big social issue of our day is housing, but we're focused on solutions to that and less so on the rhetoric of it."

Asked about the growing size of the "Irish nationalist" movement, Martin said the "ballot box is the key metric, the key determinant of the organization of society, who gets elected into government, who gets elected into local councils." 

"And I think it has to be based on ideas and policies," he said. "We believe we have a stronger set of ideas than perhaps those who articulated yesterday."

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the nonstop airstrikes on 'Special Report.' 

The Trump administration sanctioned three vessels and their owners for providing support to the Houthis – the Iranian regime's network of terrorist proxies and partners, Fox News Digital has learned. 

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced the sanctions Monday, following the Houthis' efforts to deploy missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles and naval mines to attack commercial shipping interests in the Red Sea – activities that "threaten global freedom of navigation and the integrity of international commerce."

"Today's action underscores our commitment to disrupt the Houthis' efforts to fund their dangerous and destabilizing attacks in the region," Treasury Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender said Monday, adding that the department will "continue to leverage" its tools and authorities "to target those who seek to enable the Houthis' ability to exploit the people of Yemen and continue their campaign of violence."

The State Department designated the Houthis as a specially designated global terrorist in February 2024 and redesignated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in March. 

"Providing material support to the Houthis not only carries acute sanctions risk, but also exposes vessels and crew members to serious safety risk from potential Houthi attacks," a Treasury Department official told Fox News Digital. 

TRUMP ADMIN IMPOSES SANCTIONS AGAINST BANK OF YEMEN FOR SUPPORTING HOUTHIS

A Treasury official told Fox News Digital that the Houthis control the strategic Yemen Red Sea ports of Hudaydah, Ras Isa and Al-Salif, and are funneling millions of dollars derived from port revenues and the seizure of refined petroleum products to fund a "reckless attack campaign against U.S. interests and those of our allies in the region." 

The official said the group sells refined petroleum products at "exorbitant prices" on Yemen's black market, which enables the Houthi operatives to "purchase military materials, create an artificial shortage of essential goods for average Yemenis, and fuels rampant corruption among Houthi leaders." 

Marshall Islands-registered Zaas Shipping & Trading Co. used one of the vessels targeted, the Tulip BZ, to facilitate the delivery of liquid petroleum gas to the Houthi-controlled port of Ras Isa, the Treasury said. It also has been used to transport petroleum products on behalf of Iran.

Mauritius-registered Bagsak Shipping Inc. is also targeted, and facilitated the delivery of gas oil to Ras Isa using the Panama-flagged vessel, the Maisan. The Maisan also has been involved in the export of Russian crude oil and petroleum products from Russian ports since February 2023, according to a Treasury official. 

AFTER DEBILITATING STRIKES, TRUMP TELLS HOUTHIS: STOP SHOOTING AT US AND ‘WE WILL STOP SHOOTING AT YOU'

And Marshall Islands-registered Great Success Shipping Co. facilitated the delivery of gas oil to Ras Isa using the Panama-flagged vessel, the White Whale. 

The move comes after President Donald Trump officially informed Congress in March that he had directed the Department of Defense to move additional combat forces into the Middle East, as U.S. forces carry out military strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen. Those strikes have been conducted in an effort to stop attacks on American forces and commercial ships in the Red Sea.

"I will no longer allow this band of pirates to threaten and attack United States forces and commercial vessels in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world," Trump wrote March 28. "We will act to keep Americans safe."

He said the U.S. will continue striking until the group no longer poses a threat to navigation or U.S. personnel.

The strikes have been from Navy ships, Air Force bombers and drones targeting Houthi weapons, leadership and command centers. 

The airstrikes began after renewed Houthi threats against Israeli ships and attacks on U.S. forces, including seven Reaper drones brought down since March 3.

The Houthis began ramping up attacks in the Red Sea after the October 2023 Hamas terror attack on Israel. They've claimed responsibility for targeting U.S. warships and have so far avoided hitting Chinese and Saudi ships, raising questions among defense officials about their strategic aims. 

Earlier in April, the Trump administration sanctioned the International Bank of Yemen Y.S.C. (IBY) for its financial support of Houthi terrorists.Fox News' Greg Wehner, Jasmine Baehr, Brie Stimson, Caitlin McFall and Liz Friedan contributed to this report.

            Spain and Portugal are racing the setting sun as they respond to a massive, unexplained power outage that knocked out traffic lights, caused chaos on roads and in airports, and threatened to plunge tens of millions of people into darkness on Monday.
    


            Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian Peninsula, and in parts of France, shortly after midday. It could be several hours until power is fully restored, Spain's grid operator said, meaning families and businesses around the country could be without energy come nightfall.
    


            The outage took out lighting and power sockets, and caused subway systems to suddenly fail. Some power began to trickle back across Spain hours later, but efforts to fully revive the grid and to identify the cause have not yet been successful.
    


            In Madrid, traffic piled up on the roads after the lights went out. “I was driving and suddenly there was no traffic lights… It was a bit of a jungle,” Luis Ibáñez Jiménez told CNN. “I saw a massive bus coming, and I had to accelerate a lot to go past it.”
    


            The cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs were shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of around 60 million people, hastily arranged emergency meetings to co-ordinate a response.
    


            Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to clear the roads for emergency workers. Later in the day, Madrid's emergency services provider urged the country's government to declare a national emergency, and local leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso asked the country to deploy the army.
    


            Portugal's grid operator said restoring power was a “complex operation.” By Monday evening, both Portugal's and Spain's grid operators said the supply of energy was gradually being restored in pockets of both countries, although Portugal's operator said it would still take several hours for Lisbon, the capital, to be reconnected.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said authorities are still not sure what caused the power outage. Earlier, Antonio Costa – president of the European Council and Portugal's former prime minister – said although the cause of the outage is not clear, there are “no indications” of a cyberattack.
    


            Efforts could stretch into the night. “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process – the total reestablishment of the electrical supply – will take several hours, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red Eléctrica, Spain's national grid operator, told broadcaster La Sexta.
    


            Portugal's prime minister blamed his neighboring nation for the scenes. Luis Montenegro said his government did not yet know what caused the cut, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” that the problem started in Spain.
    


            João Faria Conceição, head of REN, said Portugal was badly affected because it imports electricity from Spain in the morning, because Spain is one hour ahead and electricity produced by its solar plants is cheaper than producing it internally, during those hours.
    


            “We are peripheral,” Conceição told a news conference Monday evening. While Spain received support from France and Morocco, Portugal had no country to turn to for emergency supplies of electricity.
    


            Monday's blackout hit a huge and busy swathe of southern Europe. Dozens of Iberian cities, like Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia, are major hubs for transport, finance and tourism. Two of the five busiest airports in the European Union in 2023 were Madrid's and Barcelona's, according to EU data.
    


            For a few hours, modern routines were suspended: cash replaced card payments, police officers used arm signals to direct traffic, and restaurants, supermarkets and stores closed their doors. Madrid's firefighters carried out 174 “elevator interventions” across the city on Monday, its Emergency Information Office said, and some shoppers stocked up on essentials and on canned goods.
    


            The worst-case scenarios appear to have been averted, at least in the first hours of the blackout. Spain's nuclear sites were declared operational and safe, while Portugal's National Institute for Medical Emergencies said it had “activated its contingency plan,” running its telephone and IT systems through a back-up generator. Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there.
    


            But travel was hit harder. Flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Portugal's flag carrier TAP Air Portugal told people not to travel to the airport until further notice.
    


            Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in lines, with no air conditioning or running water. Shops were only accepting cash, she told CNN.
    


            Trains were also suspended in Spain. And darkness suddenly descended in subway tunnels; video posted on social media showed blackened subway cars stuck in standstill on platforms in Madrid, where the metro was suspended and entrances to stations were taped off.
    


            Sporting events were impacted too. Tennis fans at the Madrid Open filed out of courts after the outage caused play to be suspended.
    


            Some parts of southern France, near the Spanish border, felt a more sporadic impact.
    


            Emilie Grandidie, a spokeswoman for France's electricity transmission operator RTE, told CNN there was “a small power cut” in the French Basque Country; “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” she said.
    


            For several hours on Monday, tens of millions of people were asking each other when power would return, and why it was knocked out in the first place.
    


            Neither question was easy to answer. But once power returns, it could still take days to untangle the damage caused by Monday's worrying blackout.
    


            Spain's transportation minister said medium and long-distance trains won't resume service until at least Tuesday, and the impact of a huge backlog in flights could stretch throughout the week.

Colin Carroll, the deputy defense secretary's former chief of staff who was fired weeks ago, characterized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as being unpredictable in meetings and switching between well-mannered and “agitated.”

Carroll was fired along with senior Hegseth adviser Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick due to allegations that the trio leaked information to the media. On Saturday, he sat down with Megyn Kelly for an interview about the secretary.

Carroll complimented Hegseth's performance in a meeting with the House Freedom Caucus about spending cuts, saying, “There is not a secretary in living memory that could have done as good a job with those guys. He was informal. He was super direct. He was very transparent.”

He then recalled Hegseth's allegedly different behavior in internal meetings, saying he would raise his voice, focus on “weird details,” and become “very agitated.”

Some of the fixation on small stories has become public, such as when Hegseth's team faced backlash last week over alleged changes to the green room, with CBS News reporting that Hegseth ordered the space to be retrofitted into a “makeup studio” for television appearances. Despite other major stories happening that day, including news that Hegseth shared details of a military operation in another private chat featuring his wife, as well as a campaign in Yemen, his team continued to post about the makeup studio all afternoon.

“So it's like a tale of two Petes,” Carroll told Kelly.

Carroll's interview with Kelly comes days after reports were published about officials close to Hegseth calling the defense secretary's behavior “erratic” and saying that he yells at staff, according to NBC News. The officials also shared that Hegseth has become more “insecure” about the status of his job after recent controversies, though President Donald Trump has repeatedly backed Hegseth.

Caldwell, another fired official, appeared on Tucker Carlson's show, on which he denied claims that he leaked sensitive information to the press and blamed his firing on his disagreement with Hegseth over the handling of Iran.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) will not seek reelection in 2026 and will step down from his position as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee due to a recurrence of cancer.

Connolly, 75, announced in November last year that he was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus. He said in a statement after “grueling treatments” that the cancer has returned.

“The sun is setting on my time in public service, and this will be my last term in Congress,” Connolly said Monday. “I will be stepping back as Ranking Member of the Oversight Committee soon. With no rancor and a full heart, I move into this final chapter full of pride in what we've accomplished together over 30 years.”

Connolly defeated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in December last year for the ranking membership. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, had been one of several younger Democrats seeking a generational shift in leadership following losses in the 2024 election. However, the Democrats' steering committee selected Connolly, who had the backing of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

The Washington Examiner reached out to Ocasio-Cortez for comment.

Virginia's 11th District has remained in Democratic hands since Connolly's win in 2008, which flipped the seat from red to blue. He won reelection in 2024 with 66.7% of the vote.

Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.


While Heather Graham feels confident in the choices she's made over the last 55 years of her life, she often wonders what life would've been like had she taken a different path. 

In a new interview, the "Austin Powers" star opens up about her conscious decision not to have children and admitted that she sometimes questions her choice. 

"I think I've had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid? I guess I would say 80% of the time I feel glad I don't have kids, and I feel free and really good about it, and maybe 20% of the time I wonder what would it be like. You just have to appreciate the life you have," she told The Guardian.

"I do think it's awesome now that more women are expressing their desire to not have kids," the actress and director added. "Again, she says, it is almost people pleasing on a big scale. The culture says: ‘You need to have kids.' But why? If you're not being a people pleaser, what do you really want?"

"I think I've had moments where I wondered: what would it have been like if I had a kid?"

This isn't the first time Graham has expressed her feelings about not pursuing parenthood. 

"I think we all have different paths," she told People magazine in 2023. "You just have to embrace the one that you're on. If, somehow, I had had kids, I'm sure that would've been cool. But at the moment, not having kids, I do feel free. And I get a lot of sleep. That is pretty great."

"I do feel like, as a woman, culturally, you're not allowed to say, 'I didn't want to have kids.' Because it's like, 'What's wrong with you?'" she explained. "I think as a man it's like, 'Oh yeah, cool, you didn't want to have kids.' Now, women are getting more free to just make their own choices."

These days, Graham – whose new movie "Chosen Family" premiered last year – said she's learned the importance of dropping the "people-pleaser" label. 

"I realized, no, actually I can just ask myself, ‘What do I want?' and make myself happy," she told The Guardian. "I wish I could have had this when I was 20 or 15. If I wasn't trying to please other people, what would I have done? There were moments where I feel like I could have stood up for myself more," she said.

Graham, who has been estranged from her family for 30 years, said cutting ties with her parents and sister was a "huge relief."

"It didn't feel like a healthy dynamic. I stopped talking to them and, I have to say, that was a huge relief," she told the outlet. "I felt like, at that moment, my life opened up with a freedom. I didn't need to please them."

"I feel like I wasn't brought up to have a deep sense of self-esteem, and I think as I detached from my family, I built my own sense of self-esteem," she added. "Sort of like a detective, I went through my past and looked at how I developed certain ways of thinking that weren't the healthiest, and basically just went on a journey to be happier."

"Before, I was more: ‘What do other people think?'" she said. "Now I'm just like, f--- it."

Princeton senior Danielle Shapiro joins ‘Fox & Friends' to discuss how anti-Israel protesters disrupted a campus lecture by a former Israeli prime minister, shouting anti-Semitic chants and targeting students. 

EXCLUSIVE – Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz called on his alma mater, Princeton University, to dismiss a former high-level Iranian regime official because he is allegedly making students feel unsafe amid recent outbreaks of antisemitism at the New Jersey university.

The ex-official for the Islamic Republic of Iran, Seyed Hossein Mousavian, who is a Middle East security and nuclear policy specialist at the university, is under pressure on many fronts from congressional representatives, Princeton students and experts on antisemitism. 

"Mousavian is closely linked to the Iranian regime and to the regime's campaigns of terrorism and murder. His presence at Princeton makes students feel justifiably afraid for their safety. Princeton's decision to keep employing him shows they care less about their students, and more about providing a platform for pro-regime and anti-American propaganda. That kind of reckless institutional ideological bias is exactly why the Trump administration is reassessing federal funding for Princeton," Cruz told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Mousavian expressed support for the U.S.-designated terrorist movements, Hamas and Hezbollah, and appeared to pay tribute to the global Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani in 2020 when he attended his funeral. 

President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike to eliminate Soleimani in January 2020 for his role in the murders of over 600 American military personnel in the Middle East and his planning of new terrorist attacks.

Mousavian has declined to renounce his support for Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran's fatwa (religious decree) to assassinate the British-American writer Salman Rushdie. 

A Hezbollah flag was on display during a Princeton student protest encampment against Israel last year. The Iran-backed Hezbollah was responsible for a 1983 bombing that murdered 241 U.S. military members in Beirut.

Maximillian Meyer, president of Princeton Tigers for Israel, and an undergraduate at the university, told Fox News Digital, "I commend Sen. Cruz for raising urgent concerns about Princeton's employment of Mousavian, whose career has been defined by shilling for the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Credible reports linking Mousavian to the oversight of Iranian dissident assassinations in Europe – alongside his endorsement of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie – are deeply alarming."

INCOMING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION GIVEN NEW BLUEPRINT ON WAYS TO WEAKEN IRAN: 'UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY'

Fox News Digital first reported in November 2023 that the House Committee on Education and the Workforce launched an investigation into Mousavian's role in advancing the interests of the clerical regime in Tehran.

During Mousavian's tenure as Iran's ambassador to Germany, he was in charge of the embassy that a German court found "served as the ‘headquarters' for the planning of the 1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents at the Greek restaurant Mykonos in Berlin."

However, the former Iranian ambassador previously told Fox News Digital that "This accusation is a big lie," and "The 398-page verdict is published, and everyone can have access to it. The Berlin court verdict does not contain any direct or indirect allegations against me. German authorities never forced me to leave the country.… I have been a frequent visitor to Germany."

Yet, Iranian dissidents and human rights experts uncovered testimony from Abolghasem Mesbahi, a former senior-level Iranian intelligence official, who told the Berlin court during the Mykonos trial, "Mousavian participated in most of the [Iranian regime's] crimes that took place in Europe."

Mousavian did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries, WhatsApp messages and telephone calls for this article.

Meyer, the Princeton undergraduate student, said, "Anyone who has served in senior roles for the repressive Islamic Republic of Iran poses a clear threat to American national security. His continued employment at Princeton is a damning indictment of the anti-Americanism festering within so-called ‘elite' institutions."

Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber, who recently said he would defy Trump's efforts to stop antisemitism via federal funding cuts to the wealthy university, did not respond to Fox News Digital email press queries and telephone calls about Mousavian.

Fox News Digital recently reported that pro-Hamas and pro-Palestinian agitators stormed a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett at Princeton, sparking criticism from Jewish students at Princeton.

In a statement to Fox News Digital over the incident, Eisgruber said he was "appalled" at reports of antisemitic language used during Bennett's visit. He added, "Such behavior is reprehensible and intolerable. The University is investigating and will pursue disciplinary measures as appropriate, to the extent any members of the Princeton University community are implicated."

It is unclear if Eisgruber suspended or expelled students who prevented Bennett from speaking. Mousavian has faced criticism for stoking antisemitism since Hamas invaded Israel and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including more than 40 Americans. Eisgruber has gone silent about Mousavian's actions.

A Fox News Digital examination of Mousavian's X account shows a high number of Persian and English posts attacking the Jewish state, including comparing Israel with Nazi Germany. The comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany is classified as modern antisemitism, according to the widely accepted definition formulated by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. 

IRAN'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TEHRAN'S ADVANCING NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the former chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and director of Global Social Action at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, asked Eisgruber in a statement to Fox News Digital: Why does the university continue to protect Mousavian at a time of raging antisemitism and what is he still doing there? 

Cooper further asked, in the context of the reported antisemitic mob attack on Bennett and Mousavian's alleged ties to the murders carried out by Iran's regime, why can't "the President of Princeton connect the dots"?

Cooper said on Eisgruber's watch "It is a shameful chapter that must end the right way." Cooper accused Eisgruber of "stoic silence or indifference to antisemitism" and "stonewalling" efforts to hold Mousavian accountable for his alleged crimes and antisemitism. Cooper continued that Eisgruber owes it to Jewish students and faculty, Iranian-Americans, and Iranian dissidents to answer basic questions about Mousavian.

Eisgruber has not obstructed any law enforcement efforts to investigate Mousavian's alleged crimes.

Cooper also called on Princeton and Mousavian to submit his Ph.D. for examination. Fox News Digital has learned that neither Princeton University nor the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, where Mousavian allegedly obtained his Ph.D. in 2002, were willing to produce a copy of his dissertation. 

Mousavian was the head of the Foreign Relations Committee of Iran's National Security Council (1997-2005), according to his Princeton webpage.

Gary Hughes, a spokesman for the University of Kent, told Fox News Digital, "Data protection principle also means that neither myself nor any other colleague across the University can disclose personal data about this or any other current or former student." 

He said the university's Freedom of Information (FOI) office can answer the request. The FOI office denied a request and later said after Fox News Digital appealed that, "We are currently conducting an internal review in relation to your request." 

A British-Iranian man sought to obtain Mousavian's Ph.D. in January, according to email correspondence obtained by Fox News Digital. Kent University's Open Research team wrote in one email, "I am afraid we have no record of Mr. Seyed Hossein Mousavian's thesis in the library catalogue." Fox News Digital searches for Mousavian's Ph.D. in American, British and German academic databases showed no results. 

The Swedish-Iranian author Iraj Mesdaghi told Fox News Digital that he sought to obtain Mousavian's Ph.D. in 2013. The University of Kent declined to produce it. Mesdaghi wrote about the great lengths he went to in order to secure access to Mousavian's alleged Ph.D. on his website, including contact with the FOI office. 

Shirley M. Tilghman, the former president of Princeton University when Mousavian was hired in 2009, declined to answer a press query about whether she vetted Mousavian and his alleged Ph.D.

Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar says television networks reporting outside the White House should “blur” the faces of illegal immigrants showcased on lawn signs, which were placed on Sunday evening.

The 100 lawn signs showcase mug shots of illegal immigrants who have been detained, along with the alleged crime listed below their photo, with an MSNBC anchor noting that the signs were set up “directly behind the positions where TV correspondents do their hits from the White House lawn.” In reacting to this predicament given to the press, Kumar argued “we don't know” if the illegal immigrants were given due process, and suggested the faces on these signs should be censored.

“The press right now, we are absolutely under attack,” Kumar stated. “Our job is always to have our true north, to make sure that we're presenting balanced news, and making sure that we are not putting folks that are potentially in danger and having that representation of those pictures in the background, we can't allow that to basically for us to carry the water of potentially innocent people.”

Kumar acknowledged that “live shots are tough” but still pressed for the faces on the illegal immigrant signs to be censored, concluding that “we know better.”

The White House has promoted its new lawn signs on X, with the administration's Rapid Response account stating that the “scumbags” were being shown on the signs “for the world to see.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a video showcasing the many signs.

“We will hunt you down,” the White House's X account wrote. “You will face justice. You will be deported — and you will never set foot on American soil again. Oh, and your mug shot may just end up on a yard sign at the White House.”

As part of the White House's fight against illegal immigration within the United States, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer warned governors last week that they could lose their federal funds if they extend unemployment benefits to illegal immigrants. Earlier this month, the Social Security Administration undertook an effort to label illegal immigrants as dead, stripping them of Social Security benefits.

            Spain and Portugal are racing the setting sun as they respond to a massive, unexplained power outage that knocked out traffic lights, caused chaos on roads and in airports, and threatened to plunge tens of millions of people into darkness on Monday.
    


            Portugal's grid operator Redes Energéticas Nacionais (REN) said electrical supply was lost across the entire Iberian Peninsula, and in parts of France, shortly after midday. It could be several hours until power is fully restored, Spain's grid operator said, meaning families and businesses around the country could be without energy come nightfall.
    


            The outage took out lighting and power sockets, and caused subway systems to suddenly fail. Some power began to trickle back across Spain hours later, but efforts to fully revive the grid and to identify the cause have not yet been successful.
    


            In Madrid, traffic piled up on the roads after the lights went out. “I was driving and suddenly there was no traffic lights… It was a bit of a jungle,” Luis Ibáñez Jiménez told CNN. “I saw a massive bus coming, and I had to accelerate a lot to go past it.”
    


            The cause of the blackout was unclear, but its impact was dramatic: transport hubs were shuttered and governments in both countries, which share a population of around 60 million people, hastily arranged emergency meetings to co-ordinate a response.
    


            Madrid's mayor José Luis Martinez Almeida asked people to minimize their movements and only call emergency services if it was truly urgent. He also called on people to clear the roads for emergency workers. Later in the day, Madrid's emergency services provider urged the country's government to declare a national emergency, and local leader Isabel Díaz Ayuso asked the country to deploy the army.
    


            Portugal's grid operator said restoring power was a “complex operation.” By Monday evening, both Portugal's and Spain's grid operators said the supply of energy was gradually being restored in pockets of both countries.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said authorities are still not sure what caused the power outage. Earlier, Antonio Costa – president of the European Council and Portugal's former prime minister – said although the cause of the outage is not clear, there are “no indications” of a cyberattack.
    


            Efforts could stretch into the night. “The experience of other similar events that have taken place in other countries indicate to us that this process – the total reestablishment of the electrical supply – will take several hours, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for system operation at Red Eléctrica, Spain's national grid operator, told broadcaster La Sexta.
    


            “We could be talking about six to 10 hours, if everything goes well, until we reestablish supply to every last customer,” said Prieto, who was speaking in the early afternoon.
    


            Portugal's Prime Minister blamed his neighboring nation for the scenes. Luis Montenegro said his government did not yet know what caused the cut, but that it “did not originate in Portugal” and “everything indicates” that the problem started in Spain.
    


            Monday's blackout hit a huge and busy swathe of southern Europe. Dozens of Iberian cities, like Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona, Seville and Valencia, are major hubs for transport, finance and tourism. Two of the five busiest airports in the European Union in 2023 were Madrid's and Barcelona's, according to EU data.
    


            For a few hours, modern routines were suspended: cash replaced card payments, police officers used arm signals to direct traffic, and restaurants, supermarkets and stores closed their doors. Madrid's firefighters carried out 174 “elevator interventions” across the city on Monday, its Emergency Information Office said, and some shoppers stocked up on essentials and on canned goods.
    


            The worst-case scenarios appear to have been averted, at least in the first hours of the blackout. Spain's nuclear sites were declared operational and safe, while Portugal's National Institute for Medical Emergencies said it had “activated its contingency plan,” running its telephone and IT systems through a back-up generator. Spain's health ministry said the same process happened in hospitals there.
    


            But travel was hit harder. Flights at major airports in the region were suddenly delayed or canceled, with travelers scrambling to adapt; online flight trackers reported that several airports saw their frequent departures suddenly halted after midday. Portugal's flag carrier TAP Air Portugal told people not to travel to the airport until further notice.
    


            Ellie Kenny, a holidaymaker inside Lisbon's Humberto Delgado airport, said hundreds of people were stood in the dark in lines, with no air conditioning or running water. Shops were only accepting cash, she told CNN.
    


            Trains were also suspended in Spain. And darkness suddenly descended in subway tunnels; video posted on social media showed blackened subway cars stuck in standstill on platforms in Madrid, where the metro was suspended and entrances to stations were taped off.
    


            Sporting events were impacted too. Tennis fans at the Madrid Open filed out of courts after the outage caused play to be suspended.
    


            Some parts of southern France, near the Spanish border, felt a more sporadic impact.
    


            Emilie Grandidie, a spokeswoman for France's electricity transmission operator RTE, told CNN there was “a small power cut” in the French Basque Country; “It lasted only a couple of minutes and was restored very quickly,” she said.
    


            For several hours on Monday, tens of millions of people were asking each other when power would return, and why it was knocked out in the first place.
    


            Neither question was easy to answer. But once power returns, it could still take days to untangle the damage caused by Monday's worrying blackout.
    


            Spain's transportation minister said medium and long-distance trains won't resume service until at least Tuesday, and the impact of a huge backlog in flights could stretch throughout the week.

Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley slammed those who criticized him for hanging out with President Donald Trump ahead of the team's visit to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl win.

Barkley was spotted at Trump's golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, and then flew back to Washington on Air Force One with the president.

"lol some people are really upset cause I played golfed and flew to the White House with the PRESIDENT," Barkley tweeted on Monday. "Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago… and look forward to finishing my round with Trump ! Now ya get out my mentions with all this politics and have amazing day."

Trump had glowing praise of Barkley as he talked to reporters before he headed back to D.C.

"What a nice guy he is. I wanted to race him, but I decided not to do it," the president said.

Barkley is going to be among the Eagles players and personnel who will celebrate their Super Bowl title win at the White House later Monday.

SUPER BOWL CHAMP GIVES REASON WHY SHEDEUR SANDERS FELL TO 5TH ROUND OF NFL DRAFT

A White House official confirmed to Fox News Digital in early March that an invitation from the president had been sent and that the team had "enthusiastically accepted." This followed the Eagles' decision not to attend the White House in 2018 after winning the franchise's first-ever Super Bowl. 

During that time, Trump rescinded the invitation to host the Eagles after several players said they would not participate in the visit because of his previous criticisms of national anthem protests.

The president's economic policy has put unions in an awkward position.

by  Abdallah Fayyad

President Donald Trump's tariffs have drawn a lot of opposition — from economists, businesses, Wall Street, and the majority of Americans.

Yet Trump has received support from a seemingly unlikely source: Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, who staunchly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and previously called Trump a “scab.”

A newsletter about ending poverty in America, from correspondent Abdallah Fayyad.

”We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades,” Fain said when Trump announced tariffs on foreign-made cars late last month. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions.” (The UAW did not respond to a request for an interview.)

He's not the only labor leader who supported tariffs. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the country's largest labor unions, also endorsed Trump's policy, going so far as to support not just specific levies but across-the-board tariffs. (A spokesperson told Newsweek that the union is hopeful about the tariffs' long-term effects.) But that doesn't mean all unions or their members are enthused. Other leaders and rank-and-file members have criticized the president's blanket approach to import tax. And Liz Shuler, the president of AFL-CIO, a federation of unions in the United States, issued a statement criticizing Trump's overall policy.

Fain himself has since qualified his praise. “We support use of some tariffs on automotive manufacturing and similar industries. We do not support tariffs for political games about immigration or fentanyl,” he said in an address to UAW members after Trump announced his full tariff plan earlier this month. “We do not support reckless tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.”

The mixed reviews that tariffs have received from unions reflect the awkward position some have found themselves in. For decades, unions, particularly those representing manufacturing workers, have argued against free-trade agreements and in favor of more protectionist policies, including tariffs, which they believe will help save American jobs in their industries. And now, the president of the United States is supporting that vision.

The problem is that Trump's tariffs will be harmful to the economy and will likely hurt the working class most — the people, in other words, who unions aim to represent. So where does this leave the long-standing union talking point that tariffs would be good for American workers? 

Manufacturing jobs in the United States have been declining for decades, and free trade — where countries can export and import goods without restrictions — is often said to be the culprit. In particular, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) gets much of the blame for lost jobs. Trump's tariffs might be “chaotic,” as Fain told NPR earlier this month. “But, you know, we've sat here for the last 30-plus years, with the inception of NAFTA back in 1993–‘94, and watched our manufacturing base in this country disappear.”

NAFTA eliminated trade barriers between the US, Canada, and Mexico. Since it took effect, many American factories moved to Mexico for cheaper labor — a financially appealing option for companies that could then produce goods for lower costs without having to worry about paying tariffs. Between 1997 and 2022, an estimated 70,500 US manufacturing establishments closed. Critics of the agreement claim that this dynamic has forced US-based manufacturing employees to accept lower wages out of fear their factories would relocate south of the border.

That outcome is why unions opposed NAFTA from the start. As the agreement was being negotiated, labor unions tried to stop it and the then-president of AFL-CIO called the agreement a “poison pill.”

Estimates vary on how many jobs have actually been lost. About 700,000 positions were eliminated directly as a result of NAFTA, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and many more as a result of other trade agreements. You can see the manufacturing industry's decline reflected in union membership. In the 1970s, UAW had a high of 1.5 million members. By 2023, the union had fewer than 400,000 members. 

As a result, unions see NAFTA and other free trade agreements as a roadblock to higher wages and long-term job security, which is why they have often advocated for more protectionist policies.

In the post-NAFTA era, the prevailing consensus among economists is that free trade has enjoyed broad political support from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington, while free trade might hurt some industries, its benefits outweigh the costs. Overall, free trade is still largely viewed as a driver of global economic growth.

But free trade doesn't mean fair trade. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 — ramping up trade between the US and China — the barrage of Chinese imports into the United States cost Americans, by some estimates, millions of jobs.

As workers' wages and job prospects struggled, evidence of the downsides of trade liberalization — particularly the widening pay gaps between workers and bosses — was hard to ignore, even by some free trade proponents. “The combination of changing patterns of trade, in which more activity takes place with low-wage economies, and new research has altered economic thinking on trade,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote in 2015. “The consensus view now is that trade and globalization have meaningfully increased inequality in the United States by allowing more earning opportunities for those at the top and exposing ordinary workers to more competition, especially in manufacturing.”

When President Barack Obama rallied to get support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement between countries in the Pacific Rim — in 2015, he faced fierce opposition from unions but also skepticism from politicians, some of whom had long railed against free trade and others who changed their minds. Trump famously opposed the policy, as did Sen. Bernie Sanders during their 2016 presidential campaigns. And Hillary Clinton, who initially praised the proposed accord, came out against it during that election season.

That's not to say that unions always oppose any kind of trade deal. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated to replace NAFTA during his first term, received union support because it included better labor protections than its predecessor. But in general, union opposition to unfettered free trade has continued. 

“In truth, our trade deals were not really trade deals; they were investment deals. Their goal was not to promote America's exports — it was to make it easier for global corporations to move capital offshore and ship goods back to America,” Richard Trumka, the former president of AFL-CIO, said in 2015. “The logical outcome was trade deficits and falling wages, and that's exactly what we got.”

For unions, tariffs were a part of the answer to failures of free trade along with other protectionist policies. But to free trade proponents, tariffs represent a break from consensus and threaten to break down trade relations across the globe.

While the way Trump has implemented tariffs has been irresponsible, the fact that he has is viewed as a step in the right direction. “Even though in [Fain's] heart of hearts he realizes that Trump has rolled these [tariffs] out in a — pick your adjective — disjointed, sloppy, incoherent manner, he believes that a lot more needs to be done to protect and preserve manufacturing in the US,” said Steven Greenhouse, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. “He rightly says that free trade has been very bad for manufacturing in the US. And in Fain's mind, an effective way to rebuild manufacturing is through tariffs.”

Tariffs can indeed be part of a solution to bolster manufacturing industries in the United States, as long as they're implemented strategically and coupled with a more coherent vision for boosting American industry, which would include subsidies and investments aimed at spurring growth in certain sectors. That's how former President Joe Biden imposed tariffs. 

But Trump's policy is too broad, inconsistent, and lacking in clear objectives. And if the pause on the tariffs does end up being temporary, his policy could throw the United States into a recession, threatening all kinds of jobs, including those in manufacturing sectors.

So while some unions and their members might support the idea of tariffs to help shore up certain industries, it's not clear that Trump's policy will get Republicans more union support in the long run, especially if the forecasts about how Trump's tariffs would impact the economy turn out to be true. And at the end of the day, it's difficult to see how Trump's blanket tariff policy will, on its own, revive American manufacturing. As my colleague Dylan Matthews wrote, the American economy has changed, transitioning from manufacturing to services, and the idea that we can reverse that trend is a “false promise.”

“I fear that the horses are out of the barn,” Greenhouse said. “It's really hard to get back those millions of manufacturing jobs.”

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, is stepping into the national spotlight this week as a key figure in a landmark Supreme Court battle over religious liberty and public education.

But it's not the kind of attention most Republicans would seek out in the deeply red state, which is also part of the colloquially named Bible Belt.

Drummond, a declared candidate for governor, is seeking to block the creation of the nation's first taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school when justices hear oral arguments on April 30. The consolidated cases before the Supreme Court involve the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, with Drummond urging the justices to uphold a state Supreme Court decision that found the publicly funded school unconstitutional.

While national conservative leaders and school choice advocates rally behind the Catholic virtual school, Drummond has emerged as its fiercest opponent. One of his most discussed talking points opposing the school rests on a slippery slope argument, claiming that if the state allows a Catholic charter school to open, it would be forced to fund “Sharia law or even Satanism.”

If the religious charter school is allowed to proceed in the state, Drummond contends that “the inevitable result will be taxpayer-funded public schools teaching Sharia law, Wicca — even the Church of Satan,” he said in a March 31 post on X.

Drummond's arguments have attempted to appeal to the state's evangelical base, even as Gov. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) has maintained a friendly posture toward religious freedom in the state.

But religious freedom experts who are critical of Drummond's approach say it reeks of fearmongering and hypocrisy, pointing out that Catholic organizations already receive public funds in Oklahoma for hospitals, foster care, and other services. 

“Religious freedom is for everyone. … Charter schools are schools of choice,” said Nicole Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School whose research focuses on education law and religious liberty. “They are designed to give parents options, and the option of a religious education is attractive to many parents.”

Earlier this month, Stitt, who is unable to seek reelection after his second term ends next year, issued an executive order directing state agencies to “root out” laws and regulations that exclude religious individuals or institutions from public programs, funds, and benefits.

Drummond's opposition also puts him sharply at odds with Republican senators such as Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), and James Lankford (R-OK) — powerful figures whose endorsements he would likely court in his gubernatorial bid. All three joined a Senate amicus brief urging the court to side against Drummond, arguing that excluding religious organizations from public charter school eligibility “would set a dangerous precedent.”

“Upholding the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act with the included exclusion of religious organizations would set a dangerous precedent, signaling that religious organizations are not welcome in public projects,” the senators wrote in an amicus brief to the high court. “This would not only violate the First Amendment, but it would also deprive society of the valuable contributions that these organizations make.”

Drummond's posture in the case has raised eyebrows in GOP circles, not just for its substance but also its timing as he makes his bid for higher office. Just three weeks ago, Drummond posted a photo at the White House on April 8 after meeting President Donald Trump at the White House.

“The President's decisive leadership on border security and illegal immigration is restoring America's safety, sovereignty, and strength,” Drummond wrote on X.

In Oklahoma, where Trump won every county in the 2024 election, Drummond's break from a conservative consensus is risky both legally and politically.

Religious charter schools have become a top priority for Republicans nationwide, fueled by court victories for religious freedom activists that have chipped away at 20th-century court interpretations of the First Amendment's establishment clause and free exercise clause.

One area of great consistency among the Supreme Court's Republican-appointed majority has been cases involving conflicts to the free exercise of religious freedoms.

One of the most prominent recent cases cited in support of St. Isidore is the 2022 case Carson v. Makin, a landmark decision that determined the free exercise clause of the First Amendment did not comport with Maine's “nonsectarian” requirement that barred the use of public vouchers to pay for tuition at religious-based private schools. Carson was one of the cases Stitt ordered Oklahoma agencies to ensure their laws and statutes adhere to throughout the state government.

Thomas Fisher, executive vice president and litigation director for EdChoice, told the Washington Examiner he believes one of St. Isidore and the charter school board's main legal pitches is that “this case is materially indistinguishable from Carson.”

Another argument from Drummond is that charter schools are inherently governmental actors because they receive public funds and are supervised by state regulators. But experts like Garnett, who has advised the St. Isidore organizers, said that places the “educational pluralism” of all charter schools in peril if the attorney general is right.

“A decision suggesting that states can transform private actors into governmental ones by slapping the label ‘public' on them would also threaten the autonomy and religious liberty of private organizations that receive government funds to advance a range of public goals, including poverty alleviation, social services, healthcare and many others,” Garnett wrote for the Wall Street Journal. “Either charter schools are government actors or they aren't.”

When asked whether Fisher had any concerns about possible applications for extremists, such as Drummond's concerns, he noted there would still be a high bar to obtain a religious charter that would likely deter any of his hypothetical dilemmas concerning satanic schools.

“It takes too much money to pull together what you need to have a successful application,” Fisher said.

“States have very rigorous requirements, and they can still have all those rigorous requirements and quality controls and insistence on demonstrations of the ability to deliver quality education, and somebody who's just trying to pull a stunt with some offensive sounding scary type of charter school is not going to have the resources for that sort of thing,” Fisher added.

More than 50 elected officials, scholars, and advocacy groups have backed the school's creation. In a joint statement organized by Stitt, they argue that denying a religious charter school is itself discriminatory and violates the free exercise clause.

Drummond's stance is so unusual for the Trump era of conservatism that he also finds himself aligned with progressive groups, such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which also filed suit against the school.

Oklahoma's top education official since 2023, Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, defended against Drummond's efforts to stymie his own work reinterpreting the state's role in public education.

“I've been really disappointed in the attorney general's position on this,” Walters told the Washington Examiner. “I was elected by the people of Oklahoma, and I'm saying they are crystal clear that they want their religious liberties respected.

Walters's work has focused primarily on addressing the state's historically troublesome quality in public education, defending rights to present Christian values in schools, and implementing Trump's education agenda on the state level.

While Walters has not made any declaration for a governorship, he has long been rumored to announce a run, which would raise the stakes of this court hearing as the justices determine which side has correctly interpreted the law.

Oklahomans “understand that the Bible, Christian father, play a major role in American history and they think America should go back to protecting their communities, to go back to not running Christians out of education, out of our schools,” Walters said, noting he believes “you're seeing an AG out of step with conservatives and Oklahomans.”

At the heart of the case is the age-old tension between the First Amendment's two religion clauses — the establishment clause, which bars government from endorsing religion, and the free exercise clause, which protects individuals and groups from being excluded because of their faith.

“The U.S. Constitution protects St. Isidore's freedom to participate in Oklahoma's charter-school program, and it supports the board's decision to provide more high-quality, no-cost educational options for Oklahoma families,” said Jim Campbell, chief legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which defended the board as Drummond attempted to cancel the school's contract in court.

The justices could use the Oklahoma case to clarify how far states can go in excluding religious entities from public programs. 

However, with Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused — likely due to past ties to Notre Dame and personal connections to lawyers in the case — it's not out of the realm of possibility that the justices could rule in a 4-4 split, which could jeopardize the petitioners' chances to see St. Isidore's charter plan through or leave the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling in Drummond's favor intact.

For Drummond, the fight is one that he sees as an important line in the sand for the separation of church and state. But that line is one that advocates of recent shifts in religious freedom interpretations at the high court say has long been used as an exclusionary device against people of all religious backgrounds.

The Washington Examiner reached out to a representative for Drummond.

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., gives retirement announcement from home in Springfield where he announced his first Senate bid.

Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton picked up an endorsement from Sen. Tammy Duckworth in the primary to succeed the retiring Sen. Dick Durbin. 

Stratton launched her campaign last week after Durbin, an 80-year-old who was first elected to the Senate in 1996, announced he would not seek re-election in 2026. She was endorsed last week by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

"Juliana has not only proven to be an experienced and effective Lieutenant Governor -- she's demonstrated time and again that she truly understands and cares for working people," Duckworth, who represented Illinois, told Politico.

"I'd be honored to have her by my side in the Senate as we work to deliver real results for Illinoisans, and I'm proud to endorse her campaign," she added.

In her campaign launch video, Stratton said, "Donald Trump and Elon Musk are trying to distract us to create such a mess that we don't even know where to start. But in Washington, they're still doing the same old things they've always done, and that old playbook isn't working." 

Stratton described herself as the daughter of a teacher and Navy veteran from the South Side of Chicago, and a mother of four. 

She told Politico that she was "honored" by Duckworth's endorsement and that "Tammy is a true leader for Illinois who doesn't back down from a challenge."

The outlet also reported that Stratton had previously appeared alongside Duckworth to support the Asian American community during Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

Last Wednesday, Durbin said, "The decision of whether to run for re-election has not been easy." 

"I truly love the job of being a United States Senator. But in my heart, I know it's time to pass the torch. So, I am announcing today that I will not be seeking re-election at the end of my term," he added.

Durbin becomes the fourth Democrat in the Senate whose term is up at the end of next year who decided against seeking re-election in the 2026 midterms, joining Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Gary Peters of Michigan, and Tina Smith of Minnesota.

Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, shares why a low-glycemic index diet is essential for healthy glucose levels and reduced inflammation.

As Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications continue to grow in popularity for weight loss, a concoction dubbed "oatzempic" is trending.

The blended beverage, which consists of oats, lime juice, water and sometimes cinnamon, has been described on social media as a "weight-loss drink."

Some TikTok users have shared their own experiences with oatzempic.

POPULAR COFFEE ALTERNATIVE MAY HELP PREVENT CANCER, SAY EXPERTS

After 24 days of consistently drinking the beverage, TikTok user @fred_ddy92 reported that it's "definitely working" in terms of helping him lose weight.

The content creator stressed that it's "not a meal replacement" — but said it does make him feel full.

Registered dietitian Sara Riehm, a certified specialist in obesity and weight management at Orlando Health Center for Health Improvement, shared her thoughts in an interview with Fox News Digital.

"While it's not likely to yield much weight loss on its own, it could be a helpful tool as part of a larger, more comprehensive weight-loss plan," she said.

CHICK-FIL-A FOOD AND EMPLOYEES HELPED MAN LOSE WEIGHT AND CHANGE HIS LIFE

Oatzempic is not likely to be effective as a solo tool for weight loss, Riehm reiterated, but it could be part of a healthy diet and exercise program. 

"Oatzempic only becomes dangerous when you consume it as your sole source of nutrition," she said. "It should be added as a supplement to your intake, not a substitute."

Oats are full of soluble fiber, the dietitian noted, which slows digestion and "keeps us feeling fuller for longer."

"Starting your day with a soluble fiber food source (or drink like this) could help you stay satiated and make it easier to make healthier choices throughout the day," Riehm said. 

"The cinnamon adds some nice flavor, but I'd say it's OK to skip the lime juice."

While some experts claim that lime juice can speed up metabolism, Riehm said there "isn't much scientific evidence to support this claim — especially in the amount recommended for this drink."

She would consider adding an oatzempic-inspired drink to breakfast if there isn't already enough soluble fiber, like whole grains or fruit, the expert said.

"If you aren't consuming breakfast at all, this is also a good, quick option," she said. 

"It's hard to make good decisions when we're hungry, so this is a great way to set yourself up for success with your nutrition choices throughout the rest of the day."

RESTAURANT OFFERS FOOD DISCOUNT TO  'SKINNY' CUSTOMERS WHO CAN SQUEEZE THROUGH BARS

Robin DeCicco, a certified holistic nutritionist in New York, told Fox News Digital that she's more skeptical of the trend as a form of weight loss.

"This is not a healthy way to promote weight loss."

"People will do anything for a quick fix and to avoid doing the work of actually changing behaviors and learning how to eat for individual health," she said.

"This is not a healthy way to promote weight loss," she asserted. "It's another way to avoid learning how to eat nutritionally dense foods consistently, move more and sit less, and focus on making healthier lifestyle choices."

While she agreed that oats contain fiber, which promotes satiety and blood sugar control and can ward off cravings for starchy and sugary foods, DeCicco said that isn't enough to warrant the use of the drink for weight loss.

"Maybe this is helping certain people prevent sugar cravings and eat less because they were previously not including any fiber in their diet, but I think it's a big reach to say that half a cup of oats is the reason people are losing weight," she said.

"If the American public started to eat more fiber, they would absolutely feel fuller, snack less, weigh less and prevent more disease." (iStock)

She does recommend increasing fiber intake, however.

"If the American public started to eat more fiber, they would absolutely feel fuller, snack less, weigh less and prevent more disease," DeCicco said.

If oatzempic does have any effect on weight loss, it could be because it simply has fewer calories than a "regular" meal, DeCicco suggested.

"If you reduce calories from even one meal a day, you're more likely to lose weight," she said.

"However, this is not a long-term solution to weight loss. It's not sustainable to drink liquid meals for long periods of time, so most [people] will gain the weight back."

"It's not sustainable to drink liquid meals for long periods of time, so most [people] will gain the weight back," one expert said. (iStock)

The drink also "falls short in many areas, such as not including antioxidants from vegetables or fruit or any good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids."

"Long-term weight loss is individually based," DeCicco said.

It requires "consistency and a change in habits and behaviors."

Kentucky state Sen. Jimmy Higdon spoke with Fox News Digital about his concerns with his state's rollout of REAL ID and why he believes there needs to be an extension to the May deadline.

A Kentucky lawmaker is urging the federal government to delay its forthcoming REAL ID deadline as his state and others face a whirlwind of logistical issues.

"Kentucky wants to comply with REAL ID, but we're simply not ready. And we're not alone. At least 17 other states are still below 50% compliance, and 30 states are below 70% compliance," Republican Kentucky state Sen. Jimmy Higdon told Fox News Digital.

"If we flip the switch now, millions of Americans could be denied access to air travel and federal buildings. We need more time, and that's a reasonable request."

REAL ID was first created by law in 2005, but the federal government has delayed its implementation multiple times – most recently in 2022. But the Trump administration has made clear that the current May 7 deadline is final.

Higdon and his colleagues in the Kentucky state Senate wrote to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Secretary Kristi Noem last week seeking an extension. 

"I can tell you for a fact, I'm hearing from constituents and my fellow legislators, ‘Hey, this is a problem. This is a real problem,'" he told Fox News Digital.

The Kentucky Republican called on other state officials to reach out to Noem and ask for a delay as well.

"We're not alone here in Kentucky. We're not the lone ranger when it comes to non-compliance. We're at 40%," he said. "We're simply not ready."

Indeed, a recent CBS News analysis found that Pennsylvania, Maine and Washington were among the states that came in under 40% compliance. New Jersey's compliance rate was just 17% as of April 18, according to the study.

The Trump administration has argued that finally acting on REAL ID helps the White House's crackdown on illegal immigrants, millions of whom have entered the country since President Donald Trump was last in office.

But Higdon said there was confusion over what REAL ID is. He described long lines and a dearth of appointments as Kentuckians have scrambled to meet the deadline.

"It's almost a panic of sorts trying to get the REAL ID, a lot of people don't understand it," Higdon said. "The media's done a good job of letting people know the deadline's approaching. But a lot think they need a real ID, and they don't if there's other means of real ID – a passport, passport card, military ID – all those things work."

"And if you don't plan to travel, if you're not going to get on a commercial airline flight or visit a military base or federal courthouse, you really don't need that REAL ID-compliant ID" 

'MASS SURVEILLANCE': CONSERVATIVES SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP ADMIN'S REAL ID ROLLOUT

Starting May 7, a REAL ID will be needed for domestic airline travel – rather than a normal state-issued license – as well as in areas where federal identification is required, but having a REAL ID itself is not required.

Higdon suggested giving Americans another year to catch up, noting that people had grown used to the government delaying the deadline over the last two decades.

"I think we've trained people to ignore that deadline," he said. "So, if we're going forward in a year to get the word out, ‘Hey, this is it. We're either going to do away with REAL ID or we're gonna make it mandatory this time next year,' I think that would definitely help."

But it appears the Trump administration is not budging.

In response to Kentucky legislators' request, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) told Fox News Digital, "Beginning on May 7, passengers will need a REAL ID or another acceptable form of identification to fly, like a passport or military ID. TSA is committed to enforcing the law, as directed by Congress."

"Non-compliant passengers may expect wait times or additional measures at airports. If you are an illegal alien without a REAL ID, the only way you will be permitted to fly is if you are self-deporting," TSA said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday thanked North Korea for sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Moscow's war against Ukraine and vowed not to forget their sacrifices.

Putin's comments came just hours after North Korea confirmed for the first time that it had deployed troops to fight Ukrainian forces.

Russia said two days earlier that its troops had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, which Ukrainian forces seized last year. Ukrainian officials have denied Russia's claim and said that the operation in certain areas of Kursk is ongoing.

In a statement, Putin praised North Korean troops who he said fought "shoulder to shoulder with Russian fighters, defended our Motherland as their own."

"The Russian people will never forget the heroism of the DPRK special forces," Putin said. "We will always honor the heroes who gave their lives for Russia, for our common freedom, fighting side by side with their Russian brothers in arms."

Earlier Monday, North Korea's Central Military Commission said the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, had sent troops to Russia to "annihilate and wipe out the Ukrainian neo-Nazi occupiers and liberate the Kursk area in cooperation with the Russian armed forces." North Korean troops eventually made "an important contribution" to Russia seizing the border territory, the commission said.

While this was North Korea's first official confirmation that its troops were deployed to Russia, it has repeatedly expressed its unwavering support of Russia's war against Ukraine.

U.S., South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence officials have said North Korea deployed 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia last fall in its first involvement in a major armed conflict since the Korean War in the early 1950s.

Putin and Kim said the deployment of North Korean troops was made under a mutual defense treaty signed in June 2024 that requires both countries to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked.

The two U.S. adversaries have moved significantly closer to each other in recent years.

In addition to its deployment of troops, North Korea has been supplying a large number of conventional weapons to Russia. South Korea and the U.S. are concerned that Russia could reward North Korea with military and economic assistance, including by transferring high-tech weapons technologies that can bolster its nuclear weapons program.

Kim citing North Korea's role in Russia regaining control of the Kursk region suggests his urgent desire to receive what he wants from Russia, including its sensitive military technologies and a solid security commitment to North Korea, according to Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russia could provide military assistance to North Korea if necessary in accordance with the defense treaty, Russian state media reported.

North Korea and Russia did not disclose how many North Korean soldiers were sent to Russia or how many casualties they suffered. But last month, South Korea's military assessed that roughly 4,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in the Russia-Ukraine war. The South Korean military also said North Korea sent about 3,000 additional troops to Russia earlier this year.

South Korea's Unification Ministry on Monday called on North Korea to withdraw its troops from Russia immediately, arguing that the North's support of Russia's invasion of Ukraine poses a grave provocation to international security. Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoungsam also called the North's deployment of troops "an act against humanity."

If Russia's retaking of Kursk is confirmed, it would deprive Ukraine of key leverage in U.S.-brokered efforts to negotiate an end to the war by exchanging its gains for some Russia-occupied land in Ukraine.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday he doubts Putin wants to end the war. Just a day before, Trump had said Ukraine and Russia were "very close to a deal."

One man is dead and six others were wounded after gunfire erupted early Sunday morning on the campus of Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina. 

The small historically black university was celebrating its annual “Viking Fest” when the shooting happened, according to reports. It was the last day of the weeklong celebration at the college, and the shooting occurred around 12:30 a.m. A 24-year-old man was killed, and six others were wounded. 

Three of the injured were university students, according to reports. The deceased victim was not a student at the university. Law enforcement agencies were investigating the shooting on Sunday, and the school instituted a campus lockdown that lasted most of Sunday before being lifted.

Elizabeth City State University issued a press release on Sunday about the shooting.

“The incident took place following Yard Fest, part of the Viking Fest events held in the quad area,” the university's release reads. “Six individuals were injured during the incident. Four sustained gunshot wounds, including three ECSU students. Additionally, two other ECSU students were injured during the subsequent commotion. Fortunately, none of the injuries are considered life-threatening, and all the injured were transported to a local hospital for treatment.” 

“A 24-year-old man, who was not an ECSU student, was pronounced deceased,” the release notes. “His identity is being withheld pending notification of his next of kin.”

Several students described what happened as the shooting occurred.

“We were just having fun,” one student told a local media outlet. “They were playing music, everybody was dancing. And then a short moment after that, there were pops happening, and everybody started running in the same direction.”

“I heard the gunshots through my window and through the walls,” student Mark Hurlbut told WITN. “Campus honestly didn't send out any alerts of any kind until maybe 20-30 minutes after it happened. I didn't think nothing of it, but then it finally clicked. This happened right outside my door.”

GENDER AND THE POLITICS OF GENERATION Z

Elizabeth City State University is a small college located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, about 50 miles south of Norfolk, Virginia, according to reports. There are approximately 2,500 students enrolled at the college, and it is part of the University of North Carolina system. 

“ECSU extends its deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragic event and remains committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of the Viking community,” the university said.

China on Monday once again denied that it is in talks to resolve its tariff war with the United States, after a series of statements by President Donald Trump and his aides suggesting trade negotiations were underway.

"Let me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a press conference.

Guo also appeared to reject Trump's claim, in an interview with TIME last week, that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him.

"As far as I know, there have not been any calls between the two presidents recently," the spokesman said.

The latest blanket denial was in line with Beijing's hardline stance against Trump's massive 145% tariffs on imports from China, a top supplier of U.S. goods.

Trump administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, insist that the U.S. is better positioned to win a trade war than China is. 

But American business owners and analysts are raising alarms that the effective trade embargo with China could soon result in major economic consequences, including higher prices, product shortages and store closures.

Against that backdrop — and Trump's recent claim that his administration will be finished crafting new trade deals with numerous countries in as little as three or four weeks — some U.S. officials have expressed more openness toward a dialogue with Beijing.

"Every day we are in conversation with China," Trump's Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, said Sunday on CNN.

When told that the Chinese deny this, Rollins said, "Well, according to our team in Washington, the conversations are ongoing regarding multiples of trade, multiples of the trade goods that are coming out and going in."

"The bottom line with China is this, they need us more than we need them," she said.

Asked on Sunday why China would deny that negotiations are underway, Bessent said, "Well, I think they're playing to a different audience."

Pressed to explain whether the talks are actually happening, he said, "We have a process in place. And again, I just believe these Chinese tariffs are unsustainable."

Bessent predicted last week that a "de-escalation" with China was coming in the "very near future."

On Monday morning, he pointed to that prospective de-escalation to help explain why he was not yet concerned that U.S. consumers could soon face empty store shelves.

"Not at present," Bessent said on Fox News, when asked if he was concerned about "empty shelves." 

"We have some great retailers. I assume they pre-ordered. I think we'll see some elasticities and I think we'll see replacements, and then we will see how quickly the Chinese want to de-escalate," said Bessent.

In a separate interview Monday morning on CNBC's "Squawk Box," Bessent put the onus for that de-escalation on China, before saying he would not negotiate through the press.

China has consistently demanded that Trump, who has held up tariffs as both a powerful negotiating tool and way to rake in government revenue, scrap his sweeping import taxes.

"If the U.S. really wants to resolve the problem ... it should cancel all the unilateral measures on China," a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said last week.

That statement, translated from Mandarin by CNBC, was itself a response to Trump's claim on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials "had a meeting this morning."

"We've been meeting with China," Trump told reporters, while declining to specify who was meeting whom.

A day earlier, Trump said that U.S. officials were "actively" talking with China.

Elon Musk may skirt more than $2 billion in possible financial liabilities by exercising his influence over the federal government, a new report from Senate Democratic committee staffers out Monday alleges.

Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' has brought sweeping changes to Washington with its slash-and-burn campaign to gut agencies and purge the federal workforce. President Donald Trump has avidly supported Musk's cuts.

As he appears poised to step back from his DOGE work in the coming weeks, Democrats are accusing the world's richest person of using his influence to "evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses—on his terms and at his command."

The report, compiled by Democratic staff of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), found that on the day of Trump's inauguration, Musk and his companies were facing at least 65 "actual or potential" regulatory or enforcement actions from 11 federal agencies. These actions totaled at least $2.37 billion in potential liability, the senators wrote.

According to the 44-page memo, the potential liabilities included $1.19 billion at Tesla for allegedly making misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.

Neuralink faced $281 million in possible liability for allegedly making false statements about risks from its product, per the memo.

Additionally, the company could have been forced to pay $1.59 million in civil and criminal penalties for alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act.

"The through line connecting many of Mr. Musk's decisions appears to be self-enrichment and avoiding what he perceives as obstacles to advancing his interests," reads the memo.

"The truth is that the breathtaking scope and scale of benefits Mr. Musk is gaining from his present position may never be known, and that is by design. The silence is strategic, and it is dangerous," it says.

In the wake of the memo, the committee's ranking member, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, Conn., sent letters to five Musk-led companies — SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company and xAI — asking them to provide information on the federal investigations they faced prior to Trump's inauguration.

CNBC has reached out to the companies for comment.

The letters also requests a rundown of the steps each company has taken to keep Musk's government work separate from those probes. Blumenthal asks the companies to respond by May 11.

The White House sharply rejected any suggestion that Musk has used his role in government for "personal or financial gain," saying "any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory."

Blumenthal "is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable [sic] case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has wilted his brain," White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement.

Companies are expected to raise prices in response to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.

While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called "Liberation Day." On April 2, he announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from most countries, except Canada and Mexico. China faces even higher rates of up to 245% on some goods, the White House said on April 16. Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US.

"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again," Trump said during his remarks.

Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce.

"The tariffs are larger than forecasters expected, certainly larger than we expected in our upside case," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. "Our role is to make sure this will be a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process."

Powell said the Federal Reserve is monitoring how much prices rise, which is still unclear.

Beginning at the end of 2024, some companies warned that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. While it's still possible they could absorb some of the costs of the tariffs, here are the companies that have warned of price increases.

The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up."

"To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025," Shein's statement said.

Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping.

In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole.

Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs.

Ford, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates "the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production." Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now.

On April 14, Trump told reporters that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the US.

Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.

Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico.

It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains "volatile" and changes hourly.

According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports.

The company said it would provide more details on its pricing changes in response to the tariffs by mid-April.

Kjell Gruner, Volkswagen's North America chief executive officer, recently said the carmaker would keep prices steady through the end of May but that they could increase in June.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices.

"Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex," Barry said. "We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely."

Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce.

"Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days," Cornell said.

Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: "Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months."

Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating "a variety of different scenarios" to plan for new tariffs under Trump.

"And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market," Allan said, adding that "there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price."

Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on November 19 that the company will likely raise prices if Trump's tariff proposals are implemented.

"We never want to raise prices," he said. "Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers."

The company's CEO, Doug McMillan, said during a February earnings call that "tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that."

Tim Boyle, the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, told analysts on an October earnings call that the company was "very concerned about the imposition of tariffs. " He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, "trade wars are not good and not easy to win."

Boyle also told The Washington Post in October that the company was "set to raise prices."

"It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans," he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that "we need some surety about what is going to happen" before making price changes.

Philip Daniele, the CEO of the auto-parts company AutoZone, told analysts on a September earnings call that tariff policies had "ebbed and flowed over the years," and if Trump implemented more tariffs, "we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer."

"We generally raise prices ahead of that," Daniele said, adding that prices would gradually settle over time. "So, that's historically what we've done," he said.

Trump's 25% tariff on car imports is expected to increase manufacturing costs by anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.

P&G, the consumer goods company behind brands like Tide and Charmin, is looking at raising prices on new and existing products.

CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC price hikes are "likely."

"We will have to pull every lever we have in our arsenal to mitigate the impact of tariffs within our cost structure and P&L," P&G's CFO, Andre Schulten, said on a call with reporters.

The company is evaluating "exactly what is the right plan by brand, by market, what combination of pricing, over what period of time," Schulten added.

Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari said in March it'd raise prices by up to 10% on certain models imported to the US starting April 2.

The change was made "based on the preliminary information currently available regarding the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA," the company said.

Eric du Halgouët, executive vice president of finance at the company, told analysts on a call in April that Hermès, the luxury retailer known for its iconic Birkin handbags, hadn't yet been impacted by the tariffs, but said the company would raise prices in the US in May.

"The price increase that we're going to implement will be just for the US. Since it's aimed at offsetting the increase in tariffs, that only applies to the American market," du Halgouët said on the call.

While Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console won't see a price hike over tariffs, Nintendo said accessories for the Switch 2 "will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions."

"Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions," the company added in its announcement.

The company also delayed preorders for the Switch 2 in the wake of the tariffs.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s trading desk is turning tactically bullish on US equities, predicting that tailwinds including Big Tech earnings and trade deal announcements will continue to lift stocks after the recent rout.

Still, the bank was quick to emphasize in a note to clients Monday that the rally's momentum could fade within weeks, with the negative impacts of US tariffs poised to begin dragging on the economy in the months ahead.

Investors have continued to pull money from so-called ESG funds in early 2025 amid an "intensifying" backlash fueled by President Trump's "anti-climate agenda" and his administration's policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a new Morningstar report.

Also known as socially responsible, sustainable, impact or values-based investing, "environmental, social and governance" funds let people invest according to certain values like climate change or corporate diversity.

Investors withdrew $6.1 billion from ESG funds in the first three months of 2025, after yanking out $4.3 billion in Q4 2024, according to Morningstar.

The exodus in Q1 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of outflows.

"The continued loss of appetite among US investors for sustainable funds can be partly attributed to an anti-ESG backlash, which has intensified since the return of President Trump to the White House," according to the report.

As of the end of Q1, U.S. investors held $330 billion in ESG funds, about 10% of the global total.

Even before Trump took office, persistently high interest rates weighed on performance in segments of the ESG market, like clean energy and other "green" stocks, according to Morningstar. Higher borrowing costs burden the renewables sector because the projects can be capital-intensive.

But Trump added additional pressure.

Within days of his inauguration, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris agreement, blocked subsidies for electric vehicles, pushed for more fossil-fuel production and started a "huge pushback" against DEI policies, Diana Iovanel, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note in March.

In late March, the Republican-led Securities and Exchange Commission stopped defending a climate-change disclosure rule in court. There's also uncertainty about the fate of the Inflation Reduction Act, a historic climate change mitigation law signed by President Joe Biden.

Even before Trump's second term began, at least 18 Republican-led states had adopted "anti-ESG legislation," prompting some large asset managers to "pare back" their ESG efforts, Iovanel wrote.

Trump also signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI-related mandates and programs within the federal government, prompting major corporations like Walmart (WMT), Lowe's (LOW) and Meta (META) to begin "scaling back their DEI commitments," Morningstar wrote.

Despite the headwinds, Trump's agenda "isn't 'game over' for ESG investing," Iovanel wrote.

Demand for ESG investments "is here to stay" even in the face of political pressure, she wrote.

For one, despite Republican antipathy for ESG investing, it also has ample support, Iovanel wrote. States such as California have implemented pro-ESG regulations, and surveys indicate most large asset managers (including ones in the U.S.) invest in ESG assets despite the apparent controversy, she wrote.

Demand among individual investors also appears relatively high, especially among younger investors, analysts said.

About 84% of individual investors in the U.S. are interested in sustainable investing, according to a 2024 Morgan Stanley survey. Roughly two thirds, 65%, of respondents said their interest had increased in the prior two years.

While critics deride it as "woke" capitalism, advocates say there's a strong investment thesis for ESG.

Specifically, they argue that ESG investing positions investors for higher long-term returns because companies that adopt such practices are poised to be more resilient, and therefore more successful, than peers.

Silver Lake Management and P2 Capital Partners are exploring a potential sale of Blackhawk Network, seeking more than $5 billion for the prepaid gift card provider, people familiar with the matter said.

The private equity firms are working with advisers to weigh options for the company, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the details aren't public. They are also considering an initial public offering for the company, the people said.

A Bitcoin statue in San Bartolo Plaza in Ilopango, El Salvador.

Cryptocurrency investors waded back into the market last week, riding a surge in Bitcoin. 

Exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin and Ether attracted more than $3.2 billion last week, with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) alone seeing a nearly $1.5 billion inflow — the most this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Other Bitcoin-focused funds also saw meaningful infusions, with investors adding more than $620 million to the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and roughly $574 million into the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).

Chinese e-tailer Temu has started adding "import charges" of about 145% in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The fees, which began cropping up over the weekend after price hikes went into effect on Friday, cost more than the individual products consumers are buying and can more than double the price of a typical order.

For example, a summer dress sold on Temu for $18.47 will cost $44.68 after $26.21 in import charges are added to the bill, a 142% surcharge, a CNBC analysis shows. A child's bathing suit priced at $12.44 will cost shoppers $31.12 when the $18.68 import charge is taken into account, a staggering 150% fee. A handheld vacuum cleaner listed at $16.93 now costs $40.11 when factoring in an import charge of $21.68, which is a roughly 137% markup.

"Items imported into the U.S. may be subject to import charges. These charges cover all customs-related processes and costs, including import fees paid to customs authorities on your behalf," Temu explains on its website. "The amount listed may not represent the actual amount paid to customs authorities." 

Representatives from Temu didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rival discount retailer Shein has also hiked prices on its site, but it doesn't appear to be implementing import charges. The company added a banner at checkout that states, "Tariffs are included in the price you pay. You'll never have to pay extra at delivery."

The moves come after Temu and Shein warned earlier this month that they would raise their prices after Trump slapped a 145% tariff on many imports from China and vowed to end the de minimis exemption on May 2. The widely criticized loophole helped accelerate Temu and Shein's growth in the U.S. because it allowed most packages to enter the country duty free, as long as the imports were valued under $800. 

"Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up," Temu said on its site earlier this month. "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025."

The import fees erode the value proposition that made Temu popular with consumers in the first place. Temu, which is owned by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, has skyrocketed in popularity in the U.S. since its launch in 2022 by blanketing the internet with ads proclaiming users can "Shop like a billionaire." Though shipping times could be long, consumers flocked to the site because the rock-bottom prices on clothing, electronics and home goods made the extra wait worth it.

Temu allowed cash-strapped consumers struggling to afford essentials like groceries and housing to splurge on nice-to-have items like new clothes or home decor without the steep price tag. Now, the prices of many of its products will be more aligned with U.S. competitors like Amazon, Walmart and Target, but could still take more than a week to arrive.

Temu has sharply slashed its online ad spending in the U.S. since Trump announced sweeping tariffs. Temu's ranking in Apple's app store has since plummeted to No. 73, after consistently ranking in the top 10, according to Sensor Tower data. Shein is currently at 54, down from 15 last month.

Temu shoppers have flooded a Reddit forum with posts decrying the tariff-induced import charges in the days since the company raised prices. In one post titled "R.I.P. Temu, it was nice while it lasted," a user wrote that the price of items "went flying up" on Friday.

"From shopping like a billionaire to shopping like a peasant in one day," a user wrote in a separate Reddit post on Saturday.

Macinzi Morris, a Temu customer who lives in southeastern Missouri, said she ordered a set of succulent pots for $12.25 before the company began raising prices. By Friday, the pots went up to $30, she said.

Morris buys yoga supplies, clothing and a variety of other products from the site "a couple times a month," but she expects to shop elsewhere now that Temu items are more expensive.

"There's no point in paying a 140% upcharge when I can get the same thing on Amazon for the same price and usually get it a little faster," Morris said.

Some news outlets and consumers have tracked modest price increases on individual items sold on Temu — before the import charges. It appears the new fees are only being tacked on to products that aren't sold from local warehouses in the U.S. Over the last year, Temu has worked to build out U.S.-based distribution centers to shield itself from trade tensions and has reportedly pushed some sellers to store inventory in the U.S. 

Recently, Temu has been promoting products that ship to U.S. consumers locally over those that ship directly from China. That trend has only ramped up as the company hikes prices and adds extra fees.

For example, a scan of Temu's "lightning deals" page on Monday showed more than 75% of the products offered had a "local" tag on them. When consumers click on the items, a bright green banner with the words "no import charges" is highlighted at the top.

IBM on Monday announced it will invest $150 billion in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers.

"We have been focused on American jobs and manufacturing since our founding 114 years ago, and with this investment and manufacturing commitment we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world's most advanced computing and AI capabilities," IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in a release.   

The company's announcement comes weeks after President Donald Trump unveiled a far-reaching and aggressive "reciprocal" tariff policy to boost manufacturing in the U.S. As of late April, Trump has exempted chips, as well as smartphones, computers, and other tech devices and components, from the tariffs.

IBM said its investment will help accelerate America's role as a global leader in computing and fuel the economy. The company said it operates the "world's largest fleet of quantum computer systems," and will continue to build and assemble them in the U.S., according to the release.

IBM competitor Nvidia, the chipmaker that has been the primary benefactor of the artificial intelligence boom, announced a similar push earlier this month to manufacture its NVIDIA AI supercomputers entirely in the U.S. 

Nvidia plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. via its manufacturing partnerships over the next four years.

Last week, IBM reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. The company said it generated $14.54 billion in revenue for the period, above the $14.4 billion expected by analysts. IBM's net income fell to $1.06 billion, or $1.12 per share, from $1.61 billion, or $1.72 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.

IBM's infrastructure division, which includes mainframe computers, posted $2.89 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating expectations of $2.76 billion.

The company announced a new z17 AI mainframe earlier this month.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it's up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with the US due to the imbalance of trade between the two nations.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday put the responsibility for reaching a trade agreement on China.

"I believe that it's up to China to de-escalate, because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable," Bessent said during an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box."

The comments come with markets on edge over the direction of tariffs following President Donald Trump's April 2 announcement of broad-based global duties. A week later, Trump said he would keep in place 10% across-the-board tariffs but table for 90 days more aggressive levies against individual trading partners.

Since then, the U.S. has made progress in negotiations, Bessent said, singling out India for a potential deal in coming days among 15 to 18 "important trading relationships" that are subject of negotiations.

"We've had many countries come forward and present some very good proposals, and we're evaluating those," he said.

"I would guess that India would be one of the first trade deals we would sign. So watch this space," Bessent added.

In addition to his assessment of the situation with China and other Asian countries, Bessent charged that European nations are likely "in a panic" over the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar since the trade tensions began. The euro has risen nearly 10% this year against the greenback after the currencies had reached near parity in early January.

"You're going to see the [European Central Bank] start cutting rates to try to get the euro back down," Bessent said. "Europeans don't want a strong euro. We have a strong-dollar policy."

Administration officials have sent mixed signals recently regarding the state of negotiations.

Trump last week said he was talking with Chinese officials about trade as they visited Washington. However, other reports indicated that negotiations were not taking place as the officials instead were in town for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings.

Bessent insisted that the White House will not be conducting negotiations in the press.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that International Monetary Fund meetings took place last week.

The clock is ticking on trade deals that the U.S. will need to strike with many nations, most notably China, to avoid what Trump's Treasury Secretary has described as an "unsustainable" tariffs war. But in the U.S. farming sector, the damage has already been done and the economic crisis already begun.

U.S. agriculture exporters say the global backlash to President Trump's tariffs is punishing them, especially a decline in Chinese buying of U.S. farm products, leading to cancelled export orders and layoffs. Peter Friedmann, executive director of the Agriculture Transportation Coalition, a leading export trade group for farmers, tells CNBC the number of canceled purchases of U.S. agriculture should not be described as approaching a crisis. "It is a full-blown crisis already," he said.

Data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday revealed China made its biggest cancellation of pork orders since 2020, halting a shipment of 12,000 tons of pork.

AgTC says "massive" financial losses are already being shared by its members as a result of the trade war, based on reports it is receiving from member companies.

A wood pulp and paperboard exporter reported to the trade group the immediate cancellation or hold of 6,400 metric tons in a warehouse and a hold of 15 railcars sitting in what is known in the supply chain as "demurrage," when fees are charged for delayed movement of goods. Meanwhile, the exporter said there are 9,000 metric tons on the water to China expected to arrive on May 13 and facing the threat of costly diversion to Chinese bonded warehouses or to other countries as Chinese buyers may refuse the cargo and abandon it at port.

One grass seed exporter told AgTC it received two weeks notice that eight loads were being canceled by Chinese customers despite vessels bookings already being in place.

At a recent stakeholder meeting at the Port of Oakland headquarters regarding tariff impacts, Port of Oakland Executive Director Kristi McKenney warned that a tariff-induced downturn in the port's cargo volume — whether from import slowdowns or retaliatory export losses — ultimately could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.

McKenney cited retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, as well as manufactured goods, as essential exports that move through Oakland. Exports include almonds, beef, pork, dairy, and recycled materials, much of which is destined for Asia. China ranks as the port's top import trading partner and third export partner, representing 29% of Oakland's total trade volume.  

Unlike many U.S. ports that lean heavily on imports, Oakland is unique in maintaining a near 50/50 balance of imports and exports. That leaves Oakland concerned that tariff retaliation would directly impact its top export destinations — Japan, Taiwan, China, and South Korea — and could significantly erode California's market share for perishable and high-value commodities.

The Port of Oakland is the No. 1 refrigerated export gateway in the U.S and nearly all containerized cargo moving through Northern California goes through the Port of Oakland.

"So many local, union jobs depend on the Port's robust shipping operations including dockworkers, truck operators, and warehouse workers," said Democratic Party Congresswoman Lateefah Simon. "I support smart trade policies that uplift workers and lower costs for Oakland's working families – not an illogical and retaliatory trade war."

Agricultural exporters are warning that there are not additional markets to quickly replace China's demand and absorb the volume, and that is already impacting prices.

"We have diverted employees and production to other (less profitable) production and dramatically slowed down purchasing from independent venders (loggers, truckers, sawmills)," one lumber exporter reported to AgTC.  Some products have already declined 20% in market value, the lumber exporter reported, which it said will influence inventory planning and future investments. "The U.S. market was stable and improving, but now awash with inventory of former China products," it added.

An exporter of forage such as hay and straw that is a big business for U.S. farms supplying overseas livestock operations reported 68 blanked sailings after Trump's "Liberation Day" limiting its ability to export forage goods, with vessel space for exports restricted on freight ships still calling on U.S. ports.

"The worry is the vessel space that remains is going to be the most expensive/most 'premium' services that our product cannot absorb without selling at a loss. Being a high volume, low value item, we cannot afford drastic increases in ocean freight," the forage exported reported to AgTC.

There has been a sharp decline in China to U.S. vessel traffic, down 22.15% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year through April 14, according to the Vizion Global Ocean Bookings Tracker.

"What we've seen in the last two weeks is a continued correction in booking demand for U.S. imports, especially U.S. imports from China," said Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion. "We are now seeing this translate to a drop in departures as well," he added.

A hay exporter in Central Washington that sends a large amount of its crop output to Hong Kong and mainland China was told to reroute most of the exports shipped in the past two weeks to Japan, Dubai, Taiwan, and a few Chinese ports. Those changes came a cost to the company, and it told the AgTC, "it's not sustainable, no one can replace all the volume that China buys."

The hay exporter immediately put a stop on all orders in process, and has begun layoffs.

"We had to adjust our employee count down by 12 persons. This accounts for one-fourth of our total employees," it wrote. The company said it has been communicating to customers and employees a hope that "hasty and reckless decision-making at the top of our country will reverse, easing deep troubles that we are facing at this time." 

In addition to the tariff backlash, agriculture is facing another looming financial challenge with the recently announced SHIPS Act measures approved by the US Trade Representative, with Chinese-made vessels calling U.S. ports to be charged port fees of upwards of $1.5 million starting in the fall.

Bulk agriculture was carved out of the port fees imposed under the USTR rule, but agriculture shipped in containers is not exempt from the fees. Friedmann said an exemption is essential because the most valuable U.S. agriculture exports are shipped in containers, not bulk.

Containerized exports include refrigerated beef, pork, poultry, fruit, vegetables, dairy, and processed foods such as french fries. Cotton, forage (hay, alfalfa), nuts, dried dairy, lumber, paper, and soybeans for human consumption are also shipped in containers. "Efforts to exempt all agriculture exports, including containerized agriculture, are continuing," Freidmann said.

Based on U.S. trade data, the share of U.S. agriculture moved in containers is approximately 25% by volume and nearly 55% by value. 

The USTR did not respond to a CNBC request for comment on fee exemptions for containerized agriculture.

"So much of our future lies in the hands of so few," a hay exporter wrote to AgTC. "We plead for those few to take a very long careful look at what can be done to keep shipments flowing while they work out the trade imbalances and perceived differences."

Meanwhile, the exporter said, 9,000 metric tons of the product are on the water to China, expected to arrive May 13 and facing the threat of costly diversion to Chinese bonded warehouses or to other countries, as Chinese buyers may refuse the cargo and abandon it at port.

One grass seed exporter told AgTC it received two weeks' notice that eight loads were being canceled by Chinese customers despite vessels already being booked.

At a recent stakeholder meeting at the Port of Oakland headquarters regarding tariff impacts, Port of Oakland Executive Director Kristi McKenney warned that a tariff-induced downturn in the port's cargo volume — whether from import slowdowns or retaliatory export losses — ultimately could jeopardize job stability and the region's economic health.

McKenney cited retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, as well as manufactured goods; both are essential exports that move through Oakland. Exports include almonds, beef, pork, dairy, and recycled materials, much of which is destined for Asia. China ranks as the port's top import trading partner and third export partner, representing 29% of Oakland's total trade volume.  

Unlike many U.S. ports that lean heavily on imports, Oakland is unique in maintaining a near 50/50 balance of imports and exports. That leaves Oakland concerned that tariff retaliation would directly impact its top export destinations — Japan, Taiwan, China and South Korea — and could significantly erode California's market share for perishable and high-value commodities.

The Port of Oakland is the No. 1 refrigerated export gateway in the U.S., and nearly all containerized cargo moving through Northern California goes through the Port of Oakland.

"So many local, union jobs depend on the Port's robust shipping operations including dockworkers, truck operators, and warehouse workers," said Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Calif. "I support smart trade policies that uplift workers and lower costs for Oakland's working families — not an illogical and retaliatory trade war."

Agricultural exporters warned that there are no other markets that can quickly replace China's demand and absorb the volume, and that is already affecting prices.

"We have diverted employees and production to other (less profitable) production and dramatically slowed down purchasing from independent venders (loggers, truckers, sawmills)," one lumber exporter reported to AgTC. Some products have already declined 20% in market value, the exporter reported, which it said will influence inventory planning and future investments. 

"The U.S. market was stable and improving, but now awash with inventory of former China products," the lumber exporter said.

An exporter of forage such as hay and straw that is a big business for U.S. farms supplying overseas livestock operations reported 68 blanked sailings after Trump announced new tariffs April 2. It said this limits its ability to export forage goods, as vessel space for exports is restricted on freight ships still calling on U.S. ports.

"The worry is the vessel space that remains is going to be the most expensive/most 'premium' services that our product cannot absorb without selling at a loss. Being a high volume, low value item, we cannot afford drastic increases in ocean freight," the forage exporter reported to AgTC.

There has been a sharp decline in China-to-U.S. vessel traffic, down 22.15% week over week and 44% year over year through April 14, according to the Vizion Global Ocean Bookings Tracker.

"What we've seen in the last two weeks is a continued correction in booking demand for U.S. imports, especially U.S. imports from China," said Ben Tracy, Vizion's vice president of strategic business development. "We are now seeing this translate to a drop in departures as well."

A hay exporter in central Washington that sends a large amount of its crop output to Hong Kong and mainland China was told to reroute most of the exports shipped in the past two weeks to Japan, Dubai, Taiwan, and a few Chinese ports. Those changes came at a cost to the company, which told the AgTC that "it's not sustainable, no one can replace all the volume that China buys."

The hay exporter said it immediately put a stop on all orders in process, and has begun layoffs.

"We had to adjust our employee count down by 12 persons. This accounts for one-fourth of our total employees," it wrote. The company said it has been communicating to customers and employees its hope that "hasty and reckless decision-making at the top of our country will reverse, easing deep troubles that we are facing at this time." 

In addition to the tariff backlash, agriculture is facing another looming financial challenge with the recently announced SHIPS Act measures approved by the US Trade Representative, with Chinese-made vessels calling at U.S. ports to be charged port fees of more than $1.5 million starting in the fall.

Bulk agriculture was carved out of the port fees imposed under the USTR rule, but agriculture shipped in containers is not exempt from the fees. Friedmann said an exemption is essential because the most valuable U.S. agriculture exports are shipped in containers, not bulk.

Containerized exports include refrigerated beef, pork, poultry, fruit, vegetables, dairy, and processed foods such as french fries. Cotton, nuts, dried dairy, lumber, paper, soybeans for human consumption, and forage, such as hay and alfalfa, are also shipped in containers. "Efforts to exempt all agriculture exports, including containerized agriculture, are continuing," Friedmann said.

Based on U.S. trade data, the share of U.S. agriculture moved in containers is approximately 25% by volume and nearly 55% by value. 

The USTR did not respond to a CNBC request for comment on fee exemptions for containerized agriculture.

"So much of our future lies in the hands of so few," a hay exporter wrote to AgTC. "We plead for those few to take a very long careful look at what can be done to keep shipments flowing while they work out the trade imbalances and perceived differences."

Shareholder activists say Meta isn't doing enough to combat hate speech.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Jewish investor network JLens are calling on Meta investors to back a new proposal demanding greater transparency into how the company handles antisemitism, anti-LGBTQ+, and anti-disability hate speech.

The campaign comes amid rising concern over Meta's rollback of moderation policies and signals that investor scrutiny of the company's approach to safety has intensified.

The shareholder proposal, known as Proposal 8, calls on Meta to publish a public report detailing how it identifies, moderates, and addresses hate speech across its platforms. Shareholders will vote on the measure at Meta's annual meeting on May 28.

The report would include data tracking the prevalence of hate speech on Meta's platforms, broken down by the communities targeted, and an analysis of whether such content has increased or decreased under updated policy guidelines. It would also disclose any new policies or product interventions Meta has introduced or is developing to address hate targeting marginalized groups.

Still, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls a majority of the company's voting shares through a dual-class stock structure, effectively giving him the power to decide the outcome of any shareholder vote. Even if outside investors broadly support the proposal, it is almost certain to fail without Zuckerberg's backing.

Meta declined to comment. 

Meta's board has urged shareholders to vote against the proposal, saying the company already has comprehensive content moderation systems and transparency reports and that an additional report would not provide meaningful new information.

ADL and JLens argue that forcing the issue into public view and onto the ballot is an important step toward holding Meta accountable.

"This is not a one-time effort, but part of a broader push to ensure Meta takes meaningful responsibility for the harmful content that appears on its platforms," Ari Hoffnung, managing director of JLens, told Business Insider. "Transparency is the necessary first step. Investors and the public need to understand what Meta is currently doing to combat hate on its platforms."

Both ADL and JLens say Meta's current disclosures fall short and that independent, community-specific metrics are essential to understanding the risks.

In addition to concerns about user safety, JLens also framed hate speech as a financial risk for Meta's shareholders. Hoffnung said harmful content on Meta could expose the company to legal, regulatory, and reputational risks and threaten relationships with advertisers.

"Meta is the platform where we've consistently identified as having one of the highest volumes of antisemitic and other hateful content, making it a priority for investor engagement," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, told BI. "Meta also is a public company, and so as shareholders, we have a formal mechanism to push for transparency and accountability through resolutions like Proposal 8, which we believe is the most constructive way to drive lasting change from within the company."

The ADL, founded in 1913, is one of the most prominent civil rights organizations in the US focused on combating antisemitism and hate. In 2022, it acquired JLens, a Jewish values-based investor network, giving it a formal foothold in shareholder advocacy. JLens manages investments in major public companies, including Meta, through funds aligned with Jewish values and has stakes in most large public companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta.

While the ADL does not directly own Meta stock, its acquisition of JLens enables it to influence corporate governance through shareholder proposals.

"We've previously attempted to engage the company directly without success," Hoffnung said. "This year, we felt it was time to escalate our concerns through a shareholder proposal."

Shareholder proposals are a common tool during "proxy season," the period in spring when public companies hold annual meetings and shareholders vote on issues ranging from executive compensation to corporate social responsibility.

The pressure on Meta comes as the company's own Oversight Board, an independent group funded by Meta, recently raised alarms about the company's approach to hate speech enforcement. In a statement last week, the board criticized Meta's recent rollback of its moderation policies and warned that the changes could undermine user safety and brand trust.

Greenblatt said the ADL believes strongly in free expression but rejects the idea that it should come at the expense of user safety.

"We strongly believe in the importance of free expression, but it cannot come at the expense of safety," he said. "Antisemitic content and hate speech can lead to real-world harm, threats, and violence — as we've often seen — and it then crosses the line from protected expression into dangerous conduct."

Greenblatt pointed to Reddit's transparency report, which tracked incidents of Holocaust denial and other hate targeting specific groups, as a model for the kind of reporting they hope Meta will adopt if Proposal 8 is successful.

Proposal 8 is one of several measures investors will consider at Meta's annual meeting. Other shareholder proposals to be voted on include calls for greater transparency around child safety risks, oversight of Meta's use of artificial intelligence, and enhanced reporting on how the company's data collection practices affect user privacy.

JLens has been active beyond Meta this year. It has filed shareholder letters at Intel, General Dynamics, and Lockheed Martin, urging rejection of proposals it viewed as anti-Israel. During the 2024 proxy season, JLens and the ADL campaigned at dozens of companies to push for stronger action against antisemitism and other forms of hate.

BEIJING — Senior Chinese officials on Monday outlined plans to support jobs and help exporters, while hinting at the possibility of more stimulus in light of rising trade tensions with the U.S.

In just a few weeks, tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have more than doubled to over 100%, forcing Chinese factories to pause production and tell some workers to stay home. Exports have been a rare bright spot in China's economy, which has faced pressure from lackluster consumption and a real estate slump.

"Labor market stability remains a critical concern for Chinese policymakers, given its direct linkage to social stability and consumption recovery," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report Sunday. They estimate around 16 million jobs in China are involved in the production of goods exported to the U.S.

Authorities on Monday acknowledged the impact of trade tensions on jobs at exporting companies. China has repeatedly emphasized that consumption is its priority for the year. But Monday's press conference focused more on efforts to stabilize employment.

The briefing came after the human resources ministry on Friday announced subsidies for companies that hire recent graduates, but did not specify an amount. Officials speaking Monday spoke broadly about plans to promote entrepreneurship, increase vocational skills training and better distribute wages to workers in fields with "urgent" needs.

China will provide financial support to exporters so they "will have more confidence to take orders," Sheng Qiuping, vice minister of commerce, told reporters in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

He pointed to recent measures, together with the National Development and Reform Commission economic planning agency, to help exporters sell products domestically and reduce operating costs such as rent.

Sheng was speaking alongside senior officials from the economic planner, central bank and human resources ministry.

On top of existing employment pressures, a record 12.22 million higher education graduates are entering China's job market this year, up by 430,000 from a year ago, according to official figures.

China's urban jobless rate among those aged from 16 to 24, excluding students, stood at an elevated level of 16.5% in March, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. That marked a modest dip from 16.9% in the prior month. The overall unemployment rate for the working-age population in cities eased slightly to 5.2% in March from a two-year high of 5.4% in February.

The People's Bank of China tends to cut rates when the labor market appears soft, Goldman Sachs analysts said, citing historical precedent. They predict that by the end of September, China will cut policy rates by 20 basis points, while enacting a 50 basis point cut for the reserve requirement ratio, or the amount of cash banks need to have on hand.

Chinese officials' comments on Monday followed a high-level Politburo meeting on Friday that called for targeted measures to help businesses, and said the central bank would cut rates as needed.

China is confident it can achieve its full-year growth target of around 5%, and will introduce incremental stimulus as the macroeconomic situation changes, Zhao Chenxin, deputy head of the the economic planning agency, told reporters.

He emphasized that policies to boost consumption and establish a state-level tech development fund would be implemented by the end of June.

Beijing has ramped up economic support since late September, but measures so far have not cumulated in the large-scale stimulus that many investors have hoped for. Gross domestic product grew by a better-than-expected 5.4% in the first quarter from a year ago.

"We think policymakers are waiting on more clarity around the tariff impact before committing to more sweeping stimulus," Louise Loo, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note Monday. Second-quarter gross domestic product "is very likely to decelerate substantially, as exports falter and more than offset the momentum behind stimulus-charged investments."

U.S. President Donald Trump's "America First" ideology, which, generally speaking, prioritizes the domestic over the international, rests on the assumption that the world needs America more than it needs the world.

This may be true for the status quo. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and among the biggest exporters, according to the World Integrated Trade Solution, a database provided by the World Trade Organization. And its policies are already being felt: Factories in China are struggling to fill their order books because of increased export costs to the U.S.

But change is afoot. Countries are finding ways to respond to Trump's nationalistic gestures.

Southeast Asian nations, which suffered the brunt of Trump tariffs, are banding together to increase intra-regional trade and diversify their export destinations. China, after assessing the severity of Trump's threats, seems to be ready to strengthen its fiscal stimulus, and is likewise expanding to other overseas markets.

It's not like the U.S. has a monopoly over all aspects of international affairs, either. China controls much of the supply chain of rare earth elements as well as critical minerals like nickel and copper. Trump's green light to deep-sea mining of those elements is a sign the U.S. is playing catch-up with China.

An "America First" policy may backfire as it drives other countries to take measures that could leave the U.S. behind.

Asia markets tick upMajor U.S. indexes climbed Friday, concluding the week in the green. The S&P 500 rose 0.74% Friday to mark its first four-day winning streak since January. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.26% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.05%. However, stock futures edged lower Sunday evening local time. Asia-Pacific markets ticked up Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 added around 0.4%. Shares of Tokyo-listed Toyota Motor rose roughly 3.7% on reports the company is exploring a potentially 6 trillion yen ($42 billion) deal to acquire Toyota Industries.

China calls for more economic supportChina plans to help struggling businesses with "multiple measures" and called for "timely reductions" of interest rates in the face of "increased external shocks," according to a readout of a Politburo meeting chaired Friday by President Xi Jinping, translated by CNBC. The meeting of the Politburo, the second most powerful political body in China, comes as the trade war between the U.S. and China heats up.

Factories in China halting workChinese manufacturers are pausing production and sending workers home as the impact of U.S. tariffs sets in, according to companies and analysts. This phenomenon is largely occurring in the export hubs of Yiwu and Dongguan for now, said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. But Chinese companies are already turning to customers in Europe and Latin America to make up for a slowdown in exports to America.

Trump signs order to boost deep-sea miningU.S. President Donald Trump signed on Thursday a sweeping executive order to jump-start the controversial practice of deep-sea mining, which uses heavy machinery to remove minerals and metals from the seabed. The move attempts to shore up America's access to strategically important minerals such as nickel, copper and rare earth elements, offsetting China's dominant position in critical mineral supply chains.

Southeast Asian countries turn to each otherExport-oriented Asian countries were hit hard by Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and the ensuing U.S.-China trade war. China is among the biggest trade partners for those countries, while the U.S. serves as their strategic partner in areas like defense and development. Instead of picking a side, however, the region's nations are developing their own economies and strengthening trade ties with each other.

[PRO] Eyes on earnings and dataMore than 180 companies in the S&P 500 report their results this week, making it the busiest period of the first-quarter earnings season, notes CNBC's Sarah Min. Companies to look out for include Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. Investors should also watch the personal consumption expenditures price index, out Wednesday, and nonfarm payrolls, out Friday.

Indian airlines can't fly over Pakistan. Here's how that is affecting flights

Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines Thursday is forcing carriers to alter some routes that link India to Europe, North America, Central Asia and the Middle East.

The airspace closure comes amid tit-for-tat reactions from the nuclear-armed neighbors, following the killing of 26 tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in the northwestern India-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir.

Indian carriers — including Air India, IndiGo, Akasa Air and SpiceJet — must now fly longer, and thus costlier, flights on some westbound routes. The detour could push some flights to add a refueling stop or cancel certain routes altogether.

Indian carriers will pay a price, but passengers may not see airfares go up by much because of Pakistan's airspace closure, said John Grant, chief analyst at the aviation intelligence company OAG.

Higher German infrastructure spending will boost Europe's economic growth in the coming years — but not enough to outweigh the expected drag from U.S. tariffs, according to Alfred Kammer, director of the European department at the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF last week cut its growth outlook for the euro area, also making downgrades for the U.S., U.K. and many Asian countries due to President Donald Trump's volatile tariff policy.

The institution cut its euro area growth forecasts for each of the next two years by 0.2 percentage points, to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026.

"It's the tariffs and the trade tensions which weigh on the outlook rather than the positive effects on the fiscal side," Kammer told CNBC's Carolin Roth in an interview at the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings last week.

"What we see is we have a meaningful downgrade for Europe advanced economies... and for the emerging euro area countries double as much over this two-year period."

The negative impact of tariffs will be slightly offset by Germany's recent infrastructure spending bill, which will boost growth in the euro area over those two years, Kammer said.

Exemptions passed to Germany's longstanding debt rules have unlocked higher defense spending and enabled creation of a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) infrastructure and climate fund. The move has been described by economists as a potential "game changer" for the sluggish economy — the largest in the euro zone.

However, optimism has been shaken by U.S. tariffs, which are widely expected to dampen global growth and trade flows.

Several policymakers at the European Central Bank told CNBC last week that while the inflation path appeared positive — with tariffs potentially bringing inflation in the bloc down further — their broader outlook was now significantly more uncertain.

The IMF's Kammer said that the ECB should only cut interest rates once more this year, by a quarter percentage point, despite growth risks.

The ECB has so far reduced rates seven times in quarter-percentage-point increments, starting in June 2024. Its most recent move lower in April took the deposit facility, its key rate, to 2.25%.

"We have a very clear recommendation for the ECB. What we saw so far is a huge success in the disinflation effort and monetary policy has worked ... so we are expecting to sustainably hit the 2% inflation target in the second half of 2025," Kammer told CNBC.

"Our recommendation is there is room for one more 25-basis-point cut, in the summer, and then the ECB should hold that 2% policy rate unless major shocks hit and there is a need for recalibrating monetary policy," he added.

Overnight index swap pricing on Monday pointed to market expectations for two more quarter-point cuts this year.

A growing number of sizable companies, from mining giants to energy majors, are embracing the hype for natural hydrogen.

It comes as buzz continues to build over the potential for a resource that advocates say could radically reshape the global energy landscape.

Natural hydrogen, sometimes known as white, gold or geologic hydrogen, refers to hydrogen gas that is found in its natural form beneath Earth's surface. The long-overlooked resource, first discovered by accident in Mali nearly 40 years ago, contains no carbon and produces only water when burned.

Investor interest in the nascent natural hydrogen sector has been intensifying in recent months, fueling optimism initially driven by research startups and junior exploration companies.

Over the past year or so, some of the sector's established backers include mining giants Rio Tinto and Fortescue, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom, the venture capital arm of British oil giant BP and Bill Gates' clean tech investment fund Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Exploratory efforts are currently underway in several countries across the globe, with Canada and the U.S. leading the way in terms of project counts over the last year, according to research published by consultancy Rystad Energy.

Analysts expect the year ahead to be a pivotal one, with industry players hoping their exploration campaigns can soon locate the elusive gas.

Not everyone's convinced about the clean energy potential of natural hydrogen, however, with critics flagging environmental concerns and distribution challenges. For its part, the International Energy Agency has warned there is a possibility that the resource "is too scattered to be captured in a way that is economically viable."

Minh Khoi Le, head of hydrogen research at Rystad Energy, said it's difficult to predict whether natural hydrogen can live up to its promise in 2025.

"I guess last year was the year that things got really interesting for the natural hydrogen space because that's when many companies started to plan drilling campaigns, extraction testing and we started to see some major players start to get involved as well," Le told CNBC by video call.

"Since then, I would say the progress has been relatively slow. There are only a few companies that have actually started drilling," he added.

Rystad's Le, who characterized the global pursuit of natural hydrogen as a "white gold rush" last year, said that while there'd been no major progress over the last 12 months, an upswing in investor interest could help to deliver some meaningful results.

"Now, we are starting to see companies getting investment, so they have money to fund their drilling campaigns. So, if we are to get an answer of whether this thing will work, we'll get to that conclusion a bit faster this year," Le said.

Hydrogen has long been billed as one of many potential energy sources that could play a key role in the energy transition, but most of it is produced using fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, a process that generates significant greenhouse gas emissions.

Green hydrogen, a process that involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity, is one exception to the hydrogen color rainbow. However, its development has been held back by soaring costs and a challenging economic environment.

Australia's HyTerra announced an investment of $21.9 million from Fortescue in August last year, noting that the proceeds would be used to fully fund expanded exploration projects.

A spokesperson for Fortescue, one of the leading green hydrogen developers, said its push into the natural hydrogen sector was in line with its "strategic commitment to exploring zero emissions fuels."

Acknowledging that more work is required to fully assess natural hydrogen's emissions profile, Fortescue's spokesperson described the technology as a "promising opportunity" to accelerate industrial decarbonization.

Elsewhere, BP Ventures, the venture capital arm of BP, led a Series A funding round of U.K.-based natural hydrogen exploration startup Snowfox Discovery earlier this year, while France-based start-up Mantle8 recently received 3.4 million euros ($3.9 million) in seed funding from investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a climate and technology fund founded by Bill Gates in 2015.

Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, said the fund had backed the likes of Mantle8 and U.S.-based startup Koloma because the promise of natural hydrogen is such that it "could unlock a new era of clean, homegrown energy."

"Hydrogen is pure reactive chemical energy. If we have enough hydrogen and it's cheap enough, we can do almost anything. We can use it to make metals, make fuels, you could even make food, and all with far fewer emissions than conventional approaches," Toone told CNBC via email.

"We know it's out there and not just in isolated pockets. Early exploration has identified natural hydrogen across six continents. The challenge now is figuring out how to extract it efficiently, move it safely, and build the systems to put it to work," he added.

Aurian Durbuis, chief of staff at France's Mantle8, said momentum certainly appears to be building from a venture capital perspective.

"There is a growing interest, indeed, especially given the dynamics with green hydrogen right now, unfortunately. People are turning their eyes to other solutions, which is in our favor," Durbuis told CNBC by video call.

Based in Grenoble, in the foothills of the French Alps, Mantle8 is targeting the discovery of 10 million tons of natural hydrogen by 2030 to complement the European Union's goals.

"The question is can we find producible reservoirs, in the oil and gas terminology. That's really what we need to figure out as an industry," Durbuis said.

"We think we can drill in 2028 and hopefully that is the eureka moment because if we can find something at that time, then it could obviously be a game changer. If we find highly concentrated hydrogen, with pressure, then this just changes everything," he added.

The Hydrogen Science Coalition, a group of academics, scientists and engineers seeking to bring an evidence-based view to hydrogen's role in the energy transition, said exploration for natural hydrogen is still at an "embryonic stage" — but even so, the likelihood of locating large finds of nearly pure hydrogen that can be extracted at scale look "relatively slim."

The world's only producing hydrogen well in Mali, for example, supplies "just a fraction of the daily energy output of a single wind turbine," Arnout Everts, a geoscientist and member of the Hydrogen Science Coalition, told CNBC via email.

"Taking the evolution of US shale-gas as an analogy, even if large finds are made, it will likely take decades to achieve industrial production," Everts said.

Ultimately, the Hydrogen Science Coalition said the pursuit of natural hydrogen risks distracting focus from the renewable hydrogen needed to decarbonize industries today.

BEIJING — Chinese manufacturers are pausing production and turning to new markets as the impact of U.S. tariffs sets in, according to companies and analysts.

The lost orders are also hitting jobs.

"I know several factories that have told half of their employees to go home for a few weeks and stopped most of their production," said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. He said factories making toys, sporting goods and low-cost dollar store-type goods are the most affected right now.

"While not large-scale yet, it is happening in the key [export] hubs of Yiwu and Dongguan and there is concern that it will grow," Johnson said. "There is a hope that tariffs will be lowered so orders can resume, but in the meantime companies are furloughing employees and idling some production."

Around 10 million to 20 million workers in China are involved with U.S.-bound export businesses, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. The official number of workers in China's cities last year was 473.45 million.

Over a series of swift announcements this month, the U.S. added more than 100% in tariffs to Chinese goods, to which China retaliated with reciprocal duties. While U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday asserted trade talks with Beijing were underway, the Chinese side has denied any negotiations are ongoing.

The impact of the recent doubling in tariffs is "way bigger" than that of the Covid-19 pandemic, said Ash Monga, founder and CEO of Guangzhou-based Imex Sourcing Services, a supply chain management company. He noted that for small businesses with only several million dollars in resources, the sudden increase in tariffs might be unbearable and could put them out of business.

He said there's so much demand from clients and other importers of Chinese products that he's launching a new "Tariff Help" website on Friday to help small business find suppliers based outside China.

The business disruption is forcing Chinese exporters to try new sales strategies.

Woodswool, an athleticwear manufacturer based in Ningbo, near Shanghai, quickly turned to selling the clothes online in China via livestreaming. After launching the sales channel about a week ago, the company said it's received more than 30 orders with gross merchandise value of more than 5,000 yuan ($690).

It's a small step toward salvaging lost business.

"All our U.S. orders have been canceled," Li Yan, factory manager and brand director of Woodswool, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.

More than half of production once went to the U.S., and some capacity will be idle for two to three months until the company is able to build up new markets, Li said. He noted the company has sold to customers in Europe, Australia and the U.S. for more than 20 years.

The venture into livestreaming is part of an effort by major Chinese tech companies, at the behest of Beijing, to help exporters redirect their goods to the domestic market.

Woodswool is selling its products online through Baidu, whose search engine app also includes a livestreaming e-commerce platform. Li said he chose the company's virtual human livestreaming option since it allowed him to get up and running within two weeks, without having to spend time and money on renovating a studio and hiring a team.

Baidu said it has worked with at least several hundred Chinese businesses to launch domestic e-commerce channels after this month announcing it would provide subsidies and free artificial intelligence tools — such as its "Huiboxing" virtual humans — for 1 million businesses. The virtual humans are digitally recreated versions of people that use AI to mimic sales pitches and automate interactions with customers. The company claimed that return on investment was higher than that of using a human being.

E-commerce company JD.com was one of the first to announce similar support, pledging 200 billion yuan ($27.22 billion) to buy Chinese goods originally intended for export — and finding ways to sell them within China. Food delivery company Meituan has also announced it would help exporters distribute domestically, without specifying an amount.

However, $27.22 billion is only 5% of the $524.66 billion in goods that China exported to the U.S. last year.

"A few businesses have told us that under 125% tariffs, their business model is not workable," Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters Friday. He also noted more competition among Chinese companies in the last week.

Tariffs from both countries will likely remain in place at a certain level, with exemptions for certain tariffs, Hart said. "That's exactly what they're backing into."

Products branded and developed for a suburban U.S. consumer might not directly work for a Chinese apartment dweller.

Manufacturers have gone directly to Chinese social media platforms Red Note and Douyin, the local version of TikTok, to ask consumers to support them, but fatigue is growing, pointed out Ashley Dudarenok, founder of ChoZan, a China marketing consultancy.

Fewer and fewer Chinese companies are considering diverting exports to the U.S. through other countries, given rising U.S. scrutiny of transshipments, she said. Dudarenok added that many companies are diversifying production to India over Southeast Asia, while others are turning from U.S. customers to those in Europe and Latin America.

Some companies have already built businesses on other trade routes from China.

Liu Xu runs an e-commerce company called Beijing Mingyuchu that sells bathroom products to Brazil. While his business has run into challenges from fluctuating exchange rates and high container shipping costs, Liu said he expects trade with Brazil will ultimately not be that affected by China's tensions with the U.S.

China's exports to Brazil doubled between 2018 and 2024, as have China's exports to Ghana.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, Ghana-based Cotrie Logistics was founded to help businesses with sourcing, coordinate shipments amid port delays and build dependable logistics routes, said CEO Bright Tordzroh. The company primarily works in trade between China and Ghana and now makes $300,000 to $1 million annually, he said.

The U.S.-China trade tensions have led many companies to explore sourcing and manufacturing locations outside the United States, Tordzroh said, which he hopes can create more opportunities for Cotrie.

 New Bitcoin price highs could be driven by activity in US Treasurys and central banks boosting exposure to gold. 

Key takeaways: 

US Treasury funds saw $19 billion inflows, the highest since March 2023, as the 30-year yield fell 30 basis points.

Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%.

Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. 

The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion—the highest since March 2023.

The 30-year US Treasury yield fell by 30 basis points from its April peak, indicating a rise in bond prices as investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the safety of these bonds. This surge in demand for Treasurys as a safe-haven asset boosts market liquidity and stability while lowering US borrowing costs.

However, foreign central banks have pivoted, cutting Treasury holdings to 23% of US government debt, a 22-year low. This suggests that while private investors were possibly driving inflows, foreign central banks are stepping back, possibly due to the ongoing tariff dispute with the US. 

At the same time, gold's share of global reserves has surged to 18%, a 26-year high, up 8% since 2015, with China doubling its gold reserves to 7.1% since 2023. 

This global de-dollarization trend mirrors a pattern that favors Bitcoin. During the 2020 pandemic, when US Treasury inflows spiked amid COVID-19 uncertainty, Bitcoin soared from $9,000 to nearly $60,000 by early 2021, with gold's share of global reserves rising by 14.5% in 18 months. 

The current environment, marked by a stabilizing bond market and a central bank's gold rush, implies a similar trigger for Bitcoin's next bullish move. In 2023, when US Treasury yields rose amid recession fears, Bitcoin gained 47% in a month while the Nasdaq dropped 8.7%. With yields easing and central banks signaling a lack of faith in the US dollar, Bitcoin's appeal as a global store of value improves.

However, Bitcoin's bullish narrative could falter if global markets enter a recession in 2025. This is due to investors' decision to prioritize liquidity and traditional safe-haven assets like cash or US Treasurys during economic downturns, as noted last week, over speculative assets like Bitcoin.

Anonymous global markets researcher Capital Flows noted that macroeconomic liquidity and positioning factors drive Bitcoin's bullish price trajectory. The analyst highlighted BTC's impulse strength in a directional probability skew chart, suggesting that it is poised for an upward movement.

This aligned with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley's observation that Google searches for "Bitcoin" are near long-term lows, suggesting the rally is fueled by institutions, advisers, corporations, and nations rather than retail investors. 

The lack of retail-driven search interest contrasts with historical trends where Bitcoin search volume strongly correlated with its price in the previous cycle (r=91%, per SEMrush data), indicating a shift in market dynamics where institutional adoption is fueling demand.

A proposal for a class action lawsuit is accusing Nike of engaging in a “rug pull” by shutting down operations for its RTFKT NFT platform. 

The suit was filed Friday in a Brooklyn federal court with Australian resident Jadeep Cheema leading the group of aggrieved customers for Nike's digital sneakers. It argues that the value of the RTFKT tokens was based entirely on Nike's promotional efforts. Once the company pulled that support, investors were left “holding the bag.” 

Nike acquired RTFKT in 2021, a year after the sneaker NFT studio was founded, and began releasing Swoosh-branded digital collectables. Nike would profit in its initial sale of tokens and would also get its cut any time one of its NFTs were bought or sold on the secondary market.

Some of the NFTs could be redeemed for real-life sneakers, including limited-edition Air Force 1s. These “forging” events were particularly important for driving the value of the tokens, with one such occasion October 23 leading to a 600 percent rise in prices. 




			Watch on FN		






Amid a wider landscape of suits seeking to determine the legal status of NFTs, Cheema is joining the side arguing they should be considered as securities. “Plaintiff and others would never have purchased the Nike NFTs at the prices they did, or at all, had they known that the Nike NFTs were unregistered securities or that Nike would cause the rug to be pulled out from under them,” the filing said. 

Cheema is seeking damages of at least $5 million, as well as the disgorgement of RTFKT profits and injunctive relief to prevent Nike from offering additional unregistered securities.

Footwear News has reached out to Nike for comment and will update if a response is given. 

Cheema applies the Howey Test to the RTFKT project and says Nike created a reasonable expectation of profits with the company's continued backing. But even if the court doesn't find that the NFTs qualify as unlicensed securities, he contends Nike nonetheless engaged in a deceptive act by no longer propping up the ecosystem upon which the value of the NFTs were based. 

After Nike announced the closure of RTFKT, “holders of the Nike NFTs felt that the decision left them holding obsolete crypto assets,” the filing said before drawing a distinction between such tokens and more traditional artwork. 

 










“When an artist dies or otherwise stops producing art, the artist's work typically goes up in value. Collectors do not accuse the artist of pulling the rug out from under them.”

Mastercard is moving deeper into the digital asset economy by launching new global capabilities to support stablecoin payments across its vast merchant network, the company announced Monday.



The payments giant is working with crypto exchange OKX to roll out the "OKX Card," aimed at linking crypto trading and Web3 activities with everyday spending. Meanwhile, merchants will soon be able to settle transactions directly in stablecoins such as Circle's USDC, thanks to collaborations with Nuvei and Circle. Paxos will help extend this functionality to other supported stablecoins like USDP.



“When it comes to blockchain and digital assets, the benefits for mainstream use cases are clear,” Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard, said in a statement. “To realize its potential, we need to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them. We believe in the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments and commerce across the value chain. Unlocking this is core to how we navigate the rapidly changing world, giving people and businesses the freedom they want by providing the choices they deserve,” he said.



Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have been gradually moving beyond trading venues into mainstream payments.



Mastercard's initiative covers the full range of stablecoin use cases, from wallet enablement and card issuance to merchant settlement and on-chain remittances. The company has previously partnered with crypto exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Crypto.com to allow users to pay with stablecoins via traditional cards.



Last year, it rolled out Mastercard Crypto Credential, a service designed to simplify sending digital assets across borders using verified usernames rather than complex wallet addresses.



In 2023, Mastercard launched its Multi-Token Network (MTN) which is being leveraged to facilitate real-time settlements and redemptions of tokenized assets.



Ondo Finance, in February, became the first provider to bring real-world assets to the network.

 BNB price has shown resilience throughout all stages of the current bull market, but is it fundamentally stronger than its competitors? 

What to know:

Altcoins have lagged Bitcoin year-to-date, but BNB price shows relative resilience, trading only 10% lower than the previous cycle's all-time high.

BNB Chain shows a robust activity, consistently ranking third in daily transactions, active addresses, and TVL, while leading in the number of DApps.

The blockchain's weakest point is its revenue, which still lags compared to competitors.

Altcoin price action has been underwhelming for much of the 2023-2026 cycle, pushing many crypto traders to focus primarily on Bitcoin. However, with moderate optimism returning to the markets, a closer look reveals that not all altcoins are struggling. In fact, the total altcoin market cap remains solidly above $1 trillion — $1.17 trillion, to be exact — and its 9% surge over the past week offers a glimmer of hope.

Among the major altcoins, BNB Chain (BNB) stands out for its relative strength and stability. Currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind BTC, ETH, USDT, and XRP, BNB is valued at around $89 billion. Some analysts see it as one of the most resilient altcoins in the current cycle.

As João Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, pointed out, using data from the cryptocurrency drawdown heatmap:

For Wedson, this resilience isn't just about price action — it's also backed by solid foundations, such as BNB Chain's well-developed ecosystem and BNB's rising role in DeFi. He calls BNB “one of the rare altcoins with real utility, strong fundamentals, and growing adoption, making it the strongest-performing altcoin alongside BTC.”

Looking solely at price performance among top smart contract platforms' coins tells a more nuanced story. BNB has indeed reached a new all-time high during this cycle, but so have XRP (XRP), TRX (TRX), and SOL (SOL) — though in Solana's case, the new high barely surpassed its 2021 peak by just 1%.

When comparing current prices to their previous cycle highs (mostly from May or November 2021), BNB is now down only about 10%. That's significantly better than ETH (ETH), which is down 63%, and Solana, down 40%. However, XRP (+19%) and TRX (+49%) have performed even better.

One of BNB's monetary advantages lies in its low dilution risk. According to Messari's Market Cap/Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) ratio, 96.51% of BNB's supply is already in circulation. That's in line with Ethereum (99.93%) and TRX (99.96%), indicating a relatively low risk of future token inflation. In contrast, Solana (86.33%) and especially XRP (58.33%) could face significant future dilution.

While BNB's price performance has been relatively strong, it alone doesn't entirely justify its reputation for resilience; fundamentals offer deeper insight.

Beyond speculation, BNB's value is defined by its use in BNB Chain — an umbrella term now used to define both BNB Smart Chain (the original blockchain) and the Beacon Chain (used for governance and staking). BNB Chain specializes in gaming, DeFi, launchpads, and other large-scale consumer DApps. More recently, it also got into the memecoins game, soaking up some of Solana's volume. Being the key altcoin on the leading centralized exchange also helps.

According to Messari, BNB Chain processes around 4 million daily transactions on average, ahead of Ethereum (1 million), XRP Ledger (1.8 million), but behind Tron (5.5 million) and far behind Solana (54 million non-vote transactions daily). 

In terms of daily active addresses, BNB Chain also performs well with about 1.1 million, beating Ethereum (384,800) and XRP Ledger (55,600), but trailing Tron (2.4 million) and Solana (3.7 million).

Where BNB Chain really shines is in the number of DApps. According to DappRadar, BNB Chain supports 5,686 DApps — more than Ethereum (4,987), with Polygon (2,402) trailing in third. This reinforces Wedson's assertion of a “massive” BNB ecosystem and places BNB Chain in a strong position to lead the charge once Web3 fully matures. 

BNB Chain also ranks 3rd in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, with $5.8 billion, behind Ethereum ($50.5 billion) and Solana ($8 billion), according to DefiLlama. The blockchain seems to pay special attention to developing its DeFi activity. On March 24, its DEX trading volume even managed to briefly outpace all other blockchains, hitting a weekly total of $14.3 billion.

Blockchain revenue plays a crucial role in its long-term sustainability and growth. It is commonly assessed through the total transaction fees generated.

In 2024, Ethereum led the pack with $2.5 billion in fees, followed by Tron ($2.1 billion), Bitcoin ($923 million), and Solana ($751 million), according to CoinGecko. BNB Chain closed the top 5 with $194 million. Since XRP has little utility, its blockchain's revenues were only $1.1 million.

So far in 2025, the revenue rankings are shifting, but BNB Chain remains 5th. In the past 30 days, Tron has taken the lead with $272 million in fees, followed by Solana ($34.7 million), Ethereum ($20.8 million), and BNB Chain ($17.1 million), per Messari data. 

Overall, while BNB may not always top the charts across every metric, it consistently holds a respectable third place among the leading smart contract platforms. Its healthy activity metrics contribute to maintaining relative price stability within the sector. 

The blockchain's revenue remains its weakest point compared to competitors. However, if the promise of Web3 is realized and adoption accelerates, BNB Chain's dominance in the DApp space could become its biggest strength.

Coinbase Asset Management is rolling out a new fund for institutions to receive a yield on their bitcoin (BTC) holdings.



Opening on May 1 for non-US institutional investors, the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund aims to deliver a 4% to 8% annualized net return, according to a press release on Monday. 

Among those backing the fund, Abu Dhabi-based Aspen Digital said yield will initially be generated through basis trading, with lending and options strategies to be used in the future.

The so-called bitcoin basis trade involves capitalizing on the spread between futures and spot markets. It became popular at the tail end of 2024 as hedge funds notched a record high of $14.2 billion in BTC short positions, whilst simultaneously buying spot bitcoin ETF shares.

The strategy produces yields depending on the spread between both markets, but isn't immune to risk. For instance, if an entity was short $1 billion on a BTC futures product and the price of BTC was to wildly surge, that entity would need to keep adding margin to avoid liquidation.

Also, as the trade becomes more crowded, the spread and subsequent yield could become very thin. This has already led to a number of hedge funds exiting the trade early this year, with the short figure on Chicago Mercantile Exchange now standing at $8.4 billion, down from $14.2 billion four months prior.

Coinbase's new product stirs memories of former crypto lender BlockFi's yield platform, which opened in 2019 but ultimately failed alongside crashing prices in 2022.

BlockFi's fund, however, differed from Coinbase's latest product in that it generated its yield through lending, rather than a lower-risk basis trade.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) currently owns an astounding 538,200 Bitcoin after it added a massive 379,800 $BTC in just the last six months.

On average, the company has been acquiring 2,087 $BTC per day – a rate that far exceeds the current daily production rate of 450 $BTC, which comes to 13,500 $BTC per month.

Keep reading to find out how institutional Bitcoin accumulation could reshape the market and why now might be a great opportunity to invest in the best altcoins to buy to benefit from this shift.

By amassing such as dominant Bitcoin position, Strategy is moving toward a position where it could influence broader market trends. If institutions like Strategy control a sizable portion of Bitcoin's fixed 21M supply, the asset may become a luxury in the future.

In this environment, the $BTC cost of capital may no longer be driven by free market forces, but be increasingly shaped by the lending policies of major holders.

Although this goes against Bitcoin's decentralization ethos, it's undeniably bullish for its price.

Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck. – Adam Livingston, a $BTC analyst

Reinforcing this trend, more institutions are moving towards a Bitcoin corporate treasury plan. Blockstream CEO Adam Back even suggests this shift could eventually push Bitcoin's market cap to $200T.

Some critics warn that Strategy's debt-funded Bitcoin buying could be risky. However, experts like Saifedean Ammous have said that institutional Bitcoin concentration does not threaten the currency's protocol.

Even if institutions control over 50% of the supply, they have no incentive to manipulate the protocol. Forking Bitcoin to create more coins would only devalue their holdings, leading to large losses. Bitcoin's hard-capped supply remains fundamentally secure, and so does the long-term bullish case.

If accumulation trends continue, Bitcoin's scarcity could trigger explosive market movements. Smart investors are positioning now. Below, we highlight three of the best altcoins to buy that could surge alongside Bitcoin during a potential supply crunch.

BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is easily the best Bitcoin-centric altcoin on the market right now.

Designed to follow the king cryptocurrency's coattails, it's the first-ever and only crypto to offer free Bitcoin to its token holders. All you have to do is store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet.

These $BTC airdrops will occur every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. As you can see, by doing so, BTC Bull Token has directly tied itself to Bitcoin's growth.



What's more, the developers have also planned to shave off a part of the total token supply every time Bitcoin's price increases by $25K.

The first token burn event will take place when $BTC reaches $125K – then at $150K, $175K, $200K, and so on.

Don't miss out on one of the best cryptos to invest in now and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.002485 per token. Here's a guide on how to buy it.

A Bitcoin rally is highly likely to pull the entire crypto market along with it. With rising crypto prices across the board, it'd be the perfect time to be a crypto trader and investor. However, for the vast majority of us, finding high-potential tokens before they've taken off is an uphill task.

That's why you're better off using MIND of Pepe ($MIND), an autonomous AI agent coin offering crypto investment advice.



$MIND works by interacting with the crypto audience on decentralized applications and online platforms like X. It patiently listens to everyone's opinion on crypto, punches every piece of unique data into its AI-powered hive-mind intelligence system, and finally identifies the next cryptos to explode.

Over $8.4M in presale funding so far is proof that investors believe in AI's newfound ability to analyze social sentiment trends, which the crypto market heavily relies on for explosive moves.

If you buy $MIND today, you'll have to spend just $0.0037465 per token.

Mother Iggy launched towards the end of March and was more or less flat for the first three weeks.

It sprung to new life in the last week or so and has since then jumped over nearly 250%. It's currently the top-trending crypto in the entire market.

As the name suggests, $MOTHER is based on the ultra-famous rapper Iggy Azalea, who is renowned for songs like Fancy, Work, and Money Come.



Like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, $MOTHER, too, might not have a whole lot of fundamentals supporting it. But that is how it can be with meme coins backed by a celebrity.

They enjoy massive hype and trading volume on account of the celebrity's popularity. This ultimately leads to violent upmoves, i.e., if the token is lucky enough to be successful. $MOTHER is.

Currently trading at just $0.01982, $MOTHER might just as well be in the early stages of a huge rally. With expectations for another $BROCCOLI-like run, it could be one of the best low cap coins to buy now.

With Bitcoin poised to reclaim its all-time high and potentially rise further, the time is admittedly ripe to invest in some new cryptocurrencies like BTC Bull Token that could rise alongside $BTC.

However, bear in mind that the crypto market is volatile and guarantees no returns.

A cryptocurrency exchange reached an agreement with cybercriminals who hacked into millions, marking increased security issues in the digital currency industry.

Loopscale revealed on April 28 that the attackers involved in a recent $5.8 million heist committed to returning the majority of the stolen money in return for a reward payment.

As reported in posts posted on X (formerly Twitter), Loopscale was able to negotiate successfully with the attacker who had compromised their system on April 26. The deal permits the attacker to retain 10% of the stolen cryptocurrency as a “bounty” and return the other 90% to the platform. This amounts to around 3,947 SOL (Solana tokens) for the attacker, and 35,527 SOL returns to Loopscale.

At 3:52PM ET today, we received a response from the exploiter. They have indicated a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty.

We appreciate their engagement so far and we are actively working to reach an amicable resolution.

As such, we will be… https://t.co/znCZxtoi1z

— Loopscale (@LoopscaleLabs) April 28, 2025



The firm appreciated the hacker for consenting to the settlement and assured that they would provide updates on when vault withdrawals would resume. They further assured that they would release a detailed analysis of how the attack occurred and what they learned during the process.

Reports indicate the hack was not a straightforward break-in but rather sophisticated manipulation of Loopscale's pricing mechanism. The attacker manipulated the RateX PT token pricing mechanism, enabling them to withdraw around $5.7 million in USD Coin and 1,200 Solana tokens from platform vaults.



Upon finding the breach, Loopscale immediately suspended all withdrawals on their vaults and halted trading on their markets. The firm clarified that only users who had deposited funds in their USDC and SOL vaults were impacted by the attack, not the overall RateX collateral system.

In response to the timeline provided by Loopscale, the company reacted swiftly to take care of the issue. They offered the attacker the bounty deal on April 27, the day following the hack. The 10% payment was complemented by dropping any legal pursuit against the hacker.

The site provided the hacker with a deadline of 6 AM EST on April 28 to react to the offer. The timeline closure did the trick, and the hacker accepted the proposal with an indication of willingness to refund the money in return for the reward as promised.

Today both @LoopscaleLabs and @term_labs got hacked and lost millions each 🤷

How safe is actually all this defi?

We are chasing yield, but hack-adjusted is it actually better than just holding bonds? https://t.co/dnhw6n9yol

— Tim Haldorsson (@TimHaldorsson) April 26, 2025



The Loopscale incident comes on the heels of another breach at Term Finance, raising alarm bells throughout the cryptocurrency industry. Tim Haldorsson, founder of Lunar Strategy, voiced serious concerns about whether potential returns in decentralized finance justify the mounting security risks investors face.

The Loopscale attack is one of a disappointing trend of increasing cryptocurrency platform assaults. Security insiders say that more than $1.6 billion was stolen as a result of crypto hacks between the first three months of 2025, the worst quarterly period for security breaches in history.

The trend is that as the value and usage of cryptocurrency grow, platforms have more difficulty protecting user funds from increasingly sophisticated attacks. For some firms, direct negotiation with hackers has become a pragmatic, if contentious, way to recover stolen assets when conventional law enforcement approaches might be too slow or ineffectual.

 The company's Bitcoin holdings are worth more than $50 billion following its latest purchase, with 553,555 BTC on its books. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy added to its massive Bitcoin stash last week as the cryptocurrency surged above $90,000.

In an April 28 announcement, Strategy reported acquiring 15,355 Bitcoin (BTC) between April 21 and 27.

The latest purchases cost Strategy $1.42 billion at an average price of $92,737 per BTC, increasing the company's aggregate BTC holdings by roughly 3% to a total of 535,555 BTC worth more than $50 billion.

Strategy's latest buy is its largest since late March, when the firm bagged 22,048 Bitcoin for $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per BTC.

Announcing the purchase on X, Strategy co-founder Saylor said the firm has achieved the BTC yield of 13.7% year-to-date.

“As of April 27, we hodl 553,555 BTC acquired for approximately $37.90 billion at $68,459 per Bitcoin,” Saylor noted.

Strategy's BTC yield — an indicator representing the percentage change of the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares — amounted to 74% in 2024.

The company expects to reach a BTC yield target of 15% in 2025.

Strategy's Bitcoin purchase came as the cryptocurrency caught significant bullish action last week, surging 8% from around $87,000 to nearly $94,000 in the period from April 21–27, according to data from CoinGecko.

Bitcoin traded at $95,442 at the time of writing, slightly above its price on Jan. 1, but still lower than its all-time high price above $109,000 seen on Jan. 21.

As Strategy beefed up its Bitcoin stash alongside a BTC rally, Saylor continued posting bullish messages to the community on social media.

“You can still buy BTC for less than $0.1 million,” Saylor wrote on April 25.

In another X post preceding the purchase announcement, Saylor said: “Stay humble. Stack sats [satoshis].” He linked the message to a screenshot of Strategy's portfolio tracker reflecting the company's BTC purchases on the timeline of the price chart.

The news comes as Strategy is inching toward a $100 billion market capitalization, with MSTR shares surging roughly 23% YTD and trading at $368.7 at the time of publication, according to data from TradingView.

Strategic allocation away from U.S. assets by investors could see bitcoin hit a new all-time high in the second quarter of the year, Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick said in a report Monday.

Kendrick sees the world's largest cryptocurrency as reaching $120,000 this quarter as he reiterated his previous target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. 

Bitcoin was trading around $95,300 at publication time.

Kendrick noted that the U.S. Treasury term premium, which is closely correlated to the bitcoin price, is at a 12-year high. Accumulation by whales has also been strong. In addition, bitcoin time-of-day analysis suggests that American investors may be looking for non-U.S. assets, he said.

Lastly, exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows in the last week suggest "safe-haven reallocation from gold into BTC," wrote Kendrick.

"Bitcoin may be a better hedge than gold against financial system risks," he added.

Nuvve Launches New Subsidiary to Capitalize on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Opportunities

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nuvve Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: NVVE), a leader in grid modernization and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, today announced a new wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to building a cryptocurrency digital treasury along with cash flowing blockchain opportunities as part of a long-term strategic digital asset initiative.


The new entity, Nuvve-DigitalAssets, will build a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio designed to generate long-term growth and maximize shareholder value. As part of this initiative, Nuvve has announced an initial participation in Bitcoin through ETF based on cash surplus and is now actively pursuing additional opportunities in cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms, and fintech mergers and acquisitions.




"Bitcoin is no longer an experiment. It is an unstoppable force, and we will not sit on the sidelines while the next financial revolution unfolds,” said Gregory Poilasne, cofounder and CEO of Nuvve. “Companies that have leveraged Bitcoin and crypto early are winning, and we plan to be one of them. Anchoring our portfolio with Bitcoin gives us a solid foundation, but we're moving beyond that, investing opportunistically into a new wave of digital assets with massive upside potential that represent the future of global financial markets.

Imagine putting $1,000 into something today, and in a few years, it's grown so much that you never have to work for money again. That's the dream many people had when they bought Bitcoin early. Now, a new project called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is making some people feel like that chance is back. And this time, it comes with the speed of Solana, one of the fastest blockchain platforms in the world.

Solana has made a name for itself by doing one thing incredibly well — speed. With the ability to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second, it leaves most other blockchains in the dust. That makes Solana perfect for applications that need to move fast, like trading platforms, games, and financial apps.

But here's the problem: fast doesn't always mean strong. Some blockchains have to give up decentralization or security to achieve speed. And that's where many users begin to worry. You can't build wealth on a platform that breaks under pressure.

Solana is great, but it's not complete on its own.

Bitcoin Solaris is built differently. It takes Bitcoin's strongest feature — its scarcity and rock-solid audited security — and fuses it with Solana's fastest technology to create something new and powerful.



Here's what it brings to the table:



















This structure allows BTC-S to stay safe while moving quickly — something very few coins have achieved.

Not everyone has thousands of dollars to buy mining equipment. Bitcoin Solaris solves this with its Solaris Nova App, which lets people mine BTC-S using just their smartphones.





The Future of Bitcoin Starts Here—Be Part of BTC-S

This opens the door for everyday people to earn BTC-S, grow their assets, and become part of a rising financial system.

Plus, Bitcoin Solaris offers staking rewards — you can hold your BTC-S and earn more without locking your tokens. You keep control of your funds while they work for you in the background.



Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is in its presale phase, offering a chance for early buyers to enter before the token becomes widely available. This isn't just a regular coin launch — it's a chance to buy into a project that could be the next big thing in crypto.







Phase One Has Begun—Secure BTC-S at the Starting Line

The tokens are initially launched on Solana, but once the native blockchain is live, each Solana-based BTC-S will be redeemable 1:1 for the real thing.

A $1,000 investment doesn't usually change your life—unless it's timed right and placed in something with real potential. That's what early Bitcoin buyers experienced. Now, Bitcoin Solaris might be that next rare opportunity.



By combining Solana's ultra-fast speed with the scarcity and security of Bitcoin, BTC-S is giving crypto investors a platform that doesn't cut corners. Whether you're new to crypto or looking for the next breakthrough, this is your chance to act early, think long-term, and maybe turn that $1,000 into something life-changing.

Ethereum's potential 100x gas limit growth over four years prompts calls for a cautious implementation approach.

Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist has proposed a significant change to the network's gas limit, aiming to boost transaction capacity and network performance.

On April 27, Feist submitted Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698, suggesting that Ethereum's gas limit should grow 100 times over the next four years through automated client-side settings.

According to Feist:

“The current gas limit mechanism relies on miner/operator voting, which lacks coordination and predictability. While flexible, this approach can lead to stagnation or overly cautious increases.

By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency.”

Ethereum community member Fabda.eth explained that Feist's plan would result in a 100-fold increase that would push the network's capacity to around 3.6 billion gas, supporting approximately 2,000 transactions per second and 6,000 transactions per block.

This would significantly increase the network's current gas limit of approximately 36 million.

Notably, Feist's proposal aligns a similar suggestion by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. In February, Buterin advocated for a tenfold gas limit increase, arguing that it would support transaction inclusion and application development on the base layer, despite growing reliance on Layer 2 solutions.

While many within the community see potential benefits of expanding the blockchain network's gas limit, several developers voiced caution about Feist's proposal aggressive growth pace.

Lukasz Rozmej, an Ethereum core developer, cautioned that any expansion should either be manually agreed upon or kept gradual to avoid unexpected network strain.

Ethereum Foundation developer Jochem Brouwer echoed these sentiments. He warned that targeting a 100x increase within four years could prove too aggressive.

Instead, he advocated a more measured approach, suggesting a 2x gas limit increase over the next six months.

Brouwer added:

“Let's do this in steps before we have the majority of the nodes committed to this 100x increase in 4 years schedule and we will have a problem when we find out the limit is getting too high (then we thus need to coordinate with all nodes to opt-out and shut it down again).”

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

World Liberty Financial, supported by US President Donald Trump, has entered into a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council to enhance cryptocurrency usage in the South Asian country, according to a report from Business Recorder on April 27.

Pakistan is now ranked ninth globally for crypto adoption, with about 25 million active users and yearly transactions totaling $300 billion, based on statistics from blockchain analytics company Chainalysis.

Pakistan's finance minister, Muhammad Aurangzeb, cited the country's large youth population as the major driver of this success, with around 60% of people below 30 years of age.

The pact between World Liberty Financial and the Pakistan Crypto Council details a number of key initiatives. World Liberty will assist in setting up regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain products, develop stablecoin use cases aimed at remittances and trade, study real-world asset tokenization, and aid in the development of decentralized finance protocols in Pakistan.

World Liberty co-founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro signed the deal in a meeting with the CEO of the Council Bilal bin Saqib. The signing was witnessed by top government officials, such as Pakistan's central bank governor, finance minister, and IT secretary.

Coming on top of Pakistan's move into cryptocurrency markets, there is now former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao appointed as an advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council. According to recent reports, Zhao will assist in shaping the country's direction on regulation and innovation efforts.

Zhao met with the three founders of World Liberty recently, indicating close collaboration between the different entities involved in the cryptocurrency development plans in Pakistan.

This collaboration represents a strong turnaround in the stance of Pakistan towards digital currency. Only a year ago, back in May 2023, then-finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha announced that Pakistan would never legalize bitcoin due to fears of Financial Action Task Force regulations.

Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency has now set out a new regulatory model, announced on April 10, which seeks to tackle terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer requirements while continuing to encourage innovation.

FIA Director Sumera Azam referred to the framework as one of efforts towards finding a balance between “technological advancement and national security imperatives.”

Reports disclosed that the planned regulations would need approval from legislators and consultation with crypto businesses based in Pakistan before they could be implemented, with implementation slated to start in 2026 via a multi-phased process.

Trump and his relatives have an economic interest in World Liberty's success, as they stand to gain a share of the profits from the platform after supporting the launch of the crypto lending and borrowing platform last year.

04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27

Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion."

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip.

Now, as Binance's chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom.

“The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar.

The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell's relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates.

“Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high."

The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs' head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar's weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump.

04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares.

"We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report.

The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.”

“Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. 

“Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales' (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.”

Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades."

"Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks.

"Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion."

The bitcoin price has surged this week as traders bet on a recovery of so-called risk assets and ... More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar.

BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year.

In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument.

The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

President Trump's World Liberty Financial (WLFI) has reportedly inked a series of agreements with the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to promote investment and innovation in the country's digital assets industry.

The Express Tribune reports that Pakistan's Federal Minister for Information Ata Tarar, PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saeed and WLFI co-chairman Zack Vetkoff attended a signing ceremony.

The event took place on Saturday, just a month after the PCC was formed. The regulatory body was created to oversee and promote crypto and blockchain technology within the country.

According to Tarar, the establishment of the PCC represents a pivotal step in embracing emerging technologies, and initiatives like the partnership with WLFI will help accelerate economic growth and technological advancement. 

“Pakistan offers tremendous opportunities in the crypto sector. Despite being a relatively new player, Pakistan has made remarkable progress in a short span of time.“

Pakistan is home to 241.5 million people, making it the world's fifth-most populous country. Vetkoff says the South Asian nation holds economic potential. 

“Pakistan is one of the fastest-emerging economies. We are excited to be part of its journey towards a vibrant financial future.”

The Trump family holds a 60% stake in the WLFI, and the project itself holds over $103 million worth of crypto assets, according to Arkham data.

Cryptocurrency took the digital finance sector by storm, but alongside the perks come significant downfalls. In addition to digital anonymity, decentralization, and borderless transactions, cybercriminals are taking advantage of many juicy opportunities to scam people out of their hard-earned money.

Scammers now have prime opportunities to launder funds through mixers, split assets across multiple wallets, and even exploit exchanges with weak Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. As crypto fraud becomes more common, investigative firms like CNC Intelligence confront fraudsters with advanced technology, law enforcement partnerships, and deep cyber intelligence.

Crypto fraud isn't a small-time issue. Every year, billions are lost to crypto fraud as criminals continuously refine their methods. Whether it's rug pulls, phishing schemes, or fake investment platforms, these scams are getting increasingly sophisticated, making justice a hard-won outcome.

Why? First and foremost, tracing illicit funds across decentralized platforms and international borders is an elusive long shot for investigators.

So, how do these scammers get away with crypto fraud? One of the most common methods is using mixers—services that hide the origin of crypto by blending it with other funds. Sketchy online grifters can also utilize privacy coins like Monera, which are nearly untraceable. Of course, several criminals also exploit lax regulations in certain jurisdictions with limited KYC enforcement. This allows scammers to cash out anonymously and disappear just as quickly.

Just because stopping crypto scammers is challenging doesn't mean it's impossible. CNC Intelligence doesn't take these threats lightly, employing the most sophisticated cyber and crypto investigation solutions. These solutions offer blockchain analysis, darknet intelligence, and AI-driven fraud detection to hit the criminals with everything they've got. The CNC Intelligence team also identifies scammers, tracks illicit transactions, and works with victims and legal teams to support recovery efforts.

The CNC Intelligence strategy includes:

CNC Intelligence is about more than algorithms and digital forensics, which sets it apart from the competition. The firm employs a team of certified cryptocurrency investigators™ who are well-versed in digital asset tracking. Using cyber intelligence and investigative practices, they help uncover the people behind these fake identities and offshore shell companies.

The team's investigative work, including successful recovery efforts in high-profile cases, speaks for itself. Their work helps individuals and businesses pursue legal action to recoup stolen crypto. With a unique combination of AI-powered analytics and good old-fashioned detective work, CNC Intelligence is unveiling the digital masks worn by scammers—goodbye anonymity and hello accountability.

Individuals seeking justice for crypto scams may not know where to start when seeking law enforcement assistance. Luckily, CNC Intelligence works with agencies across multiple jurisdictions to offer law enforcement assistance services that strengthen international investigations into crypto crime. Given the amount of red tape civilians will likely contend with, that's certainly a weight off their shoulders.

Of course, given their rampant nature, most government agencies don't have the resources to pursue every crypto fraud case and track complex blockchain transactions. CNC Intelligence gives these agencies actionable intelligence to help take down fraudulent operations and get legal and monetary justice for victims.

As the crypto industry evolves, so do cybercriminal tactics—yet technology will continue to grow and adapt alongside these industry changes. That's why firms like CNC Intelligence must stay on top of these shifts and use developing tech to fight the good fight to protect investors and businesses.

It takes the right technology, intelligence, and global partnership cocktail to crack down on crypto crime. That time is on the horizon, with CNC Intelligence leading the charge.

Nike Hit With $5 Million Lawsuit Over Alleged NFT Securities Violations

Law and Order

The world's largest sportswear brand, Nike, was sued on Friday with a $5 million proposed class action, accusing the company of abandoning NFT investors by abruptly shutting down its RTFKT subsidiary and abandoning its sneaker-themed digital assets.

In a lawsuit filed Friday in the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs allege that Nike used its iconic brand to hype digital collectibles tied to its digital fashion and technology company RTFKT, then executed a "soft rug pull," leaving investors with devalued and illiquid NFTs.

The complaint also accuses Nike of promoting unregistered securities in violation of U.S. law, enticing buyers with “marketing prowess” to “hype, promote, and prop up” sneaker-themed NFTs, only to withdraw support once profits were made.

The lawsuit comes as regulators reconsider how NFTs should be treated under U.S. securities laws. Just last month, SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce suggested that certain NFT projects could soon be formally exempted from securities classification.

In any case, plaintiffs, led by Jagdeep Cheema, claim they "would never have purchased the Nike NFTs at the prices they did, or at all," had they known the tokens were unregistered securities or that Nike would abandon the project. 

“The Nike NFTs were never registered as such,” the complaint said, alleging Nike deprived investors of material disclosures that registration would have required.

"One does not expect it from Nike," the complaint reads, "the international sports juggernaut with yearly revenue of around $50 billion. But that is what Nike did.”

Nike has not immediately responded to Decrypt's request for comments.

In December 2024, RTFKT abruptly announced via social media that it was “winding down” operations, sending secondary market prices for Nike NFTs plunging, prices that have yet to recover.

Even if the NFTs are not considered securities, the lawsuit alleges, Nike's "deceptive acts”-building an ecosystem of rewards to boost NFT demand and then pulling support - violated consumer protection laws in New York, California, Florida, and Oregon.

They also claim “unjust enrichment,” noting how Nike profited from primary and secondary NFT sales while leaving retail investors to bear the losses.

Meanwhile, last week, RTFKT's NFTs, including its flagship Clone X collection co-created with artist Takashi Murakami, briefly disappeared from display due to a Cloudflare hosting issue. 

Images stored off-chain were replaced by a black screen displaying “This content has been restricted” after Cloudflare prematurely downgraded RTFKT's account to a free tier, according to RTFKT's head of technology, Samuel Cardillo.

          Once a darling of Lithuania's cryptocurrency scene, the Bankera digital coin raised tens of millions but has since collapsed in value. The project's co-founders bought a portfolio of luxury real estate using loans from a bank they owned apparently backed by funds from the crypto coin sales.

In early 2018, near the tail end of a major cryptocurrency boom, a Lithuanian start-up called Bankera announced that it had managed to raise over 100 million euros in just six months by selling its own digital coin. 

The company said the funds would be used to fashion a “bank for the blockchain era” — a fully fledged retail and investment institution, holding and exchanging most cryptocurrencies and competing with existing banks “as an equal.” 

More than 100,000 people had bought tokens in an “initial coin offering,” or ICO — a type of cryptocurrency fundraiser — and had started receiving weekly payments drawn from a share of the fees generated when others bought and sold the coin. Amid a wave of ICOs in 2017 and 2018, the Lithuanian token looked like a potentially lucrative investment.

But seven years after the ICO, the token has collapsed in value, leaving many investors disappointed, and the Bankera project still hasn't achieved one of its self-proclaimed core objectives: acquiring a European Union banking license. 

Now, an investigation by OCCRP and its partner 15min has uncovered how the once-promising cryptocurrency project has funded loans benefitting the founders of the venture, with investors left without the promised returns. 

Reporters found evidence that a portion of the funds raised in the ICO appears to have been funneled into a sprawling real estate portfolio — including a villa on the French Riviera and high-end property in Lithuania — via a bank thousands of miles away in the Pacific nation of Vanuatu.

In the four years following the ICO, more than 45 million euros flowed from a Lithuanian firm owned by Bankera's three co-founders into an account at Pacific Private Bank (PPB) – a Vanuatu-based bank the three had acquired just before the coin offering ended. 

Leaked company records and bank statements show the funds were used to underwrite loans to other companies owned by the same three men, which then purchased high-end real estate. Millions more, also backed by ICO funds, were loaned directly to the three co-founders themselves, often labeled as “personal use.” 

Kathryn Westmore, who leads the Royal United Services Institute's (RUSI's) work on financial crime policy, said the ICO proceeds should only have been used for the Bankera project.

“To extract funds and seemingly use them to finance personal spending raises suspicions that investors have been misled and [the co-founders] have profited personally,” she said. “Fundamentally this seems to be about misrepresentation of what the [ICO] funds were going to be used for, which raises the question of whether this was a fraud.”

Reporters repeatedly tried to seek comment from Bankera's three founders, including by traveling to a conference in Malta to attempt to speak with one of them, Vytautas Karalevičius. They sent multiple emails to him and the other founders, Justas Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius, and their companies, but only received a response from lawyers acting for the Lithuanian firm Bankera UAB, one of several companies in what the lawyers described as the “Bankera ecosystem.”

The ‘Bankera Ecosystem'

In the course of this investigation, reporters found several companies in various jurisdictions involved in the Bankera project or the ICO, as well as in receiving, holding, and moving ICO revenues. They sent requests for comments to these companies or their representatives, and directly to Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius.

The only substantive response came from lawyers representing the Lithuanian company Bankera UAB. Those lawyers declined to confirm that they were responding on behalf of the Bankera co-founders, or the other companies in what they referred to as the “Bankera ecosystem.” Bankera UAB provides IT and other services to other Bankera firms.

However, the lawyers confirmed Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were “the founders and majority owners of the …Bankera ecosystem.” They added that none of the three co-founders “own shares in every entity within the Bankera ecosystem, nor do they own their shares equally.”

Those lawyers declined to comment on specific transactions, but cited the purchase of PPB as evidence that funds raised in the ICO “were used towards the development of an innovative neobank using blockchain technology.” The movement of funds into the Vanuatu bank's account “had always been intended” and was carried out because “sums were given as grants to multiple Bankera ecosystem companies,” the lawyers wrote. 

While the lawyers acknowledged that the Bankera crypto token's value had “diminished significantly over time,” they said the “Bankera brand is now well known and successful” and denied that the ICO was in any way fraudulent. They declined to comment on the specific transactions related to the loans to the co-founders and their companies, and the property purchases.

Lawyers for PPB declined to comment on the transactions revealed in the leaked banking materials, citing Vanuatu's banking secrecy law.

PPB's managing director, Eimantas Kazlauskas, said the bank complied with all Vanuatu banking laws and regulations. 

And PPB's resident director, Martin St. Hilaire, said: “The goal of acquiring Pacific Private Bank by Bankera was to transform it into a modern digital bank for the blockchain era, which is being successfully done one step at a time.”

“From my standpoint, PPB has always been compliant and a good example of a small independent private bank,” he said.

The Central Bank of Lithuania told OCCRP it had contacted law enforcement regarding the Bankera ICO, but said it could not “disclose any details” due to legal restrictions.

Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were all born in the late 1980s in Šiauliai, a city of about 120,000 people in northern Lithuania.

Karalevičius is the son of a public health official and a plastic surgeon who became a politician, and Dobiliauskas is the son of a public prosecutor and a senior banker. Mockevičius' father is a civil judge and his mother worked in school administration.

They were all in their late 20s when Bankera started offering its token, known as BNK, for sale in August 2017. A fourth man, Ugnius Šimelionis, was a co-founder of multiple “Bankera ecosystem” companies, but sold his stakes in them to Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius in October 2017, shortly before the launch of the ICO. Šimelionis told OCCRP he sold his shares because his and the other founders' “long-term visions for the company's direction didn't fully align,” and said he had no involvement in the ICO or any other Bankera activities since.

By the time of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius had already established multiple digital financial service companies serving hundreds of thousands of customers, according to a white paper published by Bankera in 2017. These included three companies that would play key roles in the Bankera ICO: Pervesk UAB and Spectro Finance UAB, both registered in Lithuania, and Finalify Ltd., which was registered in the British Virgin Islands. 

Finalify issued the BNK tokens, and Spectro Finance operated the “virtual currency exchange” — an online platform to trade digital currencies — where people could buy Bankera's tokens using either traditional “fiat” currency or other cryptocurrencies. 

Potential investors had to set up a wallet for their tokens with SpectroCoin, owned by Spectro Finance, and they sent payments for BNK to an account at Pervesk, according to payment documents from multiple investors seen by reporters. Pervesk is an “electronic money institution” — a company licensed to issue electronic money and process digital payments — which Spectro Finance used to handle proceeds from the ICO. 

In its white paper, Bankera compared holding its tokens to owning shares in a publicly listed company, in the sense that they could be bought and sold after the ICO. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB told OCCRP it was incorrect to characterize the “ICO as being akin to the raising of equity.”)

Token holders would be entitled to discounted rates for Bankera services and products. They would also receive a weekly payout. Each week, Bankera would collect fees on transactions — and then, after deducting costs, it would put aside 20 percent of the remaining amount and distribute it to BNK holders in proportion to the share of the tokens they held. 

Bankera's resume was bolstered by the backing of prominent political and business figures. At the time of the ICO, the start-up's advisers included two members of the European Parliament, a former head of the Lithuanian tax authority, a former president of one of the country's largest banks, and a globally recognized blockchain entrepreneur.

The advisory board for the Bankera ICO included ten senior figures from the worlds of politics, finance, and regulation, according to the Bankera white paper. At the time, some publicly sang Bankera's praises. Today, the tone has changed markedly. Contacted for comment, five of the former advisers denied having any significant involvement in the venture. Two claimed Bankera had simply used their names. 

The board included: 

Antanas Guoga – Former member of European Parliament (2014–2019), businessman, and well-known poker player. He left the board in March 2018. Reached for comment, he said he left after his “views diverged” with the project's founders.

Audrius Žiugžda – Former CEO of the bank SEB. He also served as head of administration of Šiauliai Bank. Žiugžda joined the ICO's advisory board in 2017. "They never needed my advice,” he told reporters. “They just used my name."

Modestas Kaseliauskas – Former director of Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate (2005-2014). He left the Bankera ICO advisory board after the coin offering ended, and now works at the International Monetary Fund. He said he did not take part in the “implementation stage” of the Bankera project and so could not comment on it. 

Marc Kenigsberg – Founder of the cryptocurrency and gambling news portal Bitcoin Chase, and an advisor to several blockchain businesses. He left his role as an adviser to the Bankera ICO after he felt they were going a “more traditional financial route,” he told reporters. 

Lon Wong – Entrepreneur and developer of blockchain technology. “Unfortunately, they never sought advice from me,” he told reporters, adding that he had since “lost touch with them totally.”

Pre-sales of the currency appeared to be a hit. On August 28, 2017, Bankera tweeted: “Please lower your orders so everyone could get some tokens!” 

The following month, the company announced that it had reached its initial target of 25 million euros nine days ahead of schedule. In February 2018, it said it raised a total of 100 million euros.

Andreas Horb, a German financial advisor, told OCCRP that the prospect of weekly payouts was a “key selling point” and helped convince him to buy about 2,000 euros worth of BNK. 

Despite the apparently enthusiastic uptake of the BNK token, more than six years on, its market capitalization — the total value of all issued tokens — has fallen to just $1 million, according to data from the Ethereum blockchain, which hosts the token. As BNK's value collapsed, so did the payments to coin-holders. Eventually, in 2022, the revenue-sharing scheme was halted. But some investors say problems emerged much earlier.

“Things started to change in 2018, a few months after the ICO launched,” Horb said. “The payouts began to drop significantly below the promised amount.” 

Lawyers for Bankera UAB said that during the ICO the token was purchased “by speculators hoping for a ‘boom',” and that the “relatively early abandonment of the BNK tokens by such individuals naturally played a part in the slide in value.” 

As weekly earnings from the revenue sharing scheme dropped, Horb said he and his friends tried to contact Bankera's founders and managers: “We had regular conversations with them at first, but eventually they stopped responding after a wave of investor complaints.”

Ryan Woodhouse, a British telecoms engineer, told OCCRP he bought 4,000 British pounds worth of Bankera tokens. 

“The concept looked amazing,” he said. But, he added, “it quickly became clear that the token had lost all its value when they stopped paying the weekly returns.”

The decline in the value of the BNK tokens underscores the risks of investing in cryptocurrency, a largely unregulated area of finance, experts said.

“Investing in cryptocurrency at that time was like buying magic beans,” said Ray Blake, a financial crime expert and director of the Dark Money Files.

RUSI's Westmore described the rash of ICOs in 2017 and 2018 as “the epitome of the wild west of crypto,” adding that people facing losses from cryptocurrency investments often struggle to win compensation due to the lack of oversight of the sector.

The Bank of Lithuania told 15min that it had received “a few individual complaints” about Bankera's ICO, but said it had directed the complainants to the financial supervisory authorities in the British Virgin Islands, where Finalify is registered.

In January 2018, in the middle of the ICO, Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius were also buying a bricks and mortar bank half a world away.

Pacific Private Bank Ltd., known as PPB, is a boutique financial institution in Vanuatu, a Pacific nation inhabited by around 300,000 people that has been criticized for facilitating international tax avoidance and providing “golden passports” to people with questionable backgrounds. 

On its website, PPB describes its mission as serving “wealthy, private clients from around the world” with a focus on wealth and asset management and offering “tailored investment solutions.” 

“We accommodate to [sic] the individual objectives of every customer by providing personalized private banking services.”

Bankera's co-founders heralded the purchase of PPB as a step toward becoming “a bank for the blockchain era and a one-stop store for all financial services,” a goal which would now be delivered “ahead of schedule.” The sale price was not disclosed. 

The month after the trio bought PPB, millions of euros started moving from Spectro Finance's account at Pervesk — where BNK purchasers had sent their payments for tokens — into an account also held by Spectro Finance at PPB, leaked records from the Vanuatu bank show.

The first transfer — 15 million euros — took place on February 14, 2018, just weeks before the ICO's conclusion. Another 2.8 million euros were sent six weeks later, followed by 12 million euros six months after that. The leaked bank records give no purpose for the transfers, which are listed only as “transfer between own accounts.” An additional 15 million euros were sent in other transfers between August 2020 and September 2021. 

Lawyers for Bankera UAB said it was “not disputed that funds were moved into accounts with Pacific Private Bank,” but added that there is no “obligation to publicly set out the use of all the funds raised by the ICO.” 

In November 2019, 25 million euros were sent from Spectro Finance's PPB account to another PPB account held by Finalify, the British Virgin Islands company that issued the Bankera tokens. The credit was the first activity in the Finalify account.

In April 2021, the same Spectro Finance account also transferred 20 million euros to a PPB account held by Spectro Finance Systems Ltd., another firm registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2019 by Mockevičius, one of Bankera's founders.

All three PPB accounts — Spectro Finance's, Finalify's, and Spectro Finance Systems' — pledged funds to back loans by PPB to Bankera's three young co-founders or their companies.

Before the acquisition of PPB was announced, Bankera built up an air of suspense by promising “a very big announcement” was on the way. But once the news broke, the venture insisted that Bankera and PPB were remaining “separate projects.”

PPB never became a cryptocurrency bank. Instead, leaked banking records show, it repeatedly borrowed money from Spectro Finance, Finalify, and Spectro Finance Systems. It then loaned the same amounts to Bankera's three co-founders and to other companies they controlled.

On October 10, 2019, Spectro Finance's PPB account was debited 1.7 million euros for “B2B purposes,” a leaked bank statement shows. The same day, PPB disbursed a loan for an identical amount to a Monaco-based company called Azur Estates (SCI), registered by two of Bankera's founders, Karalevičius and Mockevičius, the previous August. The money was paid into a previously empty account held by Azur at PPB, the statement shows. 

Less than two weeks later, on October 22, Azur sent the 1.7 million euros to an account it held in Lithuania. Then, six days after that, the company bought a four-bedroom villa in Èze, a seaside village between Monaco and Nice, for 1.1 million euros. Azur paid for the house in full using corporate funds, according to French property records seen by OCCRP.

According to French property records, Azur intended the villa to serve a residential purpose. The 1.7-million-euro loan matured a year later, but Azur simply took out another loan from PPB, for a similar amount, to pay the original loan back. Karalevičius and Mockevičius also repaid loans with new loans. (It is not clear whether other loans were eventually fully paid back.)

Experts said the use of such “back-to-back” loans offered potential advantages, by creating paperwork to support property purchases and helping to keep the bank's books balanced.

“The bank that is receiving funds for the French property would want to check the source of funds,” said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a Florida company specializing in compliance and financial crime litigation. A documented paper trail would indicate that the bank providing the loan has conducted due diligence on the recipient, she said.

“If you have a pledge from a company that appears to be a separate entity, and has money in its account, then it doesn't then appear to be simply taking money out of the bank,” said RUSI's Westmore. “The opaque way these transactions were structured also raises questions about [their] legitimacy.”

Reporters sent detailed questions to Finalify, Spectro Finance, and Mockevičius, who is named as the representative for Azur, but did not receive any responses. Lawyers for Azur did not respond to questions by the time this article was published. 

Azur took another three loans from PPB amounting to 800,000 euros between August 2021 and July 2022, leaked statements show. 

These loans were guaranteed with part of the 25 million euros of ICO proceeds that Finalify received from Spectro Finance in 2019. Finalify agreed to deposit the full 800,000 euros at PPB for five years to guarantee Azur's repayment, leaked pledge agreements show.

One Man, Many Hats

The name of one PPB employee, Eimantas Kazlauskas, appeared repeatedly in transactions related to the trio and their companies.

For the first two loans to Azur, for instance, Kazlauskas — who was PPB's managing director at the time — signed the pledge agreements on behalf of the Vanuatu bank. But for the third loan, he signed on behalf of Finalify while acting as a director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., which bought Finalify in March 2020. Rational was, in turn, owned by PPB.

In 2023, Kazlauskas also signed a term deposit and a pledge agreement with himself to guarantee a loan of 100,000 euros to Mockevičius — the documents show his signature on both sides, as PPB's managing director as well as the director of Rational Pacific Investments Ltd, which represented Finalify.

Between 2018 and 2022, Rational Pacific Investments also made several payments to Kazlauskas for “kitchenware” and “fridge rubber fittings” to be supplied to Villa 25, a luxury property the company had bought in Vanuatu. 

Contacted by OCCRP, Kazlauskas said he lives in one of the three houses at Villa 25 and is "able to fix and or replace items if needed to maintain the value of the property," but did not comment on specific transactions.

In other cases, PPB loaned money directly to the trio — again, apparently to fund real estate purchases. 

On December 15, 2020, for instance, Finalify's PPB account was debited for 360,000 euros in relation to a pledge agreement, according to the bank statement. The same day, PPB loaned the same amount to Mockevičius. 

Two days later, Mockevičius transferred 329,604 euros to yet another PPB account, this one held by a Liechtenstein-registered foundation, Eternity Ventures Foundation, which company documents show was set up by two of Bankera's co-founders and whose 2020 bylaws named family members of each of Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius as beneficiaries. On December 18, Eternity paid the exact amount to buy a plot of land in the Old Town of Lithuania's capital, Vilnius. 

Another 300,000 euros were debited from Finalify's account on November 10, 2021, for a pledge agreement. That same day, PPB disbursed a loan for the same amount to Mockevičius, who transferred 300,000 euros to Eternity, also on the same day. Two days later, Eternity paid out just under 290,000 euros for more real estate in Lithuania.

Including those transactions and others, Eternity received a total of just under 1.8 million euros from Mockevičius and Dobiliauskas between the summer of 2019 and the end of 2021, according to Eternity's leaked PPB bank statements. Over the same period, it bought a total of five properties in Lithuania for more than 1.3 million euros.

In mid-2018, shortly after the end of the ICO, a Vanuatu-based company called Rational Pacific Investments Ltd., then owned by PPB, bought another local company — called Beachfront Properties — which in turn owned Villa 25, a luxury resort in a secluded seaside district just outside the capital, Port Vila, according to registry documents from the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission.

The villa, which boasts a private pool and beach, promises “barefoot luxury by the sea,” and can be rented for up to 125,000 Vanuatu vatu (about $1,000) a night during peak season.

Lawyers for Bankera UAB declined to comment on the transactions involving Eternity. They said the Vanuatu villa “is owned by Pacific Private Bank, and has historically been let out to guests and used by/for staff (including management). We understand that it is currently being used as an office due to damage caused elsewhere by the Port Vila earthquake. There is nothing remarkable about this.”

Between May 2019 and May 2023, PPB also loaned Mockevičius a total of 5.4 million euros and Dobiliauskas 3 million euros — 4.2 million euros of which were explicitly listed as being “for personal use,” leaked bank statements show. Karalevičius was loaned 5.2 million euros, which the statements say are for “investment.” These amounts were almost all guaranteed by Finalify, Spectro Finance Systems, or Spectro Finance.

Tax Dispute

In 2021, a dispute with Lithuanian tax authorities revealed that Mockevičius earned millions from the Bankera ICO before it had even begun.

In August 2017, Mockevičius signed a contract with Finalify Ltd. — which he himself represented as director — to provide “advertising and marketing services” for the Bankera ICO, according to a decision by Lithuania's Supreme Administrative Court. He was paid 750 Bitcoins, worth more than 2.5 million euros at the time.

When Mockevičius sold the Bitcoins, in late 2017, they were worth 6 million euros. He used a portion of the money to buy a 3-million-euro apartment in Monaco, according to the court's decision. The tax authorities ruled that Mockevičius had misclassified the income and fined him over 32,000 euros for underpaying personal income taxes. Karalevičius and Dobiliauskas were fined 38,000 and 36,000 euros respectively, but no further details were available.

The three Bankera co-founders did not respond to reporters' requests for comment. But Lithuania's State Tax Inspectorate confirmed the fines had been paid. 

Karalevičius, Dobiliauskas, and Mockevičius remain public faces of Lithuania's cryptocurrency industry, appearing at — and sponsoring — conferences in Vilnius and internationally. 

As for Bankera itself, the website remains active, and purports to provide “a modern bank account alternative for individuals and businesses,” though it has yet to receive an EU banking license. (Lawyers for Bankera UAB said ICO proceeds were used to secure an “electronic money institution license within the EU” for Pervesk, the e-money company involved in the Bankera ICO which lawyers described as “a Bankera ecosystem company.”)

Pervesk remains active. In 2023, the company claimed to have processed almost 2.5 billion euros worth of transactions and reported 4.8 million euros in revenues. 

And Spectro Finance's virtual currency exchange, which claimed to serve 300,000 customers at the time of the ICO, now says it helps more than one million users “buy, sell and exchange popular cryptocurrencies.”

In 2018, Lithuania's central bank fined Pervesk 700,000 euros for violations of Lithuanian banking laws. Karalevičius, Pervesk's manager, was fined 500,000 euros.

Pervesk was blocked from accepting or making payments. But by January 2019, the central bank had lifted the restrictions after Pervesk provided more information, improved its monitoring of business relationships, and “addressed other deficiencies identified during the inspection.” Two years later, a settlement between Pervesk and the Bank of Lithuania reduced the fine imposed on Pervesk to 244,000 euros, and canceled the one on Karalevičius altogether. 

The details of the settlement remain confidential.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices are stabilizing at around $93,500 and $1,770 at the time of writing on Monday, following a rally of over 10% and 12% the previous week. Ripple (XRP) price also rallied 8.3% and closed above its key resistance level last week, indicating an uptrend ahead.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 early last week, rallying 11.14% until Friday. However, BTC failed to close above its March high of $95,000 and declined slightly over the next two days. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers around $93,500. 

If BTC fails to close above the $95,000 resistance level and faces a pullback, it could extend the decline to find support around the $90,000 psychological importance level.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 65 after being rejected around its overbought level of 70 on Saturday, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Bitcoin's price could experience a sharp decline.

BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC continues its upward momentum and closes above $95,000, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $97,000.

Ethereum price broke above the $1,700 resistance level on Tuesday and rallied by 14.86% until Saturday. However, ETH retested the daily resistance level at $1,861 the next day and declined slightly. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $1,773.

If ETH declines and closes below $1,700, it could extend the losses to retest its next daily support at $1,449.

The RSI on the daily chart stands at 53 and points downward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bullish momentum. If the RSI falls below its neutral level of 50, Ethereum's price could experience a sharp decline.

ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes above the daily resistance at $1,861, it could extend the rally to retest its psychological importance level at $2,000.

XRP price continued to trade above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average at $1.98 last week, rallied over 8%, and closed above the daily resistance level at $2.23 on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $2.24.

If XRP continues its upward trend, it will extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50 before potentially reaching $3.00.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 57, above its neutral level of 50, indicating bullish momentum. 

XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around the $2.23 level, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

XRP climbs over 3% on Monday, hovering around $2.33 at the time of writing. The rally is likely catalyzed by key market movers like XRP futures Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) approval by the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a bullish outlook. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing above $94,000 at the time of writing on Monday, following a 10% rally the previous week. The institutional demand supports a bullish thesis, as US spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded a total inflow of $3.06 billion last week, the highest weekly figure since mid-November.

Ethereum (ETH) recovered the $1,800 price level on Saturday after US spot Ether ETFs (exchange-traded funds) recorded their first weekly inflows since February.

Defi Development Corporation (formerly Janover) filed a registration statement with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, signaling its intent to offer and sell a wide range of securities, including common and preferred stock, debt instruments and warrants for the purchase of equity

Bitcoin (BTC) price is consolidating around $94,000 at the time of writing on Friday, holding onto the recent 10% increase seen earlier this week.

Bitcoin continues to assert its leadership across the digital asset market, with Bitcoin Dominance climbing to a new local high of 64% as of April 22. This metric, which tracks Bitcoin's share of the total crypto market cap, highlights a clear and growing shift in capital toward BTC as the asset rallies past $90,000, currently trading at $92,700.

With Bitcoin now just 18% off its all-time highs, the asset's performance becomes even more impressive when stacked against traditional markets. The S&P 500 remains approximately 15% below its record levels, while the Nasdaq Composite lags by more than 20%. This comparison reinforces Bitcoin's relative strength and increasing appeal as a macro asset—especially in a market where liquidity remains tight and investors are gravitating toward quality.

This resurgence in BTC dominance comes at a time when ETF inflows are once again picking up steam, fueling renewed institutional interest. The regulatory landscape, while still evolving, appears to be stabilizing in Bitcoin's favor, especially when compared to the murky and often unpredictable regulatory path facing many altcoins.

Altcoins, by contrast, are struggling. Outside of isolated daily pumps, most of the altcoin market remains in a downtrend or in accumulation phases far from previous highs. Many lack the institutional interest, product-market fit, or meaningful on-chain activity to justify significant upside in the current environment. Fundamentally, the disparity between Bitcoin and most alts has never been clearer—and the market is pricing that in.

That said, some names did show strength. SUI was a standout performer, posting a gain of over 20% on the day and currently trading at $2.60. Despite the bounce, it remains more than 100% away from its all-time high, reminding investors how deep the bear market drawdowns have been for many newer Layer 1s and speculative projects.

Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates.

Ethereum also posted a notable move, gaining 10% in a single session to trade at $1,745. While a positive development, ETH still has a long way to go—needing a 170% rally just to revisit its former highs near $4,900. The underperformance of ETH, traditionally seen as Bitcoin's closest competitor, further illustrates the widening gap in investor confidence between BTC and the rest of the market.

This growing disparity underscores more than just price action—it highlights a changing narrative. Bitcoin is being recognized not only as a risk asset but increasingly as a long-term store of value, particularly in uncertain times. The rise in BTC dominance is a reflection of capital rotating into perceived safety, and away from speculative ventures with shaky fundamentals.

To be clear, this doesn't mean altcoins are obsolete—though let's be honest, many are. But it does show how hard it is to consistently “beat the market” when Bitcoin is the market.

As BTC.D continues to climb, it sends a clear and resounding message: in crypto, strength leads. And right now, Bitcoin is doing just that.

The spring migration of birds from their southern wintering grounds to their breeding grounds in the North is about to reach a fever pitch. Over the next few weeks, most of the U.S. is heading into peak migration, when hundreds of millions of birds can wing their way across the sky in a single night on a mission to claim a prime bit of real estate, attract a suitable mate and get to work raising the next generation. For bird-watchers, this is the most thrilling time of the year.

Many of these migratory birds travel vast distances between their winter and summer homes, taking advantage of seasonal abundances in food and daylight. The Blackpoll Warbler, a songbird that weighs about as much as a AAA battery, travels as many as 5,000 miles to reach its breeding grounds. The Red Knot, a stout shorebird with an orange-pink breast, may journey nearly twice that distance, sometimes covering more than 600 miles in a single day.

The birds are now looking extra snazzy—bright and glossy, dressed to impress in their breeding plumage. Colorful, shiny feathers can signal good health to potential mates. And birdsong is once again filling the air as birds tune up and start belting it out to flirt and defend their territories.

Birds are everywhere—look for them in your yard, your local park, the cemetery down the road, the grocery store parking lot. Get outside early if you can; birds tend to be most active in the morning. For a closer look at their beautiful colors, patterns and other details, use binoculars. A field guide can help you figure out which species you're observing— The Sibley Guide to Birds is especially good and is available as an app. Another guide in app form is Merlin Bird ID from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. It has a nifty feature that can help you identify birds by their songs and calls. If you want to participate in a community science project, you can enter your observations into Cornell's eBird database.

Spring is not only a perfect time for veteran bird-watchers to spy an elusive species. The availability of amazing technology means that even a novice can easily identify and learn about the birds they observe.

There's birding, and then there's extreme birding. Follow a team of competitive birders as they race to track down as many bird species as they can over the course of 24 hours.

People often wonder about the link between dinosaurs and birds. Here you can learn about how, over millions of years, evolution forged small, flight-capable birds with feathers and wings from nonavian dinosaurs.

The site, which likely once housed a roman cavalry unit, shows evidence of the respect soldiers had for their mounts.

A well-defined horse cemetery uncovered in Stuttgart's Bad Cannstatt neighborhood was the final resting place for over 100 horses that were part of the Roman Empire's cavalry in the second century A.D.

Construction crews discovered the cemetery during preparations for a housing project. Over time, excavations by the archaeological company ArchaeoBW—under the supervision of the State Office for Monument Preservation of the Stuttgart Regional Council—continued to unearth evidence from what is now believed to be the largest Roman-era horse cemetery in southern Germany, according to a translated statement from the council. 

Considered one of the most important Roman military locations in modern-day southwestern Germany, experts believe the Roman calvary occupying the region had about 500 soldiers on site, and sustained a potential population of over 700 horses. 

The first discovery of a horse skeleton in the area actually occurred in 1920 (also during a housing project), but the recent development uncovered the entire cemetery. Sara Roth, an archaeologist with the preservation office, said that radiocarbon dating helped pinpoint the age of the cemetery. “Due to the archaeological and historical knowledge of the Roman Bad Cannstatt,” she said in a statement, “the horses of the equestrian unit—a so-called ala—can be assigned, which was stationed on the Hallschlag from about 100 to 150 A.D.” 

Roth said that the deceased horses were buried about 1,300 feet from the equestrian barns (about 650 feet from the soldier's quarters), and would have been constantly replaced. Evidence shows that the carcasses were slid into shallow pits and buried lying on their side with outstretched or bent legs. And even with the dense burials, there were few overlaps of graves, exposing that the site was likely clearly defined with above-ground markers. Even if a horse could walk on its own, if it was deemed beyond military usefulness, it would have been taken to the cemetery and killed there. 

“The horses do not seem to have all died at the same time in a major event such as a battle or epidemic,” Roth said. “Rather, here are the animals that either died during the presence of the ala in Bad Cannstatt due to illness, injury, or other reasons, or who no longer did their task as a military horse.” 

One grave was of particular interest to archaeologists, as they discovered two jugs and a small oil lamp placed in the crook of the legs of one of the horses—grave goods typically reserved for humans. “Here we see a particularly close connection of the owner to his horse,” Roth said. “Even after about 1,800 years, the grief over the death of this one animal is still apparent.” 

The crew also discovered the face-down skeleton of a human male—far from the regular burial location for the Roman settlement, he was likely a social outcast. 

Experts plan to study the sex, age at death, and size of the horses while looking for possible diseases and causes of death. The team hopes to uncover more details about the Roman calvary.

Hailstorm formation has remained a mystery, until now.

Every year, hailstorms cause billions in damage to homes, businesses, and crops, yet how these ice balls of destruction form in the upper troposphere has remained somewhat of a mystery. The predominant theory was that hailstones went through a recycling motion, which explained why they often contained varying layers of a clear and opaque ice. 

Now, a new study from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that this recycling motion is only a small part of the story. In the study, Peking University's Qinghong Zhang, lead author of the study published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used stable isotope analysis to effectively recreate the “history” of 27 hailstone specimens produced by nine separate storms in China. Using this precise method, Zhang and her colleagues could pinpoint at what level in the atmosphere certain layers of the hailstones formed, creating a vertical map of the ice chunk's journey toward the earth. 

“This work fundamentally changes how we understand hail formation,” Zhang said in a press statement. “By moving beyond assumptions to actual chemical evidence, we're building a more accurate picture of these destructive weather phenomena.”

Of the 27 hailstones studied, only one of them displayed tell-tale signs of the hypothesized recycling method, in which hail travels up and down within a storm cloud. Some 10 stones showed that they formed while steadily descending toward the atmosphere, and another 13 displayed evidence of only one single upward push. Surprisingly, three even showed signs of nearly horizontal movement.

According to the researchers, hail typically forms in a temperature “sweet spot” of between roughly -30 and -10 degrees Celsius. However, Zhang's data showed that embryos of hailstones can actually form outside that gradient, between about -33.4 and -8.7 degrees Celsius. Although this largely refutes the previous theory behind hailstone formation, larger hailstones do require extended time (at least one upward growth) in this zone for supercooled water to form more layers. This explains why stronger storms—with more powerful updrafts—often produce larger hailstones. 

Zhang hopes that understanding the inner workings of hailstorm formation will help improve weather forecasting and our ability to estimate the potential dangers of a passing hailstorm (this research is in collaboration with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research). However, improving forecasting capabilities in the U.S. may prove difficult under the Trump Administration, as it steadily levies cuts on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which oversees the National Weather Service. Meteorologists at NWS have already reported degraded forecasting services due to curtailed weather balloon launches used to help gather data for accurate storm prediction. 

Although unlocking the secret of hailstone formation could help protect people in the path of dangerous storms, it helps to be able to identify that a storm is coming in the first place.

This Cutting-Edge Encryption Originates in Renaissance Art and Math

The mathematics underpinning the modern method of elliptic curve cryptography originated with Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi

By Richard Jensen edited by Clara Moskowitz

The portly, balding sculptor-turned-architect must have drawn a few curious gazes as he set up a complicated painting apparatus in the corner of a Renaissance-era piazza. He planted his instrument, which involved an easel, a mirror and a wire framework, near the then unfinished cathedral of Florence in Italy—a cathedral whose monumental dome he would soon design.

His name was Filippo Brunelleschi, and he was using the apparatus to create a painting of the baptistry near the cathedral. This demonstration of his recently discovered laws of perspective is said to have occurred sometime between 1415 and 1420, if his biographers are correct. The use of the laws of perspective amazed bystanders, altered the course of Western art for more than 450 years and, more recently, led to mathematical discoveries that enable elliptic curve cryptography. This is the security scheme that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and has become a fast-growing encryption method on other Internet platforms as well.

But how did Renaissance art lead to the mathematics that govern modern cryptography? The tale spans six centuries and two continents and touches on infinity itself.

The first steps in the path from Brunelleschi to Bitcoin involved connecting the visual geometry within the rules for perspective to Euclidean geometry, the orderly realm of lines and points that we're taught in school.

French mathematician Girard Desargues, who researched the geometry of perspective in the 17th century, was the first contributor. His findings, however, were couched in rather obscure language and struggled to find an audience. His key contributions were included in a book that had a print run of 50 copies, small even for that era, and many of those copies were eventually bought back by the publisher and destroyed. During Desargues's lifetime, only fellow French mathematician Blaise Pascal became an ardent disciple of his work. Pascal contributed his own theorem to the study of what became known as “projective geometry.”

Despite Desargues's obscurity, he made a revolutionary breakthrough by adding the concept of points and lines at infinity to Euclidean geometry. By including those points, projective geometry could be merged with Euclidean geometry in a way that was consistent for both systems.

In Desargues's system, every pair of lines meets at exactly one point, with no special exceptions for parallel lines. Furthermore, parabolas and hyperbolas are equivalent to ellipses, with the addition of one or two points at infinity, respectively.

These insights, though valuable, would languish in obscurity for more than 100 years. When they reappeared, it was not because Desargues's work was rediscovered. Rather, a different French mathematician, Gaspard Monge, began to work on the same questions and derived similar results.

The most comprehensive work on projective geometry in this era, however, came in the 19th century from French engineer and mathematician Jean-Victor Poncelet, under rather trying circumstances.

Poncelet attended France's prestigious École Polytechnique, graduating in 1810. He then joined France's corps of military engineers as a lieutenant and was ordered to what is now Belarus to support Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. He and his fellow troops overran a burned out and abandoned Moscow in September of that year, and when the Russians refused to sue for peace after losing the city, Poncelet was with Napoleon when the army left Moscow and began the return to France.

Poncelet remained with the French army right up to the Battle of Krasnoye in Russia, where he was separated from his unit and possibly left for dead. After the battle, he was scooped up by the Russian army and marched to Saratov, Russia, more than 700 miles from Krasnoye and more than 2,000 miles from his home in Metz, France.

Although Poncelet was not confined to a prison, he was “deprived of books and comforts of all sorts,” according to an English translation of his introduction to his first book on projective geometry. As a coping mechanism, he decided that he would try to redevelop all the math he had learned up to that point. He could not carry out this plan, however, saying that he was “distressed above all by the misfortune of my country and my own lot.”

Instead he essentially expanded on Monge's work and recreated Desargues's work independently. In hindsight, it is perhaps not surprising that a prisoner of war thousands of miles from home and unsure of when, or even if, he would be repatriated would focus his efforts on understanding points at infinity—a distance that might have seemed quite intelligible to someone in Poncelet's situation.

After the war that had been sparked by that invasion ended, Poncelet returned to France and his two-volume work on projective geometry, published in 1822, was far more well-received and widely read than Desargues's work.

At around the same time that Poncelet was finishing his book on projective geometry, Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel was studying elliptic integrals. These integrals are rather difficult expressions that started off as parts of an attempt to measure the circumference of an ellipse. Abel discovered that there are certain circumstances where the inverse of these elliptic integrals—what are called elliptic curves—could be used instead. The curves, it turned out, are much easier to work with. Further research into elliptic curves would be left to others, however; Abel died from tuberculosis at age 26 in 1829, mere months after publishing an important paper on the subject.

In the early 1830s French mathematician Évariste Galois laid the groundwork for a new field of mathematics. Galois would die tragically but also stubbornly in a duel at age 20, but before his death he laid out the principles of group theory, in which mathematical objects and operations that follow certain rules constitute a group.

The French had managed to unite projective geometry with Euclidean geometry, but it would fall to a German mathematician, August Möbius (of Möbius strip fame) to figure out how to merge projective geometry with the Cartesian coordinate system familiar to algebra students as a means of graphing equations. The system he developed, which uses what are called homogeneous coordinates, play a pivotal role in elliptic curve cryptography.

Several decades later, in 1901, another French mathematician, Henri Poincaré, realized that points with rational coordinates—that is, points with coordinates that can be represented as fractions on the graph of an elliptic curve—composed a group. What Poincaré realized is that if you defined an operation (typically called “addition”) that took two rational points on the graph of the curve and yielded a third, the result was alwaysanother rational point on the curve. This process onlyworked if you used the homogeneous coordinates discovered by Möbius that include a point at infinity, however. Importantly, elliptic curve groups turned out to be Abelian, which meant that the order in which those addition operations were performed didn't matter.

This is where matters stood until the mid-1980s, when Victor S. Miller, then a researcher at IBM, and Neal Koblitz of the University of Washington independently realized that you could build a public-private key cryptographic system based off elliptic curve groups.

Public-private key encryption, which is how almost all traffic on the Internet is secured, relies on two encryption keys. The first key, a private one, is not shared with anyone; it is kept securely on the sender's device. The second key, the public one, is composed from the private key, and this key is sent “in the clear,” meaning that anyone can intercept it and read it. Importantly, both keys are required to decrypt the message being sent.

In elliptic curve cryptography, each party agrees on a certain curve, and then each performs a random number of addition operations that start from the same point on the same curve. Each party then sends a number corresponding to the point they've arrived at to the other. These are the public keys. The other party then performs the same addition operations they used the first time on the new number they received.

Because elliptic curve groups are commutative, meaning that it doesn't matter in what order addition is carried out, both parties will arrive at a number corresponding to the same final point on the curve, and this is the number that will be used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Elliptic curve cryptography is a relative latecomer to the encryption game. The first suite of tools did not appear until 2004, far too late to become a standard for the Web but early enough to adopted by the inventors of Bitcoin, which launched in 2009.

Its status as the de facto standard for cryptocurrencies made people more familiar with it and more comfortable implementing it, although it still lags behind RSA encryption, the standard method in use today, by a wide margin.

Yet elliptic curve cryptography has distinct advantages over RSA cryptography: it provides stronger security per bit and is faster than RSA. An elliptic curve cryptographic key of just 256 bits is roughly as secure as a 3,072-bit RSA key and considerably more secure than the 2,048-bit keys that are commonly used. These shorter keys allow for faster page rendering for Web traffic, and there's less processor load on the server side. Principles from elliptic curve cryptography are being used to try to develop cryptographic systems that are more quantum-resistant.

If trends continue, the mathematics behind the vanishing point discovered by Renaissance artists 600 years ago may turn out to be a fundamental part of Internet encryption in the future.

Metrics details

Uncovering the genomic bases of phenotypic adaptation is a major goal in biology, but this has been hard to achieve for complex behavioural traits. Here we leverage the repeated, independent evolution of obligate cavity nesting in birds to test the hypothesis that pressure to compete for a limited breeding resource has facilitated convergent evolution in behaviour, hormones and gene expression. We used an integrative approach, combining aggression assays in the field, testosterone measures and transcriptome-wide analyses of the brain in wild-captured females and males. Our experimental design compared species pairs across five avian families, each including one obligate cavity-nesting species and a related species with a more flexible nest strategy. We find behavioural convergence, with higher levels of territorial aggression in obligate cavity nesters, particularly among females. Across species, levels of testosterone in circulation were not associated with nest strategy nor aggression. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes and co-regulated gene networks revealed more shared patterns of brain gene expression than expected by drift, although the scope of convergent gene expression evolution was limited to a small percentage of the genome. When comparing our results to other studies that did not use phylogenetic methods, we suggest that accounting for shared evolutionary history may reduce the number of genes inferred as convergently evolving. Altogether, we find that behavioural convergence in response to shared ecological pressures is associated with largely independent evolution of gene expression across different avian families, punctuated by a narrow set of convergently evolving genes.

Metrics details

The increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and the decline in the discovery of novel antibiotics have resulted in a global health crisis, particularly, for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, for which therapeutic dead-ends are alarming. Here, we identify and characterize a molecule, NM102, that displays antimicrobial activity exclusively in the context of infection. NM102 inhibits the activity of the non-essential Mutation Frequency Decline (Mfd) protein by competing with ATP binding to its active site. Inhibition of Mfd by NM102 sensitizes pathogenic bacteria to the host immune response and blocks infections caused by the clinically-relevant bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, without inducing host toxicity. Finally, NM102 inhibits the mutation and evolvability function of Mfd, thus reducing the bacterial capacity to develop antimicrobial resistance. These data provide a potential roadmap for the development of drugs to combat antimicrobial resistance.

The fight against pathogenic bacteria is becoming one of the greatest challenges for our societies, particularly with the spread of multi- and extensively-drug resistant bacteria, which are seriously jeopardizing the use of traditional antibiotics1. Estimates suggest that at least 700,000 people die annually from drug-resistant infections, and without intervention, this number could rise to 10 million by 2050, becoming the major cause of death worldwide2. In particular, infections caused by the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) are increasingly associated with therapeutic dead-ends. As such, they are at the top of the World Health Organization's priority list of bacteria for which novel therapeutics are urgently needed. The identification and characterization of antibiotics with new molecular scaffolds, innovative targets and/or novel mechanisms of action, associated with a low potential for resistance induction, are urgently needed and particularly challenging for Gram-negative pathogens. Indeed, since 1990, only six new classes of antibiotics have been approved3. Recent efforts have begun to revitalize antibiotic research, with compounds being explored either through drug repurposing or through molecular mechanisms that are often redundant with traditional antibiotics. This is the case for finafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic recently approved to treat ear infections caused by P. aeruginosa4,5, darobactin, which specifically targets Gram-negative bacteria6, teixobactin, which is only effective against Gram-positive bacteria7, and the newly developed irresistin-16, which exhibits bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria without inducing resistance, at least thus far8. These findings pave the way for the discovery of new molecules, a crucial step in providing effective antibiotics that act on novel targets, thereby avoiding cross-resistances.

In this context, this study focuses on a new bacterial target, the Mutation Frequency Decline (Mfd) protein, and its inhibition by innovative small molecules. Mfd is a non-essential transcription-repair coupling factor, ubiquitous in bacteria and absent in eukaryotes9. Mfd recognizes RNA polymerase (RNAP) stalled at noncoding lesions and utilizes ATP to translocate along DNA, likely forcing RNAP forward and ultimately dissociating it from the bulky DNA template10. Mfd then stimulates DNA repair by recruiting components of the Nucleotide Excision Repair system11,12,13,14. The structure of Mfd has been solved, revealing the presence of an ATPase motor module, which is highly conserved among bacteria and is functionally necessary12,15. Stress-induced mutagenesis can help pathogens generate drug-resistant cells during antibiotic therapy. Mfd has been associated with the development of antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter jejuni16,17, and Helicobacter pylori Mfd-deficient cells are sensitized to antibiotics16,17. Furthermore, Mfd has been suggested to be an evolvability factor that promotes hypermutation in bacteria, thereby accelerating the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR)18. In line with that, a recent study identified, through an in vivo screen, a molecule called ARM-1 for Antimicrobial Resistance Molecule that targets Mfd to reduce mutagenesis and significantly delays antibiotic resistance development across highly divergent bacterial pathogens19. Taken together, these data emphasize that blocking Mfd could hinder molecular evolution, thereby inhibiting the development of resistance in many bacterial pathogens.

Furthermore, Mfd is critical for virulence in the Gram-positive Bacillus cereus and in the Gram-negative Shigella flexneri species and it confers resistance to nitric oxide (NO) stress20,21. The production of reactive nitrogen species is a key step in the immune response following infection22. NO induces lesions in bacterial DNA, thereby limiting bacterial growth within hosts. Mfd is involved in DNA repair following DNA damage and is thus required for bacterial resistance to the host response. Consequently, in both species, a mutant lacking Mfd is severely impaired in its virulence capacity in cell and animal models. As Mfd is widely conserved in the bacterial kingdom, these data highlight a mechanism—possibly ubiquitous in bacteria—that overcomes the host immune response and tackles its mutagenic properties.

The function of Mfd in the bacterial bypass of host immunity, its role as an evolvability factor during antimicrobial resistance, its ubiquity in the prokaryotic world as well as its absence in higher eukaryotes, all support the selection of this protein as an innovative bacterial target for anti-infective therapies. Molecules that inhibit Mfd activity would neither directly inhibit nor kill bacteria, but instead curb bacterial evolution while impeding the bacteria's ability to resist the host immune response. Thus, Mfd inhibitory compounds should boost the immune system's response against pathogenic bacteria while acting exclusively at the inflammation site, thereby preventing collateral damage.

Herein, we report a targeted, structure-based, high-throughput in silico screening, using the druggable ATP binding site of Mfd, to identify molecules capable of acting as competitors to the cognate ligand ATP, thereby inhibiting Mfd activity. One molecule, NM102, was identified as a potent molecule that specifically targets the ATP-binding site of Mfd. In silico molecular analysis and in vivo assays revealed that NM102 displays antimicrobial activity, specifically in the context of infection, even against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as resistant K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and pathogenic E. coli. In animal models, NM102 was able to block infections with these pathogens without inducing host toxicity nor damaging the microbiota. Finally, NM102 also blocked the function of Mfd as an evolvability factor, thereby reducing the bacteria's ability to develop antimicrobial resistance.

Overall, our findings identify and characterize a promising antimicrobial candidate that could be used either alone, as a booster for the host immune system, or in combination with other antibiotics by inhibiting Mfd's evolvability activity.

To identify antimicrobials with a new mechanism of action, we performed a rational, targeted, and structure-based high-throughput in silico screening of small molecules to challenge their efficiency to accommodate to the ATP binding site of the bacterial protein Mfd. 3D modeling of E. coli Mfd in an active conformation was designed (Supp Fig. 1). Using this template, a large library of 4.8 million compounds was screened in silico, to challenge their capacity to bind the ATPase site of Mfd. This virtual screening led to the identification of 95 molecules, selected for subsequent experimental validation (Supp Fig. 1).

The 95 molecules were challenged to inhibit the ATPase function of E. coli Mfd in vitro (Fig. 1A). The inhibition rates of Mfd activity ranged from 10% to 85%. The molecule with the highest inhibition rate (85%), named NM102, was selected for further analysis. Dose-response assays on ATPase activity (Fig. 1B) and Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 1C) both revealed a competitive mode of inhibition of NM102 to ATP with an IC50 of 29 ± 0.1 µM and a Ki of 27 ± 1.9 µM.

NM102 is a small molecule with a chemical scaffold relatively close to ATP as it is composed of an indole-like ring close to the adenosine ring followed by a ribose-like ring and eventually polar sulfur groups that could mimic phosphate moieties (Fig. 1D).

To measure the specific binding of NM102 to Mfd, Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiments were conducted (Fig. 2A). ITC is based on the determination of the heat involved during the binding of a ligand to a receptor, measuring power units as a function of time. NM102 showed affinity towards Mfd, and the isotherm for the titration of the ligand against the molecule indicated a significant exothermic behavior. The obtained stoichiometry value (n = 1.1) indicates a 1:1 binding interaction between the Mfd protein and NM102 with a Kd of 83 ± 9 µM. To assess the specific and competitive binding of NM102 in the ATP pocket of Mfd, we measured the interaction of ATP with Mfd in the absence and in the presence of NM102 (Fig. 2B). In the absence of NM102, ATP binds to Mfd with a Kd of 145 ± 9 µM. By contrast, in the presence of NM102, ATP binds to Mfd with a Kd of 430 ± 50 µM. Thus, NM102 binds to Mfd with a better affinity than ATP and successfully inhibits Mfd-ATP interaction which decreased by ca 70% (A = Ka/Kapp = 0.34). These data demonstrate that NM102 binds specifically to the ATP binding site of Mfd and inhibits Mfd-ATP binding in a competitive manner.

To assess the specificity of the NM102 inhibitor towards the ATPase activity of Mfd, we evaluated its capacity to decrease the ATPase activity of various eukaryotic proteins, including functionally related and unrelated ATPase proteins. The activity towards four proteins was tested: ERCC3, ERCC6, XPD, and yUpf1 (Fig. 3A). NM102 sharply inhibited Mfd ATPase activity, while it had no effect on all other ATPase protein activity, strongly suggesting that NM102 is selective for Mfd activity. In addition, the activity of NM102 was also tested towards the bacterial helicase RecG since the library screen that identified NM102 was performed on the Mfd sequence of E. coli morphed with respect to the active ADP binding site of RecG (Supp Fig. 1). Consistently, a slight activity of NM102 was observed, nevertheless significantly lower than for Mfd, further emphasizing NM102 specificity for Mfd. (Fig. 3B).

ATPase activity of the proteins, in the absence and presence of 100 µM of NM102, was assessed by using BIOMOL® Green reagent microtiter-plate assay. Data were normalized to that of the DMSO control.

The graph shows the distribution of binding energies obtained for twenty poses of the substrate/ligand couple by AutoDock. Source data are provided as a source data file.

Additionally, we investigated the specificity of NM102 through computational docking studies of the ATP pocket of the E. coli Mfd to measure the binding affinity (Fig. 3C). NM102 showed a marked enhanced affinity for Mfd as compared to its cognate ATP ligand, with binding energies of −9.8 kcal.mol−1 vs -6.5 kcal.mol−1, respectively, consistently with ITC data. The docking (Fig. 4A) highlighted that Mfd accommodates NM102 at its ATP binding site, within the same binding pocket that encompasses the motif I with residues from Asp629 to Glu636, that also includes the catalytic Lys634. Markedly, NM102 engages in π-stacking interactions with Phe597 and Phe599, a polar interaction with Thr635, and charge interactions with Glu636 plus Arg905 (Fig. 4A panel right). Additionally, we were able to define a sphere of interaction through twenty-one positions involved in the binding of both ATP and NM102 (Suppl. Table 1). NM102 is a slightly longer molecule as compared to ATP, especially in its extended conformation. Thus, its accommodation extends to interact with amino-acid residues that are remote from the catalytic center, namely Gln664, His665, Asn668, and D876 of motif V. This feature could explain the increased affinity for NM102 compared to ATP.

B Close-up of the docking of ATP (cyan sticks) and NM102 (orange stick) in Mfd of E. coli harboring the site-directed mutations F597A, F599A, K634A, and E730Q. For the sake of comparison, position of ATP in the non-mutated Mfd is shown as black lines.

In parallel to Mfd, bindings of ATP and NM102 were simulated in Mfd that was mutated in silico at its catalytic center (Fig. 4B). Substitutions were performed and rotamers were selected for Phe597, Phe599, Lys634A and Glu730Q. Lys634A and Glu730Q since they are known to define the active site9. Phe597 and Phe599 were selected because they could be crucial for the recognition and pose of the indole-like ring of the ligand. Accordingly, they were mutated into alanine residues to abolish the apolar contribution of their aromatic ring, while preserving local and global folding of the protein. Importantly, the docking showed that mutated Mfd completely changed the accommodated poses of both ATP and NM102, and that their alternative positions were inconsistent with a competitive occupancy of the ATP site by ATP. These data further highlight the interaction of NM102 at the ATP binding site of Mfd.

Mfd is widely observed in the bacterial kingdom10. To assess whether NM102 could more generally bind and inhibit the function of Mfd from a wide range of bacteria implicated in AMR, multiple sequence alignment and homology modeling of Mfd were performed for one strain of each species of the ESKAPE bacteria (Supp Fig. 2). The alignment revealed that Mfds are distinctly clustered into Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, nevertheless they overall share more than 45% of sequence similarity along 1200 amino acid residues of the ESKAPE bacteria. Markedly, this average on Mfd full-length sequence does not reflect the trend observed for each functional module. Indeed, modules composed of domains D1a-D3, D4, D5-D6, and D7 show 47%, 58%, 68% and 44% of sequence similarity, respectively (Supp Fig. 3). Particularly, the ATPase motor module, composed of D5 and D6 domains, is by far the most conserved. It shares 68% and 36% sequence similarity and identity within the ESKAPE strains, respectively. Furthermore, the ATP binding site, which locates at the interface between D5 and D6, showed fairly high to strict conservation of the catalytic motifs, the so-called motifs I to VI (Supp Fig. 2).

To profile the affinity of NM102 towards Mfds from the ESKAPE bacteria and identify the probable conserved features of binding, NM102 was docked into each 3D homology model of Mfd and the binding energy was measured (Suppl. Fig. 4). Molecular binding in all the modeled Mfds revealed that both ATP and NM102 maintain similar interactions at the ATP binding site, with residues conserved in all species, particularly the catalytic Lys634 and Glu730 that are strictly conserved, and Phe597 and Phe599 that are replaced by tyrosine residues in S. aureus, A. baumannii, and E. faecium (Mfd E. coli numbering). Their mode of binding can be clustered into two rather isoenergetic groups. One cluster gathers NM102 pose similar in Mfd E. coli, S. aureus, A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, while the other gathers an NM102 pose similar in Mfd E. faecium and E. cloacae. Also, 21 residues were identified as identical between species and always positioned within the 5 Å coordination sphere (Suppl. Table 1). Particularly, P1 Phe597 and P2 Phe599 could be responsible for the π stacking pose of the adenine-like moiety while polar P12 Thr635, and charged P11 Glu636 and P21 R905 could interact closely with the sulfonamide and phosphate-like groups of NM102. Overall, ATP binding ranged from −5.5 to −8 kcal mol−1, whilst NM102 binding ranged from -9.0 to −10.3 kcal.mol−1, suggesting that NM102 binds to all ESKAPE Mfds with a significantly better affinity as compared to the physiological ATP.

Taken together, our results strongly suggest that NM102 could compete with ATP at the ATP binding site in all Mfd proteins of the ESKAPE group bacteria, hence, specifically inhibiting Mfd ATPase activity. As the challenging urgency is to identify molecules efficient against Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria of the ESKAPE group, the rest of the study is focused on clinically relevant K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and E. coli strains.

Mfd is a non-essential protein in unstressed conditions. However, we have previously shown that Mfd is essential to resist NO stress during infection20,21. Our innovative antimicrobial strategy consists in identifying inhibitors that have no antibiotic activity under unstressed conditions, but are only active under stressed conditions, where Mfd is required. NM102 was thus first tested for its antimicrobial activity in the absence of stress. Under these conditions, no antimicrobial activity on K. pneumoniae was observed (Fig. 5A). Conversely, under NO stress conditions, NM102 inhibited clinical K. pneumoniae survival (IC50 of 78.8 µM) (Fig. 5B). These results highlight that NM102 has an antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae under NO stress conditions.

Strains were grown to exponential phase in LB medium. The bacteria solution was prepared in RPMI medium and dispatched in 96-wells plate. Bacteria were exposed for 4 h at 37 °C to 50 µL of increasing concentrations of NM102 alone A K. pneumoniae DOU or with NOC-5 as a NO donor, B K. pneumoniae DOU, C E. coli ATCC 25922, D P. aeruginosa CIP27853). The bacteria survival rate was calculated by normalizing bacteria load against control without NM102. The results reported are mean ± SD of four independent experiments each in triplicates, P values are calculated against the condition without NM102, using One Way ANOVA (****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, the exact P values are provided as source data). IC50 was computed using Graph Pad 7.05. Source data are provided as a source data file.

When further investigated in the presence of other important bacterial pathogens, NM102 inhibited bacterial survival of clinical E. coli (IC50 of 61.2 µM, Fig. 5C) and, although to a lesser extent, of P. aeruginosa (IC50 of 94.2 µM, Fig. 5D) under NO stress conditions. These data show that NM102 acts against Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria under conditions that mimic immune stress.

To assess the antimicrobial activity of NM102 as an antimicrobial in vivo, Bombyx eri larvae were injected with P. aeruginosa CIP27853 and treated with NM102 (Fig. 6A). The insects were then crushed and Colony-Forming Units (CFU) were counted by plating. Treatment with NM102 resulted in a drastic 2.5 log reduction in bacterial load, showing that NM102 is effective against P. aeruginosa in vivo.

A P. aeruginosa CIP27853 wt and ∆mfd strains were grown to late exponential phase in LB medium at 37 °C and injected into forth instar silkworm larvae without or with NM102 (2.78 µg/larvae). Boosts of NM102 (6.97 µg/larvae) were administrated at 4 h and 8 h post-infection. At 24 h post-infection larvae were crushed and the content of each tube was serially diluted on LB plates for CFU numeration. Each graph represents the values obtained for n insects with the mean value indicated. Each dot represents one larva (Pa wt n = 10, Pa wt +NM102 n = 10, Pa ∆mfd n = 15, Pa 3/18/25mfd + NM102 n = 15). P values are calculated against the condition wild type-strain without NM102, using Mann-Whitney test (p < 0.0001). For mice experiments, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 wt and ∆mfd (B), K. pneumoniae ALE (C), P. aeruginosa CIP27853 (D) were grown to late exponential phase and diluted in PBS. Intranasal (i.n.) bacterial administration was performed through slow instillation of 20 µL of bacterial suspension (1 × 107 CFU). 200 µL of NM102 nanoformulation (NF-NM102 at 1.5 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg) or empty nanoformulation (control) were administrated in mice via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (B). Alternatively, 20 µl of a mixture containing bacterial suspension (1×107 CFU) and NM102 nanoformulation (1.5 or 6 mg/kg) or empty nanoformulation was administered via the i.n. route (C, D). MPN (10 mg/kg) was inoculated via the i.p. route. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 24 h and the log CFU in the lung was calculated per gram of organ. Each graph represents the bar plot obtained for n mice with mean value indicated: (B) CTR n = 9, NM102 1.5 mg/kg n = 4, NM102 6 mg/kg n = 9, MPN 10 mg/kg n = 6, ∆mfd n = 6, ∆mfd + NM102 n = 10; C CTR n = 8, NM102 1.5 mg/kg n = 8, NM102 6 mg/kg n = 8, MPN 10 mg/kg n = 8; (D) CTR n = 7, NM102 6 mg/kg n = 7, MPN 10 mg/kg n = 8, NM102 1.5 mg/kg+ MPN n = 8, NM102 6 mg/kg + MPN n = 7. P values are calculated using a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (***p < 0.0005; **p < 0.001; *p < 0.005). The exact P values, minima, maxima, center, bound of box, and whisker are all provided as source data. Source data are provided as a source data file.

To confirm that NM102 targets Mfd in vivo, the effect of NM102 was investigated on the survival of the P. aeruginosa mutant ∆mfd. First, the amount of CFU of the ∆mfd mutant was lower compared to the CFU recovered following insect infection with the wild-type strain, showing that Mfd is a critical virulence factor for P. aeruginosa. Second, NM102 did not decrease the bacterial load of the ∆mfd mutant, confirming that NM102 is specifically active on Mfd in vivo. It is interesting to note that NM102 decreased bacterial load to the same level that could be reached with the ∆mfd mutant, highlighting that NM102 had a maximum of activity, completely inhibiting the Mfd activity, similarly to a complete deletion of the target.

To further investigate the potential of NM102 in vivo, a mouse lung model of infection with K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa was chosen23. Due to its poor solubility in most common solvents (Suppl. Table 2), the above studies were performed using a solution of NM102 in DMSO. However, DMSO is known to be toxic to mice at high concentrations24. Thus, an alternative to the DMSO vehicle was developed to further assess the therapeutic effect of NM102 and to offer a more viable medication. Herein, a DMSO-free nanoformulation was prepared via a sonication assisted-nanoprecipitation method in the presence of poly(d-L lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) (Suppl. Fig. 5A-D). The resulting NM102 nanoformulation (drug content = 0.6 mg/mL) exhibited an average diameter of 180 nm, with narrow particle size distribution (polydispersity index, PDI = 0.2) and a neutral surface charge (ζ potential = −2 ± 1 mV). An “empty” nanoformulation, used as a control, was prepared according to the same protocol but without the drug (average diameter = 136 nm ± 7, PDI = 0.08 ± 0.04, ζ potential = −4 ± 1 mV). The NM102 nanoformulation showed a good colloidal stability for up to 2 weeks at both 4 °C and room temperature (Suppl. Fig. 5E, F).

Mice were infected intranasally with K. pneumoniae and treated via the intraperitoneal route with the NM102 nanoformulation. After 24 h, the CFU in the lung was assessed (Fig. 6B). The NM102 nanoformulation significantly reduced the bacterial burden in lungs compared to control group treated with empty nanoformulation in a dose-dependent manner (by 4 times with 1.5 mg/kg of NM102 and by 15 times with 6 mg/kg of NM102, corresponding to 75% and 94 % reduction of the bacterial load, respectively), showing that NM102 nanoformulation acts as an efficient antimicrobial against K. pneumoniae infection in vivo. The efficacy of the NM102 molecule was compared under the same conditions to that of meropenem (MPN), a beta-lactam antibiotic that is commonly used in the treatment of various infections including K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa23. NM102 nanoformulation showed similar efficacy to MPN in reducing the K. pneumoniae CFU in the lung of the infected mice at 6 and 10 mg/kg, respectively (Fig. 6B), resulting in 94% and 93% reduction of the bacterial load, respectively (Suppl. Fig. 6).

To confirm that NM102 targets Mfd in vivo, mice were also infected with the K. pneumoniae ∆mfd mutant. As expected, the ∆mfd mutant was less virulent than the wild type strain. MPN inhibited the bacterial burden of the ∆mfd mutant (Suppl. Fig. 6). By sharp contrast, the NM102 nanoformulation showed no effect on the bacterial burden of the ∆mfd mutant, further highlighting the inhibitor specificity toward the Mfd target in vivo (Fig. 6B, Suppl. Fig. 6). NM102 decreased the CFU recovered of the wild type strain to the level of CFU obtained with a ∆mfd mutant, and NM102 had no impact on the ∆mfd mutant, which further highlights that NM102 acts on Mfd in vivo.

The efficacy of NM102 was further investigated on the clinical K. pneumoniae ALE strain, which is resistant to several antibiotics including MPN (Fig. 6C, Suppl. Table 3). The NM102 nanoformulation at 6 mg/kg drastically decreased by 23 times the bacterial load in the lung (75% reduction of the bacterial load). Strikingly, MPN at 10 mg/kg had no significant effect on the resistant K. pneumoniae ALE, highlighting the potential of the NM102 molecule on resistant Gram-negative bacteria in vivo.

For P. aeruginosa, the NM102 nanoformulation at 6 mg/kg decreased by 14 times the mean bacterial load (although not statistically significant), and MPN at 10 mg/ml decreased the bacterial load by 26 times (Fig. 6D). The combination of the two treatments was drastically efficient against P. aeruginosa in an NM102-dose dependent manner compared to single treatments (decrease by 127 times for NM102 1.5 mg/kg + MPN 10 mg/kg, and by 730 times for NM102 1.5 mg/kg + MPN 10 mg/kg). These data suggest the possible use of NM102 nanoformulation as an antimicrobial drug during combination therapy.

Overall, NM102 proved to be an antimicrobial molecule active against clinically-relevant pathogens, including multidrug-resistant bacteria that may be associated with difficult-to-treat infections and sometimes therapeutic failure.

In the development of anti-infectives, an important feature that needs to be assessed is their impact on the host. When tested for toxicity towards human cells (Fig. 7A), NM102 and the NM102 nanoformulation did not induce cytotoxicity either to HeLa or to Vero cells at the highest doses used in insect and mouse experiments, respectively. MPN showed no toxicity to HeLa cells, but induced cytotoxicity in Vero cells at 10 and 100 µM.

A HeLa and Vero cells were cultured in DMEM at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated for 1 h with MPN at 10 and 100 µM, NM102 at 10 and 300 µM, NM102 nanoformulation at 1.29 and 5.16 mM or their respective control 10% DMSO or empty nanoformulation. Cytotoxicity was assessed using CellTiter96®AQueous. Values for treated cells were normalized to the untreated control. The results reported are mean ± SD of three independent experiments each in triplicates. B Mice were i.p. treated with NM102 (6 mg/kg) or control. Changes in the mice body weight were assessed for 7 days. Source data are provided as a source data file.

Treatment with NM102 had neither impact on insect or mouse survival nor on the mice weight (Fig. 7B). Importantly, PLGA, which was used for the nanoformulation of NM102, is an FDA-approved copolymer for which neither systemic nor organ toxicity has been reported in animal models25,26.

As NM102 is active on bacteria only in the context of a stress-like inflammation, we hypothesized that following pulmonary infection, the inflammation will be localized at the site of infection and that NM102 treatment should not affect the distant gut microbiota species, in contrast to treatment with conventional antibiotics.

To assess the innocuity of NM102 towards the gut microbiome in vivo, mice were first treated with NM102 without bacterial infection, and feces were recovered after treatment. The state of the microbiome was assessed by quantifying the overall quantity of bacteria in the feces by qPCR (Supp Fig. 7). NM102 did not impact the overall quantity of bacteria in the feces, after 1 and 7 days of treatment. By contrast, streptomycin decreased sharply the overall quantity of bacteria in the feces after 1 day.

We further assessed the composition of the gut microbiome following nasal infection by K. pneumoniae and NM102 nanoformulation treatment. We did not detect changes in gut microbiome diversity between untreated and NM102-treated mice. The family-level microbiome profile, following NM102 treatment, largely resembled that of untreated mice (Fig. 8A). The Shannon indexes of empty nanoformulation and MN102 nanoformulation-treated mice were similar to untreated mice (Fig. 8B). Similarly, we did not detect significant differences in beta-diversity between treatments using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (Fig. 8C). These results indicate that the nasal NM102 treatment does not induce changes in the richness or the structure of the gut microbiome.

Gut microbiome diversity is unaffected by NM102. Mice were infected with K. pneumoniae and left untreated or treated with NM102 nanoformulation (NF-NM102) or the empty nanoformulation (NF) as control. After 24 h, feces were collected and the microbiome diversity was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Relative abundance of bacterial families (A), Shannon index (B), and weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances (C) were determined. The bar colors represent bacterial families with mean abundance >1%. Each dot (B, C) and each column (A) represents the value obtained for one mouse. Error bars in Fig. 6B represent mean ± SEM. The sample size in Fig. 6 A, B, C is n = 7 mice per group. The statistical test in Fig. 6B is permutational anova (PERMANOVA). The statistical test in Fig. 6C is a two-tailed Wilcoxon test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. Source data are provided as a source data file.

Mfd has been shown to play a critical role in promoting bacterial resistance to commonly used antibiotics and has been proposed as a target for the development of anti-evolvability drugs18. We thus assessed whether NM102 could also inhibit Mfd evolvability activity. First, the mutation rate of E. coli wild type, ∆mfd mutant, and ∆mfd complemented strains was assessed following exposure to rifampicin that commonly induces a high frequency of resistance in vitro (Fig. 9A). The mutation frequency of the ∆mfd mutant was significantly reduced compared to that of the wild type strain, confirming the role of Mfd in the induction of mutations. Second, the strains were treated with NM102 resulting in a significant reduction in the mutation frequency of the wild-type strain to a level similar to that of the ∆mfd strain. NM102 had no impact on the mutation frequency of the mutant strain, further highlighting its specificity to the Mfd target. To assess for potential polar effects of the mfd mutation, we complemented the E. coli ∆mfd strain with the entire mfd gene. An intermediate value of mutation frequency was obtained for the complemented strain, indicating that the complementation is likely partial, which is not surprising due to the use of an inducible promoter. More importantly, treatment with NM102 led to a statistically significant decrease in the mutation frequency, consistently with the phenotype of the wild-type strain, showing that the complementation restored mfd function.

A The mutation rate of E. coli wt, Δmfd, and Ω∆mfd/mfd strains were measured following exposure to NM102 (100 µM) or the DMSO control, using the frequency of spontaneous accumulation of resistant mutants to rifampicin as reference measurement. Data in this figure correspond to 12 independent cultures. Error bars show SEM. Lea Coulson analysis was used on webSalvador to determine significance using an efficiency parameter of ε = 0,5 (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ****p < 0.001, the exact P values are provided as source data). Resistance evolution of E. coli to rifampicin (B) and streptomycin (C) was measured following exposure to NM102 (100 µM) or the DMSO control. Line plots show the median antibiotic concentration at each sampled time point for three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a source data file.

Then, the impact of NM102 on the evolution rate was evaluated following treatment of E. coli with several antibiotics. NM102 significantly decreased the evolution rate of E. coli following treatment with rifampicin (Fig. 9B) or streptomycin (Fig. 9C) by eight and two folds, respectively. These data strongly suggest that NM102 targets the evolvability activity of Mfd and could thus be used as a combinatory drug to decrease antimicrobial resistance.

To address the need for novel bacterial drug targets and the design and synthesis of unique anti-infectives with new mechanisms of action, especially towards Gram-negative bacteria, we have identified and characterized an innovative bacterial target, the Mutation Frequency Decline protein, Mfd, and promoted its inhibition by a newly discovered therapeutic molecule. Mfd is a nonessential transcription repair coupling factor that is ubiquitous and conserved in bacteria but absent in eukaryotes. In this study, we identified a molecule, NM102, as an inhibitor of Mfd activity. We showed its dual capacity, first to display antimicrobial activity in animals against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, two major nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria of the ESKAPE group, and second to inhibit Mfd evolvability function, thus reducing the frequency of antibiotic resistance appearance. As such, NM102 is active on its own to prevent bacterial infections. Furthermore, it is also predicted to strongly reinforce the efficacy of existing antibiotics and prevent the emergence of resistance, an aspect rather unique and essential in the field of drug development and antibiotic therapy.

Since Mfd is not an essential protein, standard minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays could not be used to identify inhibitory molecules. Therefore, to identify the NM102 molecule, we developed a targeted approach based on the 3D structure of the Mfd's active site. This rational approach allowed screening of a large library of molecules to identify potential inhibitory molecules. Hence, we propose a strategy that can be applied to other non-essential bacterial targets, providing a rapid and efficient pathway to screen the potential of small molecule without the need to develop laborious and specific in vitro activity tests. This structure-based method allowed us to predict the druggability of the target based on the 3D structural descriptors (i.e., polarity, hydrophobicity, volume) of ligand-bound cavities in the Mfd ATP-binding site27. The main advantage of such method is its high interpretability regarding pocket properties. Additionally, once a potentially druggable pocket has been identified, it can be screened using various in silico tools to propose potential ligands for experimental validation and further optimization.

We chose to target the ATP-binding domain of Mfd to identify inhibitory molecules because: (i) ATP plays a central role in Mfd activity; (ii) the 3D-structure of the ATP-binding site structure in Mfd is known; (iii) ATP-binding sites, despite their large structural diversity, are known to be druggable, as evidenced by inhibitors of many targets (e.g., protein kinases, HSP-90a)28; and (iv) although a large proportion of proteins have ATP-binding sites, these sites exhibit significant structural diversity, resulting in distinct specificity and selectivity for ligands28.

We report that NM102 is a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor in silico and in vitro. In silico, its molecular mode of interaction explains how NM102 is competitive and docks into the ATP pocket with greater affinity than ATP. Notably, its length could reinforce the interaction between D5 and D6 domains, which is expected for ATPase activity, through direct and closer interaction with the Q664-H665 stretch and an ancillary salt bridge between the D876 and R905 residues. Consistently, NM102 competed with ATP in vitro. Moreover, such interaction could trap Mfd in its active ATPase conformation and prevent it from engaging in the subsequent DNA translocation step. Indeed, Mfd undergoes a functional cycle to couple ATPase to DNA translocation and then switch to UvrA recruitment. NM102 interacts strongly through polar interaction with the catalytic residue E730, whose mutation into glutamine is defective in ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, E730 is sandwiched between R733 and R953, and R953A has been reported to result in the loss of DNA translocation9. Any modification of interaction within the E730 nexus, which connects both ATPase and DNA translocation activities, could impact the coordination of the two activities, which must be exquisitely tuned. Notably, the pseudo-adenine part of NM102 conserves π-stacking with F599, similar to that seen in the adenine moiety of ATP.

Furthermore, we have mutated the four residues F597A, F599A, K634A, and E730Q that are possibly critical in all species for the binding of NM102 in the ATP binding pocket of Mfd. Indeed, K634A and E730Q were previously described as important for ATP binding9 and F597A and F599A are evidenced in this work as crucial for the recognition of the indole-like ring of NM102. Neither ATP nor NM102 could correctly be positioned into the mutated Mfd ATP pocket, further demonstrating the specific binding of NM102 in the ATP binding pocket of Mfd. These data provide mechanistic and molecular insights into NM102 binding with respect to its target and specificity.

Regarding specificity, NM102 neither binds nor inhibits the ATPase activity of various eukaryotic ATPase proteins, including closely functionally related ATPase proteins involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair with ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity. These data further suggest that the ATP pockets of ATPase proteins exhibit structural diversity, allowing for distinct ligand specificity. The absence of toxicity of NM102 towards bacteria (in the absence of exogenous stress) and eukaryotic cells, further suggests that NM102 does not affect the activity of general ATPase proteins.

Mfd activity enables bacteria to overcome the host's defense responses20. Host defense against bacteria is predominantly mediated by cellular immune mechanisms. Various cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells produce toxic species, including NO, during most infections. NO can severely damage biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, thereby inducing DNA damage and strand breaks29. NO is cytotoxic and mutagenic for various pathogens and host cells30,31,32, and it plays an important role during infections by limiting microbial proliferation22. Bacteria express sensor proteins that can detect NO and, accordingly, activate the expression of enzymes that detoxify NO before it reaches lethal levels33,34. Additionally, we previously demonstrated a link between NO-induced bacterial DNA damage and DNA repair by Mfd21. Mfd is ubiquitous in bacteria, and almost all bacteria induce an NO response from the host, so the Mfd-targeted inhibitor is expected to have a broad spectrum of activity. We have consistently shown that NM102 docks in silico to the Mfd of all ESKAPE pathogens and has antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria under NO stress. As a proof of concept for efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, we also confirmed that NM102 has antimicrobial activity against B. cereus under NO stress, the same B. cereus in which we initially identified the function of Mfd during immune stress (Suppl. Fig. 8).

Mfd activity is not limited to NO stress. Indeed, Mfd has been shown to protect against oxidative stress in Bacillus subtilis35. This may explain why NM102 was efficient in vitro during ATPase assay, with a relatively low IC50 value, and also effective in vivo, while exhibiting higher IC50 values during in vitro NO stress, which may not fully represent the conditions encountered by bacteria during in vivo infections. The ability to evolve is critical for bacterial survival, particularly in the context of pathogenesis, where evading host immunity is essential and requires constant adaptation. Therefore, Mfd may be involved in bacterial virulence, likely by preventing DNA damage induced by the host through its overall immune response and/or stress conditions encountered in vivo. This question is difficult to address technically in vivo as bacteria encounter many different stresses during infection. However, we can speculate that blocking Mfd activity with the inhibitory molecule hinders the bacteria's ability to cope with the host response (not only NO stress), allowing the immune system to effectively combat the invading pathogens. Another hypothesis could be the role of Mfd during the modulation of transcription. Indeed, it has been recently suggested that Mfd acts as a transcription factor able to modulate the activity of RNAP and gene expression. These activities may also explain the observed effect of Mfd in stressed bacteria9,16,36. Besides, in C. difficile, Mfd deficient cells overproduce toxins involved in virulence37. Thus, inhibition of Mfd may not be effective in the treatment of some pathogens.

We then focused our study on the impact of NM102 on the mutagenic property of Mfd to assess its role in antibiotic resistance. Indeed, Mfd has been shown to be a general evolvability factor promoting bacterial mutagenesis during infection9. Mfd is reportedly required for developing high levels of drug resistance upon initial exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics, accelerating AMR development18. Additionally, stress-induced mutagenesis can help pathogens generate drug-resistant cells during antibiotic therapy38. Here we show that NM102 inhibits Mfd's function as a mutation and evolvability factor during antibiotic stress. This decreases the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to classical antibiotics. As such, NM102 can target the evolvability property of Mfd. By decreasing the resistance pressure, these new drugs may have a longer efficacy, which in turn will help limit the spread of antibiotic resistance. Interestingly, a small molecule, ARM1, has very recently been identified as an inhibitor of Mfd-dependent mutagenesis, further demonstrating the potential of fighting AMR by targeting this protein involved in the acceleration of evolution leading to increased AMR19,39. The mechanisms leading to Mfd inhibition are different between NM102 and ARM1. Indeed, in contrast with NM102, ARM1 did not bind to the ATP binding site of Mfd and had no impact on Mfd ATPase activity19.

Combination therapies have played and will continue to play an important role in clinical treatment. We have shown that NM102 is effective as antimicrobial in vivo, both alone and in combination with meropenem, and that NM102 treatment can kill bacteria that are resistant to current antibiotics. Thus, a combination treatment, including an Mfd inhibitor coupled with a classical antibiotic, could be a promising strategy with increased antimicrobial efficacy and a reduced likelihood of resistance development at the onset of treatment. As recently proposed, targeting the evolutionary capacity of bacteria could also have broad implications beyond AMR development, from reducing cancer evolution to limiting pathogenic diversity in the context of host immunity18.

Drug loaded into nanocarriers has been widely proposed for the delivery of poorly soluble drugs, not only overcoming the drug's physicochemical limitation but also ensuring enhanced accumulation at the site of action and sustained drug release40,41,42,43. The design of an NM102-loaded nanoformulation helped overcome the issues related to low solubility of the drug molecule, allowing its administration in the best possible clinically acceptable solvent (i.e., water). Herein, we provide proof of the efficacy of the aqueous nanoformulation of NM102, paving the way for developing a novel antibiotic formulation suitable for widespread use.

Classical antibiotics target essential bacterial pathways and, as such, are highly efficient but not specific, thus also affecting commensal members of the microbiome44. The gut microbiome is essential for human and animal health, as it is involved in various health-associated processes, including digestion, metabolism, and immune development, and it also protects against invading pathogens. Since Mfd is not an essential protein, its inhibition by NM102 should not impact the distant host microbiome in the absence of inflammatory stress. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the gut microbiome composition after NM102 treatment in healthy mice and mice infected intranasally with K. pneumoniae. NM102 had no detectable effect on the diversity of the gut microbiome, which can be collaterally damaged with classical, non-selective antibiotics. This is a unique feature that may help develop microbiome-friendly molecules that not only treat infectious diseases but also promote the overall health of patients. However, in enteric infections, local gut inflammation may make Mfd essential for the survival of bacterial commensals as well. Therefore, in those cases NM102-like compounds may also negatively impact the gut microbiome, causing collateral damage similar to that of current antibiotics, but with the advantage still of being effective in combating resistance.

Besides, since Mfd is a non-essential protein, targeting it should decrease the resistance pressure by NM102. NM102 by itself does not kill bacteria and therefore, resistance is not observed in the absence of any stress. In vivo, during inflammation, Mfd is essential and NM102 treatment hinders bacterial survival. This is likely to cause bacterial resistance eventually. Nonetheless, we can speculate that this resistance will be reduced in comparison to traditional antibiotics, which apply continuous pressure to both pathogenic and microbiota bacteria over the course of treatment. More research will be required on this topic.

Overall, new drugs targeting Mfd, a non-essential virulence and evolvability factor, could be used alone or as adjunctive therapy during the treatment of infections to improve the potency of current antibiotics and reduce the emergence of resistance. We are confident that these innovative molecules could provide a promising therapeutic option and expand the arsenal of drugs available to combat AMR and potentially other diseases.

All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the local animal welfare bodies (Unité IERP, INRAE Jouy en Josas, France, Agreement No. 78120), and all experiments were approved by the COMETHEA ethics committee and the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research (APAFIS#10124-2017040413027917 v12). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with European Directive 2010/63/EU. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and adhere to the 3Rs principle (Reduce, Refine, Reuse).

As we aimed to explore the capacity of Mfd to bind ligands that could be competitive with ATP, a prerequisite was to model Mfd in a conformation conductive ligand binding, meaning that the ATP-binding site must adopt an open and accessible conformation. At the time of computation, all available crystal structures of E. coli Mfd were in an inactive form due to the so-called walker A motif closing over the active site, thus precluding any binding (pdb id 2EYQ)12. The D2 domain of RecG helicase from Thermotoga maritima (pdb id 1GM5) is a structural homolog of Mfd, solved in an active conformation complexed with ADP45. Thus, the nucleotide-bound active form of E. coli Mfd (K578-P780, UniProt identifier P30958) was obtained by morphing the inactive form of E. coli Mfd into the active form of RecG using the default settings of the Yale Morph2 server (http://morph2.molmovdb.org/submit.html).

The Bioinfo-DB database (http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/bioinfo) is an in-house developed database of 4.8 million commercially available compounds as powder (1–50 mg) filtered according to internal rules to contain only drug-like compounds. The database was first filtered to retain compounds grossly resembling nucleotides and fulfilling the following properties: (i) at least one hydrogen-bond donor, (ii) at least two hydrogen-bond acceptors, (iii) at least one aromatic ring, (iv) predicted aqueous solubility higher than 50 µM (predicted with PipelinePilot v.9.5, Dassault Systèmes, Paris), (v) topological polar surface area lower than 120 Å2. The filtered set of 1.2 million compounds was then converted into three-dimensional (3D) structures using Corina v3.40 (Molecular Networks, Erlangen, Germany). Up to four stereoisomers were created for compounds with undefined stereocenters. Stereocenters that were explicitly defined were left unchanged. Altogether, 3D atomic coordinates were defined for 1,874,034 compounds, constituting the docking set.

The docking set was anchored to the above-described nucleotide-binding site of E.coli Mfd (Phe599, Thr602, Gln605, Gly631, Phe632, Gly633, Lys634, Thr635) with the Surflex-Dock v.3066 program46. A prototyping molecular dynamics object or “protomol” was first generated from the list of binding site residues. Compounds were then docked using default settings (excepted for the -pgeom option) of the docking engine, retaining the best ten poses according to the native Surflex-Dock scoring function.

Potential hits were selected according to the following two strategies (Suppl. Fig. 1):

The 178 best-scoring poses (Surflex-Dock score > 10) from the docking set were retained. Then, compound redundancy was removed (the highest score was retained if more than two poses originated from the same compounds) to yield 91 compounds. A chemical diversity selection by maximum common substructures was performed using the LibMCS algorithm (ChemAxon Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) to retain a first set (SET1) of 23 chemically diverse compounds.

All poses from the docking set were submitted to an interaction-based filter47 to select 206 non-redundant compounds that absolutely fulfilled the following interactions: hydrogen bond to Gln605.OE1 atom, hydrogen bond to Gln605.NE2 atom, hydrogen-bond to Gly631.N atom, π–π aromatic stacking to Phe599. If multiple poses from the same compound fulfilled the interaction similarity filter, the top scored posed (best Surflex-Dock score) was kept. A chemical diversity selection by maximum common substructures was performed using the LibMCS algorithm (ChemAxon Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) to retain a second set (SET2) of 74 chemically diverse compounds.

Previously defined SET1 and SET2 were merged, yielding a final selection of 95 unique hits (two hits were common to both sets) that were further purchased in 5 mg quantities.

Mfd sequences from the ESKAPE pathogens were retrieved from NCBI. They were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment MAFFT algorithm with default parameters48. The alignment was visualized using Jalview 249.

For homology modeling, the recent structure of E. coli Mfd in the so-called L1 state and in complex with the RNA polymerase was chosen as template because L1 state-Mfd adopts an active and opened conformation, that renders the ATP pocket accessible. The L1 state was solved at 4.6 Å resolution, using cryo-electronic microscopy; its pdb id is 6X2650. Based on this template, one hundred models were computed for each Mfd of the ESKAPE bacteria, in their wild-type form, using the homology building software Modeller version 9.1851. Each model was ranked and selected upon the lowest DOPE and function scores of Modeller. Eventually, the stereochemistry of selected model was checked using Procheck50.

To obtain Mfd with the mutations F597A, F599A, K634A, and E730Q, the best model of non-mutated Mfd was iteratively substituted four times, using the Pymol command mutagenesis. For the mutation of glutamate into a glutamine residue, the rotamer of the side-chain was selected to give a conformation compatible within the protein and avoid steric clashes.

ATP and NM102 were individually docked into the active site of each modeled Mfd, in L1-state conformation, with respect to the homology modeling described above. AutoDock Tools 4.2 (ADT4) was used with a grid box conserved in size and position, centered onto the active site of the ATPase, with the genetic algorithm of Lamarck and the default parameters for 20 runs. ATP and NM102 coordinates were obtained from the ZINC database (https://zinc.docking.org/substances/home/) in mol2 format, converted into ADT4's PDBQT format with their dihedrals set free to rotate.

For each run of each complex, an affinity score was calculated. The pose of the ligand, with the best interaction energy measured in kcal.mol−1, was selected because it is the most probable one. Finally, holo models were visually inspected using PyMOL (PyMOL 2.0.7. Schrödinger, LLC), and protein-ligand interactions were characterized using the Protein–Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) program52. The same protocol was used for Mfd mutated at F597A, F599A, K634A and E730Q.

K. pneumoniae DOU CTXM-15, ALE CTXM-15+, P. aeruginosa CIP27853, E. coli ATCC25922 were provided by Dr. Thierry Naas (CHU de Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France). The MIC of antibiotics was determined on those strains. Briefly, a 0.5 McFarland standard bacterial solution was prepared in physiological saline and then diluted 1/1000 in Mueller Hinton broth. Then, 50 µL of bacterial solution was added in 96 well plates containing 100 µL of various concentrations of antibiotics (Penicillin, Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Meropenem, Cefotaxin, Oxacillin, Streptomycin, and Ciprofloxacin). The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was measured in each well to determine the MIC (Suppl. Table 3).

E. coli K12 wild-type and ∆mfd mutants were previously described53. The complemented E. coli K-12 Δmfd Ωmfd mutant strain was obtained by inserting into the E. coli K12 Δmfd mutant strain the complementation plasmid pET21a containing the entire mfd gene (synthesized by Biobasic, genetic environment Suppl. Fig. 9). Briefly, the receptor strain was suspended in 100 µL of a buffer containing LB, 10% PEG4000, 5% DMSO, MgCl2 0.01 M, MgSO4 0.01 M and mixed the complemented plasmid. A heat shock was performed and complemented strains were selected after regeneration on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 µg/mL of ampicillin. The corresponding mutant was named E. coli Δmfd Ωmfd.

All Strains were stored at −80 °C as 20% (v/v) glycerol stocks.

The P. aeruginosa CIP27853 ∆mfd mutant strain was constructed by double-crossover region deletion. Briefly, using the available sequencing information of P. aeruginosa CIP27853 strain, approximately 1-kb regions upstream (region 3360879 to 3361826) and downstream (region 3363535 to 3364310) of the mfd gene were synthesized by Genecust (Boynes, France). The two fragments were cloned and juxtaposed into the suicide vector pEXTK by Genecust. The resulting plasmid, pPa001, was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli SM10 λpir and conjugated into P. aeruginosa CIP27853 strain as previously described (Hmelo et al., 2015). Briefly, donor and recipient strains were mixe 1:2 on a sterile 0.05 μm-pore-size-membrane (VMWP02500 Milipore) placed on LB agar plates supplemented with irgasan 25 µg/ml and gentamicin 75 µg/ml and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. After mating, bacteria were resuspended from filter in LB with IPTG 1 mM, incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and plated on LB agar plates with Azithromycine (AZT) 100 µg/ml and IPTG 1 mM for 18 h at 37 °C. Transconjugants were selected for loss of gentamicin resistance by picking individual colonies on LB agar and LB agar supplemented with 75 μg/mL gentamicin at 37 °C. Deletion of the mfd gene by double recombination was verified by PCR using primers upstream (GAACACCACCAGTTCCACCTG) and downstream (GGTAGAGCTGGCCAATCAGC) of the cloned region and by sequencing. The resulting mutant was named P. aeruginosa ∆mfd.

The K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 ∆mfd mutant strain was constructed by double-crossover region deletion. Briefly, using the available sequencing information of K. pneumoniae ATCC700603 strain, ~1-kb region upstream (region 2056347 to 2057137) and downstream (region 2060189 to 2060810) of the mfd gene were synthesized by Genecust (Boynes, France). The two fragments were cloned on either side of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette (CatR) from the pDK3 plasmid (Addgene) into the pUC57 vector (Addgene) by Genecust. The synthesized DNA fragments and the CatR cassette were digested with the appropriate enzymes and ligated to produce a “mfd-upstream”-“CatR”-“mfd-downstream” KpnI-EcoRI fragment, which was then inserted between the KpnI and EcoRI sites of the pDG704 vector (Addgene). The resulting plasmid, pKp002, was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli SM10 λpir and then conjugated into K. pneumoniae ATCC700603. Briefly, the donor and recipient strains were mixed 2:1 on a sterile 0.05 μm-pore-size-membrane filter (VMWP02500Milipore) placed on LB agar plates for 4 h at 37 °C. After mating, bacteria were resuspended from the filter in 1.5 mL of LB medium. Transconjugants were selected on LB agar supplemented with 25 μg/mL of chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Deletion of the mfd gene by double recombination was verified by PCR using primers located upstream (CCCCAGGATGTTGTTTTGCA) and downstream (CCGTTATCCTGCACCACATG) of the cloned region and by sequencing. The resulting mutant was named K. pneumoniae ∆mfd.

The 95 molecules were sourced from commercial vendors: Enamine, Chembridge, Chemspace, AbamaChem, Asinex, Chemdiv, Interbioscreen, BCH Research and Specs.

E. coli MG1655 His6-tagged MfdC (residues 451-1148 Uniprot accession code P30958) was synthesized and purified by BioBasic Inc. (Markham, ON, Canada) with a purity >90%. Briefly, the expression plasmid pET21a containing mfdC was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and expression of His6-tagged MfdC was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at 37°C for 4 h. Cells were lysed, and protein was purified using a Ni-IDA column. Elution fractions were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (2 mM DTT, 50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) overnight at 4 °C.

The XPD/ ERCC2 protein is involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and is an integral member of the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH complex. The protein has ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity and belongs to the RAD3/XPD subfamily of helicases54. The XPB/ ERCC3 protein is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that functions in nucleotide excision repair. It is a subunit of basal transcription factor 2 (TFIIH) and, therefore, also functions in class II transcription helicases55. The CSB/ERCC6 protein is a DNA-binding protein involved in transcription-coupled excision repair. It has an ATPase activity, interacts with several transcription and excision repair proteins, and may promote complex formation at DNA repair sites56. The three purified proteins were purchased from Abbexa Ltd.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein yUpf1 HD (residues 221–851 Uniprot accession code P30771, which corresponds to the helicase domain) was kindly provided by Dr Hervé Le Hir (Institut de biologie de l'Ecole normale supérieure (IBENS), Paris, France) and described in ref. 57.

Mfd-C enzyme activity was evaluated by measuring the quantity of inorganic phosphate (PO4i) released using BIOMOL® Green reagent microtiter-plate assay (Enzo Life Sciences). For the initial drug screening, Mfd-C (0.35 µM) was incubated with DMSO (2% (v/v)) or with the 95 compounds (100 mg/mL) and 1 mM ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. To further evaluate NM102 activity, Mfd-C (0.35 µM) was incubated with NM102 at the indicated concentration (0 to 100 µM). ATPase reaction was measured in Tris buffer 0,05 M at pH 8 in the presence of ATP (0 µM to 0.3 mM) for 30 min at 37 °C. XPD (2 nM), ERCC3 (35 nM), ERCC6 (2 nM), and yUpf1 HD (127 nM) ATPase activities were measured in reaction buffer (20 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM potassium acetate, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM zinc sulfate, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). Then, the proteins were incubated with 2% DMSO or 100 µM NM102. The ATPase reaction was quantified after 30 min of incubation at 30 °C. For all proteins, 50 µL of each reaction medium was transferred into clear, flat-bottom 96-well plates, and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 µL of BIOMOL® Green reagent. Absorbance at 620 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Tecan). Absorbance values were then converted to nmols of released PO4i based on a PO4i standard curve prepared as recommended by the supplier. The potency of each compound was calculated relative to the DMSO control.

The Z′ factor of the ATPase test was calculated using the formula Z′ = 1 − (3σc + +3σc−)/(|μc + −μc − |) where (σc+) and (σc−) are the standard deviations of the high and low reference controls, respectively, and |μc + –μc − | is the absolute difference between the means of the two control.

The IC50 was measured using a plot of Mfd-C ATPase activity versus ATP concentration (0.002–0.3 mM) in the presence of various concentrations of NM102. Data analysis and IC50 calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.05 (San Diego, CA). Lineweaver-Burk plots were generated using SigmaPlot Software.

The affinity constant and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between NM102 and Mfd were determined by ITC using NanoITC (TA Instruments)58. The Mfd protein was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris + 0.2 M NaCl with 4% DMSO at pH = 8 (buffer A) and used in the assay at 20 µM. NM102 and ATP were dissolved in the same buffer and used at 200 µM. For competitive assay, Mfd was incubated with NM102 and Mfd protein interaction with ATP was evaluated. The generation of heat involved during the binding of the ligand to the receptor was measured at 25 °C. Each titration involved 20 injections at 300 s intervals of 2.5 μL aliquots of the compound NM102 solution (200 μM) into the sample cell (volume 200 μL) containing the Mfd solution (20 μM). Solutions were degassed and stabilized at 298 K. The titration cell was continuously stirred at 300 rev/min. The heats of dilution of the ligand in buffer A were subtracted from the titration data.

Fitting was performed using the independent model of the Nano Analyze software (ITC Run) to determine the association constant (Ka), the dissociation constant (Kd), the stoichiometry (n), and the enthalpy change (ΔH). For competitive assays, the ratio A = Ka/Kapp indicates the reduction of the ATP binding in the absence or presence of NM102 inhibitor. Determinations were performed by triplicate.

Bacteria were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until the late exponential phase. Bacterial suspensions were prepared in RPMI medium at concentrations between 5 × 104 and 1 × 105 CFU/mL, and 150 μL aliquots were dispensed into a 96-well plate. Bacteria were exposed to NO by adding 50 μL of NOC-5 at final concentrations ranging from 0 to 1000 μM. The bacterial survival rate was quantified by plating on LB agar after 4 h at 37 °C and normalizing the bacterial load in NOC-5-treated samples to that of untreated control samples (0 μM of NOC-5). NO dose–response curves were generated by plotting log10-transformed NOC-5 concentrations and fitting the data to a non-linear model with a variable Hill slope using GraphPad Prism 7.05. The NOC-5 concentrations required to induce 10 and 20% of mortality were calculated using R and the drc package (Christian Ritz and Jens C. Strebig).

For efficacy assays, bacterial solutions were prepared as described above. Bacteria were exposed to 50 µL of NOC5 at a concentration inducing ~80–90% survival compared to the untreated condition (K. pneumoniae DOU 14 µM, P. aeruginosa 5 µM, E. coli ATCC 42 µM), in the absence (0 µM) or presence (5–80 µM) of NM102. Bacterial survival rate was quantified by plating on LB agar after 4 h at 37 °C and normalizing the bacterial load in NM102-treated samples to that of the control samples. The toxicity of NM102 in the absence of NO was assessed by exposing the bacterial suspension to NM102 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 80 µM of NM102 as described above but without NOC-5. The NM102 concentration required to induce 50% of mortality (IC50) was calculated using R and the drc package.

NM102 was formulated in the presence of poly(d-L lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) according to a previously described method with some modifications59. It consists of an ultrasonic emulsification process, followed by dialysis to remove the organic solvent. First, 120 mg of PLGA and 28 mg of NM102 were dissolved in 4 mL of DMSO and then the organic phase was injected through a 23 G-needle into 50 mL of a 0.5% w/v aqueous solution of PVA under sonication in ice (5 min, amplitude 20%, cycle of sonication: 10 s ON and 10 s OFF) using a tip sonicator (Vibra-cellTM–75041, Fisher Bioblock Scientific, Belgium). The organic phase was then removed by dialysis (24 h, room temperature) using a 100 kDa MW cut-off cellulose ester membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific, France). Empty nanoformulation was prepared according to the same protocol but in the absence of drug in the organic phase. Nanoformulations were stored at 4 °C. Intensity-weighted mean diameters (Dz) and particle size distributions were measured at 25 °C by dynamic light scattering using a Nano ZS instrument (173° scattering angle, Malvern, France) after 1/20 dilution in Milli-Q water (Millipore, France). The surface charge of the nanoformulations was determined by measuring the ζ-potential at 25 °C using the same instrument after 1/10 NP dilution in 1 mM NaCl. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The colloidal stability of the nanoformulations was assessed by measuring the evolution of the mean diameter and the particle size distribution for up to 2 weeks at 4 °C and room temperature.

For storage, 20-mL flat-bottom glass vials were filled with 2 mL of nanoformulation supplemented with 5% w/v of trehalose as a cryoprotectant. Samples were frozen at −20 °C for 12 h and then freeze-dried (24 h) using an Alpha 2–4 LD plus freeze-drier (Martin Christ, Germany) (condenser temperature <70 °C, vacuum <0.1 mbar). Freeze-dried samples were capped, weighted, and stored at 4 °C. Samples were reconstituted immediately before use by the addition of Milli-Q water, followed by gentle homogenization by pipetting and vortexing.

The drug content was determined by direct quantification of NM102 in freeze-dried NM102 nanoformulation samples (without cryoprotectant). Briefly, one sample was dissolved in DMSO (1 mL) by vortexing. The amount of NM102 was then quantified by UV spectroscopy at 282 nm (PerkinElmer UV/VIS spectrophotometer, Germany). The drug concentration was calculated using an NM102 calibration curve in DMSO (correlation coefficient >0.999), as follows: drug content (mg/mL) = weight of drug/volume of nanoformulation dispersion.

Fourth instar silkworm larvae Bombyx eri were purchased from « L'office pour les insectes et leur environnement » (OPIE), Guyancourt, France. Larvae were reared with Ligustrum vulgare or Ligustrum japonicum until they reached a weight of [0,6 –0,9] g. Prior to assays, Bombyx eri larvae were kept under starvation overnight and randomly distributed in groups of 30. P. aeruginosa wt and ∆mfd strains were grown in LB medium at 37 °C under agitation at 180 rpm until late exponential growth phase. Bacterial cultures were then diluted in Phosphate Saline Buffer (PBS). The last dilution to obtain the desired concentration was done in PBS with 10% DMSO with or without NM102. Bacteria were plated right before infection to determine the quantity injected. Larvae were injected with 20 µL of bacterial suspension (3 × 103 CFU/injection in 10% DMSO) containing NM102 (2.78 µg/larvae) or 10% DMSO in the hemolymph via the last pro-leg. Larvae were placed at 27 °C. At 4 h and 8 h post first injection, larvae were injected with 50 µL of: (i) PBS, 10% DMSO or (ii) PBS, 10% DMSO with NM102 (6.97 µg/larvae) via the last pro-leg on the other side of the larvae. All injections were performed using a 1 mL hypodermic syringe with a 0.5 × 25 mm needle and an automated syringe pump (KD Scientific KDS 100). 24 h post infection, insects were placed in 2 mL sterile tubes containing 500 µL of PBS and 1.4 mm ceramic lysing beads (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and crushed using a Fast Prep instrument (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). The bacterial content in each tube was assessed by serial dilutions on LB plates and CFU numeration. The log CFU was calculated per gram of larvae.

For all mice experiments, nine-week-old, specific-pathogen-free, female, strain C57BL, substrain 6J mice were purchased from Janvier Labs (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France). They were housed with a maximum of five animals per cage and had ad libidum access to food and water. Mice were adapted to the environment of the facility (IERP, INRAE, Jouy-en-Josas, France) one week before the experiments. The experiments were done with 12 h dark/light cycle at ambient temperature and controlled humidity.

Prior to infection, mice were mildly anaesthetized by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine (79 mg/kg) and xylazine (9 mg/kg). Bacterial strains were grown to late exponential phase and diluted in PBS. Intranasal (i.n.) bacterial administration was performed through slow instillation of 20 µL of bacterial suspension (1 × 107 CFU) with a micropipette (10 µL in each naris). Inoculated suspensions were plated on LB agar for CFU determination prior to injection. Empty and NM102-containing formulations were administrated in mice either: (i) via the i.p. route with 200 µL of suspension containing 1.5 or 6 mg/kg (1.29 and 5.16 mM, respectively) of drug or (ii) via the i.n. route with 20 µl of a mixture containing bacterial suspension (1 × 107 CFU) and NM102 nanoformulation (1.5 or 6 mg/kg) or empty nanoformulation. MPN (10 mg/kg) was inoculated via the i.p. route. For combination therapy studies, NM102 nanoformulation and MPN were inoculated via the i.n. and the i.p. route, respectively.

Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 24 h and the left lung was placed in 2 mL sterile tubes containing 600 μL of PBS and 1.4 mm ceramic lysing beads (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA). Organs were homogenized using a FastPrep instrument (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA), and aliquots from each tube were serially diluted on LB plates for CFU enumeration. The log CFU was calculated per gram of organ.

For the toxicity study, mice were treated (i.p., 200 L/injection) with NM102 (6 mg/kg) or DMSO as control, and mice weight was monitored for 7 days.

HeLa (human cervical epithelial cell line, ATCC CCL-2) and Vero (monkey kidney epithelial cell line, ATCC CCL-81)) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 U/mL penicillin, and 1 µg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Once reaching a confluency of 70%, cells were washed with Dulbeccos Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) and detached by treatment with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Total cell number was determined by using a Neubauer Cell chamber and cells were seeded at a concentration of 4 × 104 cells/well in a flat-bottom Tissue Culture 96-well plate. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight before starting the cytotoxicity assay. Two hours before the assay, medium in each well was replaced by an antibiotic-free DMEM medium. Cells were washed and treated with the respective chemical (MPN at 10 and 100 µM; NM102 at 10 and 300 µM; NM102 nanoformulation at 1.29 and 5.16 mM) or their respective control (10% DMSO or empty nanoformulation) in a total volume of 100 µL in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) medium (ThermoFischer). After 1 h of incubation, 20 µL of CellTiter96®AQueous was added to each well and cells were incubated again for 1 h. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm after 5 s of shaking to determine cytotoxicity. The background of CellTiter96®AQueous in HBSS and the background of each chemical were subtracted of the respective values. Treated cells were compared and normalized to the untreated control.

Mice were treated (i.p., 200 µL/injection) with DMSO or NM102 (6 mg/kg). Feces were collected (day 1 and day 7) and the quantity of bacteria was assessed by qPCR as previously described60. In addition, microbiota diversity was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Mice were treated (i.p., 200 µL/injection) with DMSO or NM102 (6 mg/kg) after i.n. infection with K. pneumoniae. Feces of untreated and treated mice were collected and stored at −80 °C. Microbial DNA was extracted using the Dneasy PowerSoil Pro Kit following the provider's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA samples were sent to the NGS Competence Center Tübingen (Tübingen, Germany) for quantification, library construction, and sequencing. DNA concentration was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fischer, Waltham, MA). The V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using primers F515 (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and R806 (5′-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3′)61 and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform with v2 chemistry.

To process 16S rRNA amplicon sequences, we used the dada2 v.1.21.0 package of R (v.4.2.0)62 following its standard operating procedure as available at https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/bigdata.html. Briefly, after inspecting the quality profiles of the raw sequences, we trimmed and filtered the paired-end reads using the following parameters: trimLeft: 23, 24; truncLen: 240, 200; maxEE: 2, 2; truncQ: 11. The filtered forward and reverse reads were dereplicated separately and used for inference of the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) with default parameters, after which they were merged in a per-sample basis. We next filtered the merged reads to retain only those with a length between 250 and 256 bp and carried out chimera removal.

We then performed the taxonomic assignment on the final set of ASVs using a curated dada2-formated database based on the genome taxonomy database (GTDB) release R06-RS20263. A maximum-likelihood tree of the ASVs was obtained using the R packages DECIPHER v.2.24.0 and phangorn v.2.8.164 after performing a multiple sequence alignment with each of the representative sequences. We used the PERFect v.1.10 package of R65 to identify spurious ASVs, defined as those that made insignificant contributions to the total covariance of the microbiome dataset.

For alpha- and beta-diversity analyses, samples were rarefied to 21300 reads/sample to account for differences in library size. To compare alpha-diversity between samples, we used the Shannon index as implemented in the vegan v.2.6-2 package of R. Global differences in Shannon index between treatments were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise contrasts between treatments were performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used the ASV-level abundance profile to obtain matrices of the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances with the GuniFrac v.1.6 package of R66. We assessed differences in beta-diversity estimates using the adonis function (analysis of variance using distance matrices) of the permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on the distance matrices with 9999 permutations, as implemented in the vegan v.2.6-2 package of R. For pairwise PERMANOVA tests, we used the pairwiseAdonis v.0.4 package of R (available at https://github.com/pmartinezarbizu/pairwiseAdonis). P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

E. coli Keio wt, Δmfd and complemented ∆mfd/mfd strains were grown onto LB agar O/N at 37 °C. Cultures in LB broth were started from a single colony at 37 °C at 200 rpm until an OD 600 nm at around 0.005. Each culture was then divided in two with one culture exposed to 100 µM NM102 and the other to 2% final DMSO as control. Bacteria were incubated until the culture reached OD 600 nm of 1.2, which corresponds to the early stationary phase. Bacteria were plated onto LB agar plates with 50 µg/mL rifampicin and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The number of colonies was counted and used to determine the mutation frequency. The total number of bacteria was determined following serial dilution and plating onto LB agar plate. The test was performed 12 times with independent cultures. Lea-Coulson comparisons of rate analysis were performed on Web Salvador to determine significance between conditions, using an efficiency parameter of ε = 0,5 (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ****p < 0,001).

A serial passage broth microdilution protocol was performed based on previously described methods18 to identify the effect of NM102 on the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Briefly, the culture of E. coli Keio WT started from a single colony and was diluted to OD 600 nm = 0.005. The bacterial suspension was subsequently transferred into a 96-well microplate (180 μL/well) and incubated with NM102, DMSO 2%, or left untreated. Treated and untreated bacteria were grown in LB with a gradient of concentrations of the indicated antibiotic to select for resistance for 18–24 h at 37 °C under stationary conditions. The OD 600 nm was measured and MICs were determined. Serial passage was performed using cells growing (defined by an OD 600 nm at a minimum of 50% of the untreated condition) in the highest concentration of antibiotic. Antimicrobial concentrations were adjusted during the process to compensate for the rise in MIC values. This process was repeated for four or five passages. Results were expressed as the median MIC of the three replicates.

Metrics details

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed and food legume crop, with seed size and weight being critical traits for domestication and breeding. However, genomic rearrangements like structural variations (SVs) underlying seed size and weight remain unclear. Here we present a comprehensive pangenome analysis utilizing eight high-quality genomes (two diploid wild, two tetraploid wild and four tetraploid cultivated peanuts) and resequencing data of 269 accessions with diverse seed sizes. We identified 22,222 core or soft-core, 22,232 distributed and 5,643 private gene families. The frequency of SVs in subgenome A is higher than in subgenome B. We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs and 190 SVs associated with seed size or weight. Notably, a 275-bp deletion in gene AhARF2-2 results in loss of interaction with AhIAA13 and TOPLESS, reducing the inhibitory effect on AhGRF5 and promoting seed expansion. This high-quality pangenome serves as a fundamental resource for the genetic enhancement of peanuts and other legume crops.

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important legume crop for vegetable oil and protein1. Cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid species that originated from hybridization of two wild diploid progenitors, Arachis duranensis (AA) and Arachis ipaensis (BB)2,3. Pod size is a critical quantitative agronomic trait that impacts peanut yield. During the domestication process, peanuts were selectively bred from wild accessions with small pods to modern varieties characterized by larger pods. Despite limited exploration of causal genes in peanuts4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, the molecular mechanisms regulating pod size remain largely unresolved. In addition, currently available genomes still contain numerous gaps and high-quality genomic resources for peanuts are lacking because of the complexities of assembling polyploid genomes2,12,13,14,15,16. To optimize the exploration of genomic variations, it is important to have access to high-quality genomic resources across various populations of peanuts.

Different individual genomes of a crop species can vary greatly17,18,19. A pangenome, which amalgamates genomics data from diverse individuals or populations, offers an holistic perspective for a more profound understanding of the genome structural and functional diversity of a species or population18,19,20,21. The pangenome of a crop can be much larger than its reference genome19. Developing a pangenome can identify missing or unannotated genes in the current reference genome, aiding in the discover of genes linked to yield, disease resistance and adaptability, and thus enhancing crop improvement.

In practice, the utilization of genetically diverse germplasm resources for varietal improvement is critical for enhancing peanut yield22. However, the use of germplasm resources to improve traits is still limited, and genomic variations affecting phenotypic diversity remain underexplored. Recently, resequencing of germplasm resources was imperative for the identification of genomic variations and fundamental to the acceleration of genomic research23,24. With the resequencing data of a large number of accessions, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be conducted to identify genomic variations associated with specific traits in natural populations. This approach has been extensively utilized in various gramineous and leguminous crops25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34. However, research of the mechanism and application after GWAS in peanuts remains limited23,24,35,36, especially for large-sized variations such as SVs.

In this study, we generated a comprehensive pangenome for both wild and cultivated peanuts, encompassing two diploid wild species, two tetraploid wild species and four tetraploid cultivated species. We assessed the genome-wide diversity of 269 peanut accessions, including wild species, landraces and improved species, and conducted SV-GWAS to investigate agronomic traits related to yield. Our analysis of the peanut pangenome showed significant genomic variations from breeding and highlighted trait-related variations affecting seed size and weight, providing a valuable resource for future improvements.

To explore genetic diversity and population structure in peanut, we collected ~8 TB of resequencing data from 269 accessions with various seed sizes. These accessions come mainly from four populations (32 diploid wild species, 8 tetraploid wild species, 155 tetraploid cultivated landrace, 67 tetraploid improved accessions and 7 unclassified accessions) that are geographically widespread (Fig. 1a). Two accessions were included from previous studies12,15, and 267 accessions were newly sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). After mapping reads and calling variants to the reference genome (Methods), we obtained 5,989,854 (AA: 5,048,032; BB: 941,822) high-quality SNPs (minor allele frequency >0.05 and a missing rate <0.5). The phylogenetic tree showed that peanut accessions have diverged from wild and cultivated accessions (Fig. 1b). During the domestication of cultivated accessions from wild accessions, seed size and weight were increased significantly (Fig. 1c). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SNPs in both subgenomes A and B showed clear separation of wild and cultivated accessions. A large genetic distance was found between the A subgenomes of AA wild diploids and AABB allotetraploids, whereas high genetic diversity existed in the B subgenome of landrace peanuts (Fig. 1d,e), perhaps due to the limited availability of BB diploid accessions.

a, Different species (A. hypogaea, their tetraploid A. monticola ancestors, and two wild diploid ancestors A. duranensis and A. ipaensis) and populations (AA/BB, AABB wild, AABB landrace and AABB improved) of peanut, including 269 peanut accessions with different seed sizes, are widely distributed geographically. b, Relationships of peanut accessions are illustrated using a phylogenetic tree based on subsampling 100,000 SNPs.

Source data

AA wild diploid accessions had higher genetic diversity (π; 8.57 × 10−4) than BB wild diploid accessions (5.69 × 10−5). However, the allotetraploid accessions had higher values of π in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome (AABB wild: 9.62 × 10−5 > 7.48 × 10−5; AABB landrace: 1.46 × 10−4 > 1.17 × 10−4; AABB improved: 1.26 × 10−4 > 1.06 × 10−4). Of the four populations, AABB landrace accessions had the highest value of π in the B subgenome, which was consistent with the conclusion from PCA (Fig. 1f,g). Population fixation statistics (FST) values between AA wild diploids and other allotetraploids were high (0.739–0.866), whereas FST values between BB wild diploids and other allotetraploids were low (0.153–0.201) (Fig. 1f,g). The findings indicate an asymmetrical domestication process between subgenomes A and B. ADMIXTURE population structure analysis revealed peanuts possess ancestry proportions that derived from a combination of AABB wild and landrace accessions, with an estimated cluster number K = 9 (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Fig. 1). All tetraploid wild accessions (Amon_N249, A7, US10 and so on) and several landrace accessions (SA080, DL183, SA117 and so on) were clustered into one group and shared more than 35% proportions with their ancestry BB accessions (H104, US38, US37, US36), suggesting that cultivated accessions likely originated from wild allotetraploid accessions.

We selected the genomes of eight representative peanut accessions that demonstrate a range of diverse pod sizes for the construction of a high-quality peanut pangenome: two previously published genomes and six newly published genomes, including one AA wild diploid, two AABB wild allotetraploids, one AABB landrace allotetraploid and two AABB improved allotetraploids (Fig. 2a,b). Cultivated peanuts (A. hypogaea (Ahy)) originated from tetraploid ancestors (Arachis monticola (Amon)) nearly 4,000 years ago, and these were derived from hybridization between two wild diploids (A. duranensis (Adu) and A. ipaensis (Aip)) approximately 11,000 years ago37 (Fig. 2c). The genomes of the six new sequenced accessions were assembled de novo based on the combination of Nanopore ultra-long, PacBio HiFi and Hi-C technologies, mainly using NextDenovo and HiC-Pro38,39 (Methods). These chromosome-level genome assemblies were more contiguous and complete than the previously published ones, with scaffold N50 values of 134–148 Mb, contig N50 values of 25–79 Mb, long terminal repeat (LTR) Assembly Index values of 21.27–29.37 and BUSCO values of 98.6–99.4% (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), which indicated the high quality of these genomes. Peanut genomes had a repeat sequence content of nearly 85%, with repeats mainly including retroelements (64–67%) and DNA transposons (10–12%) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 4). In total 39,736–77,824 protein-coding genes were annotated (Supplementary Table 5).

We constructed a pangenome of peanut using protein-coding genes. The pangenome was composed of 50,097 gene orthogroups (family): 17,137 core, 5,085 soft-core, 22,232 distributed and 5,643 private. Clustering of the gene family by presence–absence variations (PAVs) showed that the newly de novo assembled genomes had significantly more gene families (~37,000) than the two public genomes (~30,000; Wilcoxon rank sum test (WRST) P < 0.001) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3a). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for five tissues showed that 1,086 genes from 1,021 novel families had strong expression evidence in at least one tissue (transcript coverage ≥95% and fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped fragments (FPKM) ≥ 2; WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) indicating that a large proportion of the novel genes were real. Of the peanut pangenome, nearly 26,493–37,829 gene families were present in each peanut genome (Supplementary Table 5). The numbers of novel gene families and samples followed a power law distribution (R2 = 0.987, k = 10,150, a = 1.2) (Fig. 2e), indicating that the constructed peanut pangenome was closed. Of the 50,097 gene families, 34.2% were core, 10.2% were soft-core, 44.4% were distributed and 11.3% were private (Fig. 2f). All genes were located near the two telomeres of each chromosome, except for the private genes, which showed peaks on chr. 1 and chr. 7 (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Core and private genes in the A subgenome, regardless of the type of gene family, were longer than those in the B subgenome (WRST P < 0.001 (core) and P < 0.05 (private)) (Fig. 2g). The core and soft-core families had longer genes, transcripts, exons and coding sequences (CDSs) than the distributed and private families (WRST, gene, transcript, exon and CDS length, P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). The core and soft-core family genes in the B subgenome had higher Ka/Ks values than those in A subgenome (WRST, missense and synonymous rates, P < 0.001) (Fig. 2h). The genes of core and soft-core families had lower missense and synonymous rates than those of distributed and private families (WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5e–g) and higher expression levels in all tissues investigated (WRST P < 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 5h–l and Supplementary Table 6). The genes of core and soft-core families in both the A and B subgenomes were enriched in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and signaling pathways regulating the pluripotency of stem cells, whereas the genes of private gene families were enriched in mannose-type O-glycan biosynthesis. The genes of soft-core families in the A subgenome were uniquely enriched in aflatoxin biosynthesis and the Notch signaling pathway (Fig. 2i). Core genes found in cultivated peanuts but absent from wild peanuts were enriched in photosynthesis and lipid metabolism, indicating that they underwent convergent evolution during domestication (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).

We also investigated members from the distributed and private genes families of accession ZP06, which had the largest pod size (Methods). These genes were enriched in Pfam terms such as NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by Apaf-1, R proteins, and Ced-4) domain, Rx (Potato Virus X Resistance Protein) N-terminal domain, F-box domains and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase N-terminal domain (Fig. 2j). For example, most members of the distributed and private gene families with domain PF00931 (NB-ARC domain) were present in the A subgenome (Fig. 2k). However, a member of the gene family OG0025534 in the A subgenome of ZP06 (SL03G07910) was unique among the gene families of improved peanuts (Fig. 2l). We noted that gain of a core gene family OG0003529 in NDH108 and ZP06 occurred at chr. 3 of the A subgenome during hybridization and polyploidization, which mainly includes the plant growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) amino acid hydrolase ILR1-like 4 or 6 genes (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b).

A graph-based peanut pangenome was constructed utilizing a combination of assembly-based and read-based SV detection methods, exemplified by the NB-ARC gene that contains both SVs and small variants (Fig. 3a). Initially, we conducted a synteny analysis across multiple genomes, which revealed significant collinearity in the chromosomes of both the A and B subgenomes (Supplementary Fig. 8). From eight peanut genome assemblies, we identified a total of 86,308 high-confidence SVs, with insertions and deletions being the predominant types (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). We performed genotyping on tetraploid accessions using resequencing data, and validated ten SVs in genes by polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR; Supplementary Fig. 10a–k). Insertions were positively correlated with deletions, duplications, inversions and SNPs or insertion–deletions (indels) (Supplementary Fig. 11a). There were more SVs in subgenome A than in subgenome B, and these were not evenly distributed across each chromosome, mainly spreading in chr. 8 of A subgenome (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 11b,c). The size of SVs in the A and B subgenomes varied from 50 to 100,000 bp. The size of insertions was lower in the A subgenome than in the B subgenome, while the sizes of deletions and duplications were higher in A subgenome (Fig. 3d). Of the different SVs, 10–16% overlapped with genes and 15–30% overlapped with the upstream (promoter) or downstream 3,000 bp of genes (Supplementary Fig. 12a); 40–80% of SVs overlapped with repeat elements, particularly LTRs (Supplementary Fig. 12b). The sizes of insertions in promoter and exon regions were extremely variable and were in the three ranges, 50–500 bp, 500–5,000 bp and 5,000+ bp, while the sizes of deletions in promoter and exon regions were not similar (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 13a). Up to 40% of insertions and deletions in the promoter and exon regions were LTR and DNA transposons (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). Genes with insertions in exons were enriched in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and the PPRP (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) signaling pathway, while the promoter insertions were enriched in beta-alanine metabolism, and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation (Supplementary Fig. 14). SVs in promoter and exon rather than downstream regions could regulate gene expression (Fisher's exact test) (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 15a–f).

Our analysis particularly concentrated on accession ZP06 with the largest pod size. In this accession, we observed 2,130 insertions and 2,160 deletions in the A subgenome, and 1,401 insertions and 1,352 deletions in the B subgenome (Fig. 4a). In addition, fewer SVs were found to overlap with CDS, promoter regions and downstream regions in both subgenomes from Amon to ZP06 than from diploids to Amon (Amon to ZP06, 36–338; K30076 to ZP06, 40–650; Adu to ZP06, 269–6,185) (Supplementary Fig. 16a–d). There were more deletions in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome from Amon to ZP06 (SVs overlapping CDS, exon, promoter, gene, downstream: 55, 59, 140, 167 and 231 (A); 77, 86, 223, 186 and 338 (B)) (Supplementary Fig. 16c,d). These SV-related genes in the A subgenome were enriched in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, whereas those in the B subgenome were enriched in KEGG pathways such as stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis, and inositol phosphate metabolism (Fig. 4b). SVs had the potential to affect gene structure or gene expression directly, including some important genes related to yield and disease resistance. For example, NDH16G00520 (Snakin-2) expression was higher in the flowers and fruits of ZP06, in which there was a 214-bp DNA/DTM (DNA transposon, Mutator) insertion in the promoter, than in other accessions without the insertion (Fig. 4c). In the exon of NDH14G21970 (glutamine-dependent NAD(+) synthetase), the gene with a 7.9-kb deletion had strong evidence of supported whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of ZP06 (Fig. 4d). A 1.2-kb insertion of a DNA/DTA (DNA transposon, hAT) transposon in an exon of NDH05G28200 (glycosyl transferase) divided it into two genes (Fig. 4e). A 1.7-kb deletion in ZP06 (encompassing exons of NDH18G35100 and NDH18G35110) resulted in two truncated genes (Fig. 4f). These results indicate that SVs have varied effects on gene functions.

To better understand how genomic variations affect the function of genes during domestication, we further investigated SVs under selection between wild and landrace accessions. Genome-wide analysis of selective sweeps using FST, the nucleotide diversity ratio (πW/πL or πL/πI) and XP-CLR (the cross population composite likelihood ratio test) showed the unbalanced selection of chromosomes during the evolution of landrace accessions from wild accessions (AmToAhL) and improved accessions from landraces (AhLToAhI) (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Fig. 17a,b). Chr. 1 (14.6 Mb), chr. 9 (7.8 Mb), chr. 13 (5.3 Mb) and chr. 20 (5.7 Mb) had more selection during the evolution of landrace accessions from wild accessions, whereas chr. 3 (10.3 Mb), chr. 10 (14.5 Mb), chr. 16 (27.4 Mb) and chr. 19 (31.4 Mb) had more regions under selection during the development of improved accessions from landraces (Supplementary Fig. 17c). Regions more than twice the size (AhLToAhI: 29 Mb (A) and 67 Mb (B)) were under selection in the B subgenome than in the A subgenome during the development of improved accessions from landraces (Fig. 5c).

Different SVs from two populations were used for searches of SV-related genes. c, Genomic length, genes, SV-related genes and SV exon-related genes under selection in the A (sub-A) and B subgenomes (B-sub). d, Pfam enrichment analysis of genes and SV-associated genes with evidence of selection. e, Repeat overlap with SVs of selection in the A and B subgenomes.

We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs overlapping 329 genes (Supplementary Tables 7–9). Significantly, 108 SV-related genes in the A subgenome were subject to selection during the evolution of landraces from wild accessions, which were enriched in the salt stress response, antifungal and cullin family, whereas 114 genes in the B subgenome were enriched in bromodomain, leucine-rich repeat and sucrose synthase. During the evolution of improved accessions from landraces, 59 SV-related genes under selection in the A subgenome exhibited enrichment in the fasciclin domain and aminotransferase class-V, while 50 genes in the B subgenome were enriched in the legume lectin domain and pathogenesis-related protein bet v1 family (Fig. 5d). Some 41–55% of domestication-related SVs overlap with LTR or Gypsy elements and 35–55% domestication-related SVs overlapped with simple repeats. Of domestication-related SVs from the A and B subgenomes, the percentage of SVs with simple repeats (35% ≪ 52.8–54.7%), Helitron (8% ≪ 15–20%) and low complexity (3% ≪ 7–8%) in the B subgenome were the lowest during the evolution of improved accessions from landrace accessions (Fig. 5e).

Among the genes with domestication-related SVs, 19 were associated with traits such as fruit size or known disease resistance (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9). For example, a higher proportion of diploids and wild allotetraploids had a 629-bp deletion in CRK26 (a calcium-dependent protein kinase gene), which is found in a cluster of up to 19 CRK genes on chr. 9: 114.3–114.9 Mb (Fig. 6a). A 27.7-kb deletion in IRK (a leucine-rich repeat gene) was difficult to detect because of alignment deviation near tandem gene duplications, but assemblies can accurately report its position and predict its length (Fig. 6b). A tandem unit consisting of the pod size gene NTF6 (mitogen-activated protein kinase, brassinosteroid signaling and homeostasis and regulation of grain size and plant height) and the disease-resistance gene FBRL2 (negative transcriptional regulator of immune responsive genes, including PR1), had high copy number variants (Fig. 6c, left), which was unique in peanut and did not exist in rice, soybean and cotton genomes. In addition, higher expression levels of both NTF6 and FBRL2 were observed in accessions with larger pod sizes (Fig. 6c, middle), whereas lower expression levels of both were observed in roots after bacterial wilt infection (Fig. 6c, right), indicating strong consistency in the expression of these two genes. These results indicate that the pangenome provides a valuable resource for gene exploration and expansion associated with fruit size and disease resistance during peanut domestication.

Cytokinins play crucial roles in plant development by regulating cell division. The mechanisms of cytokinin metabolism and signal transduction are well understood40,41. Zeatin and isopentenyladenine-type are considered the predominant active forms of cytokinins42,43, and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) catalyzes the irreversible degradation of cytokinins44,45. In this study, we identified 117 SVs or indels associated with seed weight (P < 0.001), and one significant SV for seed weight was identified on chr. 3 by SV-GWAS (P = 1.84 × 10−4) (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 10). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block analyses revealed a block (chr. 3: 9.71–9.73 Mb) next to the significantly associated SV in NDH03G08990 (Fig. 7b). Gene annotation showed that NDH03G08990 (AhCKX6) encodes a CKX containing an FAD-binding domain and a CK-binding domain (Fig. 7c). This gene might be involved in regulating cell division, thereby affecting yield, as previously reported in wheat46 and chickpea47. Gene structure analysis revealed that AhCKX6 has two insertions (TTACAAATATTATTTATTACTGT and CAAATTTGTC) in the 3′-UTR of accessions with larger seeds (Fig. 7d). Genotype-based association analysis revealed that the 3′-UTR insertions were absent in all 61 wild species. By contrast, three-quarters of the landrace and improved varieties exhibited insertions in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 7e). Furthermore, association analysis revealed that these insertions were significantly correlated with seed length and 100-seed weight (Fig. 7f and Supplementary Table 11).

CKX evolution was traced back only to the first primitive land plant, Physcomitrium patens48. The ancestral CKX gene evolved in the kingdom Plantae along with the diversification into monocot and eudicot plant species >150 million years ago (Ma)49. Following a whole-genome duplication event approximately 58 Ma, CKX genes appeared in legumes. They then emerged in the Arachis genus around 2.2 Ma (ref. 37). A phylogenetic association study revealed that AhCKX genes exhibit a high degree of similarity to soybean CKX genes (Fig. 7g and Supplementary Table 12). The expression levels of AhCKX6 were observed to be higher in the roots, leaves and seeds of HapI compared with HapII (Fig. 7h). In addition, AhCKX6 expression levels were elevated in small-seed accessions relative to large-seed accessions at various stages of seed development (Fig. 7i). Conversely, large-seed accessions exhibited higher cytokinin content levels (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Table 13). In summary, the insertion in the 3′-UTR of the CKX6 gene results in reduced expression levels. This increase in cytokinin promotes early cell division, ultimately leading to the development of larger seeds (Fig. 7k).

Seed size is a critical agronomic trait that is closely associated with grain yield. Here, we identified 73 SVs associated with seed size (P < 0.001) and a gene (NDH08G29450) exhibiting an exon SV was found encode auxin response factor 2 (ARF2). This was the most significant SV associated with seed length in SV-GWAS (P = 3.63 × 10−6) (Fig. 8a, Supplementary Fig. 18 and Supplementary Table 14), which acts as a negative regulator of seed size and weight in Arabidopsis50. In the ZP06 variety, the AhARF2-2 gene contains a 275-bp deletion and a 7-bp insertion in the 12th exon, as well as premature stop codons in the 13th exon (HapII) (Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 19), resulting in loss of the conserved Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid domain (AUX/IAA, PF02309) (Fig. 8c and Supplementary Fig. 20a). This loss is significantly correlated with variations in seed length and 100-seed weight (Fig. 8d and Supplementary Table 15). Molecular markers have been developed based on this SV to differentiate between the HapI and HapII haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 20b). The AhARF2-2 gene was highly expressed in the seed and its expression was substantially higher in HapII accessions than in HapI accessions (Fig. 8e). Furthermore, after exogenous application of 1-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at the seedling stage, HapI accessions showed a significant upregulated response compared with HapII accessions (Fig. 8f). Further analysis indicated that the mutation did not alter the subcellular localization of its corresponding protein (Supplementary Fig. 20c).

Col n = 22, HapI-3 n = 9, HapII-3 n = 19. q, Model of AhARF2-2 determining peanut seed size: AhIAA13 binds AhARF2-2 via the AUX/IAA domain. Auxin releases AhARF2-2, which recruits TPL to suppress AhGRF5. Data are given as mean ± s.e.m. n = 3 biologically independent samples (e, f, k and m). P values were calculated by two-tailed Student's t-test (d, e, f, k, m, n, o and p).

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays confirmed that the AhARF2 protein from HapI accessions can interact with AhIAA13 and inhibit AhTPL, whereas the protein from HapII accessions has lost this interaction capability (Fig. 8g–i). In peanut, transient overexpression of the AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII genes resulted in a significant decrease in AhGRF5 expression, with HapI causing more pronounced downregulation than HapII (Supplementary Fig. 21). These findings suggest that AhARF2-2 may negatively regulate AhGRF5 expression in peanuts. Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays and firefly luciferase (LUC) complementation assays demonstrated that both the HapI and HapII AhARF2-2 proteins can bind to the promoter of the growth-regulating factor 5 (AhGRF5) gene (Fig. 8j). Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR) analysis revealed that AhGRF5 exhibited the highest expression levels in seeds, with significantly higher expression in HapII accessions than in HapI accessions (Supplementary Fig. 22). Moreover, AhARF2-2 could inhibit AhGRF5 expression, with HapI exhibiting a stronger inhibitory effect than HapII (Fig. 8k). TOPLESS (TPL) acts as an inhibitory factor in multiple biological processes51. AhARF2 has the capability to recruit TPL, thereby further suppressing the expression of AhGRF5; thus, HapI exhibits stronger inhibitory capability than HapII (Supplementary Fig. 23). Results from transgenic Arabidopsis showed that the seed area and seed length of HapII lines were significantly larger than Hap I transgenic lines (Fig. 8l–p and Supplementary Fig. 24a–e). In summary, we propose that AhARF2-2 interacts with AhIAA13 via the C-terminal AUX/IAA domain. In the presence of auxin, AhARF2-2 is released and subsequently recruits TPL to suppress the expression of downstream AhGRF5. However, in large-seed accessions with SV deletion, AhARF2-2 is unable to interact with AhIAA13 and TPL, which leads to the reduction of the suppression of AhGRF5, thereby promoting seed expansion (Fig. 8q).

Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), recognized as one of the most important oilseed and food legume crops, exhibits the unique characteristic of ripening its seeds underground. Throughout the processes of domestication and cultivation, there has been a progressive increase in the size and weight of peanut pods and seeds1,12,49. However, our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary factors influencing peanut pod size and weight remains limited. In this study, we developed comprehensive peanut pangenomes by integrating data from eight high-quality peanut genomes and 269 resequenced accessions. This resulted in an extensive resource of genomic variations that contribute to key agronomic traits in peanuts. The newly constructed pangenomes and identified variations enhance our understanding of the genetic basis underlying traits such as seed size and weight, and will facilitate advancements in crop science and peanut breeding, thereby potentially improving global food security.

Along with SNPs and epigenetic differences, SVs are newly emerging as important variation features contributing to the genetic and phenotypic diversity observed in and between species. Understanding the impact of SVs on plant phenotypic variation is crucial for breeders aiming to develop superior cultivars51. SV identification has long been challenging in terms of both a lack of accuracy and comprehensiveness when using short-read resequencing data. Nevertheless, the important role of SVs has been highlighted in recent crop studies51,52. Our analysis revealed that combining assembly-based and read-based methods using long-read sequencing data improves the identification of SVs in plant genomes, especially large SVs. Notably, a significant observation is that most insertion SVs are associated with LTR retrotransposons and DNA transposons. We identified 1,335 domestication-related SVs and 190 SVs associated with seed size or weight. Our study revealed that SVs could influence gene expression, functional dynamics and uneven domestication between the two subgenomes, ultimately affecting seed size and weight.

Throughout the extensive process of domestication and evolution, differential selection pressures have been exerted on subgenomes A and B, resulting in distinct functional specializations, similar to those observed in cotton (Gossypium spp.)53 and rapeseed (Brassica napus)54. During the transition from landraces to improved cultivars, chr. 3, 16 and 19 experienced intense artificial selection. The genes in the B subgenome were enriched in legume lectin domain and pathogenesis-related protein, such as a tandem unit of two peanut-specific genes associated with pod size and disease resistance separately (Fig. 6c). In crop breeding, enhancing both disease resistance and yield presents major challenges, with trade-offs between these traits being a common phenomenon in crop production55. Our research suggested that resistance was compromised as yields increased during peanut domestication. SV-GWAS identified two significant regions potentially related to seed size and weight. Subsequent experiments confirmed that SVs in these genes influenced seed size and weight. Notably, an SV in the 3′-UTR of the AhCKX6 gene on chr. 3 was associated with seed weight. Another significant candidate gene, AhARF2-2, encodes an auxin response factor and negatively regulates seed size. However, our research still has the limitation on the sample size of tetraploid wild peanuts in population selection, owing to the specificity of Arachis monticola acting as an intermediate between cultured and wild peanut.

In summary, we have developed an extensive dataset comprising high-quality reference genomes, pangenomes and significant genomic variations, such as SVs, elucidating the influence of SVs on critical traits, including seed size and weight in peanuts. This study furnishes a genetic resource for the identification of functional genes associated with yield and disease resistance, offering valuable tools for breeding and crop enhancement for peanut as well as other polyploid species.

All 269 analyzed accessions (two accessions, Tifrunner and Shitouqi, were previously published and others were newly sequenced) were collected from major peanut-growing regions, including India, the United States and China. These accessions, which are currently one of the most complete and representative collections worldwide, were used to analyze the major haplotype of the candidate gene related to the seed traits. Plant DNA was extracted using the Plant DNA Extraction Kit (catalogue number SM262; Seven). Peanut seedlings were grown in pots in a growth chamber set to 28 °C, with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod and ~60% relative humidity. Experiments were conducted when the seedlings reached the four-leaf stage. All Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and transgenic plants were from the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype background. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants were grown in pots in a growth chamber at 23 °C with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod and ~60% relative humidity.

In this study, previously collected WGS and phenotypic data from 269 peanut accessions with various seed sizes were reanalyzed using an updated high-quality reference genome NDH108. Raw sequencing data was preprocessed using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56. Trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome (Near T2T genome: NDH108) using BWA (v.0.7.17)57. Moreover, for wild diploid accessions, homologous chromosomes of subgenomes were retained as the reference genomes (NDH108-A or NDH108-B subgenome). SNPs and indels were called using bcftools (v.1.10.2)58 (parameter: bcftools mpileup --min-ireads 1 -Ou -f $ref ${sample}.bam | bcftools call --ploidy 1 -mv -Oz). The SNPs and indels were then filtered using bcftools (parameter: bcftools filter -g3 -G10 -e ‘QUAL<30 || DP<5 || MQ<20'). Variants from all accessions were merged into one file using bcftools (parameter: merge -0). To conduct the analysis for both diploid and tetraploid peanut genomes, SNPs with the A or B subgenome were filtered with a minor allele frequency of >0.05 and a missing rate of <0.5 using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --max-missing 0.5 --maf 0.05), respectively. These SNPs and indels were annotated using SnpEff (v.5.1)60.

SNPs in variant call format (VCF) were converted to PHYLIP format using Vcf2phylip (v.2.8)61 for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic relationship was inferred using the neighbor-joining method with PHYLIP (v.3.697)62. PCA was performed using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63 (parameter: --pca). To estimate the genetic similarity in and among populations, we calculated genetic diversity (π or pi) in four population using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --window-pi 100000 --window-pi-step 20000), as well as the population fixation statistics FST using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --fst-window-size 100000 --fst-window-step 20000). LD pruning was performed using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63 (parameter: --indep-pairwise 50 10 0.2). Population structure was estimated using ADMIXTURE (v.1.3.0)64, which identified different numbers of clusters (K) according to cross-validation error. Considering both agronomic traits and genetic variability, we newly selected several representative accessions with smaller to larger pods for high-quality genome assembly. These include an accession of Ad (Arachis duranensis; Adu), two accessions of Am (Arachis monticola; Amon and H16-5) and three accessions of Ahy (Arachis hypogaea; mH8, NDH108 and ZP06).

Raw Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads with a mean quality score >7 were retained at the pre-processing step. De novo genome assembly was performed with ONT Ultra-long reads or PacBio HiFi reads using NextDenovo (v.2.4.0)38. To improve the accuracy of the assembly, the contigs were refined with Racon (v.1.3.1)65 using long reads and Nextpolish (v.1.3.1)66 using Illumina short reads with default parameters.

Quality controlling of Hi-C raw data was performed using HiC-Pro (v.2.8.1)39 as former research. First, low-quality sequences (quality scores <20), adapter sequences and sequences shorter than 30 bp were filtered out using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56, and the clean paired-end reads were then mapped to the draft assembled sequence using Bowtie 2 (v.2.3.2)67 (parameter: -end-to-end --very-sensitive -L 30) to get the unique mapped paired-end reads. Valid interaction paired reads were identified and retained by HiC-Pro from unique mapped paired-end reads for further analysis. Invalid read pairs, including dangling-end, self-cycle, re-ligation and dumped products were filtered by HiC-Pro. The scaffolds were further clustered, ordered and oriented scaffolds onto chromosomes by LACHESIS68 (parameters: CLUSTER_MIN_RE_SITES=100, CLUSTER_MAX_LINK_DENSITY=2.5, CLUSTER NONINFORMATIVE RATIO=1.4, ORDER MIN N RES IN TRUNK=60, ORDER MIN N RES IN SHREDS=60).

Transpose elements (TEs) were annotated using EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 () pipeline (parameter: --sensitive 1 --anno 1), which incorporates several well-performed structure-based and homology-based programs, including LTRharvest (v.1.5.10)70 (in GenomeTools), LTR_FINDER (v.1.07)71, LTR_retriever (v.2.9.0)72, Generic Repeat Finder (v.1.0)73, TIR-learner (v.2.5)74, HelitronScanner (v.1.0)75, TEsorter (v.1.3.0)76, RepeatModeler (v.2.0.2)77 and RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78. The interspersed repeats and tandem repeats of genomes were annotated using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78 with a TE library generated from EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 and TRF (v.4.09)79.

Three independent approaches, ab initio prediction, homology search and reference guided transcriptome assembly, were used for gene prediction in a repeat-masked genome. In detail, GeMoMa (v.1.6.1)80 was used to align the homologous peptides from related species to the assembly and then obtain the gene structure information, which was homolog prediction. For transcript-based gene prediction, filtered RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome using STAR (v.2.7.3a)81. The transcripts were then assembled using Stringtie (v.1.3.5)82 d and ORFs were predicted using PASA (v.2.3.3)83. For the de novo prediction, RNA-seq reads were de novo assembled using Stringtie and analyzed with PASA to produce a training set. Augustus (v.3.3.1)84 with default parameters was then utilized for ab initio gene prediction with the training set. Finally, EVidenceModeler (v.1.1.1)85 was used to produce an integrated gene set from which genes with TE were removed using the TransposonPSI package (http://transposonpsi.sourceforge.net/)86 and the miscoded genes were further filtered. UTRs and alternative splicing regions were determined using PASA (v.2.3.3)83 based on RNA-seq assemblies.

Proteins of each accession were assessed using BUSCO (v.5.3.2)87 with database embryophyta_odb10 v2020-09-10. Domains of proteins were annotated using InterProScan (v.5.55-88.0)88. The Gene Ontology of proteins was predicted using PANNZER2 (v.15.12.2020)89. Enrichment analysis was preformed using ClusterProfiler (v.3.16.1)90.

The longest protein sequences of each gene were selected as representatives. Short proteins with <50 amino acids were ignored. The orthogroups (or gene families) were found using Orthofinder (v.2.5.4)91 with the parameter ‘-S blast'. For each accession, orthogroups with at least one member gene were defined as being present. The orthogroups PAVs matrix was used for downstream analysis. The power model92 was chosen to fit the new gene family count (n) and sample count (N) as reported previously. Every new gene family count was the median of values from 100 iterations of random sampling without replacement. The curve was fitted using the ‘nls' function in R v.4.0.2. Pseudo-R2 was computed using the R package aomisc v.0.648. The orthogroups in all (eight of eight) accessions were considered as core families. Orthogroups present in more than 90% of samples but not all (seven of eight) accessions were considered as soft-core families, the same threshold used for ‘soft-core' in previous studies18,93. Orthogroups present in between two and six of eight accessions were considered as distributed families. The orthogroups present in only one (of eight) accession were considered as private families. Single-copy gene orthogroups with fewer than one member per accession were aligned in parallel using ParaAT (v.2.0)94. The gene pairs were aligned using MUSCLE (v.5.1)95 and nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates were calculated using KaKs_Calculator (v.3.0)96 with the model averaging method97.

Synteny and collinearity analyses were performed at both the genome and gene levels. We used D-Geneies (v.1.4)98 with whole genomes' alignment from Minimap2 (v.2.22)99 and MCscan (in JCVI) v.1.2.7 (ref. 100) with the CDS of longest protein sequences of each gene alignment from Last (v.1418)101.

SVs of each accession were called using assembly-based and read-based SV detection methods, generating three graph-based pangenome sets. (1) Assembly-based SVs, graph pangenome construction from variants (SVAss): SVs of each accession were detected with assembly-based methods Svim-asm (v.1.0.2)102 (parameter: haploid) and CuteSV (v.1.0.13)103 (parameter: -s 1 --genotype --report_readid -p -1 -mi 500 -md 500 –max_cluster_bias_INS 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.9 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.5). Insertions (INS) and deletions (DEL) from the intersection of two tools were compared and selected using Truvari (v.3.4.0)104 (parameter: bench). Duplications (DUP), inversions (INV) and breakends (BND) were selected from the results of CuteSV (v.1.0.13)103. SVs with supporting sequence names (RNAMES in the INFO column) from the same chromosomes or unplaced contigs were retained. Moreover, for two wild diploid accessions (Adu and K30076), the SVs from homologous chromosomes (Adu, A subgenome; K30076, B subgenome) or unplaced contigs were retained. The nonredundant SVs set was merged using SURVIVOR (v.1.0.7)105 (parameter: merge 1000 1 1 -1 -1 50). We constructed graph-based pangenome from variants and reference sequences using vg v.1.53.0. (2) Assembly-based SVs and small variants, graph pangenome construction from assemblies (FASTA) (Minigraph-Cactus): base-level pangenome graphs were constructed of each chromosome using Minigraph-Cactus (v.2.7)106. The DNA sequences (nodes) in the sequence graph (GFA) of each chromosome were renamed (chromosome prefixes + raw node identification) and merged into a graph of all chromosomes. (3) Assembly-based + read-based SVs, graph pangenome construction from variants (SV Assembly and Read): we added a read-based SV detection method to avoid heterozygous and unassembled-region SVs omitted in the single haplotype of genome assembly. SVs of each accession were detected using the read-based method CuteSV (v.2.0.3)103 from ONT reads and PacBio HiFi reads (parameter: --max_cluster_bias_INS 100 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.3 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 100 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.3 (ONT); --max_cluster_bias_INS 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_INS 0.9 --max_cluster_bias_DEL 1000 --diff_ratio_merging_DEL 0.5 (PacBio HiFi)). The SVs with the ‘PRECISE' and ‘PASS' tags were filtered. Next, these SVs were divided into two subsets according to the regions of assembly alignment: SVs in assembly-covered regions and SVs in assembly-uncovered regions. For subset 1, heterozygous insertions and deletions were compared and merged with assembly-based SVs using Truvari (v.3.4.0)104 (parameter: bench). For subset 2, insertions and deletions were added with assembly-based SVs. The final SVs dataset included both assembly-based SVs and read-based SVs. We constructed graph-based pangenome from variants and reference sequences using vg (v.1.53.0)107.

SVs were annotated with gene regions (gene, exon, CDS and gene upstream and downstream 3,000 bp) and repeat regions (TE, low complexity and simple repeat) using Vcfanno (v.0.3.3)108. The alternative allele sequences of insertions were extracted and annotated for repeats using RepeatMasker (v.4.1.1)78 with a TE library generated from EDTA (v.2.0.0)69 and TRF (v.4.09)79.

Five tissues (flower, fruit, stem, leaf and root) of accessions Adu, Amon, H16-5, mH8, NDH108 and ZP06 were selected for RNA-seq experiments. The raw paired-end reads were filtered and trimmed using FASTP (v.0.23.2)56. The trimmed reads were mapped to the reference genome (NDH108) using HISAT2 (v.2.1.0)109 (parameter: --dta) and sorted using Samtools (v.1.10)110. The coverage of each transcript of genes was calculated using Bedtools (v.2.29.2)111 (parameter: genomecov -bga -split -ibam). The expression of each transcript of genes and each gene was calculated using Stringtie (v.1.3.5)82. The FPKM was used to estimate the gene expressions.

We used three metrics to identify selective region of domestication sweeps, including genetic diversity ratio, FST and XP-CLR112. We compared the genetic diversity ratio (πAA/πAABBw, πBB/πAABBw, πAABBw/πAABBc) in four groups in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --window-pi 100000 --window-pi-step 20000). Windows with the top 5% of values were identified as candidate domestication-sweep regions. To identify additional domestication effects, we calculated the population fixation statistics (FST) in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb using VCFtools (v.0.1.16)59 (parameter: --fst-window-size 100000 --fst-window-step 20000). Windows with the top 5% FST value were regarded as highly differentiated regions. We also calculated XP-CLR112 to scan for domestication-sweep regions in 100-kb windows sliding 20 kb and identified windows with the top 5% XP-CLR values (parameter: --ld 0.95 --size 100000 --step 20000). Windows filtered with at least two metrics were considered as domestication-sweep regions.

NDH108 was cultivated using the hydroponic method (14 h light and 10 h dark photoperiod). When peanut roots reached 5–6 cm, seedlings were inoculated with Ralstonia solanacearum (strain number 180731-1) provided by the Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China. We performed RNA-seq of roots in NDH108 with bacterial wilt infection, at three time points (0, 12 and 24 h) of three independent experiments in replicates. The analysis process of raw reads was the same as described in the section ‘Gene expression analysis'.

For genotyping of resequencing accessions, we used an ensemble genotyper EVG (v.1.2.0)113 combining GraphTyper2 (v.2.7.7)114, GraphAligner (v.1.0.13)115, vg (v.1.53.0)107 and Pangenie (v.3.0.1)116 with the graph pangenome constructed from both genome assemblies and long reads to genotype variations of SVs and indels (≥10 bp) from short-read sequencing data in tetraploid accessions. For SV-GWAS, two phenotypes (seed weight and seed length) were surveyed and the insertions and deletions from the graph pangenome were selected. Genotype files were prepared using PLINK (v.1.90b6.24)63. GWAS was performed using EMMAX (v.beta-07Mar2010)117.

Plots were generated using R (v.4.0.2) with the R packages ggplot2 (v.3.3.6), ggmap (v.4.0.0) (Plotting spatial data), GOplot (v.1.0.2), ggbreak (v.0.1.1) (axis breaks plots), gghalves (v.0.1.4) (half plots), qqman (v.0.1.8) (GWAS Manhattan plots), ggpubr (v.0.4.0) (significant level in box plots) Pheatmap (v.1.0.12) (heatmap; https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pheatmap), iTOL (v.6.6)118 (phylogenetic tree), Bandage (v.0.8.1)119 (graph pangenome visualization) and Rcirco (v.1.2.2)120 (genomic circos plots). Plots of the genome browser including tracks of gene annotations, repeat annotations, SVs and alignments were generated using Samplot (v.1.3.0)121, JBrowse2 (v.2.3.2)122 and IGV (v.2.5.3)123. The LD heatmap was generated using LDBlockShow (v.1.40)124.

The amino acid sequences were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 5.2 (ref. 125) (maximum-likelihood method), FastTree (v.2.1.11)126 (approximately maximum-likelihood method) and modified by iTOL (v.6.6)118. The multiple sequence alignment was performed using MUSCLE (v.5.1)95. The protein structure was predicted using AlphaFold (v.2.3)127 and displayed using PyMol (v.2.3.4) (http://www.pymol.org).

The CDSs of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII (NDH08G29450) were cloned into a pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector using the Hieff Clone Universal One Step Cloning Kit (catalogue number 10911ES20, Yeasen). The recombinant plasmids pCAMBIA1300-HapI/HapII-GFP (35S:HapI/HapII-GFP), marker vector and empty control vector were then transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 (AC1001, WEIDI). Agrobacterium mediated transient expression assays in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and peanut according to our previous work11. Fluorescence images of transiently infected tobacco leaf subepidermal cells were captured utilizing laser scanning confocal microscopy (catalogue number LSM710, Carl Zeiss).

Two-week-old seedlings (mH8 and ZP06), cultivated on plates, were subjected to treatment through spraying with 1 μM NAA. Samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 12 h following the treatment with NAA. Total RNA was extracted using FastPure Universal Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (catalogue number RC411, Vazyme) and TransScript One-Step gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit (catalogue number AT311-02, TransGen Biotech). Gene expression levels were assayed using the PerfectStart Green qPCR SuperMix Kit (catalogue number AQ601, TransGen Biotech) in conjunction with the Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR system. The 2−∆∆CT method was used to calculate the relative expression levels of each gene128. Ahactin7 (XM_025826875) and Atactin2 (U37281.2) were used as the internal control genes. Primers were designed using Primer 3 (v.4.1.0)129. Cytokinin measurements were performed by Wuhan Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd, utilizing seeds from the Amon and ZP06 varieties, approximately 15 days following the peg's penetration into the soil.

The AhGRF5 (Arahy.V829EQ) promoter was integrated into the pAbAi vector. The recombinant plasmid pAbAi-AhGRF5 was digested with the restriction enzyme BstBI (catalogue number R0519V, New England Biolabs) and transferred into the Y1H yeast strain and tested on SD/-Ura medium (catalogue number PM2271, Coolaber) with different concentrations of aureobasidin A. The CDS of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into the pGADT7 and transferred into the Y1H yeast strain, containing pAbAi–AhGRF5 plasmid, tested on SD/-Leu medium (catalogue number PM2201, Coolaber) with 200 ng ml−1 of aureobasidin A.

The CDSs of AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into the N-terminal half of yellow fluorescent protein (nYFP). The CDSs of AhIAA13 and AhTPL were cloned into the C-terminal half of YFP (cYFP) to generate HapI-nYFP, AhIAA13-cYFP, HapII-nYFP and AhTPL-cYFP vectors. The appropriate pairs of constructs (AhTPL-cYFP and HapI-nYFP; AhTPL-cYFP and HapII-nYFP; AhIAA13-cYFP and HapI-nYFP; AhIAA13-cYFP and HapII-nYFP) were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves via Agrobacterium-mediated transient infiltration and detected by laser scanning confocal microscopy (catalogue number LSM710, Carl Zeiss).

AhIAA13 (Arahy. MDB4JZ) and AhTPL (Arahy.UFRA39) CDSs were cloned into pGBKT7 vector (bait vector). These recombinant vectors were transformed into the Y2H yeast strain. The bait vectors pGBKT7-53 (BD-T7-53) and pGBKT7-Lam (BD-T7-Lam), serving as positive and negative controls respectively, were cotransformed with the prey vector pGADT7-T. Yeast cells and control cells, carrying recombinant plasmids, were grown on deficient medium: lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD/-Trp/-Leu; catalogue number PM2221, Coolaber) and leucine, tryptophan histidine and adenine (SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade; catalogue number PM2221, Coolaber), respectively.

The CDSs of AhTPL, AhARF2-2HapI and AhARF2-2HapII were cloned into pCAMBIA1300-GFP vector to construct the pCAMBIA1300-TPL-GFP (35S:TPL), 35S:HapI and 35S:HapII as effector plasmids. The AhGRF5 promoter (850 bp) was inserted into pGreenII 0800-LUC to construct the GRF5pro:LUC reporter plasmid. These vectors were individually transformed into GV3101 (harboring the pSoup plasmid). The pairs of constructs (35S:GFP and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapI and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapII and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapI, 35S:TPL and GRF5pro:LUC; 35S:HapII, 35S:TPL and GRF5pro:LUC) were infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves using the method reported previously130. LUC activity was detected using a low-light cooled CCD imaging apparatus (Tanon 5200). LUC or Renilla luciferase was assayed using the Double-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (catalogue number FR201, TransGen Biotech) with dual LUC assay reagents (Promega). Primers used for the LUC assay are listed in Supplementary Table 16.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 containing the recombinant vectors 35S:HapI-GFP or 35S:HapII-GFP was used to transform Arabidopsis (Col-0) using the floral dipping method131 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were selected on MS medium supplemented with 30 mg l−1 hygromycin and their identity was confirmed through PCR. Subsequently, the T3 generation of transgenic plants was utilized for phenotypic analysis of the candidate gene. Seed sizes were photographed with an anatomical microscope and were tested using the Ween SC-G automated test analysis system (WSeen). Primers used for gene cloning are listed in Supplementary Table 16.

The statistical analyses were mostly performed in R (v.4.0.2). For biochemical and molecular biology analysis, at least three individuals were mixed in each sample with three biological replicates. Standard deviations and P values were calculated using two-tailed Student's t-test and analysis of variance.

Metrics details

Generative AI is changing biotechnology research, and accelerating drug discovery, protein design and synthetic biology. It also enhances biomedical imaging, personalized medicine and laboratory automation, which enables faster and more efficient scientific advancements. However, these breakthroughs have also raised biosecurity concerns, which has prompted policy and community discussions1,2,3,4.

The power of generative AI lies in its ability to generalize from known data to the unknown. Deep generative models can predict novel biological molecules that might not resemble existing genome sequences or proteins. This capability introduces dual-use risks and serious biosecurity threats — such models could potentially bypass the established safety screening mechanisms used by nucleic acid synthesis providers5, which presently rely on database matching to identify sequences of concerns6. AI-driven tools could be misused to engineer pathogens, toxins or destabilizing biomolecules, and AI science agents could amplify risks by automating experimental designs7.

Metrics details

The European Union is committed to achieving ambitious area-based conservation and restoration targets in the upcoming decade. However, there is concern that these targets risk conflicting with socioeconomic needs, particularly for food, timber and bioenergy production. Here we develop an integrated spatial planning approach to identify where restoration, conservation and production allocation could maximize benefits to species conservation and climate mitigation, while acknowledging future land demands of the bio-economy. We show that, while changing production demands risk driving further biodiversity loss by 2030, when these demands are met alongside strategic restoration measures, as outlined by the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, future landscapes could improve the conservation status of populations for more than 20% of species of conservation concern while also increasing terrestrial carbon stocks. Our analysis demonstrates how critical the Nature Restoration Regulation is to achieving biodiversity targets and how integrated planning can align biodiversity policy objectives with future socioeconomic demands.

Metrics details

Achieving global biodiversity goals requires assessing, attributing and reversing the ongoing, unprecedented biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems, and relies on adequate data to inform policy and action. Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has become established as a novel and powerful approach to assess the state and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and although increasingly implemented by stakeholders its potential is not yet fully tapped. In this Perspective, we review the current state of aquatic eDNA research, focusing in particular on the policy relevance of eDNA and its utility in contributing towards the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. We summarize key technological developments in eDNA science to measure organismal diversity, its potential for spatial and temporal upscaling to become a key reference for local to global biodiversity action, and the next steps needed to effectively implement eDNA for decision-making and reaching biodiversity targets. Using eDNA to support biodiversity assessment will particularly benefit the understanding of understudied ecosystems and allow the direct calculation of ecological indices and implementation of FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) and inclusive data curation. Important next steps for eDNA require proper method standardization and commonly agreed quality standards, populating reference databases, and overcoming methodological constraints in retrofitting novel eDNA-based approaches to existing biodiversity monitoring approaches.

Aquatic biodiversity is declining from local to global scales, yet in most regions, no or only minimal data on state and change of biodiversity are available.

Representative, scalable and replicable monitoring of aquatic biodiversity is needed to achieve the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework targets.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a key technology to achieve a global measurement network of state and trends in biodiversity, and many of its technical aspects are ready to be implemented.

eDNA analysis allows whole-community assessments, broad taxonomic coverage, high spatiotemporal resolution and calculation of environmental indices.

Particularly for undersampled regions, large rivers, lakes and marine systems, eDNA metabarcoding might be an effective technology to rapidly gain biodiversity data.

To make eDNA-based monitoring policy frameworks successful and trusted, inclusive development and uptake of international method standards are needed.

The unprecedented decline of global biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems1,2,3, including the loss of functional and genetic diversity, is exceeding the planetary boundary of biosphere integrity4 and threatening many ecosystem functions and services. Consequently, biodiversity loss has been identified as an urgent global challenge5, and increasing political consensus exists that rapid measures to halt and reverse biodiversity loss are needed. The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), adopted by the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022 (ref. 6), sets out four overarching goals for 2050: (1) halt human-induced species extinction, (2) achieve sustainable use of biodiversity, (3) implement equitable sharing of benefits from biodiversity and (4) mobilize resources to close the biodiversity finance gap. The GBF also contains 23 targets to be reached by 2030, including conserving at least 30% of the world's land and sea areas, restoring degraded ecosystems, reducing pollution, ensuring sustainable use of biodiversity and performing adequate monitoring of biodiversity globally6,7.

Freshwater and coastal marine systems are among the most affected by global change8, and the main drivers of biodiversity decline in these ecosystems are well known9: habitat modification, pollution, invasive alien species, direct exploitation and climate change. Attributing the effects of these large-scale drivers to localized spatial and temporal scales is challenging, primarily because of the transport and mixing of water in aquatic systems. For example, diffuse and point-source inputs of chemicals in rivers have cumulative effects on aquatic biodiversity at a downstream catchment scale10. Furthermore, aquatic ecosystems cross countries, continents and are — via oceans and through the global water cycle — far more continuously integrated than terrestrial systems11. Consequently, effects of anthropogenic pressures have the potential to spread over large spatial extents and across political jurisdictions.

To implement actions that successfully address aquatic biodiversity loss, adequate assessments are necessary7,12 and require monitoring of all aquatic biodiversity — including groundwater, surface water and marine systems. Such monitoring must be broadly applicable, comparable and scalable, and must be implementable for countries worldwide that have different baseline information on species diversity and abundance to effectively inform policymaking.

Environmental DNA (eDNA)13 analysis is a key advance in biodiversity monitoring14 that will help to achieve the GBF targets. eDNA is directly extracted from an environmental sample15, such as water, soil or air (in contrast to DNA directly isolated from specimens) and analysed. Environmental samples might contain the DNA of all organisms present (including microorganisms, meiofauna and macrofauna), and include both intra- and extracellular DNA. eDNA in aquatic systems can also provide information on the diversity of organisms in adjacent terrestrial systems whose DNA is washed into the water bodies16,17. Environmental samples might also contain RNA (eRNA)18,19, which is more difficult to handle, but can reflect more recent and metabolically active community signals than eDNA20,21.

As eDNA can be sampled and analysed across all aquatic ecosystems to detect organisms in a universal manner, it can be applied to meet multiple GBF targets (Fig. 1). Methods based on eDNA are already established and being implemented for the early detection and mitigation of invasive alien species22,23 (GBF target 6: reduce the introduction of invasive alien species by 50%) and the evaluation of the state of ecosystems under multiple stressors and in pre- and post-restoration states24,25 (target 2: restore 30% of all degraded ecosystems). Collecting eDNA samples is becoming increasingly fast and cost-efficient26, rendering this approach highly scalable across space and time. The simplicity of gathering water samples also grants eDNA analysis a high potential for automatization27,28 and for its inclusion in citizen science projects29,30,31. Methods based on eDNA could, therefore, be implemented across the world, even in regions for which we currently lack adequate biodiversity data.

a, The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) identified 23 action-oriented global targets to be reached by 2030 (ref. 6). Many of these targets require information on the state, change and trends of biodiversity for scientific, political and economic decision-making. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) to provide information on biological diversity offers a potentially universal approach that can support GBF targets by providing baseline data and action–response information to guide decision-making. Establishing, tracking and assessing biodiversity hotspots, biodiversity trends and change is particularly important. b, Multiple targets can be directly assessed using existing eDNA technologies, which are sufficiently developed for implementation but not yet routinely used in most countries.

In this Perspective, we examine the current state of aquatic eDNA research, with a particular focus on the policy relevance of eDNA and its utility in contributing towards GBF targets (Fig. 1). We focus on eDNA only (not eRNA) because of its higher readiness level for biodiversity monitoring. First, we explain the technical aspects of eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring required for assessing baseline states and action–response effects. Second, we assess the use of eDNA at the level of communities and ecosystems, targeted species, and its ability to attribute environmental change to underlying drivers. Finally, we outline necessary steps, including standardization, data curation and data deposition, to make eDNA analysis globally accessible.

DNA is universal across all species, and traces of DNA are left in the environment by all organisms, for example, by shedding skin cells. Extraction of this DNA from an environmental sample, in theory, enables the detection of any organism, either by targeted screening for single species or assessment of whole communities13,32 (Fig. 2). In both cases15, the first step is sampling water in the focal environment and extracting the DNA present in these samples. For species-specific assays, a portion of DNA is amplified using primers specific to this taxon33,34 and the number of copies present in the original sample is evaluated using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)35 approach, such as real-time qPCR or digital PCR. When assessing whole communities via metabarcoding14, a barcode gene region is amplified using primers with a broader taxonomic scope. The amplified DNA is sequenced via high-throughput sequencing technologies36, which yield millions to billions of sequences (termed ‘reads'). These sequences are then bioinformatically processed and clustered into meaningful units (either as operational taxonomic units or as  amplicon sequence variants) and compared with reference sequences in databases to assign them to specific organisms. These two approaches are well established and are currently the most used methods applied to eDNA samples32,37. New approaches are being developed to investigate the functional or genetic diversity of a group of organisms38, to investigate trophic relationships39 or to obtain information on the whole genome of the organisms present in the samples40,41, but are not yet sufficiently developed for widespread biodiversity monitoring. Generally, sampling of eDNA is applicable to systems with minimal prior information and can also be integrated with data from other monitoring techniques such as remote sensing, camera or audio recordings17,42.

a, Aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) is sampled from marine, freshwater and groundwater ecosystems, enabling spatial (for example, catchment wide) and temporal (for example, across seasons) integration. The basic principle of aquatic eDNA analysis include sampling and capturing the DNA (usually via filtration) followed by DNA extraction, amplification (either of single species or through metabarcoding), sequencing and taxonomic assignment by comparison to DNA reference databases. b, Environmental DNA collected in river networks enables gathering information on biodiversity from a wider spatial extent by integrating hydrological first principles and estimated production and decay of DNA. Collection of samples can be enhanced via automated methods (such as autonomous samplers) or via citizen science approaches, which enables accumulation of data at high spatiotemporal resolution.

Following pioneering work in the 1980s and 1990s to isolate microbial communities from environmental samples43,44 and the development of DNA barcoding technology for species identification45, the combination of these technologies in the late 2000s46 led to eDNA becoming established as a research field in its own right13. Uptake of eDNA-based approaches has since vastly expanded in the field of biodiversity research owing to their non-invasiveness and increased efficiency for detecting species in a range of habitats at decreasing costs47. Technological advancements36,48 have enabled progression from detecting single species — initially focused on protected or invasive alien taxa46,49 — to comprehensive biodiversity assessments of many taxa with a metabarcoding approach. Consequently, the past 15 years have seen substantial growth in the number of datasets produced using this approach (Fig. 3), alongside the development of guidelines, large-scale projects and end-user applications15,29,37,47,50,51,52,53,54.

Here, a dataset is defined as a data package with a specific run number. Metadata on these datasets were retrieved using Entrez Programming Utilities and parsed using a list of keywords to include only eDNA and eRNA datasets from aquatic environments. HTS, high-throughput sequencing.

The uptake of eDNA research has been particularly prevalent in aquatic ecosystems, including rivers, lakes and marine water bodies, because of the ease of sample collection. Gaps in biodiversity knowledge are often larger for aquatic ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, necessitating the implementation of novel approaches tailored to aquatic ecosystems. Current eDNA research in aquatic environments has mostly focused on freshwater ecosystems (65% of studies compared with 25% on marine ecosystems and 10% on other/multiple systems) and more than half of the studies have focused on fish (52%)51 — probably due to their high commercial and recreational values. Additionally, fish tend to shed greater amounts of DNA than species with sclerotized exoskeletons (such as crayfish) and are easier to detect owing to their high biomass and mobility55.

The primary strength of using eDNA analysis for assessing biodiversity is the ability to infer species' presence without direct collection or observation13, and that the same approach can be applied across the whole tree of life. The minimally invasive sampling involved is desirable from ethical, work-safety and systems perspectives, as massive upscaling can be achieved without unwanted side effects. However, indirect inference — detecting DNA and not the organisms themselves — is sometimes also seen as the greatest weakness of eDNA analysis. This approach limits inference and information on population structure (abundance or life stages) and requires cautious interpretation of the signal as positive detections might be linked to transport of DNA56, sequencing errors57 or database classification errors58. Therefore, eDNA workflows require rigorous methods and best practices at each stage to minimize the risk of false positives59.

Successfully meeting the GBF targets requires the acquisition of three types of data (Fig. 1). First, biodiversity must be mapped across all scales and systems to identify priority areas for conservation and restoration (‘map biodiversity'; for example, GBF targets 3, 6 and 14). Second, the spatial movements and temporal changes in abundance of species of interest (such as pathogens, invasive alien or endangered species) must be tracked (‘track species'; for example, GBF targets 4 or 6). Finally, the responses of ecosystems to anthropogenic changes must be monitored and understood, including identifying pollution levels that do not harm biodiversity (as mentioned in GBF target 7) or tracking recovery success when restoring degraded ecosystems (see the ‘Understand and attribute drivers of biodiversity change' section). The analysis of eDNA is a powerful approach to address all these aspects and to provide common information needed for implementing efficient regulation. In this section, the potential use of eDNA-based approaches for these three objectives is explored and examples of their usefulness for GBF targets presented.

Effective ecosystem assessment for policymaking, such as monitoring systems under pressure or identifying biodiversity hotspots, hinges upon efficient characterization of biodiversity, including adequate baseline data and mapping biodiversity trends over space and time60. Traditional sampling approaches such as gillnet fishing or trawling are still widely used, but are not sufficient to reach the ambitious targets of GBF and other regional initiatives (such as the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive) because they are too labour intensive, destructive and costly to scale up or implement — particularly in undersampled regions, such as tropical streams, open ocean or groundwater systems. By contrast, eDNA analysis allows greater spatial resolution and increased temporal and taxonomical scales compared with traditional approaches, and eDNA sampling is increasingly adopted by public agencies as part of their routine biomonitoring programmes61,62,63. eDNA-based approaches effectively complement traditional aquatic biodiversity monitoring as they overcome the challenges of morphology-based classification (such as juvenile life stages or cryptic species64) and enable access to undersampled and less-accessible systems such as groundwater ecosystems65 or oceanic trenches66.

Technological advances are currently driving this transition. The ever-increasing pace of technological developments in eDNA science has inevitably reduced the cost of processing water samples67, enabling the collection of samples at high spatial and temporal resolution68,69. Although sample collection and eDNA capture can still be labour intensive, collecting water samples is becoming considerably faster owing to the development of autonomous robotic and passive samplers. Existing autonomous samplers70,71,72,73 are capable of multisample capture and preservation. When coupled with a microfluidic block, they can even collect, filter, extract and perform multiple targeted qPCR assays of eDNA samples in situ74,75. These automated samplers are highly attractive for early detection of invasive alien species (addressing GBF target 6; see the ‘Tracking endangered, harmful or invasive alien species' section), and can be operated for months at a time without intervention76; however, further technological improvements are possible and the cost of fully automated samplers is currently prohibitive for some applications. Low-cost and less technologically advanced alternative samplers are based on passive capture of eDNA on substrates, such as non-charged cellulose ester or even medical gauze secured in three-dimensional hollow printed housing77,78. Traditionally, monitoring biodiversity was often restricted to specialists, whereas these simple eDNA capture methods have the potential to include citizen scientists in eDNA-based biodiversity assessment29,30,31, contributing to increased participation and improving integration of biodiversity into decision-making at every level (GBF targets 22 and 14, respectively).

Owing to transportation and mixing processes in water bodies, aquatic eDNA samples taken at a specific location reflect both the local community and organisms living in the surrounding environment. This feature can be leveraged to understand the spatial structure of biodiversity underpinning the observed data. In rivers, for example, depending on the discharge and other abiotic factors, eDNA can travel downstream from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres56,79,80, acting as a ‘conveyor belt of biodiversity information'16. Thus, eDNA-based biodiversity measures not only correlate to upstream-averaged measures of land use and habitat types17,81,82,83, but also provide space-filling projections of biodiversity by integrating signals from discrete sampling points into a continuous representation along a watercourse (Fig. 2). Similarly, in marine systems, eDNA is transported by currents and shaped by the stratification of the water column84,85. Coupling stream86,87 and marine88,89 eDNA data with hydrodynamic models is therefore essential to unravel and understand the spatial distribution of biodiversity. Specific models90,91 enable spatial projection of pointwise eDNA samples beyond their collection point into space-filling taxon richness maps at high spatial resolution92. As such, they provide spatially integrated information on biodiversity.

The assessment of overall biodiversity is particularly relevant for GBF targets that focus on area-based or area-projected measures, such as target 1 (‘plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss'), target 3 (‘conserve 30% of land, water and seas') or target 14 (‘integrate biodiversity into decision-making'). These targets are most effectively reached when overall biodiversity assessments of ponds, streams, groundwater and marine systems are comparable, implementable and accessible from local to global scales.

Tracking or detecting species of particular interest or concern is often a key piece of information needed for policymaking and communication. In this context, eDNA analysis is a valuable tool for the detection and monitoring of individual species. Indeed, the first applications of eDNA were for the detection of either rare and endangered49 or invasive alien species46,93. The detection and monitoring of individual species of interest is directly associated with several GBF targets, including target 4 (‘halting extinction of [individual] endangered species') and target 6 (‘reducing the introduction of invasive alien species'). Two examples of integrating eDNA information on targeted species into policy are the tracking of the endangered great crested newt in the UK using eDNA94 and the almost globally implemented eDNA (and eRNA) tracking of pathogens (in particular SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater samples95. In both cases, real-time implementation and analysis of eDNA samples enables rapid dissemination to inform policy. eDNA-based methods are now implemented in many countries for routine monitoring of harmful algal blooms96,97, invasive alien species, such as the quagga mussel98 and European green crab99, and of endangered species such as the above-mentioned great crested newt94 or the harbour porpoise49.

Importantly, however, an eDNA signal does not automatically indicate an organism's immediate temporal or spatial occurrence. The signal can be transported in space (for example, by water current or in the faeces of predators), reflect past occurrences (ancient DNA), be a transient signal of an organism passing by, or even enter the water via wastewater or terrestrial run-off16,100,101,102. An eDNA signal therefore contains different information compared with the direct observation of an organism, including potential false positives103,104, and thus requires different interpretation. For example, detection of an alien species using eDNA analysis in a location where it has not previously been observed should not trigger a policy response for removal, but rather incentivize the deployment of other methods to confirm the species' presence. Similarly, eDNA-based techniques do not allow the collection of population demographics, such as age and size distribution or sex ratio, which can be required for endangered or invasive alien species monitoring105. Some of these limitations can be overcome by sampling eRNA rather than eDNA, as eRNA represents genes expressed in the sampled environment and degrades faster than eDNA20. As eRNA provides a more contemporary signal than eDNA, its analysis can potentially distinguish between live and dead material to reduce the number of false positives18,21 or, in specific cases, even differentiate life stages (for example, in amphibians). However, eRNA analysis is still under evaluation and, with a few exceptions19, is not yet ready for use in monitoring contexts to inform policymakers.

Approaches based on eDNA are potentially relevant for GBF target 4, which specifically links the halt of species extinctions to the prevention of genetic diversity loss. Addressing this target currently relies on indirect measures of genetic diversity based on abundance data for many species and subsequent estimation of effective population size. Determining abundance estimates from eDNA is challenging, but at least possible in some circumstances. Both targeted106,107 and metabarcoding108 approaches have demonstrated correlation between copy number and/or read counts from eDNA and biomass or abundance, indicating that the method is at least semi-quantitative. However, this approach is strongly debated owing to the high potential for bias throughout eDNA workflows, which can create noise and error in the signal109,110,111,112,113. Possible solutions include adding internal standards of a known amount of synthetic DNA (so-called DNA spike-in) to compare read counts within species and across sites.

In addition to indirect measures of genetic diversity based on abundance, eDNA analysis could enable direct measurement of intraspecific genetic diversity, even in hard-to-sample environments and for rare and elusive species. This approach is still in development and is not yet ready for direct implementation; however, it has shown promising results in particular cases. So far, investigations have focused on the detection of haplotypes in short sections of mitochondrial (mt)DNA used for metabarcoding, and demonstrated that eDNA captures the genetic diversity of sampled populations38,114,115,116,117. Such approaches can differentiate populations and identify regions with unique genetic variation based on the mtDNA marker genes118. However, these short mtDNA fragments generally have low power to resolve finer genetic structures within or between populations. Targeting longer fragments and nuclear DNA provides increased resolution but presents additional challenges related to the shorter persistence of longer DNA fragments in the environment, and that eDNA represents a mixture of DNA from different individuals. Current methods do not allow assigning genotypes to individuals, which restricts most genetic approaches to population-level estimates119. Likelihood-based DNA mixture models could be applied to address the problem of redundancy (multiple individuals sharing the same allele) as long as a relatively large panel of multi-allelic markers is available120. Technical challenges notwithstanding, microsatellite allele frequencies of round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) or an Arctic diatom (Thalassiosira hyalina) estimated from aquatic eDNA have been shown to closely resemble allele frequencies from genotyped tissues120,121.

A considerable challenge for estimating genetic diversity from eDNA data is the detection of errors generated during the amplification and sequencing steps. For species detection, many bioinformatic procedures remove genetic variability during regular data cleansing and cluster sequences at the species level. For population genetic-level analysis, keeping exact sequence variants while removing erroneous sequences is the primary goal and can be more challenging119. Resolving this challenge requires combined improvements in sequencing technologies and the computational steps to identify and remove errors.

For policymaking and management, attribution of biodiversity change is key: only when drivers of change (both positive and negative) are linked to their biodiversity effects can effective policy and management be achieved. Traditionally, attributing drivers to aquatic biodiversity change has relied on monitoring and morphological identification of a relatively small number of species (such as macroinvertebrates, benthic macrofauna, fish and diatoms) that are biological indicators of environmental pressures such as nutrient pollution122. However, these methods are often unsuitable for monitoring emerging drivers, such as pollution by nanoparticles or microplastics, and hinge on the (often incorrect) assumption that a few indicator groups represent overall ecosystem responses. eDNA-based methods have already led to marked improvements in our ability to document biodiversity123 and identify pollutant thresholds124 by integrating data from diverse taxonomic groups with only one sample. This approach, in comparison with traditional methods, will provide a more comprehensive — and at least more diversified — response of aquatic communities to anthropogenic changes, individually and in combination24,25,125.

Current monitoring, whether with traditional or molecular tools, often focuses on the structure of communities (their richness and composition) rather than their functional properties123. However, the effect of biodiversity loss on ecosystem services cannot be fully understood from estimates of taxonomic diversity alone. To characterize ecosystem health in its entirety, structural and functional biodiversity must be measured as these parameters can respond differently to different stressors. This type of monitoring requires a shift from focusing on which species provides the function to understanding how the functional properties of the whole community respond to pressures123,126. For example, co-occurrence data generated from eDNA metabarcoding across the tree of life allow reconstructing multitrophic ecological networks, from which functional properties such as connectance and nestedness can be estimated127. Other emerging approaches for addressing ecosystem changes are based on the analysis of expressed genes via eRNA. The strength of these eRNA methods lies in monitoring the physiological state of populations or communities by detecting changes in the activity of single or multiple genes18. Shotgun sequencing of total RNA from environmental samples (metatranscriptomics) allows the identification of genes that are actively and collectively expressed under different conditions128. Changes in freshwater biofilm microbial community-level expression in response to pollutants have been demonstrated, even when changes in community composition were not detected129. Additionally, experiments have revealed changes in community-wide gene expression of aquatic organisms under heat stress through sampling experimental tank water, demonstrating that metatranscriptomics of extra-organismal eRNA can reveal gene expression response to environmental change130. These emerging measures of ecological condition, especially when using eRNA, are promising but not yet ready for widespread use for practitioners and to inform decision-making.

Advances in artificial intelligence and modelling are enabling new approaches for attributing biodiversity change to environmental and/or anthropogenic drivers. For example, eDNA coupled with machine-learning models is used to infer the ecological status of aquatic systems131,132, and allows inclusion of a broader set of indicator taxa. Microorganisms, for example, differ considerably in their metabolism and sensitivity to different pollutant sources133, but have been largely ignored in biomonitoring because they are difficult to culture and identify, and because knowledge of their ecological function is unavailable134,135. Validated approaches based on profiling communities using amplicon sequence variants and/or operational taxonomic units detect changes in the structure of communities of bacteria133,136, freshwater invertebrates25,137 and diatoms138 against well-understood disturbance gradients, and have demonstrated strong improvements in the accuracy of ecological quality assessment139,140. Supervised machine learning combined with metabarcoding will complement and expand current morphology-based methods to produce the same ecological quality assessments at increased speed and cost efficiency, and without necessarily depending on taxonomic assignment using barcode reference databases135 (Fig. 4). The ability of supervised machine learning to outperform traditional indicator value approaches, using training datasets with reference disturbance levels to estimate biotic indices, has been demonstrated131,132,140,141,142,143.

The principle of the machine-learning approach is to link genomic features of the environmental DNA (eDNA) samples (such as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) or taxonomically assigned information) to environmental reference states. Specifically, during the training phase, the model learns relationships between genomic features and known environmental conditions, iteratively refining its predictive rules. In the predicting phase, the trained model applies these learned rules to analyse new eDNA samples, generating straightforward, actionable predictions. Through continuous feedback cycles, the model enhances its accuracy, improving its utility for environmental monitoring and management.

Overall, eDNA analysis enables attributing changes in biodiversity to specific environmental factors17,65,144, evaluating the impact of implementing protected areas145,146, and calculating biodiversity and ecosystem state indices47. Aquatic eDNA analysis can also attribute change beyond aquatic ecosystems: imprints of terrestrial land use on aquatic eDNA are well established, showing that aquatic eDNA signals associate to the structure and diversity of terrestrial land use assessed by remote sensing at 400–1,000-m upstream distances17. This information can then be translated into effective practice for the prevention of biodiversity decline.

eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring has the potential to scale from a local to a regional and eventually a global perspective, and enables data integration and the use of this information to downscale back to regional and local interventions42. eDNA approaches are already widely used across different scales, which helps to contribute to monitoring progress on GBF targets. These methods are particularly useful for spearheading activities in regions in which previous knowledge on biodiversity is limited; for example, eDNA-based approaches are being tested to study the biodiversity of deep marine habitats147,148. Similarly, subterranean habitats are one of the least studied environments and the use of molecular tools such as eDNA contributes to mapping their biodiversity65,149. Moreover, eDNA-based assessments are being developed and implemented in many of the world's largest rivers such as the Danube150, Yangtze144 or Rhine151, which are not only home to enigmatic megafauna but are also severely threatened by anthropogenic activities.

Achieving target 1 of the GBF (‘plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss') depends on understanding the initial state and change of overall biodiversity. In many cases, eDNA data are the very first baseline data, and linking these data to possible drivers of biodiversity change will ultimately guide restoration planning152. The ability of eDNA analysis to provide data on the state and change of individual species focuses on target 4 (‘halt species extinction, protect genetic diversity, and manage human–wildlife conflicts'), which directly refers and links to the monitoring and managing of biodiversity, at the species or within-species level. Similarly, target 6 (‘reduce the introduction of invasive alien species by 50% and minimise their impact') operates at the species level, aiming to decrease the impact of alien species in part through preventing their introduction in aquatic systems. To support this approach, eDNA analysis provides early detection and monitoring of alien species. Although initial attempts to detect invasive alien species (for example, the Asian carps Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix93,153) were partially challenged by detection failures (false absences), false presence indications and unknown lower thresholds of detectability, increasing standardization and the adoption of structured decision-making processes have resulted in a relatively broad application of eDNA methods to monitor Asian carp species in North America23,154. Similar efforts have been established for other aquatic alien species, such as invasive kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and sea stars (Asterias amurensis)155, tunicates (Didemnum vexillum)156, dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.)22 or freshwater aquatic plants (Najas minor)157.

The contribution of eDNA analysis to GBF targets 1, 4 and 6 focuses on simply detecting the presence of species. However, eDNA analysis can provide insight into why and how biodiversity is affected; that is, mechanistic monitoring of aquatic systems and the effects of stressors. Classic assessments of environmental toxicology and environmental chemistry have focused on monitoring a highly diversified set of chemicals10. To reach target 7 (‘reduce pollution to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity'), pollutant monitoring must be linked to an ecosystem's ecological health and resilience status. eDNA is effective in capturing how environmental stressors, particularly chemical pollution, have combined negative effects on the structure, stability and composition of aquatic communities across a wide range of taxa158,159,160. Target 10 (‘enhance biodiversity and sustainability in agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry') requires similar monitoring of effects on biodiversity, but in relation to the production and harvesting of natural resources. eDNA is already routinely used to monitor impacts of aquaculture (such as salmon farming) by examining marine benthic sediments161 and has also been used to monitor the outflow of wastewater into natural streams, focusing on possible effects of different agricultural runoff100.

eDNA-based methods have the potential to greatly improve our understanding of aquatic ecosystems and contribute to national and global biodiversity targets. For successful inclusion of eDNA analysis in monitoring programmes, careful action is needed as methods must be broadly applicable, comparable and scalable, and must be implementable for countries across the globe.

Two key barriers exist to the implementation of eDNA: first, the perceived limited comparability between results generated with eDNA-based approaches and those obtained with traditional methods162,163,164; and second, unequal access to technical infrastructure. eDNA metabarcoding technology is considered ready for implementation and allows — when needed — retrofitting of indices to current standards47,135. Discrepancies with traditional assessments occur because of amplification biases and incomplete reference databases, but also because eDNA can detect cryptic or elusive species47,123,165 previously missed by traditional tools. Assessing biodiversity and achieving successful conservation outcomes will require effectively using eDNA alongside traditional methods, as biodiversity monitoring globally remains under-resourced. In high-income countries, existing monitoring programmes should be complemented with eDNA-based approaches, creating continuity for existing long-term monitoring and generally allowing comparison at the index level. Maintenance and overlap with other programmes will increase costs and require extra work over the short term, but secure existing data series in the long term. To encourage the rapid adoption of eDNA globally, in low- and middle-income countries, novel (and first) monitoring could use eDNA only.

This section discusses necessary steps towards a global application of eDNA to assess biodiversity within the context of the GBF. First, methods of standardization must be agreed and promoted (agree on minimal standards on sampling and processing, provide training opportunities and institutionalize quality control). Second, adequate reference databases, digital sequence data deposition and general access to these resources must be established. Finally, efforts must be made to increase inclusivity and remove technology barriers (collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility and ethics (CARE) principles and Nagoya Protocol).

The development and implementation of international standards is an essential next step to make eDNA approaches broadly applicable. These next steps, including establishing standardized protocols and best practices for general implementation of eDNA, are particularly relevant for global initiatives, such as the GBF, that rely on common agreement beyond the borders and jurisdiction of individual countries.

eDNA has always been developed as a tool for practitioners, rather than for academic research only. Consequently, discussions on an adequate and replicable implementation paralleled the rapid advances in the field153,162,166,167. General protocols and guidelines were developed from the first species-based assessments, such as amphibians in the UK29, to the monitoring of whole communities of invertebrates and fish, for example, in Switzerland168, the EU37,169, China170 or the USA93.

Despite these standardization efforts, eDNA-based biodiversity assessments still use various approaches throughout the world171. The selection of a certain filter material, DNA extraction methods, primers, sequencing technologies and post-processing steps can drastically affect the inferred taxa lists172,173. For multispecies detection approaches, such as eDNA metabarcoding, the effects of the choice of methods are most pronounced for rare species that are easily missed. Broader use of eDNA for monitoring thus requires standardization of practices63,174, in particular a global agreement on general minimum standards for sampling and processing, reporting and data publishing. Here, specific recommendations for different freshwater ecosystems (for example, small stream versus large, stratified lake), environmental factors (turbidity, flow, pH and so on) and specific research questions and tasks (single species detection versus multispecies detection) must be accounted for37,168,175. This standardization is well underway — a first ISO standard is available in draft form after international voting176, and several others are in development under the framework ISO/TC 147/SC 5 (Biological methods) — but must be continued. Given the ambitious 2030 GBF timeline, the implementation and standardization of the method in its current form might be more effective than deferring implementation considering the promise of upcoming new technologies.

Comparability and scalability across taxa and regions are the biggest assets of eDNA analysis. These capabilities hinge, however, on adequate access to reference databases as most uses of eDNA rely on assigning specific sequences to taxonomic and genetic reference databases (although taxonomy-free approaches exist139). These reference databases are globally still highly unevenly distributed, and large geographic and taxonomic gaps are present177,178,179. For example, (sub)tropical systems and many invertebrate groups are far less represented than temperate systems and vertebrate groups. Populating, expanding and maintaining these reference databases is imperative.

Advances in sequencing technologies enable the upscaling of reference database generation by several orders of magnitude while also drastically reducing costs. However, many — even formally described — species are still absent from public genomic repositories180. Novel nanopore sequencing technologies could allow the barcoding of thousands of specimens from a single amplicon pool at a sequencing cost of few US$ per specimen, offering the potential to catalogue all species within two decades181. The portability and applicability of sequencing technologies in field conditions is also rapidly improving; for example, portable sequencers have been used for DNA barcoding in the Ecuadorian Chocó Rainforest182 and other remote locations. Populating databases is still a major bottleneck as implementation is lagging behind this progress in technologies, and also critically depends on taxonomists' knowledge and expertise. Scientists and end-users must be mobilized alike and commit to complementing the databases as the task is important, necessary and cannot be delegated. This challenge is particularly pronounced given the large number of undescribed or underrepresented taxa, discrepancies in taxonomic classifications and the need for rigorous validation of reference sequences. The complexity of maintaining and curating these databases has been widely discussed in the literature, touching on issues such as funding177 and standardization efforts58. A comprehensive discussion of these aspects is, however, beyond the scope of this Perspective.

Alongside data generation, the raw data produced from environmental samples must be deposited in repositories (Table 1) whose long-term operability is guaranteed183. Priority should be given to open platforms specifically adapted to host genetic data, enabling better discoverability through advanced application programming interfaces (which enable the exchange of data between existing programmes) and research tools184. The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, linking the Sequence Read Archive, the European Nucleotide Archive and the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive are currently among the most suitable options for depositing and indexing eDNA data. Ideally, eDNA repositories should facilitate the seamless exchange and integration of data across different platforms and disciplines. For example, biodiversity data portals such as the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) can include biodiversity records derived from raw DNA data while providing a permanent link to the original repositories185. Publication of eDNA datasets in these global biodiversity databases is crucial to ensure that data can be used by policymakers with little to no specialist knowledge186. However, so far, few eDNA datasets have been made publicly available through these platforms. The key to successful adoption is the mandatory deposition of eDNA raw data along with relevant metadata provided in standardized data models, such as provided by the Genomics Standards Consortium (see the MIxS MIMARKS checklists187) or the Biodiversity Information Standards consortium TDWG (Darwin Core extended data model188,189). As part of ongoing international task forces, new metadata standards are currently being developed190. These data standards ensure that the most critical metadata are recorded and made available through a standardized vocabulary191, which in turn can be aligned with other biodiversity community standards. Such metadata (Table 1) are crucial as they ensure that the data can be accurately interpreted and reused in various contexts, which is necessary to reach a broad range of stakeholders, including citizens.

eDNA data producers must focus on creating datasets that can be used and reused186, which involves ensuring the longevity of data, adopting standard formats and metadata for ease of interpretation, and promoting open access to facilitate wide usage across different sectors. Thus, published eDNA data must adhere to the FAIR principles — findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable192 — as this approach enhances the discoverability and usability of eDNA data across various scientific and non-scientific domains186 (Table 1). Therefore, setting minimum guidelines for data reporting and analysis is recommended, and minimum information to be reported as part of any aquatic eDNA study has been proposed190,193. Data deposition must include the raw sequencing data and the essential metadata specific to the samples and their processing in the laboratory, but also the final community data matrix, easily interpretable by the stakeholders, as well as the bioinformatics tools and reference databases required to produce the results. These minimum guidelines will ensure a baseline of quality and comparability for eDNA research and application.

The successful, widespread implementation of eDNA hinges on removing barriers to its access and making the methods inclusive. Technological barriers and uneven distribution of knowledge and resources between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries exist across biodiversity sciences. As eDNA analysis (similar to remote sensing and other technology-driven approaches) depends on specialized laboratory and analysis techniques, overcoming discrepancies in lack of knowledge, training and resources is particularly relevant. If countries cannot afford eDNA-based monitoring or do not have access to the technologies to process and assess the samples, the existing inequality in biodiversity knowledge will further increase.

In addition to ensuring equitable access to eDNA technology, local and Indigenous knowledge on biodiversity must be both valued and integrated into technology-driven monitoring efforts. Although measuring biodiversity variables through proxies such as eDNA is technologically feasible, maintaining taxonomic and natural history knowledge, as well as connections to ecosystems and nature, is essential. Datafication of biodiversity and reliance on technological solutions run the risk of disconnecting people with nature194, as sequencing information and eDNA approaches cannot replace observing and experiencing nature directly. Additionally, limits exist to the quality and applicability of data available from methods based on indirect collection of information, such as remote sensing or eDNA. Conversely, eDNA also has the potential to be a powerful tool that provides people with a new perspective on their surrounding environment and biodiversity, strengthening their interest in and commitment to nature29,30,31. Any eDNA-based approaches should, therefore, consider how to include the public and taxonomic experts such that the information on biodiversity from eDNA is accompanied by increased understanding and perception of biodiversity.

Addressing the sociocultural dimensions of eDNA, particularly when data originate from territories of Indigenous communities, necessitates the adoption of the CARE principles195. These principles ensure that eDNA research is conducted in a manner that respects the rights and traditions of local communities, promoting an ethical approach and facilitating the local populations acceptance of biodiversity research. Incorporating the CARE principles aligns eDNA practices with broader societal values and legal frameworks, such as the Nagoya Protocol196 and GBF target 13 (‘fair and equitable sharing of genetic resources'). In some situations, however, open-access goals such as the population and maintenance of reference databases can bypass traditional mechanisms for benefit sharing, potentially disadvantaging the countries or communities where the genetic material originated. Public deposition without consultation can undermine the authority of these communities over resources tied to their cultural identity and governance systems. Moreover, eDNA can also complicate traditional frameworks, especially when DNA is transported across national boundaries by natural processes such as ocean currents, river flows and air197. All stakeholders — nations, Indigenous groups and local communities — must be included in discussions about the implementation of CARE principles, data sharing and benefit sharing to ensure that the benefits of eDNA research are distributed fairly and with due regard to the sovereignty and cultural significance of the data sources194,198.

One of the four overarching goals of the GBF is to mobilize the business and finance sectors to close the gap in funding biodiversity. In particular, target 19 (‘Mobilize $200 billion per year for biodiversity') encourages solutions to incentivize international companies and finance to engage in the monitoring of biodiversity and contribute monetarily to its protection. Several initiatives are being promoted to market biodiversity and to incentivize the development of activities and technologies that are not harmful for the environment or that mitigate deleterious actions, such as green bonds or biodiversity credits (quantifiable units of biodiversity improvement that should provide an incentive for funding conservation projects)199,200. Although such market-based solutions to environmental challenges are gaining substantial attention at the global scale, deep uncertainties exist regarding the process and their benefits199. Without proper transparency and accountability, these schemes might be ineffective and lead to greenwashing and inequitable outcomes, as has occurred for carbon credits201.

A challenge to the broad use of biodiversity credits is the difficulty in quantify biodiversity improvements accurately and in a standardized manner. Sampling and identification methods vary substantially, are not all easily implementable across the globe, and the multidimensionality of biodiversity cannot be captured in one single number. eDNA metabarcoding has been suggested as a useful method to help the development of marketing metrics for biodiversity, as its simplicity and scalability could allow the collection of comparable data across the globe. However, this approach also requires global standardization of methods and a clear reference to its limits. Moreover, eDNA is particularly well suited for aquatic environments but is less proven for terrestrial ecosystems, which might limit the comparability of this data201,202.

Addressing biodiversity decline and implementing global measures to assess, manage and restore biodiversity are essential and at the core of the GBF framework. The huge progress in molecular-based biodiversity monitoring, particularly the use of eDNA, has created the first feasible and coherent approach to monitor aquatic biodiversity. To successfully implement eDNA biomonitoring as a reliable and widely trusted basis for policy and decision-making, a new common agreement on its use is needed, including common protocols, data standards and standardization for quality assurance. Further, implementation of eDNA approaches hinges on increased FAIRness and open accessibility of biodiversity data globally, which also presents an opportunity to enhance collaboration, improve conservation efforts and advance research. Rapid completion of reference database, curation and integration of FAIR principles are needed. Although progress towards these goals, in particular where and by whom data are stored, is becoming more systematically addressed in academic research, agreement has not yet been reached and implemented regarding data produced by public stakeholders and private companies. Sample repositories (such as the Global Genome Biodiversity Network) and data centres established for eDNA data should not only be accessible and implemented for high-income countries (for example, the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration), but also for low- and middle-income countries. As these repositories are funded by public money and provide collective benefits, all data collected through governmental programmes should be included — even when data collection and analysis is executed by private companies.

Coherent, integrated and complete data storage and access will allow establishing new universally valid metrics for describing biodiversity and elevate the quality and comparability of biodiversity data. In the framework of the GBF, regional to global progress on reaching targets could be tracked by new eDNA-based indicators on the state, change and pressures of biodiversity. Particularly in aquatic systems, these metrics can be calculated at high spatial and temporal resolutions: transport of eDNA in the water allows predictions of biodiversity across catchments and water bodies, whereas matching eDNA sampling to existing monitoring stations of water quality allows synergy with existing infrastructure. A pragmatic approach should be chosen when designing new metrics versus retrofitting to existing monitoring programmes: that is, complementing rather than replacing existing monitoring programmes, yet building new monitoring timelines where no data are available. Swiftly establishing a global network of coherent aquatic biodiversity monitoring using eDNA is realistic and required to achieve GBF targets.

A possible way forwards is institutionalizing eDNA monitoring activities through regional centres (examples of such attempts include the Defra DNA Center of Excellence in the UK, the Joint Research Center in the EU and the National eDNA Reference Centre in Australia). These centres coordinate activities that include funding, supporting and driving research that is relevant to policy implementation, reaching out to local monitoring personnel, receiving samples from citizens, performing quality checks through internal positive control, and generating reference material and certification standards. Such regional eDNA excellence centres can facilitate capacity building and act as coordinating and executing building blocks, linking both local and global biodiversity monitoring centres (similar to GEO BON). The Canadian Centre of Biodiversity Genomics at the University of Guelph and other federal initiatives are examples of such centres. Global join up of these initiatives and centres is crucial to ensure international standards and comparability of datasets across countries. Finally, to future proof the data acquired and ensure long-term comparability, adequate biobanking of samples is a necessary next step, which should, at a minimum, include storing metadata, raw sequencing output, and the extracted DNA samples in quality and quantity sufficient to be used by generations to come203. Together, these measures will elevate the accessibility and extent of aquatic biodiversity data to levels needed for achieving GBF targets and securing global biodiversity.

When Italian philosopher and essayist Andrea Colamedici released Ipnocrazia: Trump, Musk e La Nuova Architettura Della Realtà (Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the New Architecture of Reality), he wanted to make a statement about the existence of truth in the digital age.

The book, published in December, was described as “a crucial book for understanding how control is currently exercised not by repressing truth but by multiplying narratives, making it impossible to locate any fixed point,” according to a description by Tlon, a publishing house Colamedici cofounded. While the book attracted buzz in philosophy circles, Italian magazine L'Espresso revealed in April that the book's purported author, Jianwei Xun, did not exist, after one of its editors tried and failed to interview him. Initially described as a Hong Kong–born philosopher based in Berlin, it turned out that Xun was actually a hybrid human-algorithmic creation. Colamedici, listed on the book as translator, used AI to generate concepts and then critique those concepts.

“It's not just a book but a philosophical experiment, a performance. My aim was to raise awareness,” he tells WIRED. He says the point of the book was to help readers understand AI and invent a new concept for this era.

So far, Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the New Architecture of Reality is available in three languages (Spanish, French, and Italian) and has sold some 5,000 copies.

“From figures like Trump, Musk, and other world leaders to the ways in which digital platforms grab our attention, Xun unveils the mechanisms by which power shapes our perception of reality. It is a clear and disturbing analysis that goes beyond traditional critiques of digital society to reveal how reality itself has become a political battleground,” its description reads.

Jianwei Xun, the first “ghost thinker” created with artificial intelligence.

However, the controversy surrounding the decision to use AI to author it, and initially withhold that information, has now become a major part of the discourse around it—and that's what Colamedici wanted.

“When readers discovered the truth about how the book was created, many were hurt. I deeply regret that, but it was necessary,” he says.

“Some people have said, ‘I wish this author existed.' Well, he doesn't. We must understand that we build our own narratives. If we don't, the far right will monopolize the narratives, create myths, and we will spend our lives fact-checking while they write history. We can't allow that to happen.”

WIRED interviewed Colamedici in a conversation that explored the nuances of his project.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

WIRED: What was the inspiration for the philosophical experiment?

Andrea Colamedici: First of all, I teach prompt thinking at the European Institute of Design and I lead a research project on artificial intelligence and thought systems at the University of Foggia. Working with my students, I realized that they were using ChatGPT in the worst possible way: to copy from it. I observed that they were losing an understanding of life by relying on AI, which is alarming, because we live in an era where we have access to an ocean of knowledge, but we don't know what to do with it. I'd often warn them: “You can get good grades, even build a great career using ChatGPT to cheat, but you'll become empty.” I have trained professors from several Italian universities and many ask me: “When can I stop learning how to use ChatGPT?” The answer is never. It's not about completing an education in AI, but about how you learn when using it.”

We must keep our curiosity alive while using this tool correctly and teaching it to work how we want it to. It all starts from a crucial distinction: There is information that makes you passive, that erodes your ability to think over time, and there is information that challenges you, that makes you smarter by pushing you beyond your limits. This is how we should use AI: as an interlocutor that helps us think differently. Otherwise, we won't understand that these tools are designed by big tech companies that impose a certain ideology. They choose the data, the connections among it, and, above all, they treat us as customers to be satisfied. If we use AI this way, it will only confirm our biases. We will think we are right, but in reality we will not be thinking; we will be digitally embraced. We can't afford this numbness. This was the starting point of the book. The second challenge was how to describe what is happening now. For Gilles Deleuze, philosophy is the ability to create concepts, and today we need new ones to understand our reality. Without them, we are lost. Just look at Trump's Gaza video—generated by AI—or the provocations of figures like Musk. Without solid conceptual tools, we are shipwrecked. A good philosopher creates concepts that are like keys allowing us to understand the world.

What was your goal with the new book?

The book seeks to do three things: to help readers become AI literate, to invent a new concept for this era, and to be theoretical and practical at the same time. When readers discovered the truth about how the book was created, many were hurt. I deeply regret that, but it was necessary. Some people have said, “I wish this author existed.” Well, he doesn't. We must understand that we build our own narratives. If we don't, the far right will monopolize the narratives, create myths, and we will spend our lives fact-checking while they write history. We can't allow that to happen.

How did you use AI to help you write this philosophical essay?

I want to clarify that AI didn't write the essay. Yes, I used artificial intelligence, but not in a conventional way. I developed a method that I teach at the European Institute of Design, based on creating opposition. It's a way of thinking and using machine learning in an antagonistic way. I didn't ask the machine to write for me, but instead it generated ideas and then I used GPT and Claude to critique them, to give me perspectives on what I had written. Everything written in the book is mine. Artificial intelligence is a tool that we must learn to use, because if we misuse it—and “misuse” includes treating it as a sort of oracle, asking it to “tell me the answer to the world's questions; explain to me why I exist”—then we lose our ability to think. We become stupid. Nam June Paik, a great artist of the 1990s, said: “I use technology in order to hate it properly.” And that is what we must do: understand it, because if we don't, it will use us. AI will become the tool that big tech uses to control us and manipulate us. We must learn to use these tools correctly; otherwise, we'll be facing a serious problem.

Why did you choose to present yourself as a translator rather than an author?

I use translator as a metaphor. Yes, I am the translator, but not in the literal sense. I am one because to translate can also mean to transport, and that's what I do: I transport something. However, I wrote the book in Italian. I didn't translate it from Chinese—I don't know Chinese—or from English (the other language that the fictional Jianwei Xun knows). Jianwei Xun is a liminal figure: a meeting point between East and West, a point where cultures collide. And that is the opportunity he offers, to understand that we must meet in these strange spaces that are AI. We can do it, but we have to proceed with caution and courage. I know it sounds paradoxical, but this is how we must embody this connection. To be a translator here is also to be a translator of a historic opportunity: to reflect on what we do. If we do not reflect on this, we will be mere passive subjects. It has to be problematized. We cannot just say “AI, give me more, more, more.” We must be neither techno-enthusiasts who accept everything uncritically, nor technophobes, because it is impossible to live without technology today. AI is here to stay and we must understand it. It offers an opportunity to live more deeply and we must seize it.

If AI can create a convincing philosophical treatise, what is left for human authors? You have said that “we must think, we must be critical.” So what is the way forward for today's intellectual?

This is a beautiful question because if AI can draw better than we can, if it can drive better, if it can make music better than we do ... then what are we doing here? But we should look at this from another angle, not from the neoliberal perspective that turns all of life into a competition where it is all about winning. It's not like that. We must seek our own personal fulfillment, find a way to express ourselves, with or without AI. What does it matter if someone else can draw better than me? That's not the important thing. What matters is that I can learn to draw better and improve my abilities—working with AI or with another person (I recommend with people, but if you choose AI, that's fine). The big problem of humanity is this obsession to be the first, to be the centre of the story. But science already showed us in the 19th century that we are not at the centre of the universe; we are in a remote corner of the Milky Way. Nor are we even the centre of life on Earth: more than 99% of the biomass is plants, trees, other life forms. We are so small and we have only been here for a very short time, barely 200,000 years. Think of a pine tree or other species; a chicken, which is a much older species. Even among humans, we aren't a whole. “I am large, I contain multitudes,” as Walt Whitman said. We are also not the most intelligent species on the planet. That doesn't have to be understood as a tragedy, it can be viewed as a liberation.

Let's talk about Ipnocrazia [Hypnocracy]. Why did you choose that title for your book? And while we're at it, let's delve some into the Trump-Musk relationship that you analyse in the book.

Yes, I talk about a hypnocracy because what is happening is not a power physically acting on our bodies nor even on our minds, but instead on our very state of consciousness. This is what is happening to us: They are manipulating, through algorithms, our way of perceiving the world. And that is really dangerous. When we use a smartphone and social networks, we think we are connected to the world. We read newspapers, but we receive a personalized timeline that create a bespoke reality for us.

This is very concerning. We think we inhabit the same world as others, but our reality is shaped by our biases, opinions, and political positions. We need contact with those who think differently, but these filter bubbles and echo chambers only show us our own reflection. We must build bridges to the unknown, to the different. If not, we are heading for civil war. The other will become a threat, when in fact they are first and foremost a mystery—and perhaps even something to be treasured. That should be our first thought when confronting difference.

Today, Trump and Musk multiply realities with AI. The technology allows us to create infinite narratives, parallel versions of the world, and they play with that. It's no longer about hiding the truth by taking it off the table, but about piling so many lies on the table that the truth is drowned out.

Can AI have an original point of view, or does hypnocracy simply recycle human thoughts through algorithms? How would you define this relationship?

This is another big question, because there's a paradox: Hypnocracy begins with a human perspective. Without it, it wouldn't exist. But at the same time, I couldn't have generated this concept without AI. It's a creative codependency: just as I would need a conversation with another person to develop an idea, I needed that dialogue with artificial intelligence. AI does not live by itself. It requires prompts and stimuli while humans think autonomously. But that is precisely why we must understand what AI is. If we do not respect it for what it is, a tool, we will end up degrading our own humanity. To give an example: If we are used to saying “Alexa, turn off the light” in an impersonal tone, we will end up talking to our partner or friends in the same way. I'm not saying that we need to thank Siri as if she has feelings, she doesn't, but that we should make sure to preserve our ability to express kindness in real life.

Some intriguing studies indicate that when we order an Uber through an app, we treat the driver worse than when we call for a car by phone. The risk is twofold: humanizing AI (which is of course not human) and “platforming” people (that is, turning them into interfaces). This is dangerous and confusing these different categories of exchanges can dehumanize us.

Do you consider AI to be simply a tool for humans, or how would you define its ontological status?

AI is a human tool, no question. It's a product of our past, a type of collective consciousness that we created and that helps us understand why we are here. But here's a paradox: While AI can tell us the weather, recite verses from ancient poets, or suggest possible solutions to problems, it can never help us understand the meaning of life.

The mistake is in asking AI “tell me why I exist.” The better approach is to tell it that, “I've been reflecting on the meaning of life. I've read Sartre, who says that there is no predetermined meaning, but that we construct one. What other thinkers from other cultures, would you recommend I look at in order to broaden my understanding?” The West is exhausted. We need to find other radical connections: with Native American philosophies, the Vedas, and other distant cultures. Therein lies the great opportunity of AI: It's not an oracle, but a bridge to the unknown.

What led to the choice of Jianwei Xun's nationality and the specific cultural context for this fictional philosopher? Was it your decision, the result of AI, or maybe a strategy to challenge certain Western narratives?

The world needs to understand that Western culture must look outside itself. Western civilization has a serious problem: It still believes that it is at the centre of the universe, the only one capable of solving problems, and it treats other cultures as only being able to produce mere copies at best. This is a profound mistake. Today, that which is truly revolutionary—the ideas that may fundamentally change our perspective on the world—will not come from the West. It's possible that they might come out of China, but even more likely they will come from one of those spaces on today's frontier where different cultures meet. And we need to beware that even the concepts of East and West are absurd simplifications, but I use them for now.

I wanted to create a perspective that sits outside of this Western narcissism. Something that combined the new with old but forgotten ways of thinking. In Italy, for example, we have a crazy situation: The government demands that schools teach that only we have a history. Can you imagine? As if the Chinese dynasties or the indigenous peoples of America and Oceania did not. This reflects the fragility of a society that, instead of accepting that it is losing its centrality—which is not a tragedy, but a liberation—clings to ridiculous myths.

The book has become a publishing phenomenon. What do you attribute this success to? Is it interest in the conversation about AI, the philosophical provocation, the debate about authorship in the digital age?

It's true that we've had three printings already, although I don't remember whether they were 2,000 or 3,000 copies each. In total, the book has sold between 4,000 and 5,000 copies. But the strangest thing was when a journalist from [the Spanish newspaper] El País contacted me and asked: “Did you use a pseudonym to sell more copies?” It's actually the other way around! In Italy my books already sell well; I don't need to invent other names. The first printing was, in fact, only 70 copies; it was an experiment. Then I saw that the concept resonated with readers and we increased the print runs.

Right now, my life is chaotic. I have interviews in five countries, packed schedules of events in France and Spain. But this is a great opportunity and, although it's fun, it's serious too. Play is not a trivial thing: If we don't play, then what are we living for? We are in a dark historical moment; we need to reinvent how we exist.

When El País learned that the philosopher and coauthor of this book wasn't real, they decided to remove their review of the book from their website. If the thesis of the book is valid and it contributes to an important debate, why delete it instead of contextualizing it? Do you think this reflects our inability to handle the ambiguity between fiction and truth in the age of AI?

I understand that fear. Journalism is under attack, and many media outlets act out of fear of damaging their credibility. Their first instinct is to attack something they see as an “impostor” and erase all traces of it. It's an understandable reaction, even necessary in some cases, because we must protect journalists. They are crucial to uncovering the truth and restoring trust in experts. But the mistake that El País made was not taking the time to understand the context. For example, they talked about the EU's AI Act, but in 2023 I attended the [State of the European Union], and I listened to Ursula von der Leyen [president of the European Commission]. She admitted that tech moves faster than regulation, and that legislating is complex because innovation doesn't wait. El País could have gone deeper into that. Instead of deleting the review, they could have created something more nuanced along the lines of “Yes, the author is fictional, but his analysis of AI is relevant because ...”

However, I understand why the media acted as they did: They played it safe. The problem is that's not the smartest solution. The smart thing would be to open dialogues, to accept that nobody knows everything about AI. It is a huge and changing field and we should encourage curiosity as a driving force. People are exhausted and scared, but curiosity generates energy. We need more complex discourses, not simplifications driven by fear.

The game, if you will, behind the book exposes a paradox: Readers connected to the fictional philosopher despite knowing he was a creation and not a real person. Doesn't this demonstrate that, in the age of AI, we crave believable stories more than real facts?

I don't know. We'll see how the public reacts now that they know the book is more complex than it first appeared. Before, readers were drawn to it thanks to its interesting theories; now they face two challenges: to discover the real structure of the text—perhaps not until they reach the end—and to approach it with the knowledge that the “author” is not a conventional one. I have read articles in Italian media that embody an absurd contradiction. They engage deeply with the research, but then the headlines reduce the book to its most sensational element: “The Philosopher Who Is an AI Creation.” But no, it's not that the AI wrote this book, it's an investigation into ideas of authorship and truth. I know it's hard to sum it up in a headline, but we should take a few minutes to reflect on it. Otherwise, we feed a tendency to simplify ideas and sow mistrust. We have a huge responsibility to readers.

A possible more nuanced headline could be “An AI Philosopher or a Reflection of Our Times?” But instead we prefer the easy click. Our world now revolves around the immediate reward even when we should encourage slower pursuits—meditation and productive boredom. As Walter Benjamin said: “Boredom is the dream bird that hatches the egg of experience.” You have to sit on the egg and wait for it to hatch.

Do you see other similar collaborations with AI in the future or was this a one-time thing, a way of questioning what it means to be an author in our time?

I'll continue to publish works as Jianwei Xun—he's a bridge between the human and AI—but it won't be my only voice. It would be dangerous to start thinking that I can only express myself through algorithms. I need to write with and without AI, because I must preserve my ability to dive into myself without intermediaries. Not everyone sees it right now, but in a year or two we will understand the risks of this moment. We are on the verge of losing the ability to think and live without technological dependence. The paradox is that AI itself, used properly, can be an antidote. It's like a fire that, when it burns in a controlled way, warms us but doesn't harm us.

When readers discover that this “philosopher” is, in fact, a fusion of AI and human thought, many say they are puzzled and even disappointed. What would you tell them about the value of this hybrid creation? How should they read the book once they know it's true structure?

It's a fascinating question, because it's not about percentages—Jianwei Xun is not 30 percent AI and 70 percent human, for example. Jianwei Xun is the name I use when I engage with artificial intelligence. It's an identity where the human and the algorithmic merge without any clear boundaries. I'd tell readers to enjoy the journey and allow yourself to be amazed, because a sense of being amazed is what we lack today. As Plato said in The Theaetetus, philosophy is born from thaumazein, a Greek word that means both wonder or amazement and terror. This is precisely our historical moment: It is terrible in two different senses of the word—terrifying and awesome. It's not a matter of blind optimism, insisting that it's sunny even when it's raining, but of choosing how to look. It's choosing to see beyond the abyss, knowing that we may be lost, but we are not alone.

True freedom—and our defense against manipulation—lies in actively choosing to embrace mystery and the unknown, even when it is scary. Only then will technology become a bridge and not a prison.

What do you see as the future of philosophy in the age of AI, and why do you think it's urgent that we reflect on these issues now?

The future of philosophy is found in the cracks between what we might call “normality.” Intersectional feminism has taught us that all truth has layers—not only in the struggle around gender, but in every aspect of reality. And yet we continue to pretend that there are pure bodies, minds, and ideas.

One last thing: We have been measuring intelligence with our own yardstick for centuries, ignoring that forests have memories and octopuses dream. Meanwhile, AI infiltrates our refrigerators and the locks on our homes as stealthily as some modern trickster god. It is the myth of Thoth revived: Plato warned that writing, that “poison of memory,” would make us sages only on paper. Today, AI repeats the paradox: It promises knowledge while emptying the act of knowing of its meaning. The trick is to do as Plato did and use this poison as an antidote. Criticize the machine from the machine, write about writing, and think against thought. In the end, the coming philosophy will not be a refuge, but a spur. It is something that will wake us up from the technocratic dream with more pointed questions than those posed by any algorithm.

News about Android is being relegated to a side show at Google's annual developer conference, Google I/O, next month. On Monday, the company announced it would share information about the latest updates coming to the Android ecosystem at an upcoming virtual event called “The Android Show: I/O Edition,” airing on May 13. 

The decision to move the Android portion of Google I/O to its own separate event ahead of the start of I/O suggests this year's developer conference could be even more AI heavy than usual. AI news and updates were already taking up an increasingly longer portion of the Google I/O consumer and developer keynote addresses.

Google, however, is framing this shift differently.

Instead, the company says there were “so many new things to share” about Android that it chose to create a special event — an I/O edition of its Android Show video podcast — as another way to share the latest news and changes. It also notes that Android will continue to have a presence at I/O in keynotes and technical sessions for developers.

Still, moving a bulk of the Android news to a virtual show ahead of the main event is a notable programming change for the developer conference. Whether that's because there's “too much news” or because Google decided Android's news didn't require as high a billing as in previous years remains to be seen.

An update by Intel to the perfmon platform has added support for upcoming Panther Lake CPUs, listing their core architecture codenames and CPUID, via InstLatX64. This commit unofficially confirms that Panther Lake will employ Cougar Cove Performance (P) cores, while Darkmont will serve to power its Efficiency (E), and likely Low Power Efficiency (LPE) cores as well. Panther Lake is expected to launch later this year, succeeding current-generation Arrow Lake U/H offerings.

With Intel's flagship 18A in risk production, Panther Lake is scheduled for mass production later this year. Hence, it wouldn't be surprising if the bulk of Panther Lake arrives in Q1 next year, similar to how Meteor Lake rolled out. Make no mistake: Panther Lake isn't a successor to Lunar Lake, which was uniquely focused on efficiency as a one-off product, with on-package memory, limited TDP, and a power-optimized design. Current rumors indicate Panther Lake variants will sport up to 18 hybrid cores (6P+8E+4LPE) and 12 Xe cores, based on Intel's upcoming Celestial (Xe3) graphics architecture.

Intel positions Panther Lake as combining Arrow Lake's power and Lunar Lake's efficiency, but that's still a somewhat general claim. According to leaks, most Panther Lake systems will include traditional SODIMM/soldered memory, while some laptop designs might even support next-gen LPCAMM, combining fast and upgradeable RAM. Based on their TDP (rumored: up to 64W), Panther Lake chips are expected to power a wide range of devices, including entry-level laptops, handhelds, and gaming laptops. The company is even eying bringing this architecture to automobiles.

An Intel engineer has pushed an update to the lookup table for perfmon, adding Panther Lake as a supported architecture. Panther Lake has been marked with the "GenuineIntel-6-CC" identifier, assigning it to CPU Family 6, Model 204 (0xCC). In addition, the patch reports the Cougar Cove and Darkmont architectures for Panther Lake's Performance (P) and Efficiency (E) cores, respectively.

Intel's speculated P-core evolution goes from Lion Cove (ARL/LNL) to Cougar Cove (PTL/WCL), and then Coyote Cove (NVL). Likewise, the rumored E-core path is Skymont (ARL/LNL) to Darkmont (PTL/WCL) and Arctic Wolf (NVL). Once again, these are based on preliminary assumptions and a compilation of several leaks, so take them with a heavy dose of skepticism.

Essentially, we're seeing a full architectural jump and shift to a leading-edge node, which should yield substantial performance gains. I'm curious to see how much Panther Lake laptops will cost compared to Lunar Lake, which was entirely manufactured by TSMC. With Computex just weeks away, we expect Intel to share finer architectural details at the show.

PC cooling mainstay Scythe has officially announced the shutdown of its European division due to ongoing financial difficulties. The move comes just days after the company entered provisional insolvency proceedings, leading to a restructuring of its distribution and customer support channels across the region.

In an official statement sent to Tom's Hardware, Scythe confirmed that it will cease operations under Scythe EU GmbH effective immediately. However, the company reassured that Scythe-branded products and customer service will remain available in Europe through its network of distributors and online e-commerce platforms.

The company acknowledged that during this transitional phase, there could be some “unfinished matters,” which likely refers to potential service delays or ongoing warranty claims. Apologizing for any inconvenience to customers, Scythe also added that it will continue to uphold the principles of "responsibility and integrity," by protecting customer rights in accordance with the law.



For now, if you are looking for Scythe products in Europe, you should still be able to purchase them through offline and online retail stores. However, it's worth noting that even before the announcement, Scythe products were seemingly available in limited quantities in Germany, as suggested by Computer Base.

After-sales service will be routed through the company's international support teams. Customers who need assistance with existing Scythe products are advised to reach out via the company's official support emails or its Facebook page. Meanwhile, Scythe's operations in Europe will now be handled through its Japan, USA, and Taiwan divisions.

The closure follows earlier reports from Germany where Scythe EU GmbH was placed under provisional insolvency proceedings. According to the Consumer Protection Forum, the district court in Reinbek initiated the proceedings to safeguard the company's assets as it faced increasing financial strain. The insolvency phase typically allows a few months for auditing and restructuring, but Scythe has ultimately opted to shut down its European division altogether.

Scythe has long been a respected name in the PC cooling market, earning praise for its price-to-performance ratio and reliable designs. However, the closure sheds some light on the growing pressure of smaller hardware manufacturers that are struggling to stay afloat amid escalating production costs, global supply chain disruptions, and stiff competition, particularly from cheaper Chinese alternatives.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

A classic springtime storm setup could unleash dangerous weather across the Upper Midwest today, including damaging tornadoes, large hail, and strong winds, according to forecasters at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center (SPC).

The SPC has issued a Moderate Risk—its second-highest threat level—for parts of southern Minnesota, northern Iowa, and western Wisconsin. Thunderstorms are expected to fire up in the late afternoon and continue into the evening, bringing with them all the ingredients for a regional severe weather outbreak.

“The most dangerous period is likely during the late afternoon and evening,” the SPC warned in its latest forecast, “when strong tornado potential should be maximized.” Warm, moist air is surging northward ahead of a sharp dryline—the boundary between moist and drier area along which storms form.

An incoming jet streak—fast winds high in the atmosphere—will supercharge developing storms. The greatest risk for severe storms is in the Upper Midwest, but by the mid-afternoon thunderstorms may break out as far south as Texas. However, the only area with a moderate risk is a 56,152-square-mile (145,433 square kilometer) area comprising the Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin border, an area populated by about 5.6 million people.

The greatest threats from the system are supercells capable of producing intense tornadoes, large hail (think golf balls and bigger), and damaging gusts of wind.

The threat isn't just confined to the Midwest. Farther south, from central Oklahoma into parts of Texas, another round of supercells could form along the dryline. These storms will also carry a risk of large hail, particularly in the evening hours, the NWS bulletin stated.

If you're in the affected area—especially where the worst weather is expected—keep track of updates from your local National Weather Service station. This is the kind of day where conditions can change fast—it costs nothing to be prepared, and its value can be priceless.

The world has a trash problem. The amount of stuff we throw away is expected to nearly double, to 3.8 billion metric tons, by 2050. Reducing what we use would go a long way to addressing the issue, but let's face it, we're not very good at buying less either.

That leaves recycling, which has its own problems. People routinely try to recycle dirty yogurt cups or toss plastic in the aluminum bin. It all makes recycling more expensive because, ultimately, someone has to manually pick out the unwanted stuff.

In response, several companies have been building automated systems to sort recyclables, including Glacier, a 6-year-old company that has developed inexpensive robotic arms controlled by computer vision to identify over 30 different types of materials. 

The startup has deployed its robots in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, Phoenix, and now Seattle.

As Glacier looks to expand its robot fleet to more municipalities, it recently raised a $16 million Series A, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. 

The round was led by Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from AlleyCorp, Alumni Ventures, Amazon Climate Pledge Fund, Cox Exponential, Elysium, New Enterprise Associates, One Small Planet, Overlap Holdings, Overture, VSC Ventures, and Working Capital Fund. 

Materials recovery facilities — or MRFs, as sorting facilities are called — are getting squeezed on both ends, Rebecca Hu-Thrams, Glacier's co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. Governments want more waste to be recycled, but MRFs are having a hard time finding enough people to staff the sorting line.

Industry-wide, turnover is extremely high. A typical MRF will have to hire five times per year for a single sorting position. The job is so undesirable that one MRF operator told Hu-Thrams that, even though his wages were higher, he was concerned about losing workers to a new warehouse set to open nearby.

“Would you rather stand at a conveyor belt and sort through people's trash, or would you rather be lifting boxes in an air-conditioned warehouse?” Hu-Thrams said. “That kind of underscores the dilemma that a lot of our customers are facing.”

Glacier offers its robots to customers as outright purchases or on a lease-to-own model. It encourages MRFs to make repairs they feel comfortable with, supplying them with training and spare parts. For those that would rather not, the startup offers maintenance packages.

Glacier is also offering a data product, in which MRFs and other stakeholders like consumer products companies and government agencies can pay for access to insights about the waste stream. For an MRF, that might mean identifying where on a line it's losing valuable aluminum cans to the landfill. For a company or regulator, it might mean auditing the waste stream to determine whether packaging that's designed to be recycled is actually getting recycled.

With enough robots, recycling rates should improve, if only because robots are faster and better at distinguishing between recyclables and trash.

“Every time we send people to audit our AI systems, the people just do so much worse,” said Areeb Malik, Glacier's CTO and second co-founder. “AI is getting really powerful, being able to distinguish beyond what people can even notice.”

Who doesn't love bringing the party with them? If you're the type of person who likes to liven things up wherever you go, the JBL PartyBox was undoubtedly made for you. It's a portable speaker that's massive and unique enough to get the crowds going and the music thumping no matter where you go. And while it's usually pretty pricey, it's on sale thanks to Amazon right now, so you can get it for a much more reasonable price than you normally would.

See at Amazon

You can get the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 for $475, which is down from its normal price of $600. That's $125 off and a discount of 21%. This is a limited time deal only too, so you'll have to act fast if you want to get one.

This lavish speaker gives you everything you pay for, especially at a discount. It has two 6.5-inch woofers that give you deep bass and crisp treble, even when you play them loudly, thanks to 25mm dome tweeters. Those give you your higher tones. It's loud and its sound travels enough to make sure you can fill the space of a tennis court with music or whatever other sound you're interested in.

Connect to your Bluetooth music source and you can get the party going, with up to 18 hours of battery supported per charge. You can even swap out the replacement battery and keep going if things happen to falter. Plus, one 10 minute fast charge will net you 2 additional hours of battery, so if this thing is something you use a lot, that replacement battery, which is sold separately, will undoubtedly come in handy more than a few times.

Beyond its audio functions, this portable speaker also comes equipped with some fun lights and other effects. It can glow a variety of rainbow colors in addition to putting on light trails, creating starry lights, and strobe effects. All of them sync up to your music, too. That gives you a leg up on the competition if you want to be the most dynamic party host you can be, and it's all built in to the same machine.

This is the best addition for just about any party you could need, or a celebration, or just hanging out at someone's house. And it's available at an all-time low price right now, so be sure to grab yours while you can.

When all smartphones are huge slabs that look like iPhones, tech companies really need to go hard with eye-catching designs. Carl Pei's Nothing has been turning heads with its transparent phones and wireless earbuds since 2021, and last year the company's sub-brand, CMF, surprised everyone with its unapologetically plastic and modular Phone 1.

The fact that I can't remember a damn thing about the Phone 1's tech specs but vividly recall how fun it was to unscrew the back plate to install a card case, kickstand, and neck lanyard should tell you what CMF prioritized for the budget phone.

Nearly a year later, CMF is back with the Phone 2 Pro. I've only had the device for a weekend, so not enough time for a full review, but you can expect it on Gizmodo in the coming days. CMF beefed up the specs—a slightly faster processor, higher-resolution cameras including telephoto and ultra-wide lenses, more battery life— and even added the physical Essential button for accessing what's basically an AI memory that was introduced on the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro. But I feel like the Phone 2 Pro has lost some of the modular charm that made the Phone 1 so memorable.

The first thing I did after unboxing the Phone 2 Pro was see which of CMF's official Phone 1 accessories worked. Both the kickstand and the neck lanyard screwed into the Phone 2 Pro's round wheel without issue. However, the card case wallet, which requires attaching a special magnetic plate that also secures into the round wheel, didn't. And because the Phone 2 Pro's back is sealed and no longer removable, any Phone 1 back plate “cases” aren't compatible, either. 

If you own extra Phone 1 back plates or the card case wallet, you're shit out of luck. It's not completely bad news… if you own a 3D printer. Thanks to CMF retaining the four easily removable screws, you can still design and 3D print your own accessories or buy them from makers off marketplaces like Etsy. I wouldn't be surprised if the flourishing DIY community is why CMF is breaking compatibility with some Phone 1 accessories so soon.

The Phone 2 Pro is a decent-looking phone that feels solid—refreshingly lightweight (185g) and thin (7.8mm) compared to other phones with a similar-sized display. The screen is more than bright enough, and Nothing OS 3.2 (Android 15) is responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. 

Nothing sent me the light green that you see in these photos. It has a satin-like sheen when viewed at different angles. But the phone also comes in white, black, and orange. The latter has a two-tone design that looks the best of the lot, in my opinion. 

As I mentioned earlier, the Phone 2 Pro is more powerful under the hood—it's just all very incremental. The display is a slightly larger 6.77-inch AMOLED versus the Phone 1's 6.6-inch screen, the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro 5G chip is 10% more powerful, and even though the battery capacity is the same 5,000mAh, CMF says it should last an extra hour.

The most noteworthy upgrade is the rear cameras. Whereas the Phone 1 had a single 50-megapixel main camera (and a controversial and mostly useless 2-megapixel “depth camera”), the Phone 2 Pro has a proper no-bullshit triple-lens camera system consisting of a 50-megapixel f/1.88 main lens, a 50-megapixel f/1.85 telephoto lens, and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide lens. Photo and video quality will have to wait until I can snap enough photos to make an evaluation, but at the very least, you can get more zoom reach and a wider field of view in your shots.

I admit I wasn't expecting to find the Essential key below the right-side power button. I thought Nothing would gatekeep it for its more expensive phones, but perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised, since Nothing plans to charge a subscription to use the AI feature in the near future. Gotta get the button onto as many phones as possible if you wanna turn it into a subscription business!

Currently, the button works exactly like it does on the mid-range Nothing Phone (3a) and (3a) Pro devices. Press it once to take a screenshot, to which you can then add a text note or attach a voice recording for additional context. Press and hold the Essential key, and you're taken to the Essential Space, where all your screenshots live, but also where generative AI organizes and helps make sense of all those captures. The AI might offer a summary of text or describe photos, create calendar events or reminders, transcribe voice memos, or make task suggestions. It's a nifty idea for a “second brain” or “memory recall” function where you can just dump everything into the Essential Space and let AI sort it all out, but its usefulness is pretty limited right now. There isn't even a way to search your screenshots (yet).

For a budget phone, the CMF Phone 2 Pro packs in a lot while still keeping some modularity. Nothing's primarily targeting India and Europe with this phone: £219 in the UK, €249 in Europe, and ₹18,999 for 8GB of RAM + 128GB of storage. A Phone 2 Pro with the same RAM and twice the storage (256GB) will go for £249 in the UK, €279 in Europe, and ₹20,999 in India. Like always, U.S. consumers can get the 8GB RAM + 256GB storage model—the only variant shipping to America—through Nothing's Beta program for $279.

CMF is also selling several official Phone 2 Pro accessories, and for some reason, exclusively and in limited quantities in the UK and Europe. There's a “universal cover” for attaching other accessories (£25 / €25), interchangeable fisheye and macro lenses (£35 / €35), and a wallet/stand ( £35 / €35). There will also be two bundles: one with a cover and choice of wallet/stand or lenses for £45 / €45, and another with a cover and both the wallet/stand and lenses for £65 / €65. You'll have to convert the currency yourself if you plan to import them, since they won't be available in the U.S. or India. I've not tried any of these accessories, so your guess is as good as mine as to how good they are. Pre-orders start today, April 28, and official sales directly from Nothing and select retailers on May 6.

The thing I like most about OLED gaming monitors is how consistent they are in performance. In my experience so far, I have yet to find a bad one. They all deliver a crisp bright image with deep blacks and saturated color, in QHD or UHD resolution.

With so many monitors nearly identical in gaming feel and appearance, how is one to choose? Dough stands out with its choice of Gorilla Glass for the front layer of the screen. Other OLEDs do with shiny plastic, which is fine, but the optical properties of glass are superior. The image is extremely sharp, perceived contrast is higher and color is a bit livelier.

Dough takes it even further with unmatched performance and tweakability. Made to compete with the best gaming monitors, the Spectrum Black 32, delivers Ultra HD resolution in a 32-inch panel fronted by Gorilla Glass. It also boasts a 240 Hz refresh rate with a 480 Hz FHD mode for even faster response and lower input lag.

A premium panel renders HDR highlights of 1,000 nits and color covers nearly 100% of DCI-P3. Video processing includes Adaptive-Sync, blur reduction and many options for adjustment. Let's take a look.

The Spectrum Black 32's OLED panel includes two standout features. First is the Gorilla Glass which has a visible effect on the image. It's extremely crisp thanks to the glass's optical purity. And perceived contrast is greater. The picture truly pops, even when compared to other premium OLEDs. This is a difficult thing to quantify as there are no scientific tests to confirm it. But in a side-by-side comparison, Gorilla Glass adds something extra that can easily be seen. It is shiny but a coating, like what's found on camera lenses, cuts down on reflections.

The second is MLA+ technology. MLA stands for Micro Lens Array, and it is literally an array of tiny lenses placed in front of the OLED layer. It's there to increase light output and the Spectrum Black 32 has that in abundance. Dough claims 1,000 nits for a 3% window pattern. I measured over 700 nits for a 25% window which is about 40% more light than most of the 32-inch UHD OLEDs I've reviewed. Only Asus' PG32UCDP comes close.

The only thing the Spectrum Black 32 does not have is a Quantum Dot layer. That's why DCI-P3 coverage is around 95%. While this is far from a deal breaker, it is possible to buy an OLED that covers nearly 110% if it's the Alienware AW3225QF. The Dough is certainly colorful, but a few others are more so. It is extremely accurate though. Dough calibrates each sample at the factory and mine measured within a whisker of perfect in its Display P3 and sRGB modes. Full calibration can be accomplished with the included gamma presets and color temps.

For brightness control, you get a fixed option where the output level remains the same regardless of content, plus two levels of variable brightness. HDR also has two options for its luminance curve called Accurate and Maximum.

Gaming is the Spectrum Black 32's primary skill and to that end, Dough has covered every possible base with video processing options. There's anti-flicker as well as blur reduction via black frame insertion. You also get a 480 Hz mode that runs at FHD resolution. Motion is blur-free at 240 Hz, but you'll need a stout video card to hit that frame rate in Ultra HD. As you'll soon see, the Spectrum Black 32 at 480 Hz is the fastest monitor I've ever tested.

Physically, the Spectrum Black 32 sports solid build quality but not much else. I got the version without a USB hub, and there are no internal speakers or LED lights. There is a USB-C port but it's only for firmware updates. The video inputs are DisplayPort 1.4 with DSC and HDMI 2.1 with full bandwidth (24Gbps).

The Spectrum Black 32 is not a small purchase. The panel as tested is $1,100 plus another $99 for the stand. The top model adds USB and DisplayPort 2.1 for $1,300. You can save a few bucks and get the matte screen model with no USB for $900.

I've reviewed many OLEDs and upon receiving the Spectrum Black 32, I noted that its carton is smaller than typical. Granted, only the panel and an external power supply are inside, but there isn't a whole lot surrounding it.

There is no crumbly foam, which is a good thing, but the panel is protected only by cardboard. My sample arrived safely with the stand in a separate box. There are no video cables, only the power supply, and a calibration data sheet.

The Spectrum Black 32's flush bezel is super narrow, just 8mm around the top and sides and 12mm at the bottom. There's no room for a logo here which improves the perception of an image that floats in front of the user. The controls are under the front center and consist of a tiny joystick, lighted power toggle and a function key that can be programmed by the user.

Styling is as simple as it gets with the OLED panel's 6mm thickness grafted onto a component bulge. The total depth is 39mm (1.5 inches) making the Spectrum Black 32 thinner than most 32-inch monitors. If you'd rather use an arm, there's a 100mm VESA mount in the back but you'll need to provide your own fasteners.

The stand is relatively solid with a thin upright that's barely visible from the front. It features a generous 5.1-inch height adjustment plus 23 degrees tilt and a 90-degree portrait mode. Movements are firm but there is a bit of wobble at the base. The portrait mode has firm detents so you can get the panel level easily.

The ports face backwards and include two HDMI 2.1 (24 Gbps) and a single DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC). A USB-C port is also included but it is only for service. For an extra $200, you can get the Spectrum Black 32 with a DisplayPort 2.1, two HDMI 2.1, three USB-C and two USB-A ports. There are no internal speakers, but there is a 3.5mm headphone jack.

The Spectrum Black 32's OSD is loaded with every conceivable option for video processing and image adjustment. Terminology is simple and direct which is refreshing. There is a lot to see here so let's dive in

Pressing the joystick brings up the OSD which always shows signal info at the top and context-sensitive help at the bottom. First up is Input/Output and it is more than just a selector. You can change the port versions, access PIP and PBP and adjust the audio volume to the headphone jack.

In the Gaming menu are the crosshair and frame counter options. You can put them in multiple positions and make them any color you like. Also here is a Black Equalizer which enhances shadow detail by raising the black levels.

The Picture menu has four image modes termed by their color gamuts. The Spectrum Black 32 accurately renders sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3 and Display P3. DCI stands for Digital Cinema Initiative, and it is different from Display P3 in its color temp and gamma, which Dough gets right. If you need a post-production monitor for color grading, the Spectrum Black 32 is fully qualified.

This menu also has Brightness Control which affects how light output is managed according to content. Uniform means the level never changes. In fact, the brightness slider does not affect output in this mode, it's set at 200 nits although you can lower the contrast slider if you want to reduce brightness. Tempered and Standard modulate output to make highlights pop more. I found the most dynamic image in Tempered and even though it shifts with content, it maintains accurate gamma.

The Spectrum Black 32 is extremely accurate out of the box but if you want to tweak, there are four fixed color temps and gamma presets too. In HDR mode, you get Accurate and Maximum Brightness options. I'll tell you more about those on page five.

Video processing options are found in the Performance menu and there are many. Anti-flicker comes in low and high settings and reduces any artifacts associated with changes in frame rate. I had no need for this thanks to a GeForce RTX 4090 that can run Ultra HD at 240fps. But if you run variable frame rates, it is a useful tool to keep the action smooth. You can also reduce blur with black frame insertion and its minimum strobe frequency slider. Frame rates over 200 won't benefit from this option because they're blur-free already.

The big one here is Dual-mode. The Spectrum Black 32 can run at 480 Hz in FHD resolution for a major bump in speed. You'll see on the next page what a difference that makes. The caveat is that it takes several seconds for the monitor to reset. Decide which mode you'll use before starting a game for best results.

Rather than task-oriented picture modes, Dough simply includes three user memories which can be set however you'd like. You can also reset the Spectrum Black 32 back to factory specs here.

The OSD menu includes programming for the four joystick directions and the extra control key. It makes accessing commonly used functions a one-press affair. The Custom button is handy for switching refresh modes.

The Spectrum Black 32 has a huge array of care options like logo detection, pixel orbiter and the like. You can also run refresh routines to balance pixel use. I turned all of them off for testing, but I recommend using the Screen shift and occasionally running OLED wear compensation. I've never seen burn-in on any OLED in my possession including a five-year-old LG TV and a computer monitor that is used many hours per day.

The Spectrum Black 32 uses color gamuts as the basis for its picture modes. If you want maximum color for all content, go with Display P3. It has the correct 2.2 gamma and D65 color temp and needs no further adjustment. sRGB offers the same accuracy with the smaller gamut. Adobe RGB is completely usable for photographers. And DCI-P3 correctly renders the cinema version of that standard with a 6300K color temp and 2.6 gamma.

Calibration is possible in any mode, but I could not improve upon the out-of-box results. The choices are, therefore, brightness level and color spec. I stuck with Display P3 for everything with Brightness Control on Tempered, the most aggressive variable brightness setting. It renders the most dynamic image. If you pick Uniform, it maintains constant brightness around 200 nits. There, you can only lower the light level with the contrast slider. Here are my settings:

For more control of the light level, choose Standard where you can dial it down to 2 nits if you like. Here are the brightness settings:

Upon setting up the Spectrum Black 32, my first task was to update the firmware. Dough has posted several versions over the past few months and the latest is 1.0.14. The monitor is fussy about its USB-C interface and requires a thumb drive formatted to FAT32 and smaller than 32GB in size. I opted for the RealTek updater which Dough provides files for. This is done with a cable connection to a PC, and you need to plug it into the backplane, not a port on the case. The upside is that HDR becomes brighter and more accurate, so the update is well worth doing.

There are some considerations when preparing the Spectrum Black 32 for optimal gaming performance. The best scenario is to have a fast video card like a GeForce RTX 4090. Then you can run in Ultra HD at 240 Hz and get smooth motion with low input lag. If you run below 200 fps, the Black frame insertion option with Minimum strobe frequency at 75 keeps blur at bay with only minimal light output reduction.

For Dual-mode, make sure Black frame insertion is turned off and Adaptive-Sync is on. Engage the option, then visit Nvidia control panel, if running G-Sync, and set the refresh rate to 480 Hz. My PC did this automatically but yours might not. You only need to do this once, then you can switch back and forth with a button press. I programmed the extra control key for this. Make the switch from the Windows desktop. If you do it in game, the title may crash requiring a visit to the Task Manager or a restart. With these things done, I settled in for some very enjoyable gaming sessions.

I have played on every type of gaming monitor available using all manner of screen tech, refresh rates, video processing options, sizes and shapes. I still maintain that there is nothing that is more fun to play on than a fast OLED. The image quality is easy to quantify, just look at the test results. But the feel factor is something that must be experienced. The Spectrum Black 32 and its competitors are incredibly fast and smooth. And nothing delivers clarity on the level of an Ultra HD screen at 240 Hz.

If you're considering this monitor, I urge you to pair it with a fast video card. Only something like a GeForce RTX 4090 will match the Spectrum Black 32's potential. If you can do this, it is a true weapon. You'll see on the next page that it is one of the fastest Ultra HD monitors available. And at 480 Hz, it is the fastest monitor I've ever tested.

The FHD 480 Hz mode has pluses and minuses. On the plus side, it is incredibly fast and smooth. You will never see motion blur and input lag is essentially non-existent. On the downside, it's FHD resolution from a 32-inch 16:9 panel. That means 69ppi. And as good as the Spectrum Black 32's picture is, you will see the reduced clarity. In my gaming universe, I would not use this mode since I can run UHD at 220-240fps. But for competitors needing every possible edge, it is a great option.

Apart from gaming, the Spectrum Black 32 is a superb display for all uses. SDR content looks best when Brightness control is set to Tempered. That delivers plenty of bright highlights without any harsh midtones that would cause viewing fatigue. I set 200 nits peak using a 25% window and never felt a need to lower the brightness or contrast sliders. If you want uniform brightness, that's available and you can control output with the contrast control.

Color in every case was superb. The Spectrum Black 32 comes with a properly executed factory calibration and I could not improve upon it. I used the Display P3 and sRGB modes interchangeably and saw a perfect image in all scenarios.

Ergonomically, I appreciated the tall stand that let me set the panel high with my eyepoint at center screen. Build quality is solid and the Spectrum Black 32 has a premium feel when navigating the OSD or adjusting its position. I didn't mourn the lack of USB ports but if you need them, Dough has a version with lots of connectivity available.

I also enjoyed the enhanced clarity and depth provided by the Gorilla Glass front layer. Though I can't quantify its benefits with tests, it compares favorably with other OLED screens in a side-by-side comparison. The Spectrum Black 32 costs a bit more than some 32-inch OLEDs but it's the only one with Gorilla Glass.

Takeaway: The Spectrum Black 32 is the quickest monitor I've ever tested. Not only do the test results on the next page support this but I could feel and see it when I played Doom Eternal and other familiar titles. Though my skills are not at competition level, I can't imagine any pro player not wanting to add this monitor to their toolkit.

On top of that, it delivers perfect out of box accuracy and a stunning image suitable for any task from word processing and web browsing to pro-level video post production and color grading. There is nothing the Spectrum Black 32 cannot do well.

The use of 3GB GDDR7 memory could help Nvidia add more VRAM to its GPUs.

It has only been a few months since Nvidia officially announced its RTX 50-series graphics cards, but rumors are already pointing to a potential Super series refresh. According to a post on the Chiphell forums, a hit-and-miss source for hardware leaks, Nvidia might already be working on an RTX 5080 Super with 24GB and an RTX 5070 Super with 16GB of VRAM.

The key enabler behind these rumored memory configurations is said to be Nvidia's use of 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. These modules essentially allow for more flexible VRAM amounts than the traditional 8GB or 16GB increments. By leveraging 3GB chips, Nvidia can gain the ability to offer configurations like 18GB (6×3GB) and 24GB (8×3GB) VRAM for its desktop class GPUs without making any major PCB redesigns.

This can also help Nvidia make refreshes or upgraded versions (like the aforementioned Super variants) easier to deliver without changing much hardware or firmware. With the higher amount of VRAM, these graphics cards will potentially have the ability to handle larger textures at higher resolutions, and more complex scenes with fewer performance drops.

Before this raises any expectations, it's important to note that there's currently no official confirmation from Nvidia, and these rumors should be treated as entertaining speculation. Given how early it is in the RTX 50-series lifecycle, a refresh at this moment seems unusual, but is not entirely out of the question.

Prior to the launch of the RTX 50-series, there were similar reports around Nvidia's plans to use 3GB GDDR7 memory modules. It was also speculated that the RTX 5080 would arrive in a special 24GB VRAM flavor. However, the company ended up using conventional 2GB memory chips, possibly due to higher costs. Notably, these 3GB modules are being used for Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell GPUs, as well as the laptop variant of the RTX 5090 which comes with 24GB of VRAM with a 256-bit memory interface.

While the discussion around these models is still at a very preliminary stage, it is possible that Nvidia is experimenting internally or possibly working on contingency plans. Although, we don't expect Nvidia to bring a Super refresh for the RTX 50-series as soon as Computex 2025, for example, they would more likely arrive late in 2025 or even for CES 2026.

For now, though, it would be best to view the RTX 5080 Super and RTX 5070 Super as interesting possibilities rather than inevitable products. We'll be watching closely for any reliable updates or official hints from Nvidia in the coming months.

EliteBook is HP's business laptop brand—“real power for real work”—and a quick peek at the price reveals a fairly universal truth about business-focused hardware: It's more expensive than consumer-grade gear. Considerably so. With a $2,429 MSRP (though already discounted to $1,999), the EliteBook Ultra G1i is the priciest laptop I've tested in over a year, except for Apple's MacBook Pro, which had its specs blown out.

The EliteBook Ultra G1i has relatively tame tech under the hood, a modest configuration that would barely merit a raised eyebrow amongst its Windows competitors. So what are you getting for that outsized outlay?

The big sell is security: HP Wolf Security for Business adds several extra layers of protection on top of existing anti-malware features, and it's hard not to notice them right away. For example, one feature of Wolf emerges when you attempt to install any software. Wolf pops up to alert you if the software is not on its authorized list (nothing was, during my tests), and asks if you really want to install it. It's similar to Microsoft's User Access Control system, except you can't bypass this through the Control Panel.

Additional features of Wolf Security include anti-phishing protection, a BIOS tamper-prevention feature, Windows OS hardening/resilience features, and much more, with extras geared toward IT fleet management. I tested as many of the security features as I could and was impressed that they were wholly effective at blocking any of the bad stuff I could turn up. Much of this is overkill for the consumer, but if your business needs this kind of protection and added manageability, well, you probably already know it.

Beyond all that, there's the actual hardware, which is buttoned up. Matte black, with curved corners but generally crisp edges, nothing about the design will surprise any user who's worked on a corporate laptop in the last decade, save perhaps for the screen, which opens to a lie-flat 180 degrees. The magnesium cover has a moderate amount of give, but the thinness does help keep weight down to a svelte 2.6 pounds, and thickness at 19 mm.

Specs are not bare-bones but are far from luxe; the 14-inch touchscreen has a 2,880 x 1,800-pixel resolution, and the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 268V CPU. That's a few steps up from the basic processor model, but still a step down from higher-end options you typically find at this price. The 32 GB of RAM is fair, but the 512-GB solid-state drive feels chintzy for the money, though perhaps that's an acknowledgement that most business users will be leaning heavily on cloud or server-based storage instead. Ports are acceptable: three USB-C with USB4 support and a single USB-A port (with a flip-down cover). You'll need one of those USB-C ports for charging.

Given the above specs, I was surprised that performance was generally on the low side, more in keeping with a true entry-level configuration than what the G1i includes. None of the benchmarks I ran were any more impressive than I've seen on slower, cheaper machines running Intel Core Ultra 7 Series 2 processors, and many of the scores I saw were below even those uninspired levels, albeit only slightly. I suspect the overhead from the Wolf Security features is giving the unit a slight performance hit that, while not severe, may be more noticeable when putting the laptop under heavy loads.

Battery life on a full-screen YouTube playback hit just over 14 hours, a decent score, and I was impressed by the completely silent operation of the laptop; I couldn't get the fan to kick in, no matter how heavy a load I put on the device. The speakers are fine, and the screen looks good enough, but neither blew my socks off. I did appreciate the keyboard on the device, which has just enough travel and responsiveness to make for easy data entry, while also being fairly quiet. The touchpad is spacious but just short of being too large.

As with most laptops today, AI is a major focus for the EliteBook line, and HP's AI Companion, the company's own GPT-4o skin, is preinstalled on the unit. AI Companion purports to let you take fuller advantage of the onboard neural processing unit, though it requires an active internet connection to work and wasn't any faster than any online tools available. You're also getting double AI duty here, as pressing the Copilot button on the keyboard still brings up a standard Microsoft Copilot interface.

The temporary sale price of $1,999 makes the EliteBook Ultra G1i a better deal, but it still doesn't measure up on a price-to-performance basis against competing systems. It does, however, provide a much stronger value proposition for its security and manageability benefits, though again, I doubt many of these features have much utility outside of large, corporate environments.

Body mass index might be a more accurate measurement than commonly thought. New research shows that a vast majority of people with a BMI signifying obesity have substantial excess body fat.

Scientists at Johns Hopkins University conducted the study, published this month in JAMA. In a nationally representative sample of Americans, they found that adults with an obese BMI almost always met the criteria for obesity in terms of waist circumstance or body fat percentage, too. The findings suggest that BMI remains an important population-level tool for assessing obesity, the researchers say, even as many people are trying to phase it out.

The researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey of Americans' dieting and lifestyle habits regularly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As part of the NHANES, some people are given more extensive examinations, which include tests measuring their body fat or waist circumstance.

The researchers looked at the most recent NHANES data (2017-2018) that included people who received these other tests in addition to having their BMI checked. Obesity is typically defined as having a BMI 30 and over (27 for people of Asian descent). But it can also be defined by having a body fat percentage of 25% for men and 35% for women, or a waist circumstance of 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women.

More than 98% of people who were considered obese using BMI alone also fit the bill when either waist circumstance or body fat percentage were taken into account, the researchers found.

“Although certain patient populations (eg, athletes) may warrant further evaluation, our results suggest that these individuals make up a very small portion of the population,” the researchers wrote.

Say Bye to Just BMI: Experts Call for a Major Shift in How We Measure Obesity

The findings are especially relevant given recent developments in the field of obesity medicine. Earlier this January, a large group of experts called for a sizable shift in how obesity is diagnosed.

They've pushed for doctors to stop using BMI as the sole criteria for measuring obesity. Instead, they say, doctors should either use two measurements of body size (one of which can include BMI) or a direct measurement of body fat to diagnose obesity. They further called for obesity to be grouped into two broad categories, depending on whether a person's obesity is actively causing related health problems: preclinical and clinical obesity.

Other researchers and advocates in the body positivity and fat acceptance movement have long called for BMI to be phased out, and the group's conclusions were strongly backed by many public health groups, including the American Heart Association and World Obesity Federation.

The study researchers note, however, that direct body fat tests require specialized equipment and could be more expensive for patients in terms of out-of-pocket costs, and given their findings, many people might not benefit from undergoing these other tests. Either way, it seems likely that the scientific debate over the usefulness of BMI isn't quite settled yet.

“For nearly all U.S. adults with elevated BMI, there may be limited utility to confirming excess adiposity,” the authors wrote. Currently, under the current BMI criteria, around 40% of adults in the U.S. are considered obese, though the rate may be starting to finally decline, thanks in part to the arrival of newer, more effective weight loss medications like Wegovy.

Automakers are increasingly pushing consumers to accept monthly and annual fees to unlock preinstalled safety and performance features, from hands-free driving systems and heated seats to cameras that can automatically record accident situations. But the additional levels of internet connectivity this subscription model requires can increase drivers' exposure to government surveillance and the likelihood of being caught up in police investigations.

A cache of more than two dozen police records recently reviewed by WIRED show US law enforcement agencies regularly trained on how to take advantage of “connected cars,” with subscription-based features drastically increasing the amount of data that can be accessed during investigations. The records make clear that law enforcement's knowledge of the surveillance far exceeds that of the public and reveal how corporate policies and technologies—not the law—determine driver privacy.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism.

“Each manufacturer has their whole protocol on how the operating system in the vehicle utilizes telematics, mobile Wi-Fi, et cetera,” one law enforcement officer noted in a presentation prepared by the California State Highway Patrol (CHP) and reviewed by WIRED. The presentation, while undated, contains statistics on connected cars for the year 2024. “If the vehicle has an active subscription,” they add, “it does create more data.”

The CHP presentation, obtained by government transparency nonprofit Property of the People via a public records request, trains police on how to acquire data based on a variety of hypothetical scenarios, each describing how vehicle data can be acquired based on the year, make, and model of a vehicle. The presentation acknowledges that access to data can ultimately be limited due to choices made by not only vehicle manufacturers but the internet service providers on which connected devices rely.

One document notes, for instance, that when a General Motors vehicle is equipped with an active OnStar subscription, it will transmit data—revealing its location—roughly twice as often as a Ford vehicle. Different ISPs appear to have not only different capabilities but policies when it comes to responding to government requests for information. Police may be able to rely on AT&T to help identify certain vehicles based on connected devices active in the car but lack the ability to do so when the device relies on a T-Mobile or Verizon network instead.

Charlotte McCoy, a GM spokesperson, tells WIRED the company now requires a court order before handing over location data to law enforcement. “We review each request individually to assess the circumstances and the nature of the request before providing any information,” they say. “Connectivity offers many benefits—including navigation, communication, safety, and maintenance—and customers can mask their location or turn off connectivity at any time.”

Other car manufacturers listed in the CHP presentation, including Ford, did not respond to a request for comment.

“There's definitely a role being played by the companies in deciding what kind of standard they're going to insist on,” says Andrew Crocker, the surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “And this is a dynamic we've seen in other areas of tech. Google and Facebook and Apple all played a role in saying, ‘We'll only provide this data in response to a warrant; other data we'll provide in response to a subpoena.'”

When police are investigating a specific suspect, they will often use a technique known as a “ping” to geographically locate a specific device known to belong to that individual. But when canvassing near a crime scene for an unknown perpetrator, authorities commonly rely on a procedure known as a “tower dump,” requesting that ISPs cast a wider net and identify virtually any devices that have connected to a specific cell tower during a certain window of time. Police analysts can then comb through this data and attempt to identify a culprit, often using surveillance footage or witness testimony about a vehicle's color, make, or model.

Nearly all subscription-based car features rely on devices that come preinstalled in a vehicle, with a cellular connection necessary only to enable the automaker's recurring-revenue scheme. The ability of car companies to charge users to activate some features is effectively the only reason the car's systems need to communicate with cell towers. The police documents note that companies often hook customers into adopting the services through free trial offers, and in some cases the devices are communicating with cell towers even when users decline to subscribe.

In an August 2022 email, one detective noted: “In some vehicles, again [it] depends on manufacturer, the vehicle is still doing this despite the lack of an active subscription, and just sending the data back to the mother ship. This could be due to collecting user data for what the manufacturer sells it for, to providing this data to try to sell you on renewing your [subscription] package that lapsed.”

The “tower dump” technique is becoming increasingly unpopular in US courts following the US Supreme Court's acknowledgement in 2018 that location data raises significant Fourth Amendment concerns. While the Supreme Court specifically avoided addressing tower dumps in its landmark US v. Carpenter decision, a Fifth Circuit ruling last year placed the capability in great jeopardy, concluding that a warrant to “geofence” an area and collect evidence from a wide variety of individuals is inherently unconstitutional.

On the back of that decision, a federal magistrate in Mississippi ruled two months ago that tower dumps are likewise unconstitutional. While a “tower dump” and a “geofence” are not precisely the same—the latter relying on GPS coordinates obtained from internet companies such as Google, as opposed to a cell tower—the results are more or less identical: offering police a dragnet with which to accumulate vast amounts of location data on individuals, many if not most of whom are not suspected of committing a crime.

In response to the rapid changes in case law surrounding location data, Google—historically a frequent target of geofence warrants—announced technical changes to its software last year, making it effectively impossible to respond to these types of warrants.

“Location data is some of the most sensitive, revealing information that is generated by our devices, including our cars,” the EFF's Crocker says. “It's extremely revealing of obviously where you go and where you've been, but also all the people you associate with and all the things you're doing. You can paint a very clear picture of someone's life with just a list of all the places they've been in their car. The Supreme Court has made that very clear.”

The police documents reviewed by WIRED alone demonstrate the arbitrary nature of vehicle surveillance upon this shifting legal landscape, with police noting, for instance, that while Verizon will refuse to allow police to define their own radius when requesting cell tower data, its competitors impose no such limitations. Another document notes that while AT&T will conduct “pings,” locating a device in real time, it will only do so for “voice devices.”

What is also clear from the documents is that US police are aware of the control corporations have over their ability to acquire vehicle location data, expressing fears that they could abruptly decide to kill off certain capabilities at any time.

In a letter sent in April 2024 to the Federal Trade Commission, US senators Ron Wyden and Edward Markey—Democrats from Oregon and Massachusetts, respectively—noted that a range of automakers, from Toyota, Nissan, and Subaru, among others, are willing to disclose location data to the government in response to a subpoena without a court order. Volkswagen, meanwhile, had its own arbitrary rules, limiting subpoenas to fewer than seven days' worth of data. The senators noted that these policies stood in contrast to public pledges previously made by some automakers to require a warrant or court order before surrendering a customer's location data.

Automakers “differ significantly on the important issue of whether customers are ever told they were spied on,” the senators wrote. At the time of the letter, only Tesla had a policy, they said, of informing customers about legal demands. “The other car companies do not tell their customers about government demands for their data, even if they are allowed to do so.”

“We respect our customers' privacy and take our responsibility to protect their personal information seriously,” Bennet Ladyman, a T-Mobile spokesperson, says.

AT&T spokesperson Jim Kimberly says: “Like all companies, we are required by law to provide information to law enforcement and other government entities by complying with court orders, subpoenas, and other lawful discovery requests. In all cases, we review requests to determine whether they are valid. We require a search warrant based on the probable-cause standard for all government demands for real-time or historical location information, except in emergency situations. For government demands for cell tower searches, we require a probable-cause search warrant or a court order, except in emergency situations.”

Verizon did not respond to a request for comment.

“Especially now, with American civil liberties eroding rapidly, people should exercise great caution in granting new surveillance powers to law enforcement,” says Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the People.

Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, notes that the police documents reviewed by WIRED contained substantial detail about car surveillance that appear to be publicly unavailable, suggesting that corporations are being far more open with law enforcement than they are with their own customers.

“It's an ongoing scandal that this kind of surveillance is taking place without people being aware of it, let alone giving permission for it,” Stanley says. “If they're carrying out surveillance on the public, the public should know. They should have meaningful knowledge and give meaningful consent before any kind of surveillance is activated, which clearly is not the case.”

Two years ago, astronomers believe they detected a star devouring one of its planets. Now, new observations of the aftermath of same event from the James Webb Space Telescope have suggested a scenario previously only considered in the realms of science fiction: that a planet about the size of Jupiter self-destructed by heading straight into its parent star. The scientists in charge of the observation believe they witnessed the first “planetary suicide” in history.

The only noted way for a star to consume its own planets is for the star to increase significantly in size. This happens when a main sequence star, like our Sun, runs out of hydrogen to fuse and swells to many times its original size, becoming a red giant. Experts are studying this process with interest because the solar system itself is likely to face it. In about 5 billion years, after exhausting the hydrogen in its core, the Sun will expand to 100 times its current radius, devouring nearby planets such as Mercury and Venus in the process.

When a star absorbs a planet, observatories on Earth detect an increase in its luminosity, albeit one that's short-lived. Such a moment of brightening is known as a nova.

In 2023, the Gemini South observatory observed a nova 12,000 light-years away. It was initially suspected to be a red giant consuming one of its nearby planets. However, two years later, a more detailed analysis with the James Webb Space Telescope's infrared instrument revealed that the star was still in its main sequence phase, fusing hydrogen—the star had not aged and expanded into being a red giant. This new evidence suggests that the young star's nova was caused by it being impacted by a Jupiter-sized body.

According to a recent study published in the Astrophysical Journal, this nova is the most convincing direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star. The same researchers had already posited that this nova was evidence of a planet being engulfed in another report, published in Nature a couple of years ago. But in the new study, the team added more evidence of this being the signs of an engulfment, having conducted spectroscopy of the star—that is, analysis of the visible light and other radiation it emitted—820 days after its peak brightness.

This provided new data on the star's luminosity and ejected dust debris, and gave the team of astronomers a better idea of what might have happened in that solar system. They believe a Jupiter-sized planet, orbiting at the same distance as Mercury does from the Sun, gradually approached its star until it was destroyed by the star's outer layers.

As far as the evidence allows us to know, planets moving towards their star, towards destruction, are not common. Scientists estimate that the process may have been triggered by the same phenomenon that generates tides on Earth—the gravitational pull of other nearby celestial bodies (which in Earth's case is the Moon and the Sun). Over millions of years, the gravitational forces exerted by the star would have extracted some of the planet's orbital energy, pulling it out of its stable path towards the host star. In the end, the planet would have orbited too close to maintain its structural integrity.

Not all of the scientific community is convinced by this explanation. One of the main counter-hypotheses says that the star only looks young, because it is could be surrounded by a dense cloud of stellar dust, dampening its luminosity. If it turns out that the age or type of star is different from what is hypothesized, then there may be another explanation for the nova.

New measurements with more powerful telescopes will measure this star's brightness better, and will hopefully provide more evidence as to what happened. It's also possible that more “suicide” planets will be found in future in other places, revealing that the scenario is more common than thought.

When Deepankar Rustagi last raised money for OmniRetail in 2022, excitement was high for African startups addressing the supply chain and operational challenges in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. At one point, these startups received more capital than all sectors, except fintech.

Recently, though, the industry's enthusiasm and venture capital's interest have faded, as various business models have struggled under mounting pressure.

Yet for Rustagi, OmniRetail isn't just another B2B commerce platform; it's an ambitious effort to reshape informal retail across Nigeria and West Africa using technology and embedded finance in a scalable, profitable way. Now, that vision has received further endorsement with a $20 million Series A equity funding round. This capital will help OmniRetail expand its presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, while deepening its focus on embedded finance products.

The round was co-led by Norwegian development finance institution Norfund and Lagos-based VC firm Timon Capital, with follow-on participation from Ventures Platform, Aruwa Capital, Goodwell Investments (via Alitheia Capital), and Flour Mills of Nigeria.

This marks Norfund's first direct equity investment in an African startup, and according to Rustagi, puts OmniRetail on a path to dominating in a segment where others have struggled to grow profitably. OmniRetail has raised $38 million in equity and debt since its inception in 2019. 

OmniRetail's model digitizes order management for 145 manufacturers, more than 5,800 distributors and services over 150,000 informal retailers across 12 cities in Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast.

Retailers use the app to order inventory, access working capital, and make digital payments. In the background is a third-party logistics network of over 1,100 vehicles and distributed warehousing capacity managed by 85 local logistics partners. 

OmniRetail's asset-light strategy has been important in hitting profitability. In 2023, the Lagos-based B2B e-commerce platform became EBITDA positive. In 2024, it turned net profitable. A similar story is unfolding in Egypt, where another B2B e-commerce platform, Cartona, owes its push toward profitability to the model.

Both CEOs have noted that Africa's informal market is vast and made up of suppliers and distributors that don't need to be displaced or competed against, but rather made more efficient with the tech tools provided by their platforms.

“The profitability journey was an outcome of our efficiency on utilizing the assets that we aggregated in the network, and this has proven that the model that we put together as a ‘network of networks' is profitable and is highly scalable, Rustagi said. “That's the reason we went ahead and raise the capital to finally put the metal on the pedal and scale in more geographies and in more categories. We're expanding now not just to grow, but to optimize.”

Better occupancy in warehousing, smarter logistics routes, and deeper category penetration will all improve margins, he added. 

Rustagi, in a conversation with TechCrunch, alongside OmiRetail's head of investment, Archit Bagaria, further explained that the company's progress also lies in a deep understanding of the FMCG retail ecosystem, with the entire leadership team boasting decades of experience.

According to them, it affords a unique advantage of understanding how the value chain works, who the key players are, and where the gaps in visibility exist.

“For years, goods have been moving from point A to point B, but the lack of transparency has hindered financial inclusion and caused inefficiencies in the process,” said Bagaria. “By building an ecosystem that streamlines this entire landscape, we can solve these problems.”

Once a startup reaches critical mass, Bagaria adds, it becomes easier to layer additional services, such as payments and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), on top of its existing infrastructure. “Our approach has been different from others, and we believe we've found success with this model,” Bagaria added. 

Unlike other startups that jumped into offering credit products too early or mistimed the launch, OmniRetail waited until it had significant distribution scale and data. Thanks to this strategy, OmniRetail processed over ₦1.3 trillion (~$810 million) in transactions last year, with Omnipay, its BNPL product, disbursing ₦19 billion monthly (~$12 million) in inventory credit, boasting near-zero defaults, according to the company.

Acquiring Nigeria-based merchant solution platform Traction Apps in 2024 further strengthened OmniRetail's strategy. Traction provides full-stack payment capabilities, including POS terminals, PSSP and Super Agent licenses, and access to retailer-level sales data. 

For OmniRetail, the purchase allows it to gain a complete financial profile of each retailer, giving it even greater control over the supply chain and the ability to offer tailored financial solutions.

“Every transaction in the FMCG value chain has two sides: the movement of goods and the movement of funds,” said Rustagi. “Today, we are in a position to aggregate maximum benefits from every transaction in the value chain. Our plan is to dive deep into the value chain and maximize margins. International players have done well in their markets, and we're bringing that model to Nigeria today.”

While it no longer publicly discloses GMV figures, shifting away from the metric that has long been a key performance indicator in the sector,  it reports a 35% increase in net merchandise volume (NMV) and a 40% bump in revenue over the past year, all while maintaining profitability despite its expansion.

 Some of our next moves are laser-focused: a solid debt raise for inventory finance, strategic acquisitions, and a relentless profitable growth.”

With $20 million in fresh capital, OmniRetail plans to continue growing its retailer base and expand into new product categories like personal care, home care, and cold storage. 

The capital will also upgrade its infrastructure, enhance its credit underwriting tools, and strengthen partnerships with domestic debt providers. As such, some of its next moves include a debt raise for inventory finance and strategic acquisitions, according to Bagaria.

For Norfund, OmniRetail represents more than just a fintech or commerce bet; it's infrastructure.

“Embedded finance is one of the most transformative tools for small business growth in Africa,” said Norfund Investor Director Cathrine Conradi. “OmniRetail's model brings capital to areas where traditional systems haven't reached.” 

Meanwhile, Timon Capital, which backed OmniRetail from its seed stage, sees this as a breakout moment for the company.

“OmniRetail has now hit an inflection point in distribution, payments, and credit, showing just how much profitable growth they can generate with their expanding footprint,” the firm said.

Researchers have uncovered multiple new genes and genetic pathways that could lead to repurposing hundreds of existing drugs for osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis.

The research, which analyzed data from nearly 2 million people in diverse populations worldwide, was recently published in Nature. It represents an extensive genetic exploration of osteoarthritis, a condition affecting over 600 million people globally.

Conducted by an international team led by Helmholtz Munich in collaboration with Rush University Medical Center and 125 top academic institutions worldwide, this initiative is the largest genetic investigation into osteoarthritis conducted and the largest musculoskeletal study.

The study uncovered 962 genetic variants associated with the disease and spotlighted 69 key genes whose protein products are already targeted by 473 approved drugs - many of which could be redirected to manage osteoarthritis more effectively. This discovery leads to a fast-track to personalized medicine and innovative clinical trials.

"This study takes a leap forward in offering tailored therapies for osteoarthritis patients, many of whom have long awaited disease-modifying options," said Dino Samartzis, DSc, co-author, professor and director of the international spine research and innovation initiative of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Rush.

"This research is a beacon of hope. By leveraging human genetics, we can now reimagine much more effectively as to how we treat this widespread condition."

Osteoarthritis results from the gradual breakdown of cartilage in the joints.

It differs from rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, and is a leading cause of pain, reduced mobility and disability - projected to affect 1 billion people by 2050. It costs the United States nearly $486 billion annually and up to €817 billion in Europe.

As orthopedic specialists, we see firsthand how osteoarthritis affects quality of life. This study takes us closer to developing targeted biologics that not only alleviate symptoms but also slow disease progression and, ideally, restore joint health."

 Brian Cole, MD, professor of orthopedics at Rush

"With 10% of our genetic targets already linked to existing drugs, we're poised to accelerate the development of transformative treatments for osteoarthritis," said Eleftheria Zeggini, BSc, co-author and director of the Institute of Translational Genomics at Helmholtz Munich and professor of translational genomics at the Technical University of Munich. "This is precision medicine at work - offering new hope to millions."

Traditionally, osteoarthritis has been managed with pain relievers and mobility aids, but no disease-modifying therapies exist to date. This study not only redefines our genetic understanding of the disease but also provides a path toward repurposing safe, approved drugs, potentially slashing the time and cost to bring effective treatments to market.

The team stresses the need for more genetically diverse studies and functional genomics data from global populations to further refine their findings. By integrating genetics with tissue-level molecular insights, the pathway to new, effective and personalized treatments for osteoarthritis becomes increasingly attainable.

"This is one of the finest examples of impactful team science," Samartzis said. "Researchers and clinicians from across the globe united with a singular goal - to change the trajectory of osteoarthritis care for generations to come."

Arc Institute continues its work to generate and share large-scale, high-quality datasets of cell state before and after chemical or genetic perturbations to enable "virtual cell" models and other innovations. Two months after launching the Arc Virtual Cell Atlas comprising over 300 million cells, the initiative is now benefiting from new partnerships with 10x Genomics and Ultima Genomics, industry leaders in advanced tools that make collecting single cell data faster, more scalable, and more affordable for scientists working to improve human health.

"By combining Arc's expertise with 10x and Ultima's cutting-edge technologies, we will be able to generate high-quality, perturbational single-cell data at scale," said Arc Executive Director, Co-Founder, and Core Investigator Silvana Konermann. "We're excited to make this resource available to the scientific community so that these datasets can inform the most accurate models possible."

Leveraging 10x's high-resolution single-cell analysis platforms, particularly its Chromium Flex technology, Arc researchers will be able to generate perturbational data at unprecedented scale and quality. The technology makes it possible to simultaneously examine millions of perturbed individual cells at the lowest per-cell cost and highest resolution. 

"GEM-X Flex was built to meet the demands of today's most ambitious biological questions-delivering high-quality single-cell data at scale and at a cost that makes large-scale exploration feasible," said Serge Saxonov, CEO of 10x Genomics. "We are excited to enable the creation of increasingly powerful AI models in biology to accelerate scientific discovery and transform drug development."

Arc will leverage Ultima's UG 100 sequencing system and its recently launched Solaris chemistry to scale up its next phase of data generation and Atlas expansion. Ultima's unique wafer-based sequencing architecture and novel chemistry will enable Arc researchers to generate significantly more data and at lower cost than alternative approaches. The UG 100 platform has been validated by Arc to work seamlessly, and generate high-quality data at scale when used in combination with 10x's GEM-X Flex. Furthermore, Arc researchers will gain access and utilize UG 100 Solaris Boost, a new high-throughput operating mode currently available in Early Access, to further increase data output. 

"Our unique sequencing technology was designed to scale far beyond conventional approaches to lower the cost of genomic information and enable data generation at scale," said Gilad Almogy, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Ultima Genomics. "Emerging AI/ML applications such as large-scale perturbation data sets and virtual cells atlases highlight the enabling benefits of our technology and low-cost sequencing. We are grateful to work with Arc and 10x Genomics to advance the development of these resources to accelerate scientific discovery and advance our understanding of biology's complexity."

Arc is continuing to build the Atlas through additional collaborations to bring in single-cell data from other partners and research efforts. The goal is to provide a long-standing resource for machine learning efforts transforming biology.

At Arc, we're developing tools that can predict which perturbations would be effective to return a diseased cell to a healthy state. Instead of the guess-and-check approach that dominates experimental biomedicine today, a predictive 'world model' of the cell could help narrow the focus to the most promising therapeutic targets."

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) tend to have higher average ferritin levels compared to control subjects, but this does not seem to have a significant impact on their fertility or metabolic health. Iron deficiency also does not appear to be associated with infertility in women with PCOS. These findings are based on a study conducted at the University of Oulu, Finland, which investigated the relevance of ferritin levels to the health of women with PCOS.

Factors influencing ferritin levels included irregular menstruation, menstrual bleeding volume, and elevated insulin levels—features closely associated with the syndrome. Although high ferritin has previously been linked to poorer metabolic health, this association was weaker among the PCOS group than among the control group.

The study also examined the relationship between ferritin levels and infertility in both the PCOS and control groups, but no such association was found. Based on the findings, iron deficiency does not seem to be a cause of infertility, although adequate iron stores remain important for the health of both pregnant women and their developing babies.

The study utilized data collected as part of the Women's Health Study (WENDY), conducted between 2020 and 2022, which focused on the health of Finnish women aged 34-36.

PCOS is the most common hormonal disorder in women, affecting one in six. In addition to polycystic ovaries, disrupted menstrual cycles, and elevated androgen levels, the condition is often associated with metabolic disturbances and an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Ferritin is a protein that primarily stores iron in the body. Blood ferritin levels serve as an indicator of the body's overall iron status. In interpreting ferritin levels, inflammation markers must also be considered, as ferritin levels can rise significantly in response to inflammation.

The HER2-targeted therapy zongertinib demonstrated clinical benefits for previously treated patients with advanced HER2-mutant non-small cell lung cancer – particularly those with specific HER2 mutations – with manageable side effects, according to results from the Phase Ia/Ib Beamion LUNG-1 trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Updated data from the trial were presented today by principal investigator John Heymach, M.D., Ph.D., chair of Thoracic/Head and Neck Medical Oncology, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2025 and were published simultaneously in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The trial previously reported a 71% objective response rate (ORR) – indicating tumor shrinkage – in 75 patients from the first cohort, but newly presented data include a median duration of response (DOR) of 14.1 months and progression free survival (PFS) of 12.4 months.

A 71% response rate is unprecedented in this cancer subtype, and not only is the data strong in showing that this treatment works, but zongertinib has the added convenience of being a once-daily oral therapy. When you also consider the improved safety profile compared to less selective inhibitors, this suggests a promising approach for patients in need of new treatments. That's exciting because just a few years ago these patients had no effective targeted therapies."

John Heymach, M.D., Ph.D., principal investigator

The Beamion LUNG-1 trial is investigating zongertinib as a monotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring HER2 mutations. The only currently approved treatment for this patient population is the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which is delivered intravenously and has been linked to instances of interstitial lung disease.

Zongertinib is an oral inhibitor that, unlike previous tyrosine kinase inhibitors tested in this setting, selectively targets HER2 and spares EGFR, resulting in a significant reduction of adverse effects. Grade three or higher adverse events occurred in 17% of patients and mostly included diarrhea and rash, with no instances of interstitial lung disease.

The presentation included data from three cohorts. Cohort 1 included 75 patients with mutations in a specific region of HER2, known as tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations; cohort 3 included 20 patients harboring non-TKD mutations; and cohort 5 included 31 patients with TKD mutations who previously were treated with a HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate such as T-DXd. Outcomes are summarized below, although DOR and PFS data is not yet mature for cohort 3.

"This new data is particularly encouraging for patients who had disease progression after prior therapies, because it indicates that the resistance mechanisms to those therapies does not necessarily confer cross-resistance to zongertinib," Heymach said.

Zongertinib was granted a breakthrough therapy designation and a priority review by the FDA earlier this year based on interim data from this study presented at the 2024 World Conference on Lung Cancer.

A clinical trial investigating zongertinib as a first-line treatment is underway (Beamion LUNG-2), and Heymach and colleagues are planning additional studies to investigate the drug's potential in combination treatments in other tumor types harboring HER2 mutations.

This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim. Heymach serves on advisory committees for Genentech, Mirati Therapeutics, Eli Lilly & Co, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim, Regeneron, Takeda, BerGenBio, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Curio Science, Novartis, AstraZeneca, BioAtla, Sanofi, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, GSK, EMD Serono, Blueprint Medicines and Chugai Pharmaceutical.

Researchers at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine have found that individuals with colon cancer and a documented history of high cannabis use were more than 20 times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis compared to those without such a history.

This study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that heavy cannabis use may have underrecognized impacts on the immune system, mental health and treatment behaviors - all of which could influence cancer outcomes."

Raphael Cuomo, Ph.D., lead author, associate professor, Department of Anesthesiology, UC San Diego School of Medicine

The research team drew on electronic health records from more than 1,000 colon cancer patients treated across the University of California Health system between 2012 and 2024. They evaluated how cancer outcomes differed based on patients' documented cannabis use before diagnosis, controlling for age, sex and indicators of disease severity such as tumor staging and cancer biomarkers.

The analysis found:

While some laboratory studies have shown anti-tumor effects from certain cannabis compounds, the authors note that real-world use is more complex. Given the increasing prevalence and social acceptance of cannabis use, they also emphasize the need to further investigate its long-term effects in medically vulnerable populations.

"High cannabis use is often associated with depression, anxiety and other challenges that may compromise a patient's ability to engage fully with cancer treatment," said Cuomo, who is also a member of UC San Diego Moore's Cancer Center. "However, this isn't about vilifying cannabis. It's about understanding the full range of its impacts, especially for people facing serious illnesses. We hope these findings encourage more research - and more nuanced conversations - about how cannabis interacts with cancer biology and care."

The study was published online in the Annals of Epidemiology. No funding or conflicts of interest were reported for this study.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have uncovered a unique ability of a special subtype of natural killer cells in the immune system, called adaptive NK cells, to remember ovarian tumors and effectively attack them. The discovery, published in Cancer Immunology Research, could pave the way for new, more powerful immunotherapies for difficult-to-treat cancers.

NK cells, or natural killer cells, are white blood cells that play a central role in the body's defense against viral infections and cancer. NK cells can identify and destroy unhealthy-looking cells, such as tumor cells, without prior exposure.

Adaptive NK cells, aNK cells, are a subset of NK cells that can remember past infections or tumors and react more strongly the next time they encounter the same threat. This ability makes them particularly promising for cancer treatment.

The study shows that aNK cells can remember tumor-specific signals, infiltrate and fight cancer cells, and cooperate with other immune cells to become even more effective, making them particularly attractive for cancer treatment.

"Our results demonstrate that aNK cells have great potential for treating cancer, especially for patients with difficult-to-treat ovarian cancer," says Dhifaf Sarhan, senior lecturer at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, who led the research.

"The study also challenges previous perceptions of NK cells, which have historically been considered only innate immune cells with no memory function against cancer," she continues. "This opens new opportunities for the development of innovative immunotherapies."

The study involved comprehensive analyses of human immune cells and ovarian tumor tissues, utilising advanced RNA and gene expression mapping techniques at the single-cell level. This allowed the researchers to investigate how aNK cells interact with ovarian cancer tumor cells.

The next step in our research is to develop methods that increase the number and activity of aNK cells in patients, followed by clinical trials to evaluate their effect on patient survival rates."

It's a common misconception that fluids with different flow rate requirements always need separate pumps. In reality, that's not necessarily the case.

When working with two fluids that require different flow rates, there are alternative solutions worth considering. In some situations, using a single pump can improve efficiency and reduce costs.

This article explores practical options for handling different fluids with varying flow rates.

Some application examples may warrant the use of separate pumps for working with different fluids, but there are other options. For example, a duplex pump featuring two pump heads can be calibrated at different values.

These ‘2-for-1' pumps feature a single drive motor, despite being able to drive two different pump heads with two different mix ratios. These types of pumps are extremely beneficial to users looking to simplify their operations and save space within the lab environment.

The need for separate pumps or a single pump option depends largely on a specific application's needs, but a duplex pump can often be used to process different fluids at different flow rates.

If your application allows you to meter multiple fluids using a single pump, there are several potential benefits to consider. Here are some of the key advantages:

The most significant benefit of using a single pump is the simplification of the electrical system. Two pumps necessitate the use of multiple motor controllers to operate at independent speeds, adding to the system's complexity in terms of integration. Duplex pumps help to reduce the complexity of the fluidic system.

Using a single pump instead of two saves space within both the lab environment and within the instrument itself. As well as its reduced space requirements, this can help improve reliability, reduce maintenance requirements, and reduce downtime, effectively streamlining overall operations.

Using a single pump should also reduce its overall cost, especially when leveraging a single duplex pump rather than acquiring multiple units. Despite its versatility, the duplex pump will often cost less to manufacture than two standard pumps.

Applications requiring flow outputs in multiples of two may not be adequately served by a single pump. For example, increased complexity in the fluidic system can lead to increased system size, increased cost, and additional leak points.

The decision to work with one pump versus two separate pumps should always be based on the requirements of the application in question.

Fluid Metering, Inc. offers a range of duplex pump options able to accommodate applications where it is beneficial to use a single pump for processing different fluids at different flow rates. Various models with dual shaft or dual head options are available, from stepper base options to the QB series of pumps.

It is advisable to contact Fluid Metering prior to purchasing a pump solution to ensure the best combination of pump head and calibration is provided for the specific application.

It is important to note, however, that while this article primarily discussed the duplex pump, many other products in Fluid Metering's portfolio can be used for the same purpose.

Dr. Ho Sang Jung and his research team from the Advanced Bio and Healthcare Materials Research Division at the Korea Institute of Materials Science (KIMS), in collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, have developed a technology that enables the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes using synovial fluid. This marks the first such achievement in Korea.

According to some studies, over 50% of the population aged 65 and older experience symptoms of osteoarthritis, while rheumatoid arthritis is known to be a serious chronic disease that affects approximately 1 in 100 people over the course of their lifetime. Although osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis may appear similar, they differ in both their causes and treatments, making accurate differentiation at the early diagnosis stage critically important. Until now, diagnosis has relied on X-rays, MRI scans, and blood tests, which are time-consuming, costly, and limited in accuracy.

The human joints contain a fluid known as synovial fluid. The research team focused on the differences in the composition of metabolites-byproducts of chemical processes occurring within the body-present in this fluid. By analyzing these metabolic differences, they developed a technology capable of distinguishing between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis within 10 minutes, as well as assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis.

 The research team utilized Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology, a phenomenon in which the optical signals of molecules are amplified by several million times. This technology amplifies signals from trace molecules present in synovial fluid and, through a combination of AI-based analysis and mathematical algorithms, detects minute substances responsible for arthritis. In addition, the team developed a simple and rapid diagnostic method using a sensor composed of a sea urchin-shaped gold nanostructure formed on a paper surface with high moisture absorption, enabling efficient detection via body fluids.

 In collaboration with Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, the research team conducted tests using this technology on 120 patients. The results showed that osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis could be diagnosed and distinguished with an accuracy of over 94%. Furthermore, the technology achieved over 95% accuracy in determining the severity of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings demonstrate that the technology not only significantly reduces the time and cost of arthritis diagnosis but also ensures a high level of diagnostic accuracy.

If this technology is commercialized, it will not only aid in diagnosis but also be highly useful in monitoring treatment progress. We also plan to continue expanding our research to cover a wider range of diseases in the future."

This research was funded by the Bio & Medical Technology Development Program and the Global Young Researcher Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF), as well as the Materials and Components Technology Development Program of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE). The research findings were published online on March 30 and will appear in the April 2025 issue of Small (IF: 13), a globally renowned scientific journal in the field of nanomaterials.

 April 28, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — A 20-year initiative by Kaiser Permanente Northern California that assessed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening status and offered flexible options for screening has made a huge difference in CRC incidence, deaths, and racial disparities, an analysis showed.

“The program promptly doubled the proportion of people up to date with screening,” reported lead investigator Douglas A. Corley, MD, PhD, a research scientist with Kaiser's Division of Research, at a press briefing held on April 24, ahead of a presentation at the Digestive Disease Week (DDW) 2025.

Additionally, within about 10 years, cancer rates were cut by a third, deaths were halved for the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and the differences that had previously been seen by race or ethnicity were largely eliminated, he said.

“Ten years ago, there were big gaps in cancer risk and death, especially among our Black patients. Now, those differences are nearly gone,” Corley said.

A systematic CRC screening program was implemented across Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The program included proactive outreach to members who were overdue for screening and mailing them fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kits for at-home use.

Corley and colleagues tracked screening status and CRC incidence and mortality annually from 2000 to 2019 among about 1.1 million members aged 50-75 years across 22 medical centers of the integrated healthcare system. The cohort included American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and White members.

Screening rates via FIT, colonoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy more than doubled after starting the program, from about 37% in the early years to about 80% within a few years, and it stayed that high through 2019, Corley reported. 

“Importantly, these large increases occurred across the whole population with only small differences,” he said. 

For example, about 76% of Hispanic members, 77% of Black members, 82% of White members, and 83% of Asian members were up to date in the later years and through 2019.

“This shows that systematic, comparable outreach can provide a level playing field for completion of preventive care,” Corley said.

After an expected early uptick in CRC incidence due to early detection, incidence later declined and by 2019 had dropped approximately 30% across the groups.

CRC deaths also fell by about 50% across all groups, with the largest decline among Black members, Corley noted.

Racial and ethnic disparities in both CRC incidence and mortality have long existed, with Black patients in particular experiencing higher risks and worse outcomes, likely from a mixture of risk factors and healthcare utilization, Corley said.

Offering outreach and equal access to screening in the Kaiser program erased those long-standing disparities.

“It's remarkable that some of these large differences in mortality by race and ethnicity that we saw two decades ago, and which are found throughout the United States, are now similar to small chance variation in the population,” Corley said.

Flexibility was key to getting more people screened, he noted. “It's about reaching people at their homes and offering a choice to patients. It's an astonishingly simple concept.”

It's important to note that these findings stem from a large, integrated healthcare system, which may differ from other settings, although similar outreach strategies have succeeded in safety net clinics and smaller practices, Corley added.

By boosting screening rates to 80%, the health system reached the level that's essentially been defined in the past as our goal of screening programs, said Loren Laine, MD, professor of medicine (digestive diseases) at Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, and chair of this year's DDW. 

“It shows that if health systems institute programmatic screening for all their covered individuals, they could markedly increase screening, said Laine, who also served as moderator of the press briefing.

“Most importantly, of course, [screening] was associated with a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence and deaths,” he said.

The study had no commercial funding. Corley reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Laine's disclosures included consulting and/or relationships with Medtronic, Phathom Pharmaceuticals, Biohaven, Celgene, Intercept, Merck, and Pfizer.

The legacy of discriminatory housing policies continues to shape both economic and health outcomes. A study by Tulane University, New Orleans, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, reveals that patients in historically redlined neighborhoods experience significantly longer delays in achieving HIV viral suppression than those in non-redlined areas.

Researchers analyzed 1132 newly diagnosed patients with HIV in New Orleans between 2011 and 2019, finding a 15% longer delay in viral suppression among those from redlined neighborhoods. These delays impact both individual health and broader public health efforts to prevent HIV transmission, said senior author Scott Batey, PhD, a professor at Tulane's School of Social Work, New Orleans.

“The association between redlining and health outcomes is not a new concept, but applying this lens specifically to HIV was novel,” Batey noted.

Though HIV viral suppression can be achieved in about a month with a single daily pill, the study found it took patients from redlined neighborhoods nearly a month longer to achieve it than their counterparts (193 vs 164 days). The study was conducted in collaboration with the Louisiana Department of Health and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama. 

Abolished in 1968, redlining refers to the practice of mortgage lenders marking certain areas with red lines on maps to signify where loans would be denied to residents based on their race or ethnicity. This financial exclusion led to lasting disparities in healthcare access, education, and household income.

Today, even in areas where investments have been made to counteract redlining, “individuals still experience longer times to achieve viral suppression,” Batey said. “This suggests that historical systemic barriers continue to have lingering effects, even across generations.”

Among the study participants, 62% resided in formerly redlined neighborhoods. Most were men between ages 25 and 44 years. Although New Orleans has a Black majority population, the study revealed a higher concentration of Black individuals in redlined areas than in non-redlined ones.

“Our study reinforced existing research that links social determinants of health — such as poverty, depression, substance abuse, and intimate partner violence — to HIV outcomes,” he added. “However, structural determinants of health remain less explored, making our findings particularly compelling.”

Factors like limited healthcare access, financial insecurity, transportation barriers, and medical mistrust further delay treatment, Batey said. Limited health literacy and stigma further complicate access to timely care. “Stigma remains a major barrier — people may avoid seeking care due to fear of discrimination.”

While the study focused on New Orleans, its findings are relevant across the Deep South, where redlining was prevalent and healthcare disparities persist. This region accounts for over half of new HIV cases in the United States, Batey said.

Addressing these systemic issues requires targeted interventions. “If we can make services more accessible and get people virally suppressed sooner, the impact on the HIV epidemic could be profound,” Batey said. “Expanding on-site testing and at-home testing, telehealth options, and culturally competent education initiatives can help close these healthcare gaps.”

The results from the redlining study can help inform and reinforce the need for community-based strategies. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to addressing HIV treatment adherence, added Shobha Swaminathan, MD, FIDSA, professor of medicine and director of HIV services at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.

“Most infectious disease physicians enter their specialty driven by a strong desire to improve public health and reduce health disparities,” said Swaminathan, who also serves as medical director of Infectious Diseases Practice, Rutgers Health at University Hospital. “This foundational motivation is a powerful asset in addressing the complexities of HIV treatment adherence.”

By collaborating with mental health and substance use disorder clinicians, community health workers, and case managers, providers can deliver patient-centered care while increasing education on HIV treatment effectiveness. Encouraging the use of long-acting injectable medications can also help address adherence challenges, Swaminathan said.

Education campaigns, community outreach, and partnerships with local organizations — especially through social media — can inform at-risk populations about early treatment and viral suppression, she added. Integrated care models that address HIV alongside mental health and substance use concerns can improve retention, with local services easing access to multiple types of care.

Community health worker programs and long-acting injectable antiretrovirals offer promising solutions, reducing the burden of daily medication and improving engagement in care, Swaminathan said.

“By approaching HIV care with a comprehensive, empathetic, and advocacy-driven mindset, we can be catalysts for change in the fight against HIV, improving both individual and community health outcomes.”

Batey and Swaminathan reported having no relevant financial relationships.

 April 28, 2025  

INCHEON, South Korea — The diabetes drug metformin may reduce the pain of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in patients with overweight or obese, independent of weight loss, according to results from a randomized placebo-controlled study presented at the World Congress on Osteoarthritis (OARSI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

The double-blind trial, which was simultaneously published on April 24, 2025, in JAMA, involved 107 patients with symptomatic radiologic knee OA and a body mass index > 25, who were randomly assigned to receive either 2000 mg/d metformin or a placebo for 6 months.

This treatment was associated with a mean change in the visual analog scale for pain of −31.3 mm in the treatment group compared with −18.9 mm in the placebo group at 6 months, which represented a significant adjusted between-group difference of −11.4 mm (P = .01).

While this did not achieve the minimum clinically important difference of 15 mm, Flavia Cicuttini, MD, a rheumatologist at the Alfred Hospital and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and researcher on the study, described the metformin's effect size of 0.43 as moderate.

The study also found significant differences in favor of metformin in the secondary outcomes of improvements in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index scores for pain (−113.9 with metformin vs −68.2 with placebo), stiffness (−56.9 vs −26.7), and function (−426.1 vs −221.7). These analyses used imputed data to address missing primary and secondary outcomes for the 18% of patients in the trial who were lost to follow-up and did not provide data at 6 months.

“I think this provides a different approach that has the potential to slow this rapid move towards knee replacements for early OA,” Cicuttini said.

An earlier systematic review, which Cicuttini co-authored, found consistent preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting metformin had chondroprotective, immunomodulatory, and pain-reducing effects in knee OA.

“Metformin has a whole lot of different actions or benefits on joint cartilage, on low-grade inflammation, on the metabolism,” Cicuttini commented to Medscape Medical News. “What's also attractive about metformin is it doesn't cause hypoglycemia; you can use it in normal healthy people, you don't have to monitor their blood sugar.”

There was some weight loss in both groups (mean change, −1.8 kg in the metformin group and −1.2 kg in the placebo group), but Cicuttini said the impact on OA symptoms was independent of weight loss.

Some patients experienced adverse events, with 15% of the metformin group reporting diarrhea compared with 8% of the placebo group, but there were high levels of adherence to the medication.

Rheumatologist Anita Wluka, MBBS, PhD, of the Alfred Hospital and Monash University — who was also a co-author on the study — said to Medscape Medical News that “metformin ticks all the metabolic boxes, and it's cheap as chips.”

Commenting on the findings, physiotherapist Brooke Patterson, PhD, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said there are numerous trials looking for medications to help with OA, but it is challenging to find effects because of the nature of the disease.

“You've got all these different subgroups within the 50 participants that are getting the intervention, but only a small proportion of those might respond to one treatment,” she said. “I would just recommend that people with OA talk to not only their doctor but a range of health professionals or get their doctor to try and understand potentially what are some of their risk factors” and their OA disease phenotype.

The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. Cicuttini reported receiving funding from the NHMRC Investigator Grant and being on the advisory board of Magellan Stem Cells. Patterson and Wluka had no relevant conflicts of interest.

New research reveals that ultra-processed foods account for nearly half of US household grocery purchases, with lower-income and less-educated families bearing the brunt, underscoring the need for urgent national policy reform.

In a recent article published in the journal Public Health Nutrition, researchers analyzed purchases of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) by American households, examining differences based on education levels, household income, and race and ethnicity.

They found that almost half of all food purchases and more than one-third of beverages were UPFs; snacks, soft drinks, and mixed dishes accounted for the highest proportions of UPFs. Purchases of UPFs were more common in households with lower incomes and members with lower levels of education, as well as in non-Hispanic white households. The study included a nationally representative sample of 59,939 US households, analyzing over 33 million purchased products during 2020.

Statistical analyses used a significance threshold of p < 0.0001 to determine meaningful differences between groups.

UPFs are highly engineered products made with additives and ingredients derived from food and are becoming increasingly dominant in American diets. These foods have been linked to several chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, depression, sleep issues, and even premature death.

Unlike traditional food research focused on nutrients, recent studies use the NOVA classification system to assess food processing levels, aiming to highlight foods designed to encourage overconsumption.

UPFs are identified not only by their high processing but also by the use of certain additives rarely found in home cooking. Current estimates show that approximately half of American beverage and food purchases are ultra-processed. Nutrition-related health problems, including obesity, also show significant disparities across ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic groups.

Past research undertaken from 2007 to 2012 revealed that more educated individuals consume fewer UPFs, while white and Black adolescents consume the most. Income and age were inversely related to UPF intake. While purchase data provide a clearer picture than dietary surveys, earlier findings indicated that Black households bought more processed drinks but fewer processed foods.



Proportion of food and beverages purchased by US households by level of processing

In a quickly changing food market, researchers sought to update research on UPF purchasing patterns, exploring how race, income, education, and family structure intersect with food purchasing.

The study utilized data from a consumer panel survey of 59,939 American households, drawn from a nationally representative sample of approximately 35,000 to 60,000 households per year, conducted in 2020. Participating households scanned packaged beverage and food purchases and provided demographic data, including race, ethnicity, education, income, and household composition.

Ethnicity and race were grouped as non-Hispanic, Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic Black. Income was divided into three levels based on the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), namely <185%, 185–350%, and >350%. Education was classified into at most high school, some college, or college graduate and above. Households were also classified based on whether they included children.

Using commercial databases, each product was matched with nutrient labels and ingredient data. Items without nutrition labels or barcodes (like fresh produce and meats) were excluded. Products were grouped into nine food and eleven beverage categories.

Based on the NOVA classification system, items were categorized as minimally processed, containing processed ingredients, processed foods, and ultra-processed foods (UPFs). UPFs were identified by checking for substances not typically used in home kitchens, including flavor enhancers and sweeteners. If items originally classified as UPFs were found to contain none of the NOVA markers or additives, the product was reclassified as processed foods rather than UPFs.

The authors used statistical tests to compare the purchase volumes of UPFs across demographic sub-groups, applying Bonferroni adjustments to account for multiple comparisons.



Proportion of (A) foods and (B) beverages purchased by US households by both level of processing and food category

In 2020, among 59,939 American households and over 33 million purchased products that were analyzed, 38% of beverages and 48% of packaged foods were classified as UPFs, accounting for 43% of all products purchased.

The groups with the largest share of UPFs were carbonated beverages, which contained 90% UPFs, followed by soups and mixed dishes at 81%, and snacks and sweets at 71%. In contrast, fruits, vegetables, fats, nuts, and oils had virtually no UPFs. Importantly, although these minimally processed categories had almost no UPFs, they made up only a small fraction (12%) of total purchases, compared to the top three UPF categories (carbonated soft drinks, sweets and snacks, and mixed dishes/soups), which together comprised 36% of all purchases.

Non-Hispanic white households had the highest percentage of UPF purchases (49%), followed by non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (46%), and other ethnic groups (43%). Lower-income and less educated households purchased a higher proportion of UPFs than higher-income and more educated households.

These patterns held across racial-ethnic groups even when stratified by income. Differences were observed across food categories, with non-Hispanic white households purchasing more carbonated UPF drinks, and non-Hispanic Black households purchasing more UPF dairy beverages and fruit juices. The "other" race/ethnicity group consistently had the lowest proportion of UPF purchases, except in the dairy beverage category. Grain products and fruit/vegetable juices showed the greatest variability by group, with at least a 10% difference between the lowest and highest proportions of UPFs purchased.

It is important to note that this study measured only in-home purchases. Previous research has shown that non-Hispanic Black households are more likely than other race-ethnic groups to purchase sugar-sweetened beverages outside the home, which was not captured in this dataset. Therefore, the observed lower in-home beverage UPF purchases among non-Hispanic Black households may not reflect their total beverage consumption.

This study confirms the dominance of UPFs in American household food purchases, consistent with previous research. Notably, non-Hispanic whites now purchase more ultra-processed beverages than other groups, differing from earlier findings. One possible explanation for this shift is purchasing behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have disproportionately affected minority groups and altered patterns of food insecurity and at-home purchasing. Additionally, the limitation of only capturing in-home purchases may confound observed racial and ethnic differences in UPF beverage purchasing patterns.

Despite using a nationally representative sample and full-year data collection, limitations include reliance on purchase (rather than consumption) data, potential underestimation due to food waste, exclusion of restaurant purchases, possible misclassification using the NOVA classification system, and pandemic-related purchasing shifts. Despite these, scan-based data likely ensures reasonable accuracy.

The findings emphasize the urgent need for American policy initiatives addressing UPF consumption to enhance diet quality and mitigate chronic disease risks, particularly given the absence of federal regulations compared to other countries.

Early 20th-century quarantine efforts in Hawai'i successfully halted YFV outbreaks after infected ships arrived from South America, demonstrating the effectiveness of preemptive public health measures.

A recent study published in the journal npj Viruses proposed that global trends, including unprecedented urbanization, increased international travel, and the expansion of mosquito habitats, increase the odds of the geographic spread of the yellow fever (YF) virus (YFV).

YF, caused by YFV, is an acute viral illness in humans and several nonhuman primates. Unlike other mosquito-borne diseases, humans infected with YFV exhibit heightened viremia and are efficient amplifying hosts, allowing for inter-human transmission by mosquitoes. This makes YFV particularly capable of sparking urban epidemics, as infected people can efficiently infect mosquitoes that bite them. The YF mosquito (Aedes aegypti) is the primary urban vector, being anthropophilic and adapted to the human environment.

Both YFV and YF mosquitoes originated in African forests and were introduced into the Americas via the transatlantic slave trade before or in the 1600s. During the colonial era in North America, Caribbean trading vessels imported yellow fever (YF) mosquitoes to coastal port cities in the eastern United States (US). Onboard YFV transmission could ensue, leading to quarantine.

Once an area was infested with YF mosquitoes, YFV infection followed soon, resulting in epidemics over the past three centuries. An effective YFV vaccine, developed in the 1930s, and the eradication of YF mosquitoes in the Western Hemisphere eventually led to the cessation of YFV transmission in the Americas. Nevertheless, enzootic cycles in nonhuman primates and sylvatic mosquitoes continued in the forest canopies of the American tropics and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Further, human-amplified urban YF epidemics have occurred recently in Africa. The reasons for the reemergence of YF epidemics are unclear but are believed to be due to various factors, including human population expansion, inadequate vaccine coverage, and a lack of effective mosquito control. The study notes that, for example, recent years (2016–2023) have seen an increase in YF spillover from sylvatic cycles in both Africa and the Americas, raising alarms about further geographic spread.

Historic U.S. epidemics, such as Philadelphia's 1793 outbreak that claimed 10% of the population, permanently altered societal behaviors, influencing urban planning and disease response strategies.

The paper is published on the 100th anniversary of epidemiologist H.R. Carter's original warning about yellow fever's potential to invade the Asia-Pacific region, and the authors stress that many of Carter's concerns are now more pressing than ever.

Notably, YFV has not been transmitted in Asia so far. However, studies suggest a possibility of YFV expansion to the Asia Pacific region. The paper emphasizes that over two billion susceptible people in the Asia-Pacific region live in areas infested by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, with no natural herd immunity to YFV. This was recognized in the 18th and 19th centuries but deemed unlikely due to logistical barriers. Nevertheless, the threat of YFV spread to Asia was underscored once Aedes aegypti was identified as a YFV vector in 1903. The present study reviewed the YF threat to the Asia Pacific.

The YF mosquito eradication program was initiated in the United States in 1962 and was abandoned seven years later due to repeated importations from countries without similar policies. Meanwhile, the persistence of YF mosquitoes in limited refugia has gradually led to reinfestation across the Americas, which continues to this day.

Yellow fever's “extrinsic incubation” period, the 10-day delay between a mosquito biting an infected host and transmitting the virus, was first documented in 1898, reshaping outbreak containment protocols.

Global trends have facilitated the resurgence and spread of YF, including population growth, urbanization, the emergence of megacities, rapid transportation, trade globalization, and the expansion of YF-carrying mosquitoes. For instance, it was estimated that over four billion people traveled internationally by airplane in 2019, and a 2016 study found that 60 million unvaccinated people traveled to or from YF-endemic countries to areas infested with yellow fever mosquitoes. Travel by unvaccinated individuals from or to YF-endemic areas increases the probability of the introduction of YFV to non-endemic countries infested with Aedes aegypti.

Besides, if YFV is introduced in a permissive country, the disease could first be misdiagnosed as dengue. This risk is heightened because early or mild YF cases can closely resemble other flavivirus infections, and cross-reactive immunity complicates laboratory diagnosis. However, some mitigating factors reduce the risk of YFV transmission, such as the World Health Organization's (WHO) “Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics” program, which aims to increase YF vaccine access and coverage. Another factor is that the severe form of YF is remarkable and easily diagnosed.

Besides, travel history raises suspicion about YF, and imported cases are likely to be recognized early. Nonetheless, the study warns that most countries infested with YF mosquitoes lack the public health infrastructure to effectively control mosquitoes, rapidly distribute vaccines, or manage a surge of clinical cases. As such, a large YF epidemic could cause chaos in a non-endemic country. The paper warns explicitly that the combination of high case–fatality ratio, hemorrhagic symptoms, and inadequate vaccine supply could rapidly overwhelm public health systems.

The fundamental question is why no YF epidemic has occurred in permissive urban centers of Asia-Pacific or tropical America. Moreover, recent pandemics of chikungunya, Zika virus disease, and dengue suggest ideal epidemiological conditions for the global and regional transmission of YFV. The article frames this as an “enigma,” noting that unraveling why YF has not yet spread in these regions can help in designing effective preventive measures.

Possible explanations for the lack of YF spread include cross-protective immunity from Zika, dengue, and other orthoflavivirus, demographic and geographic obstacles, non-adaptation of YFV lineages to the YF mosquito-human urban cycle, effective mosquito control in at-risk areas, good surveillance and rapid response containment, variable YF mosquito densities, variable host-vector competence, and plain old luck, among others. In particular, the article highlights that areas endemic for dengue and other flaviviruses may have populations with cross-reactive immunity, which could either reduce disease severity or suppress transmission, though this remains to be confirmed in humans.

Brazil's 1938 eradication of Aedes aegypti, achieved through door-to-door insecticide campaigns, collapsed by the 1970s due to funding cuts, allowing the mosquito to resurge globally.

Effective control and prevention of YF will require more information on the epidemiology, biology, and genetic diversity of YFV, as well as enhanced surveillance and improved tools to prevent, identify, and contain transmission. Although a highly effective and safe YF vaccine is available, its supply is limited, and significant upscaling will be necessary for widespread use. The study notes that current egg-based vaccine production is difficult to rapidly scale up in emergencies, contributing to shortages during outbreaks.

Further, while new mosquito control tools in the pipeline appear promising, none provide effective emergency and long-term control at the required scale. Moreover, public health infrastructure should be built to address Aedes-linked viral diseases. The article emphasizes the urgent need for research into new vaccine platforms, sustainable mosquito control strategies, antivirals, improved surveillance, and integration of vaccination with vector control. Thus, successful YF containment requires extensive capacity-building and research in most tropical urban centers.

In summary, the concern that YFV will spread to the Asia Pacific region, which was raised a century ago, remains equally pressing today, and the odds of such a catastrophe may be even higher now. The authors explicitly warn that if a yellow fever pandemic were to occur in today's world, its much higher lethality could make the COVID-19 pandemic pale by comparison, resulting in a devastating global public health crisis. Further, the risk in 2025 is amplified by ideal social, epidemiological, and ecological conditions for spreading and transmitting YFV and its mosquito vector. Moreover, it is unlikely that the global trends responsible for the elevated risk will abate.

Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who received the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab before, during and after standard-of-care surgery had longer event-free survival without the cancer coming back and higher rates of substantial tumor shrinkage prior to surgery, according to the first interim analysis of a randomized, open-label phase 3 clinical trial led by investigators from Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center and Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

This trial, called KEYNOTE-689, is the first study in more than 20 years to show improvements in outcomes over standard of care for this patient group. Current standard of care for resectable head and neck cancer involves surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, though only 40% to 50% of patients survive five years.

"This is a practice-changing study," said Robert Haddad, MD, chief of the Division of Head and Neck Oncology and the McGraw Chair in Head and Neck Oncology at Dana-Farber, and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Haddad is the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center principal investigator and member of the KEYNOTE-689 steering committee. "Not only has this regimen improved event-free survival, but we also observed that fewer patients required chemotherapy as part of standard of care after receiving immunotherapy before surgery."

The results will be presented by the study global chair, Ravindra Uppaluri, MD, PhD, director of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology at Dana-Farber and Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Brigham and Women's Hospital Endowed Chair in Otolaryngology, at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. A press conference will take place on Sunday, April 27, from 12:00-1:00 p.m. ET / 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m. CT. Uppaluri will then present the study in Clinical Trials Plenary Session CT001 on Sunday, April 27, 2025, from 2:00-2:15 p.m. ET / 1:00-1:15 p.m. CT.

Douglas Adkins, MD, professor of medicine and director of the Section of Head and Neck and Thyroid Medical Oncology at WashU Medicine who worked closely with the Dana-Farber Brigham Cancer Center team in a previous phase 2 trial, is the co-senior author.

The KEYNOTE-689 trial randomized 714 patients with newly diagnosed stage III or stage IVA head and neck squamous cell cancer to receive either pembrolizumab before (called neoadjuvant), during and after (called adjuvant) standard of care or standard of care alone. The investigators also measured the presence of the target of pembrolizumab, PD-L1, in tumors to determine if higher scores of PD-L1 in tumors would affect response to treatment.

They found that patients who received pembrolizumab had longer event-free survival regardless of their PD-L1 scores. Median event-free survival across all patients was 51.8 months with pembrolizumab and 30.4 without after a median of 38.3 months of follow-up. The team also observed significantly higher rates of major pathologic response, a substantial immune mediated tumor destruction seen in surgical resections, across all patients taking pembrolizumab.

The treatment was found to be safe with no new observed side effects. Further, patients taking pembrolizumab received surgery in a timely manner and were not delayed by immunotherapy-related side effects prior to surgery.

The ability for surgery to occur without delay was a very important observation."

Robert Haddad, MD, chief of the Division of Head and Neck Oncology and the McGraw Chair in Head and Neck Oncology at Dana-Farber

Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is reviewing potential approval of this regimen for this patient population.

"It is very exciting to see this first positive trial of upfront immunotherapy moving forward with the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with head and neck cancer worldwide," said Uppaluri, who expects further analysis of the study data after a longer follow-up later this year.

This new regimen would represent a substantial change in workflow for head and neck cancer care. Currently, patients see a surgeon for a definitive diagnosis via biopsy and, if positive, move straight into surgery. The addition of immunotherapy prior to surgery requires a robust multidisciplinary approach.

"The value of multidisciplinary care in head and neck cancer becomes even more important with this approach of providing immunotherapy prior to surgery," Haddad said. "The mindset of many surgical oncologists in the U.S. and the world will need to evolve to incorporate this paradigm shift."

"Our multidisciplinary teams are now focused on determining if this progress can be improved upon with different agents or with combinations of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in head and neck cancer," Uppaluri said. "This study really has opened up the potential for neoadjuvant treatment to make a difference for our patients with head and neck cancers."

A study on donor lungs preserved outside the body before transplantation demonstrated that the hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (HOPE) technique is a safe and effective lung preservation method, even with total out-of-body times approaching 20 hours.

Jitte Jennekens, MSc, organ perfusionist/transplant coordinator at the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, presented the study results at today's Annual Meeting and Scientific Sessions of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in Boston.

"This technique is being used to preserve donor livers and kidneys and is being studied in clinical trials for hearts, but it hasn't gotten that much attention for lung preservation yet," said Jennekens. 

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a technique that allows for donor lungs to be maintained, assessed, and potentially reconditioned outside of the body before transplantation. The lungs are connected to a pump and a ventilator and perfused with a solution that functions as a physiological fluid.

The UMC Utrecht developed its HOPE protocol to safely extend perfusion times, to maintain the viability of the lungs overnight until the transplantation can be performed during the day.

Donor lungs selected for EVLP are typically transported on ice and then warmed to 37 degrees Celsius using a normothermic EVLP (called nEVLP) protocol for functional assessment. Following nEVLP, the lungs are then returned to ice until the transplant begins.

The HOPE protocol eliminates the second period on ice by assessing the lungs during one hour of nEVLP and then preserving the lungs at 12 degrees C until the procedure.

Jennekens presented data comparing the outcomes of 12 cases conducted using the nEVLP-HOPE protocol with a historical cohort of donor lungs transplanted directly into patients without ex vivo lung perfusion. 

The control cohort included 118 cases of lungs transplanted directly without perfusion between 2017 and 2022. The cases were performed between 2022 and 2024 using the HOPE protocol for logistical reasons.

No lungs in the nEVLP-HOPE group were rejected for transplantation, and short-term outcomes were similar between the study and control groups.

"Our findings indicate that HOPE is a safe and effective lung preservation method after a period of normothermic EVLP," Jennekens said.

Jennekens said the next step is to determine the preservation strategy that will be most beneficial to a specific type of donor lung.

"Extending perfusion times for donor lungs outside of the body will allow for a future in which donor lungs can be optimized with different therapies," she said.

The U. S. Men's National team is two months away from a crucial test in the Gold Cup, a biennial tournament that decides North America's strongest soccer team. The Gold Cup will be the USMNT's last competitive international competition before the United States, Canada and Mexico host the World Cup in 2026, and the pressure is on for it to perform.

Here's how USMNT players are playing on the world stage as the Gold Cup draws near:

Winger Christian Pulisic | AC Milan, Italy

This is a less-than-stellar season for AC Milan, which was eliminated from the Champions League before the knockout rounds and sits ninth in Italy's Serie A. But there's one bright spot in Milan's dismal season: Pulisic, who scored Sunday in a 2-0 victory over Venezia.

The goal was his 50th in all competitions for the team since joining Milan in 2023. Pulisic, Milan's leading goal scorer this season, is putting together one of the stronger seasons for an American abroad in history. 

"It's always good to get goals and assists," Pulisic said after the match, per goal.com. "That's our job." Sure, but some players do that job better than others — and Pulisic is doing it better than just about everyone.

Defender Chris Richards | Crystal Palace, England

Defense has been a weak spot for the USMNT for years, but 25-year-old Alabama native Richards is looking to change that. He played in all 90 minutes of Crystal Palace's 3-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday in an FA Cup semifinal.

Richards has played lights-out in the FA Cup since the tournament started last fall. He and his Palace back line have conceded just one goal on their way to the final against Man City on May 17.

"Hopefully we can make it just one goal conceded for the whole tournament," Richards said, per the Crystal Palace website.

Defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers and Auston Trusty | Celtic, Scotland

Carter-Vickers and Trusty, Celtic's American center back pairing, lifted the Scottish Premiership trophy on Saturday after beating Dundee United 5-0. It's Celtic's 55th Premiership title, which levels it with Glasgow rival Rangers for the most wins in Scottish Premiership history. 

Midfielder Johnny Cardoso | Real Betis, Spain

Cardoso led Betis to an impressive 5-1 win over Valladolid in La Liga on April 24. The win lifted Betis to sixth in La Liga and put it just one point outside of the Champions League qualification spots for next season.

Cardoso is a composed, cerebral midfielder vital to Betis' success but is rarely the star of the show. Don't let his lack of flash fool you, though. His fitness, consistency and intelligence make him a crucial depth piece for the USMNT.

 Diego Luna | Real Salt Lake, United States 

Luna scored twice Saturday against San Diego FC, but it was his first goal — an impressive solo effort that began with a muscly interception and ended with a looped shot into the top corner — that showed off his skill set best.

"That's just my style of play, right?" he said, per goal.com. "I'm not the tallest, not the fastest, not the strongest, right, but it's the creativity and the risk-taking that's gotten me here."

Creativity and risk-taking? Sounds like exactly what the USMNT needs as it gears up for the Gold Cup. After years on the sidelines, Luna is finally a shoo-in for the senior roster.

Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid at the end of the La Liga season and take over as Brazil head coach, according to multiple reports. 

Ancelotti, according to The Athletic, will lead the Selecao through the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America on a one-year deal. Following a deflating elimination from the UEFA Champions League losing both quarterfinal legs to Arsenal, reports of Ancelotti's departure started to take off. After losing to the Copa del Rey final to Barcelona, it appears all that's left to figure out is how Real Madrid goes about announcing his exit. 

Real Madrid are still competing for the La Liga trophy with one final Clasico scheduled for Saturday, May 11. If the points gap remains the same heading into the tie, a Los Blancos victory would cut the gap to just one point. 

The Brazilian Football Confederation want Ancelotti on the touchline for Brazil's friendlies in June against Ecuador and Paraguay, according to Fabrizio Romano. It would be a quick turnaround going from Real Madrid's final game on May 25 to the Brazil national team on June 4, but there's little time to waste if he's going to install his tactics and system with the World Cup just over a year away. 

Ancelotti leaves Real Madrid for the second time with two La Liga titles, a Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de Espana and UEFA Champions League trophies. He also won the UEFA Super Cup in 2022 and 2024 plus the old FIFA Club World Cup. The expectation is that Real Madrid will have a new manager on the touchline for the new Club World Cup come the summer.

He'll continue to manage the likes of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Endrick with Brazil while aiming to get the most out of other talent like Raphinha, Gabriel, Bruno Guimaraes and more.

The 2024-2025 season may have been a largely disappointing one for Norwich City in the EFL Championship, English soccer's second tier behind only the Premier League, but for U.S. Men's National Team forward Josh Sargent, it has been another solid campaign.

Despite requiring midseason groin surgery, the 25-year-old has continued to impress for the Canaries, scoring 15 goals in 32 games, including a run of 11 goals in 15 games in the second half of the season during which he was also named captain for the first time. Sargent's goals haven't been enough to turn the tide in Norwich's favour, though, with the Canaries sitting 14th in the league as they head into the summer without a head coach.

Sargent's excellent form led to him being named to the EFL's Championship Team of the Season, alongside teammate Borja Sainz. Speaking at the awards ceremony, Sargent said it felt “very good” to be named to the team. Meanwhile, with Norwich staring down another season in the Championship, they now face the prospect of taking on Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham twice next year after they confirmed their third-straight promotion.

“I think both of us worked very hard to be in the team,” he told Norwich's social media team. “Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out with the results for the team, but very happy on an individual note for both of us to make this team.”

Sargent went on to add, “I think there's a ton of talent in the league, and just very honoured to be able to be in this team and be one of the guys in the team of the season.”

While he may be a fan of the league, it seems he may soon be set to leave the Championship, with Sargent's form having attracted interest from teams in the Premier League and Bundesliga, as per Florian Plettenberg. With his current contract not set to expire until the summer of 2028, he could fetch around €15-20M ($17-22.8M).

Sargent has experience in both leagues, having spent three seasons in the German top tier with Werder Bremen, scoring 11 goals in 71 games prior to their relegation in 2021.A subsequent move to then-Premier League side Norwich saw Sargent find the back of the net just twice as they too were ultimately relegated.

However, his subsequent three seasons in the Championship have seemingly helped the American find his feet, scoring 44 goals in 97 league games, also helping him return to the fold with the USMNT.

Over the last year, Sargent has made five appearances for the USMNT, including three under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Unfortunately, despite his upturn in league form and opportunities on the national stage, the scoresheet continues to evade him, with his most recent international goal having come back in 2019.

Now with friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland scheduled for early June and the CONCACAF Gold Cup taking place shortly after, Sargent has a battle on his hands if he's to convince Pochettino to give him another chance. This may have been made ever harder by Haji Wright's return from injury and solid form for Coventry City, Brian White's excellent season with the Vancouver Whitecaps, and Folarin Balogun's recent return from a lengthy injury layoff with AC Monaco.

Across the Atlantic this week, the USMNT's overseas contingent has savored titles (and tangerines) in Scotland and enjoyed the magic of the FA Cup at Wembley. But some things don't change: once again, Christian Pulisic gave Milan something to cling to.

Elsewhere, Johnny Cardoso and Paxten Aaronson turned heads in La Liga and the Eredivisie, but Wolfsburg's Kevin Parades suffered a blow as he continues his return from a foot injury.

Read on as this week's USMNT Player Tracker brings you all the ups and downs of the players national head coach Mauricio Pochettino will turn to this summer.

Pulisic's nerves of steel meant Milan clung onto their hopes of Champions League football next season.

The USMNT star was unflappable when presented with an early unexpected chance to score against Venezia on Sunday, on what manager Sergio Conceicao said was a small, dry pitch that wasn't easy for his players.

An error from the hosts at the Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo, when they gave the ball away cheaply in their own half, allowed Milan's Youssouf Fofana to seize possession and play in Pulisic at close range.

Of course, the 26-year-old stayed cool and put it in the back of the net, giving the Rossoneri a major boost after just five minutes.

That was it for another agonizing 91 minutes, as Milan had to fight against the relegation-battling Venetians before Santiago Gimenez made it 2-0 in stoppage time at the end.

Pulisic's big moment earned him the nod from Milan fans as man of the match, and he also put himself in elite statistical company. According to Opta, the goal meant he is now only one of the three Serie A players to have been directly involved in at least 50 goals (31 goals and 19 assists) in the last two seasons in all competitions, alongside Atalanta's Ademola Lookman (50) and Lautaro Martinez (54) of Inter.

In terms of what it means for his club, they are still eight points away from the Champions League qualifying spots with four league games remaining. It will be a tall order to drag themselves ahead of the teams above them, not least Weston McKennie's Juventus, who are currently fourth and also won on Sunday.

But after springing something of a surprise win over rivals Inter last week to reach the final of the Coppa Italia, then winning in Venice, at least Pulisic and co are developing upward momentum in the closing stages of what remains a below-par season.



It was an altogether more decisive win for Pulisic's international team-mates in Scotland on Saturday.

But USMNT defender Cameron Carter-Vickers probably did not envisage spending a few minutes picking tangerines off the field before later celebrating his team being crowned champions.

Celtic's 5-0 thrashing of Dundee United earned the 27-year-old a fourth title medal with Celtic in a game that was interrupted during the first half when Celtic fans threw the fruit onto the field as a protest against their opponents' ticketing prices for the game.

Around the 12-minute mark, the supporters in the away section threw the tangerines and unfurled a banner reading “£njoy th£ fruits of our labour”.

That aside, it was easy work for Carter-Vickers and his team, who have now won the Scottish top flight 13 times in the past 14 seasons.

Carter-Vickers was a happy man, then, but he disagreed when asked afterwards whether Celtic had to set the record straight in their next game, which happens to be against rivals Rangers, who have dented an otherwise glittering season by beating them twice.

Play is stopped as tangerines?… are thrown on the pitch by the Celtic supporters.

“Yes. I mean, some people might say set the record (straight),” he told the Daily Record. “I wouldn't personally use that kind of language because for me, it's not just like one or two games in the season, but the whole 38.

“And I think we've shown over the 38 games that we are the best team. But, yeah, we definitely want to win the game next weekend and put in a strong performance because, at the end of the day, we know it's something that the fans care about and we care about also.

“Of course we want to win. We want to win every game we play. And that's no different for who it is.”

It might have been a less perfect afternoon for Carter-Vickers' U.S. team-mate Auston Trusty, who was benched and did not make it onto the field in the game that confirmed their title.

Trusty, who recently became a new father, has not featured in three of his team's four most recent games. On Saturday, manager Brendan Rodgers preferred Republic of Ireland defender Liam Scales ahead of him.

But he did not let that spoil the fun for him and was on the fruit-free pitch to enjoy the post-match celebrations.

The Champagne wasn't quite uncorked yet for another USMNT defender on Saturday, but it could be on ice.

Chris Richards took his usual place in Crystal Palace's indomitable back three at Wembley in their hugely impressive 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa.

The south London club will now face Manchester City in the final on May 17, after Pep Guardiola's side beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 in the other semi on Sunday.

Before Palace's big win, Richards did the media rounds and chatted with Men in Blazers, who asked him about the USMNT's woeful performances in March's Concacaf Nations League semi-final and third-place games.

“I think the best adjective for what happened in the last camp was we got Concacaf'd,” he said. “We're going to have to put this show pony-ness away.”

Then asked why the U.S. players haven't always been able to translate successful club form onto the international scene, he added: “One of the reasons I think that everyone has been so successful at their clubs is you're in that environment every day.

“I know it's hard to emulate that when it comes to national team, but I think that's why guys seemed so much more in tune or sharper — you're playing with these guys every single day and when you're coming to national team, these are guys you only train with, depending on flights, depending on times, maybe two days leading up to a game.



“I understand that's what every national team is doing, so there's no excuse, but we needed to be more competitive in the last camp and I think going forward, not just from the players' aspect but from the coaching aspect… we kind of had a coming-to-Jesus meeting after the last game and we can't let something like the last camp happen again — especially leading up to a World Cup.”

Name: Ethan Horvath
Club: Cardiff City
Position: Goalkeeper
Appearances (all competitions): 18

Horvath experienced the low of relegation with his Welsh club on Saturday when their 0-0 draw with U.S.-owned West Brom sealed their EFL Championship fate.

It meant Cardiff will be in League One, England's third-tier, next term, but the 29-year-old, who joined the Bluebirds in the winter transfer window, still made some excellent saves on a difficult afternoon.

Name: Kevin Paredes
Club: Wolfsburg
Position: Midfielder/wing-back
Appearances: 2

Paredes was so impressive on his return from long-term injury last time out, creating a goal in the 2-2 draw with Mainz, that he kept his place for Wolfsburg's game against Freiburg on Saturday.

However, it was a difficult afternoon for Ralph Hasenhuttl's side, who were reduced to 10 men after just 26 minutes and ended up losing 1-0. Despite the result, Paredes looked sharp again until he was forced off just past the hour with a hamstring problem.

That is believed to be a minor strain and while he is likely to miss the next game against Gio Reyna's Borussia Dortmund, he should be back in contention for Wolfsburg's final two fixtures of the Bundesliga campaign.

Perhaps Paredes will have the words of the national coach in his mind after Pochettino said last week that the USMNT needs players to “fight for the people that would love to be in your position” and “the right characters to be really competitive”.

The 21-year-old, who fell to his knees and sobbed when his young U.S. side were knocked out of the men's soccer tournament during last summer's Olympics, is hoping that his will to win (and electric talent) catches Pochettino's eye. Now he must end the season with Wolfsburg strongly and earn a chance to feature in the USMNT's summer friendlies or Gold Cup campaign.

Name: Paxten Aaronsen
Club: FC Utrecht
Position: Midfielder
Appearances: 35

The 21-year-old is another young prospect hoping to gain more senior USMNT exposure this summer on the back of a strong season.

He grabbed an assist as Utrecht won 4-0 away at RKC Waalwijk in the Eredivisie. They're now fourth in the table and level on points with Feyenoord in third. Aaronson has been a key part of this push for Champions League football, with seven league goals to his name so far and having created four more.

His success means the Dutch club, who loaned him for the season from Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt, want to borrow the American again next season.

“We are in talks with Frankfurt,” said Utrecht coach Ron Jans recently. “We hope we can keep him for another year. It will take a few weeks before it is clear whether it will work.”

Whether Frankfurt are inclined to oblige remains to be seen.

(All Eastern Time)

Johnny Cardoso is having a fine old time with his club Real Betis. They're sixth in La Liga, on course for Europa League qualification and only six points off the Champions League qualification places.

Last Thursday, they thumped Valladolid 5-1, meaning they head into their Europa Conference League semi-final against Fiorentina on Thursday in fine fettle.

Cardoso's performances have caught the eye and he has been praised by former USMNT player Charlie Davies.

“Johnny Cardoso: we have to talk about him now, at the moment,” Davies said on CBS Sports Golazo America. “(He's) 23 years old, killing it at Real Betis, another massive goal for him at the club, and he was near perfect on the ball (in Betis' previous win over Girona). I think he's really found a good role within this team and Isco is the guy that makes this team tick, but in terms of being an outlet and being able to shuttle the ball across, he has great positioning.”

Watch them in that semi-final on Thursday (3pm, Paramount+).

By Saturday, we will know if Antonee Robinson has recovered from the knee pain that has plagued him lately to face Aston Villa in the Premier League (7:30am, Peacock Premium).

Given the load on him this season for club and country and the possibility of further football in the summer's Gold Cup, it will be vital that the left-back's minutes are managed carefully to prevent his knee issue becoming worse going into the World Cup year.

Also on Saturday, Bournemouth and Tyler Adams are charged with trying to end their season on a high after their promise stalled, leaving them in mid-table. They travel to second-placed Arsenal (12:30pm, Peacock Premium).

Finally, next Monday, see if Pulisic and Milan's belated mini-revival can keep going when they take on Genoa (2:45pm, Paramount+).

All eyes on the CWC because the Raumdeuter deserves a proper sendoff. 

With Thomas Müller's tenure at Bayern Munich coming to a close very soon, the attention is towards all the titles he can bag with the club before his departure. Müller's legacy at the club is unforgettable — he has played a pivotal role in the club's history. The trophies play testament — he is the second most decorated German player with 33 trophies after Toni Kroos. This statistic is however subject to change, with Kroos' retirement last year after bagging 34 trophies. 

However to Müller, titles do not mean everything. Per FIFA and @iMiaSanMia, he spoke on the upcoming Club World Cup. “It's not about titles. The title is just the piece of metal you get when you win the competition. But that's not what makes you happy,” he stated.

Further elaborating, he said that the journey matters more. “The journey there is what excites me. It's about constantly taking on the pressure, both physically and competitively – and winning,” he said. 

Looks like the Raumdeuter still enjoys winning but he just wants to do it in style. 

He explained his excitement about this tournament. “The attraction [of the competition], of course, is that it's a World Cup. In this format, it feels a bit more like a World Cup,” he described.

It goes without being said that all eyes will be on the CWC as it will be one last dance. For, the most unbelievable statement is now the truth — Thomas Müller will be playing his last game at Bayern Munich at the age of 35 years. The same age where the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Yann Sommer, Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski and Luka Modric were considered to still play at near-full capacity. Hell, they all bagged trophies at this age. One can only wonder what could have been, for it is only possible for us to enjoy the little time we have left with our own one club man.

ATLANTA (April 28, 2025) — U.S. Soccer is offering supporters a chance to etch their name and cement their legacy in the federation's new chapter with the U.S. Soccer Brick Program.

The new Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center is set to open in spring 2026 in metro Atlanta, and the program allows fans to be a part of the historic opening. Supporters can inscribe a custom message on a brick that will be placed in the entryway of the new facility.

About 4,000 custom bricks will be displayed in the grand entry, the Yazdani Family Plaza, on the north side of the walkway leading up to the main entrance of the National Training Center. Each message will celebrate soccer and each brick purchase will help push the sport forward in the United States.





Supporters can purchase a personalized brick — along with an included brick replica — starting April 28. Price points begin at $350 with multiple packages offering various sizes from 4”x8” up to 12”x12”.

To purchase a brick, fans can visit ussoccer.com/brickprogram, email customercare@ussoccerbricks.com or call 1-888-428-2001.

It sounds as if Hoffenheim want some financial compensation if Bischof is to join Bayern for the CWC.

In the summer, Bayern Munich will be participating in the inaugural summer edition of the Club World Cup. The tournament has been met with very mixed reception, but it will give incoming players a chance to immediately prove their mettle at their new clubs. Enter Tom Bischof, who has already agreed a free transfer to Bayern Munich for the summer. The 19-year-old Germany youth international will look to get a chance to prove he can compete with the likes of Joshua Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlović for a prominent role. 

However, there is a problem. Bischof's contract ends on the 30th of June, as is the nature of most contracts in European football, but the Club World Cup begins in mid June. If Bischof were to simply join in July, he would miss the group stages of the tournament, a very inconvenient situation indeed. Hoffenheim will need to release their youth academy graduate early from his contract, something their sporting director, Andreas Schicker, is willing to do. Still, a “good solution” will need to be found before Bischof can leave Hoffenheim: 

“Bayern have already contacted us. We won't stand in Tom Bischof's way. If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” Schicker tells reporter Dennis Bayer (via @iMiaSanMia). “I'm confident that a solution will be found.”

It sounds for all the world as if Hoffenheim want to receive a financial compensation in order to release Bischof from his contract, even though Hoffenheim will contest no matches during June. Would Bayern be willing to part with money to get Bischof in a few weeks sooner? We will have to see...

Looking for more thoughts and analysis of Bayern Munich's current transfer situation heading into the summer transfer window? What will the backline look like next season? Which attackers could leave? Is Florian Wirtz truly the answer to Bayern Munich's problems? Let's talk about all that and more on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works — Weekend Warm-up Show.

Losing the cup final to Barcelona was embarrassing enough, but Madrid went several steps further with their childish behaviour

In Japan, there is a philosophy that every person has three faces. The first is the one you show to the world, the one to be judged and build a public image upon. The second is what you portray to those closest to you. The third is who you keep to yourself, your true essence and personality, never to be cast upon by outsiders.

On Saturday in Seville, Real Madrid ripped off their third face like a mask and held it aloft, proudly or otherwise, as if it were Simba being raised up by Rafiki in the opening sequence of 'The Lion King'. Years, months, weeks and days of petulant nonsense came spewing out all ends before, during and after losing to Clasico rivals Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

It's bad enough being beaten by their nemesis from Catalunya on a normal day, but this was far from normal, even by these two raging crybabies' standards. What occurred in southern Spain this weekend will live on as infamous for Los Blancos, irrespective of how they will inevitably try and whitewash it from history.

Pep Guardiola has addressed recent reports claiming Kevin De Bruyne has no intention of representing Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup at the United States after being told he has no future at the Etihad Stadium.

De Bruyne will leave Manchester City at the end of the season after a decorated, trophy-laden decade in sky blue that has put him up there with the Premier League's best-ever imports and amongst the greatest midfielders to have played in England.

The 33-year-old was hopeful of a new deal to extend his stay at the Etihad Stadium but club bosses – including incoming sporting director Hugo Viana – relayed to the Belgium international that he does not feature in the club's plans next season.

     

Since his announcement confirming his impending departure earlier this month, De Bruyne has revealed in interviews he was left disappointed with the club's decision, admitting he was away from his family when Manchester City officials relayed their stance to the playmaker.

City are due to participate in the 32-club FIFA Club World Cup in the United States between June and July – between the end of their Premier League and FA Cup campaign(s) and the beginning of pre-season preparations for the 2025-26 campaign.

It emerged last week that De Bruyne has informed club bosses and Guardiola of his reluctance to travel with City to the United States for the Club World Cup amid fears of injury and a desire to take some time off to rest, recover and assess offers to make a decision on his future with his family.

After refusing to take questions on De Bruyne's future initially whilst speaking to the press ahead of Manchester City's FA Cup semi-final triumph over Nottingham Forest at the weekend, Guardiola was asked if there was any truth to De Bruyne's hesitation to play at the Club World Cup.

“I don't know any info about that,” said Guardiola, who kept De Bruyne on the bench for the entirety of Manchester City's 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Forest at Wembley on Sunday, with the Belgian expected to return to the lineup against Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.

Real Madrid is in one of the most critical stages of the season. With the final stretch of the competition in sight, decisions about the team's future are beginning to take shape. The most important: Carlo Ancelotti's future.

After a season of ups and downs and defeats in the Copa del Rey and the Champions League, the club would already be taking measures.

Although Carlo Ancelotti has a contract with Real Madrid until 2026, his future has been in doubt in recent weeks. The Italian, key in the club, has said he will respect Madrid's decision at the end of the season.

The latest setbacks, especially the eliminations in national and international competitions, have put his continuity on the line. According to Relevo, Madrid would have almost certainly decided to dismiss Carlo Ancelotti after La Liga, at the end of May.

This farewell could occur at Bernabéu, in a calm match, as the league options were reduced after the defeat against Barcelona.

If Madrid doesn't close the gap with Barcelona, May 25 against Real Sociedad could be the farewell of Ancelotti and his son, Davide.

With Carlo Ancelotti's departure, Real Madrid has already begun to think about the immediate future. One of the first challenges will be the Club World Cup, which will be played from June 14 to July 13 in the United States. According to reports from 'Relevo,' the club would have already spoken with Santiago Solari to take charge of the first team during this competition.

Solari, who is currently the Director of Soccer at Real Madrid, already has experience leading the first team. In 2018, when Julen Lopetegui was dismissed, Solari took on the responsibility of leading the team and achieved important victories, including the first major bet on Vinicius Jr.

Florentino Pérez sees Solari as the natural option for the Club World Cup, until hiring a long-term coach. The relationship between the Argentine and the club is solid, and his time with Castilla has allowed him to know Madrid's structure well.

This coaching change would be a provisional solution, as the club is searching for a coach for the next season. Xabi Alonso remains the favorite in the betting, although his situation at Bayer Leverkusen could complicate his arrival.

Alexander Zverev has long thrived at the Mutua Madrid Open, where he has earned two of his seven ATP Masters 1000 titles. 

The German is pursuing another crown this week at the Caja Magica, where he is the top seed.

ATPTour.com caught up with Zverev to learn how it all adds up for the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion. The No. 2 played in the PIF ATP Rankings discussed his favourite Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalries, why Madrid is his favourite tournament to play, which player knows him best and more.



What is your favourite tournament to play and why?
The most special tournament is to play the [Nitto ATP] Finals, because you know that you qualify for it as one of the best eight players in the world, so that's very special always. But my favourite tournament to play is probably in Madrid. Most successful tournament for me. Love the stadium, love the atmosphere. Really like playing there.

What is your favourite tennis rivalry?
All time, I like the Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi rivalry. Loved it as a kid. Obviously loved the Federer-Nadal-Djokovic rivalry, those three all together. I've really enjoyed the Tsitsipas-Medvedev rivalry. Now, Sinner-Alcaraz. There are always new ones coming along, but there's always some interesting ones.

 

Who's your greatest rival?
I played Medvedev the most. I don't necessarily think we played the biggest matches [with] each other in our careers, not the most important matches. I think the most important matches in my career [I] have played against Novak, Carlos, Jannik. But me and Medvedev, we played the most against each other.

Is it almost weird when you know somebody so well and know what they're going to do?
The person I know the best and the person that knows me the best is Andrey Rublev, because we've been playing each other since we were 10 years old. And it's funny, when we play each other, he knows where I'm going to serve. I know where he's going to hit his forehand. So, it's basically like ping pong tennis, in a way, sometimes. 

But it's different when you're playing someone for the first time, you're trying to get a feel for each other. When you're playing somebody for 15 years, you kind of know every single shot they're going to do. So, it's definitely different. It's definitely a part of our sport and that's the interesting part about tennis. 

What has a unique moment of your career been? Just a moment that stands out when you think about your career.
There's been a few. It's very tough to pick. First ATP title, I will always remember in St. Petersburg, it was against Stan. He [had] just won the US Open a few weeks before that. First Masters [1000] title in Rome. First [Nitto ATP] Finals title. The [Olympic] gold medal. It's difficult to pick, but I think the most special one so far is Tokyo. But I hope I'll make some more memories during my career. 

 

What is the biggest thing you've been chasing?
Win a Grand Slam. That's the most obvious answer for me right now.

How exciting is the chase?
I would love to stop chasing, get one rather sooner than later. It is just the way my path has been. Been in a few finals already, lost some tough battles. But I'm still here and I'm still going to go  [for it]. 

Is there anything you've gotten to do because you're a tennis player that's been a super cool thing off the court?
I think if you're a top tennis player, top athlete in general, we do get maybe a few more privileges than someone else. We get invited to some courtsides at games. I [have] played an exhibition match in some of the best stadiums around the world, played football in the Bayern Munich arena. So those things, they're special and I know that I only get them through tennis.

Eliakim Coulibaly, a 22-year-old left-hander, has become the first player from Ivory Coast to win an ATP Challenger Tour tournament—and he did it at the inaugural edition of his home tournament in Abidjan.In an all-African final at the Côte d'Ivoire Open, which was temporarily interrupted by rain, Coulibaly overcame top-seeded Tunisian Aziz Dougaz, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4. Despite Dougaz firing 12 aces, the home favorite kept his composure, broke his opponent's serve three times—and collapsed joyfully on the fully packed Court Central Kaydan after two hours and 43 minutes of play, amid deafening cheers.

Jack Draper became one of the biggest stories of the season when he soared to his first Masters 1000 title at the BNP Paribas Open. The win helped him clinch a Top 10 debut, but few eyes are on the 6'4” lefty heading into the clay-court season. Though it's thought to be his least potent surface, Draper played solid enough in his first outing of the year, winning a quick opener against Marcos Giron but losing to an inspired Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters.Draper was similarly effective to kick off his Madrid campaign, making quick work of Tallon Griekspoor to book a third meeting with Berrettini. Draper leads their head-to-head, 2-0, winning their most recent match earlier this season in Doha, but this is their first match on clay. Berrettini would also prefer a quicker surface, but proved lethal on clay when he outlasted top seed Alexander Zverev two weeks ago in Monte Carlo.Berrettini rallied from a set down to beat Giron on Saturday but has been trending up this spring, making Draper a prime target for another upset. Winner: Berrettini—David Kane👉 Click here for more news on the Mutua Madrid Open.

The former “Break Point” star is prioritizing his privacy in the wake of the new series featuring Carlos Alcaraz.ByDavid KanePublished Apr 28, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 28, 2025

Daniil Medvedev is happy to entertain fans on the tennis court but is drawing the line at kind of 24/7 access Carlos Alcaraz gave to create his self-titled Netflix docuseries.Though Medvedev and Alcaraz participated in Break Point, an ensemble reality series that ran two seasons on the popular streaming service, the former was critical of his portrayal in the wake of the second season's release.“The series is not real life,” said the 2021 US Open champion of what fans and fellow players deemed his “villain edit,” and the experience appears to have soured him on the medium going forward.“I saw, for example, how Carlos's one was done, you know, and, damn, it's cameras all over you, all over the day,” Medvedev said at the Mutua Madrid Open on Sunday. “That's not me. That's just, I mean, I get, like when I'm on court I try to sign a lot of autographs. When I'm, let's say, even if you're in the official hotels or you're out on a holiday, a lot of people camp outside the hotels. And it's fine, I sign, I take pictures. But like when I'm having dinner, when I'm with my family I don't.“I sometimes can be, it's not rude, but people are like, ‘Oh, let's take a photo,' when I'm eating dinner. And I'm like, ‘Nope.' After dinner's it's okay. So I'm pretty, I can be pretty rude with my personal space.”

But like when I'm having dinner, when I'm with my family I don't.“I sometimes can be, it's not rude, but people are like, ‘Oh, let's take a photo,' when I'm eating dinner. And I'm like, ‘Nope.' After dinner's it's okay. So I'm pretty, I can be pretty rude with my personal space.”

“The series is not real life,” said the 2021 US Open champion of what fans and fellow players deemed his “villain edit,” and the experience appears to have soured him on the medium going forward.“I saw, for example, how Carlos's one was done, you know, and, damn, it's cameras all over you, all over the day,” Medvedev said at the Mutua Madrid Open on Sunday. “That's not me.

Medvedev eased through his first match in Madrid on Sunday after getting a walkover into the third round.

Alcaraz's series, entitled My Way, dropped last week and chronicled the Spaniard's 2024 season with featured interviews from coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, idols like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal and members of his family—Medvedev citing the latter as a primary reason for his reluctance.“If I give it to the documentary I'm going to get nuts, like because, especially when you give your permission to them, they want more. They want to film your daughters, they want to film your wife, they want to ask them questions, they want to ask you more about your personal life.“I remember I saw an interview of Jack Harlow, and he said that people around you, not your friends, like fans and everyone, they want to know everything about you. They want to know who you date, who, how, what you have for dinner, if you take your shower for 5 or 15 minutes. But you need to keep something for yourself, otherwise they take all your life away.“So that's probably why I will never do a documentary, but let's see, I never say never.”Perhaps Medvedev takes the camera into his own hands and launches a YouTube channel, but few can argue the former world No. 1, who is looking to complete a set of Masters 1000 semifinal appearances at the Caja Magica this week, doesn't already give us plenty of content.

MADRID -- Mirra Andreeva was serving for the match when the power went out early Monday afternoon.

“It was 15-40 on my serve,” Andreeva later told reporters. “I was like, `Oh, Mirra, please -- please -- do everything in your power to take this game and finish the match. Because I knew that if it would go to 5-5 probably we would have to wait and I would be here yet.”

Madrid: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Coco Gauff had already closed out Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-2 and was in the midst of her on-court interview when the microphone died. Security quickly ushered her back to the players' lounge.

“It was pitch-black, and I got the gist that the power went out,” Gauff said. “I thought it was just us and then I realized it was the whole country -- that's just insane.”

Not just all of Spain, as it turned out, but much of Europe, affecting many millions. Initially, the cause was unknown but early reports cited issues with the European electric grid.

As a result, Andreeva -- eventually a 6-1, 6-4 winner over Yuliia Starodubtseva with the chair umpire calling the lines -- and Gauff were the only players to advance to the quarterfinals at the Mutua Madrid Open on schedule. They will play each other later in the week.

“Last time I faced her on clay was Roland Garros 2023,” Andreeva said. “The first set was tight, but the rest of the match was like ehhh. She didn't give me a chance. But it was two years ago, so I'm just super excited to not take revenge but to see how different I play. I think it's going to be an entertaining match.”

Andreeva is through to the quarterfinals for the second straight year.

“This year, going to try to advance further,” she said. “I'm going to do everything possible to win this.”

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

While chaos reigned outside the site -- the internet, rail systems and airports were all shut down -- there was a sense of community, driven by their shared experience, among the players.

“Everyone is using the phones with flashlights,” Andreeva said, “but it's also kind of fun because everyone is talking together, the atmosphere is a little bit more friendly.”

Said Gauff, “I was literally thinking the same thing. Most of the time we're trying to prepare for our matches, everyone's zoned in and we all understand that, I was talking to Frances [Tiafoe], talking to Mirra, too, Diana [Shnaider], Maddy [Keys].

“This is the type of situation, it's light-hearted, nobody knows when they're going to go on.”

“This is my first blackout,” said Andreeva, who was happy to have a book and some Uno cards to pass the time. “It's actually kind of exciting because I've never experienced anything like this. I'm super happy that they put me first so I got to finish everything on time.

“But I don't want to spend the night here and sleep in the gym, but we're going to see what they tell us and just go from there.”

Not everyone was so lucky. Grigor Dimitrov was serving for the match in Manolo Santana Stadium against qualifier Jacob Fearnley when play was suspended.

“That's tennis, that's life,” Gauff said. “I feel like at this point this is only a situation you can laugh at if I was on court. Because it's probably not going to happen ever again and we'll always remember the day the power went out at Madrid Open.”

A post shared by #MMOPEN (@mutuamadridopen)

On Sunday, Gauff requested the schedulers to place her match second in the order of play.

“But I'm glad that request didn't go through,” she said, laughing. “Shoutout to the WTA supervisors for making the right decision for me.”

The greatest hardship at that early juncture, she said, was the inability to take a post-match shower.

“There's no running water so I just had to take baby wipes and wipe myself,” Gauff explained, “and spray some perfume and call it a day. I don't think we're even going to be able to go back to the hotel because the traffic lights are out.

“It's just crazy how much we depend on electricity, it's really insane and puts it in perspective. Also makes me think about the humans before electricity and how impressive that is.”

Carlos Alcaraz received flak from his agent, Albert Molina, and psychotherapist Juanjo Moreno for taking a trip to Ibiza midway through last season. Alcaraz felt the need for a little breather after a heartbreaking loss to Novak Djokovic in the French Open 2024 semi-final. Subsequently, he went to Ibiza, a well-renowned place for partying and nightlife. The decision reaped rewards for the Spaniard as he came back rejuvenated, with a hunger for victory.

The World No.3 was reprimanded by his agent Molina, but he knew what he was doing. The break immensely helped Alcaraz as he immediately won the Queen's title and then went on to take the momentum to attain the Wimbledon glory, by beating Djokovic in straight sets.

On the occasion of the release of "Carlos Alcaraz: My Way", a Netflix docuseries of the tennis sensation, his agent revealed what he suggested to his client back then.



"I tried to explain to him that it might not be the best idea to go to Ibiza for three or four days on vacation when he had a tournament at Queen's the following week and Wimbledon after that," Albert Molina told Netflix.

"I remember looking at Carlos and saying, 'Carlos, now's not the time. You're being selfish in the present with your future self.' And coming from Ibiza, he hadn't had enough time to prepare for Queen's to really guarantee a win," Juanjo Moreno said while echoing Molina's complaint.

While the experts he hired made all the sense and were talking in the best of Carlos Alcaraz's interest, Alcaraz went his way, and in hindsight, it could be gauged as the best decision.

Alcaraz narrated in the series that he took the call to have a short trip because the decision had worked before for him in the past.

"In 2023, I was already very mentally tired. It was 24/7, 100% thinking about tennis. And at Roland Garros, I lost to Djokovic in the semifinals. And I had a friend who had a few days off, going to Ibiza with other friends," Carlos Alcaraz said in his Netflix docuseries. "I really made the most of it because I knew I might not get another three days like that. When I got back, I won Queen's and Wimbledon, of course.

"I'm not saying I won because of the partying but those days were good for me. And I believe if things are going well, you have to keep at it. I had to do it again this year."

Carlos Alcaraz has won four Grand Slam titles till now, which is a towering feat at 21. He will be looking to augment the number this season, as he is seen as the heir who will take the glory of Big 3 forward.

In the latest edition of Second Serve, our weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC tennis reporter Jonathan Jurejko weighs up the pros and cons of the extended Madrid Open.

With the two-week Madrid Open reaching the halfway point, it is the perfect time to revisit a thorny issue in tennis.

Stretching several ATP and WTA tournaments across a fortnight has caused some controversy - and it's debatable how successful the move has been.

The thinking was the elongated events would have greater gravitas - essentially creating 'mini Grand Slams'.

According to ATP and WTA bosses, that meant increased financial opportunities for more players.

Another benefit would be players having days off between matches, allowing for better recovery and, in theory, more high-quality matches.

Fans, in turn, would be more engaged and media coverage would increase, creating a buzz around them like the existing four majors.

For many, it has not panned out like that.

The players are certainly divided. In Madrid, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek both responded positively when asked what they preferred.

Sabalenka said she enjoys the longer format because she can "rest" physically and mentally between matches, while Swiatek added she doesn't "think about it anymore".

But the top stars - the ones who go regularly deep in these draws - are the players more likely to benefit from the days off.

Others further down the chain have voiced concerns.

The recent lawsuit lodged by the Professional Tennis Players' Association - which claimed to be on "behalf of the entire player population" - said that "instead of providing professional tennis players more rest between tournaments to endure a longer season, the ATP and WTA have given them less".

It was also telling that Novak Djokovic, who co-founded the PTPA, gave a lengthy answer about the subject in his pre-Madrid news conference.

Asked about Carlos Alcaraz saying he felt like a "slave" to the game, Djokovic referenced the negative effect of the extended events.

"Now we essentially don't have four Grand Slams - we have maybe 12 Grand Slams. It's a lot," he said.

Seven of the nine ATP Masters are now played over a fortnight, along with six of the 10 WTA 1000s.

The first week of the combined Madrid Open - a mixture of qualifying and main-draw matches -  felt like a slow burner.

The main stadiums at the Caja Magica were rarely full, although the grounds were swelled by hundreds of children on school trips. 

For many of those further afar, the disjointed scheduling can seem illogical and difficult to follow.

Will anything change?

ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi is committed to the format and, while the WTA insists the circuit is always under review, its chair Steve Simon also believes the structure does not increase workload.

It seems, as Swiatek basically said, everyone will just have to get on with it.

Emma Raducanu again had Mark Petchey in her coaching box at the Madrid Open. The British number two says she is happy with the "informal" arrangement". 

Will Carlos Alcaraz be fit enough to defend his French Open men's singles title? The injured Spaniard hopes so, but is unsure whether he will be able to play beforehand after pulling out of Madrid.

The strange times continue for Novak Djokovic. The 37-year-old says losing his opening match of a tournament for the second time in a row is his "new reality".

While the rankings are not updated until after Madrid, the live standings show  a few interesting things.

Russia's Diana Shnaider is set to reach a new career high - and could break into the top 10 for the first time - if she goes deeper than the last 16.

In the men's rankings, Russia's Andrev Rublev will drop out of the top 10 after his Madrid title defence ended in the last 32, while Italy's Lorenzo Musetti is provisionally into the top 10 for the first time.

Most eyes this week will remain on the latter stages of the Madrid Open.

The prizes will be handed out at the weekend, with the women's singles final on Saturday and the men's on Sunday.

Attention will also increase over the coming days on another big story - Jannik Sinner's comeback.

Sinner, the men's world number one, is set to make his return from a three-month doping ban at next week's Italian Open.

World number six Jack Draper has led the British charge at the Madrid Open and was one of three men to reach the last 32.

Cameron Norrie has found a timely return to form after winning his first ATP main-draw matches since Indian Wells, while Jacob Fearnley - playing only his second tour-level clay-court event - came through qualifying.

The three British women who directly entered the main draw - Katie Boulter, Raducanu and Sonay Kartal - all won their opening matches before falling in the second round.

Francesca Jones fought through qualifying to reach the first round where - playing for the third straight day - she lost a tight battle to 2024 Australian Open semi-finalist Dayana Yastremska.

Boulter, playing alongside Daria Kasatkina, lost in the doubles first round, as did Olivia Nicholls with partner Tereza Mihalikova.

With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.

As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.

As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.

Roland-Garros and Rafael Nadal have always been a love story written in red clay. Across two decades, the Spanish legend carved out an unparalleled legacy with 14 French Grand Slam titles, defining an era and earning his crown as the undisputed King of Clay. Now, as the 2025 tournament begins, that love story will be celebrated in unforgettable fashion with tickets and travel packages still available.

On Sunday, May 25, just one month from now and the opening day of this year's tournament, Nadal will be honoured in a special ceremony on Court Philippe-Chatrier. Following his official retirement in November 2024 after Spain's Davis Cup campaign, the 22-time Grand Slam champion is set to return – not to compete, but to be commemorated. French Grand Slam director Amelie Mauresmo announced the plans earlier this week, calling Nadal's contribution to the sport “deserving of the highest order of recognition.”

The tribute will take place during the day session in front of what is expected to be a capacity crowd. The ceremony will also honour 2000 women's champion Mary Pierce and French veteran Richard Gasquet, who is set to play his final Roland-Garros.

The ATP Tour calendar currently has a heavy focus on clay, with the various events building up towards the French Open.

Casper Ruud is being tipped to win the French Open this year, but he is first eyeing success at the Madrid Open this week.

Carlos Alcaraz is capable of shining on clay in the absence of Rafael Nadal, although worryingly he was forced to withdraw from Madrid due to injury.

Nadal once dominated the clay courts, having won a record 14 French Open titles, with Alcaraz now aiming to take over from his idol.

Novak Djokovic meanwhile is still chasing an elusive 25th Grand Slam title on the ATP Tour, but his current form means that is unlikely to arrive at Roland Garros.

Djokovic suffered another early exit in his latest tournament in Madrid, with his struggles certainly suggesting that the changing of the guard is very much underway.

His fellow legends Nadal and Roger Federer have already retired, while the likes of young stars Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have been enjoying huge success in recent seasons.

Moreover, a handful of regular top 10 players are now losing their places in the leaderboard to their younger counterparts.

Daniil Medvedev sits 10th in the current ATP Live Rankings, with Ruud in 14th, Andrey Rublev in 17th and Stefanos Tsitsipas in 18th.

Taking their places high in the rankings are the likes of 23-year-old Jack Draper, who is in sixth place, and 21-year-old Holger Rune in eighth.

Fellow youngsters Lorenzo Musetti, Ben Shelton and Arthur Fils meanwhile sit ninth, 12th and 13th respectively.

It is a change in men's tennis that has seemingly been coming for a while, but the constant battling of veteran names such as Djokovic and Medvedev helped delay the process.

But it seems that fans must now accept that the past is the past and the new generation have officially arrived, without even mentioning future superstars Joao Fonseca, Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien and Alex Michelsen among others.

Ben Shelton took out a chunk of the electronic advertising board at the Madrid Open during his clash with Jakub Mensik. The big-serving American star went down 6-1 6-4 to the recent Miami Open champion after a delay in proceedings during the second set.

Shelton, up 40-30 in the fourth game, faulted on his serve and the ball ended up hitting the board that had been displaying adverts behind Mensik. Play was momentarily stopped as it emerged that the small individual panel that Shelton hit had been damaged, displaying a black screen rather than the advertisement.

“The board has taken a bit of a hammering there,” Sky Sports commentator Nick Lester said. The panel had fallen out of the board, such as the power it was struck by, before an official came out to put it back into place.

Play soon resumed but Shelton, the world No. 13, had little joy and succumbed to defeat against Mensik. The Czech teenager is enjoying a breakthrough campaign, having beaten Novak Djokovic in the Miami Open final last month.

The board was not the only one to suffer issues in Madrid, with Shelton calling for the doctor in an error-laden opening set. He was able to continue, improving his form in the second, but ultimately could not compete with another heavy-hitting server in Mensik.

“Today was a good day in the office on my return,” the 19-year-old said after booking his place in the fourth round. “I know Ben can serve much better, but in this high altitude, it's always tough to break him.

“I knew that he was not feeling very well, me neither. But I still tried to reach my best level and that was the key. I'm glad I came out with the win.”

Mensik dropped just two of 28 points behind his first delivery and will next face Alexander Bublik in the last 16. While Shelton should be sticking around in the Spanish capital as he is due to play doubles with Rohan Bopanna.

Mensik is on an eight-match winning run at ATP Masters 1000s, having claimed his first title on tour in Miami. He could crack the top 20 this week with a positive run and will be buoyed by his 67-minute win over Shelton, improving to 6-1 against top 20 players this year.

“I enjoyed it a lot with my family, my friends, my close ones,” said Mensik of his upset in Miami against Djokovic. “But it's just one tournament. I'm trying to improve myself every week, the journey is still long and my goals are even further.”

Former world number one Andre Agassi is set to make his professional debut in the booming world of pickleball next week, teaming up with top-ranked star Anna Leigh Waters for the mixed doubles event at the U.S. Open Pickleball Championships.





Pickleball is an exciting paddle sport cum tennis-badminton fusion created in the year 1965 by a group of Americans. Played on smaller courts, using a perforated plastic ball, it has rapidly gained popularity across America and beyond.

 Agassi Joins Forces with Anna Leigh Waters



Anna Leigh Waters, who was projected to earn over $3 million last year as a professional pickleball player, found herself in need of a mixed doubles partner for this year's U.S. Open, which kicks off Saturday in Naples, Florida.

That's where Agassi entered the scene.



“Andre's goals are to grow the sport of pickleball, and that's a huge goal of mine," Waters explained.

 

She added, “I thought if we partnered together, this would be a really awesome way to grow the sport."

 

 

 Agassi Brings Humor to the Court

Despite his legendary tennis credentials — eight Grand Slam titles and 60 ATP Tour victories — Agassi joked about his new role alongside Waters.

“She's probably sick of winning so much, and that's why she called me and asked me to play," Agassi quipped during an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.

 

 

 Not a Full-Time Transition

While fans may be excited to see Agassi in pickleball, the 54-year-old clarified that he doesn't intend to pursue a professional pickleball career beyond this event.

“If I had the luxury of bandwidth to focus all my energy on just playing and body recovery and all that stuff, that would be a joy. But I don't. I'm in a different season now," Agassi said, acknowledging that his life priorities have shifted.

 

 

The U.S. Open Pickleball Championships in Naples, Florida, are set to showcase not only the continued growth of the sport but also a unique crossover moment featuring one of tennis's most iconic figures.

Andy Cowell has admitted to Aston Martin's new wind tunnel “opening our eyes” in the weeks since it went live, with the team “looking forward to making a faster race car” as a result.

Commissioning a wind tunnel is the latest development in the Silverstone-based operation's ambitious plan to become F1 championship challengers over the coming seasons.

It has been slotted into their state-of-the-art campus next to the British Grand Prix venue, while complementing a works Honda power unit deal for 2026 and beyond, key hires including technical guru Adrian Newey and much more.

Team Principal Cowell confirmed that the wind tunnel has been in use since mid-March and is taking on both 2025 and 2026 aerodynamic development, with the first fruits of that labour due to hit the track soon.

“We've transitioned to this tunnel, and there's hardware coming through that we'll see at the circuit in the coming races,” Cowell explained at the recent Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, with Aston Martin previously using engine supplier Mercedes' wind tunnel.

“People often talk about how to tell the time when you've got two watches – how do you tell the aero load when development work has been done in one wind tunnel and then you swap across to the next?

“They'll never tell you exactly the same, but we are enjoying the new wind tunnel. It's opened our eyes to a few characteristics. Then you've got to do the work. If you've got a new test facility that gives you a clearer view, a more representative view, you've got to then do aero development work.

“You've got to change shapes, make parts, understand, and then make full-size components to bring to the circuit and measure in this complex environment. We're in that process, enjoying the new tool, and look forward to making a faster race car with it.”

Aston Martin's new wind tunnel has gone live amid a challenging start to the 2025 season for the outfit, who took just 10 points from the opening five rounds.

“I guess we're not happy with the performance of the car,” Cowell commented. “We'd like it to be quicker, we'd like to be picking up points at every single race. The team's very ambitious.

“But it's a complex business – lots of interacting systems from tyres to aero and others. Getting on top of all of that is exceptionally challenging. When you look at the lap time difference across all the teams, it is incredibly close.”

He added: “We're in the last year of these regulations. We're a relatively young team trying to dial in new tools and trying to understand it, and not just trying to survive, but to really succeed.

“There are many areas where, if we could go back to the start of the year with the same car, we could do better at every event. That gives us hope. There are relatively easy things we can do to move forward, but some exceptionally complicated things we've got master as well.”

Aston Martin's points tally puts them seventh in the Teams' Championship ahead of the Miami Grand Prix, with Racing Bulls, Alpine and Kick Sauber sitting behind them.

To open the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame-themed live episode of “American Idol” on April 27, 2025, Carrie Underwood wowed viewers with an updated rendition of the rock song she sang 20 years earlier as a contestant on the show. 

Underwood won “American Idol” in 2005 and is now in her first season of judging the show. In April 2005, the country singer — who was 21 at the time — broke out of her shell to sing Heart's “Alone” and blew away judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, and Paula Abdul. 

Although that performance didn't need a do-over, many viewers say Underwood, a huge rock music fan herself, took the tune to a new level with her 2025 rendition. 

Underwood first performed Heart's “Alone” on “Idol” in April 2005. Twenty years later, she revisited that performance in her “Idol to Icon” web series, sharing how nervous she was to appear with teased hair and sing something different than the judges were used to. 

But she did so well that Cowell made the now-infamous prediction that she'd not only win the competition, but “sell more records than any other previous Idol” — a vision that did come true. 

For her 2025 rendition of the classic Heart song, Underwood was full of confidence and displayed her impressive vocal range on the tune, stunning fans who flooded social media with reactions.  

One wrote on YouTube, “WOW! Breathtaking. The Very Best I've Ever Heard Carrie Sing!”

Former “Idol” contestant and rising country star Grace Leer wrote on Instagram, “INSANE!!!!' 🔥🔥🔥🔥”

Another fan on Instagram wrote, “Confirming we made the right choice 20 years ago 🔥👏”

A post shared by American Idol (@americanidol)

During her “Idol to Icon” episode on April 24 about performing “Alone” in 2005, Underwood reflected, “Song choice is so difficult when you are doing something like this, because just as much as people are listening to you sing it, they're thinking about the original song. And I remember week to week, you know, we would get critiqued, and it would be like, ‘Oh, you know, you're playing it so safe. You're being so safe with your choices.' And it's like, ‘Well, does that matter if I do a good job?'”

“And this week,” Underwood recalled, “I was like, ‘Okay, I'm just gonna throw caution to the wind. And I think I even remember, like, writing in my journal how much they were not gonna like me singing this song and being not so much worried. I was like, ‘They're gonna hate it, (but) whatever. I really want to do it. So, okay, let's go.' Never know what's gonna happen. Just gotta do the best you can.”

Although Underwood is one of the top country music artists on the planet, she is also a huge rock n' roll fan, so she relished watching the remaining top 14 contestants perform tunes made popular by Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees. 

After her performance of “Alone,” she took her place at the judges' table wearing a Guns n' Roses leather jacket, red bandana around her forehead, and ripped jeans. Explaining her outfit to host Ryan Seacrest, she said, she had to represent “the greatest band of all time with the greatest front man of all time,” Axl Rose. 

In May 2023, she told Howard Stern that she's been a Guns ‘n Roses fan “since birth” and joined the rock band for multiple concert dates that year, even serving as their unlikely opening act for three concerts in Canada.

Two years earlier, during a 2021 interview on “CBS Sunday Morning,” Underwood revealed that her workout playlists mainly consist of “metal or super-hard rock music” and said that I Prevail's hardcore “Trauma” was among her favorites.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: How is this for continuity — as the last of the current series created/co-created by Greg Berlanti, You, is topping Netflix's charts with its just-released final season, he is readying his next series — next three, that is, including Stillwater, which has been picked up by Amazon. Focusing on development and returning to writing over the past several months, Berlanti has set up the three high-profile new projects — all co-written by him — through Berlanti Prods. and Warner Bros. Television, where the company is based.


	In a bidding war, Amazon has landed mind-bending horror thriller Stillwater, based on the Skybound comic book series by Chip Zdarsky and Ramon K. Perez, with a series order. Berlanti and Carly Wray (Watchmen) are adapting, with Skybound Entertainment (The Walking Dead) producing.

	Details are sketchy on the third project, which is still in negotiations at Max, I hear. It is believed to be a family drama, which is intended to follow the 15 episodes a year at a reasonable budget model established by another WBTV drama series for the streamer, The Pitt.


	The new slate spans the gamut of genres that have signified Berlanti's writing career, from coming-of-age and family dramas that marked his early breakthrough on Dawson's Creek and first two series as creator, Everwood and Jack & Bobby, to comic book adaptations that highlighted the decade he spent building the CW's DC Arrowverse, to mysteries/thrillers with shows like You.


	Whichever of the three projects goes on the air first would mark Berlanti's first series as a creator/co-creator since the 2021's Superman & Lois. His Berlanti Productions, which he runs with longtime producing partner, the company's Chairwoman Sarah Schechter, has remained very active, launching half a dozen series over the past three years, including NBC dramas Found and Brilliant Minds, which are awaiting renewal news alongside Berlanti Prods.' long-running CW drama All American. The company also recently got a greenlight at Netflix for a high-profile Scooby-Doo live-action series and sold Dilettante, starring Jeff Daniels, to Apple TV+.

	











	After riding the Peak TV wave to establish himself as the most prolific producer in TV, breaking multiple times the record for most series on the air with as many as 18 concurrent shows, Berlanti, who last year received the TV Academy's Governors' Emmy Award, has shifted his attention back to the area where he first made a name for himself, TV writing.


	In Stillwater, penned by Berlanti and Wray based on Skybound's comic, when ex-con Daniel West receives a mysterious letter promising answers about his past and a substantial inheritance in the small town of Stillwater, he discovers a community where nothing ever ages, no one ever dies, and nobody ever gets out.


	Executive producing for Skybound Entertainment are founders Robert Kirkman and. David Alpert, Rick Jacobs, Head of TV Glenn Geller and Chip Zdarsky. For Berlanti Prods., executive producing are Berlanti, Schechter and President Leigh London Redman. Also executive producing the project are Wray, who is under an overall deal at WBTV, Robbie Rogers and former Berlanti Prods. executive Jonathan Gabay who worked on its development.


	Geller took the Stillwater comic book to Berlanti almost two years ago. The two previously worked together when Geller was President of Entertainment at CBS during Supergirl‘s season-long run on the network before the series, co-created/executive produced by Berlanti, moved to the CW. Redman and Geller also had worked together as executives at CBS.


	Written by Berlanti and Doran based on Jenkins' debut novel, Foster Dade is a mystery set at an East Coast boarding school that explores privilege, power, sexuality, and masculinity in the age of the Internet, anxiety and pharmaceuticals.


	Berlanti Prods.' Berlanti, Schechter, and Redman executive produce alongside Doran, Jenkins, Rogers as well as Donald De Line of De Line Pictures who has developed a movie with Doran.


	Wray has worked as a writer-producer on several WBTV series, The Leftovers, Westworld as well as Watchmen, sharing in its Emmy win for Outstanding Limited series. Her credits also include Mad Men and Mindhunter. She is repped by Untitled, WME and Johnson Shapiro Sleweet & Kole.


	In addition to The Walking Dead franchise on AMC, Skybound Entertainment is behind the hit Amazon adult-animation series Invincible, created by Kirkman. The company is in post production on two international series, Swedish-language disaster thriller Vaka for Prime Video Nordics and Spanish language series Dime Tu Nombre for Prime Video Spain.


	Doran recently created and executive produced the four-part BBC series Life After Life, based on the novel by Kate Atkinson, which is available on Prime Video. She also created and executive produced the Channel 4 series Traitors and worked on Netflix's Emmy-winning Beef. Doran's movie Henry, financed by Studio Canal, will shoot in 2026 with Ralph Fiennes starring. She is writing an adaptation of Witness For the Prosecution for Twentieth Century Fox and developing TV projects with Anne Hathaway at Amazon and with Playtone at Apple TV+. Doran is repped by UTA and Untitled Entertainment.


	Berlanti has served as a creator or executive producer on over 45 television series, including 9 that have hit the 100-episode mark. In addition to his TV Academy Governors' Award, he received the PGA's Norman Lear Achievement Award and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Berlanti is repped by CAA.

Shaun Gray, a cousin of 'Maverick' screenwriter Eric Warren Singer, seeks a "screenplay by" credit and a share of profits from the blockbuster sequel. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	Paramount has been sued by the cousin of a writer for Top Gun: Maverick, who alleges he cowrote the screenplay.


	In a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on Sunday, Shaun Gray says he penned key scenes for the film after screenwriter Eric Warren Singer and director Joseph Kosinski enlisted his help to craft the story behind the blockbuster sequel. He seeks a court order that would force Paramount to give him a writing credit and a share of profits.




	The lawsuit marks the second legal battle over the rights to Top Gun: Maverick. In 2023, the heirs to the author of a 1983 magazine story that inspired the original film accused Paramount of forging ahead with the project without renegotiating a new license. The plaintiff in the since-dismissed case was represented by copyright termination heavyweight Marc Toberoff.

	In a statement, Paramount Pictures said this lawsuit, “like the one previously brought by Mr. Toberoff in an attempt to benefit off of the success of Top Gun: Maverick, is completely without merit.” It added, “We are confident that a court will reject this claim as well.”


	Gray is the cousin of Singer, who was recruited by Kosinski to write the film after collaborating with him on Only the Brave. His credits show that he was a staff writer on an episode of Shantaram and was Singer's writer's assistant for The International. He's mostly worked as a digital artist, including on The Magicians, Defiance and Two and a Half Men.


	In the lawsuit, Gray says Singer, after being hired by Paramount Pictures to pen the screenplay for the movie as a work-made-for-hire, approached him in 2017 to cowrite it at Kosinski's request. Over the next five months, he actively participated in story meetings and “wrote key scenes” for vital action sequences, the lawsuit says.


	This includes the opening scene in which Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, pushes a high-tech prototype fighter jet past its limits, breaking speed records before the aircraft fails, and another sequence in which he repeatedly outmaneuvers elite pilots during a training exercise, culminating in a dogfight with a trainee. The lawsuit includes time-stamped files and emails that document his writing of the scenes.


	Gray argues he's a coauthor of the screenplay since he never reached a work-made-for-hire deal, which governs a production company's employment relationship with a writer and gives it the copyright to a script, with Paramount unlike other writers for Top Gun: Maverick, including Singer, Eric Kruger, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig and Justin Marks. He says he never entered into any written contract regarding his work on the movie.

	











	The lawsuit seeks a court order for Gray to receive a “screenplay by” credit moving forward, for Paramount to include him in future marketing efforts and works related to the movie and a cut of profit. If the court declines to issue such an order, he brings a claim for copyright infringement and seeks unspecified damages.


	In a statement, Toberoff said the lawsuit has “absolutely nothing to do with the priorTop Gun suit currently up on appeal.” He added, “Paramount can deny and deflect all they want” but that an exhibit included in the complaint documents “Shaun Gray's very significant joint-authorship of the Top Gun: Maverick screenplay with detailed citations to Gray's time-stamped files and time-stamped emails conveying to Eric Singer the numerous pivotal scenes Gray authored and, at times, to the film's director, Joe Kosinski as well.”

EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Pictures is continuing its strong relationship with its Top Gun: Maverick star Miles Teller as sources tell Deadline that Teller is attached to star in Paramount Pictures' Winter Games. Paul Downs Colaizzo is directing. Pat Cunnane and Colaizzo penned the script. 


	Film revolves around the high-stakes arena of the Winter Olympic Games, a perpetually overlooked skier and a self-sabotaging hockey legend who collide at their breaking points. Their unexpected connection threatens her chance for a medal and his shot at a comeback as they navigate romance and redemption in the Olympic Village.

	Tim and Trevor White are producing on behalf of Star Thrower alongside Teller. The film is in development. The project continues the studio's strong ties with Teller following the box-office smash hit Top Gun: Maverick. Teller is also attached to star in a remake of An Officer and a Gentleman.


			Watch on Deadline		







	This marks a reunion for Teller and co-writer Cunnane as well as the producing team of Tim and Trevor White of Star Thrower, who all recently worked together on the A24 pic Eternity.


	Prior to that, he portrayed Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw—son of the beloved “Goose”—in Paramount's Top Gun: Maverick alongside Tom Cruise. The sequel reunited Teller with Only the Brave director Joseph Kosinski and went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of all time at the domestic box office, surpassing Titanic. It earned $100 million in its opening weekend and grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide.


	In spring 2022, Teller starred in the critically acclaimed limited series The Offer for Paramount+, playing legendary Godfather producer Al Ruddy. His performance earned widespread praise and added to the series' strong reception.


	That summer, he reunited with Kosinski once again for Netflix's Spiderhead, a psychological sci-fi thriller based on the George Saunders short story from The New Yorker, later included in the author's collection Tenth of December.


	He recently wrapped production on two high-profile projects: Lionsgate's Michael Jackson biopic Michael and A24's Eternity, in which he stars opposite Elizabeth Olsen and Callum Turner. The film is already generating early awards buzz.

	











	Teller is repped by CAA and attorney Chad Christopher.

Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” tops the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart for a milestone 10th total and consecutive week. The single, whose title honors late R&B great Luther Vandross, who is sampled on it, became Lamar's sixth No. 1 and SZA's third. Lamar and SZA each extend their longest career Hot 100 reigns with the song.


	An elite 4% of all Hot 100 No. 1s (46 of 1,179, dating to the chart's Aug. 4, 1958, start) have ruled for double-digit weeks. Of those, “Luther” is the first by a solo man and woman and no accompanying acts – surpassing the nine-week reign of Diana Ross and Lionel Richie's “Endless Love” in 1981. (Among other 10-plus-week No. 1s by co-billed lead male and female acts, Puff Daddy and Faith Evans' “I'll Be Missing You” — featuring vocal group 112 — led for 11 weeks in 1997 and Mariah Carey and then-quartet Boyz II Men's “One Sweet Day” dominated for 16 weeks in 1995-96.)


	Plus, Alex Warren's first Hot 100 top 10, “Ordinary,” hits a new high (5-3), and reaches No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart, and Morgan Wallen and Post Malone's “I Ain't Coming Back” debuts at No. 8 on the Hot 100, becoming their 15th and 14th top 10, respectively. It's the sixth top 10 from Wallen's album I'm the Problem — all ahead of its May 16 release, as he extends his record for the most top 10s from an album prior to its arrival.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated May 3, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, April 29. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Luther,” on pgLang/Interscope/ICLG, totaled 68.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1% week-over-week), 21.9 million official streams (down 13%) and 2,000 sold (down 14%) in the U.S. April 18-24. (A week earlier, its chart performance was boosted by the April 11 premiere of its official video.)


	“Luther” leads Radio Songs for a fourth week and dips to No. 3 following seven weeks atop Streaming Songs.


	“Luther” concurrently collects an 18th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts.


	Two weeks after “Ordinary” became Alex Warren's first Hot 100 top 10, the song pushes 5-3 for a new best. It concurrently crowns Streaming Songs for the first time, with 21 million streams (up 3%). (While the song's sum of raw streams is the week's second-highest, after “Luther,” “Ordinary” tops Streaming Songs due to the application of weighting to all titles' paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streams and programmed/radio streams.)


	A week earlier, “Ordinary” became Warren's first No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, where it descends to No. 3 although with a 7% gain to 7,000 sold.


	Morgan Wallen and Post Malone's “I Ain't Coming Back” bows at No. 8 on the Hot 100. Released April 18, it totaled 19.5 million streams, 2.9 million in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first week.


	The song further ushers in Wallen's fourth studio album, I'm the Problem, due May 16; his tour of the same name is set to launch June 20. It's his sixth song from the set (all are confirmed as on its tracklist) to hit the top 10 – extending the record for the most Hot 100 top 10s from an album prior to its release. Here's a recap of the collection's top 10s to date:




	(Previously, Post Malone's Hollywood's Bleeding, in 2019, and Taylor Swift's Red, in 2012, each generated four Hot 100 top 10s before debuting, each at No. 1, on the Billboard 200 albums chart.)


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” keeps at No. 2, following five nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Drake's “Nokia” drops 3-4 on the Hot 100, after reaching No. 2.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” rebounds 5-4 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July. It adds a 42nd week atop the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Chappell Roan's “Pink Pony Club” backtracks to No. 6 from its No. 4 Hot 100 high and Wallen's “I'm the Problem” climbs 10-7.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, descends 7-10, as it tallies a record-extending 59th week in the top 10; a week earlier, it surpassed the 57-week run in the region of The Weeknd's “Blinding Lights” for the most such frames in the chart's history. “Lose Control” first hit the top 10 on the list dated Jan. 20, 2024, and has been absent from the tier for only eight weeks since.


	“Lose Control” notches an 88th week on the Hot 100 overall, one-upping Imagine Dragons' “Radioactive,” in 2012-14, for the sole third-longest stay in the chart's history. The only hits with longer runs: Glass Animals' “Heat Waves” (91 weeks, in 2021-22) and “Blinding Lights” (90, in 2019-22).


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Benson Boone's “Beautiful Things” holds at No. 9, after it hit No. 2 in March 2024.

Zach Cregger is citing how Paul Thomas Anderson's 1999 drama “Magnolia” inspired his “horror epic,” “Weapons.” Sure, it may seem like the iconic star-studded “Magnolia” doesn't have much in common with Cregger's (albeit secretive) sophomore film “Weapons,” but the writer/director is crediting how “Magnolia” gave him “permission” to think big.

“I just like that kind of unapologetic, ‘This is an epic,'” Cregger told Entertainment Weekly of the “Magnolia” effect. “I love that movie. I love that kind of bold scale. It gave me permission when I was writing this to shoot for the stars and make it an epic. I wanted a horror epic, and so I tried to do that.”

Even the aesthetic choices in “Weapons” have nods to PTA's masterpiece: Cregger said that “Weapons” star Alden Ehrenreich has a mustache for the role as a reference to John C. Reilly's “Magnolia” look.

While little is known about Cregger's latest horror/thriller, New Line Cinema chief Richard Brenner described the film as being “batshit insane.” Cregger agrees with that categorization, saying that the mystery of missing kids will “propel you through at least half of the movie, but that is not the movie.” He teased, “The movie will fork and change and reinvent and go in new places. It doesn't abandon that question, believe me, but that's not the whole movie at all. By the midpoint, we've moved on to way crazier shit than that.” 

Cregger added that the bidding war for “Weapons” after his 2022 debut hit “Barbarian” put the pressure on to deliver. “It was stressful,” Cregger said. “People might think from the outside looking in that I was flinging dollar bills in the air and calling enemies and saying, ‘Fuck you.' The truth of the matter was it's a very high-pressure thing, and people were getting pissed and it was stressful. I didn't totally get to unclench and appreciate what happened until maybe a week later when the dust settled and the adrenaline subsided.”

He continued that compared to “Barbarian,” “Weapons” is “more ambitious in almost every way.” 

“I don't just mean in terms of the budget, but I just mean creatively,” Cregger said. “The story is weirder and it's twistier and it's bigger. I have way more actors to fit into this thing. The set pieces are definitely bigger. It's just a bigger, weirder movie than ‘Barbarian' is.” 

 










“Weapons” premieres August 8 in theaters from Warner Bros. Pictures.

Episode 2 of “The Rehearsal” Season 2 saw Nathan Fielder engaging in the kind of elaborate simulation of a social interaction that has become his trademark in recent years. But rather than a bar trivia dispute or an uncomfortable cockpit moment, this rehearsal saw the comedian prepare to tackle a real problem from his own professional life: the removal of the Summit Ice episode of “Nathan for You” from Paramount+. 

Officially titled “Horseback Riding/Man Zone,” Season 3, Episode 2 of “Nathan for You” saw Fielder use his outlandish tactics to solve a variety of small business problems. The most notable storyline from the episode involved Fielder learning that the brand Taiga had published a tribute to a Holocaust denier, prompting him to start his own outerwear brand, Summit Ice, which placed Holocaust remembrance front and center. While the episode found humor in Fielder convincing a sporting goods store owner to let him build an elaborate display of information about Hitler's atrocities next to the jackets, Summit Ice has continued to operate as a real brand that donates all of its proceeds to Holocaust remembrance organizations.

Fielder has since moved on from “Nathan for You,” but “The Rehearsal” brought the show back to the public consciousness this week when Fielder revealed that the Summit Ice episode is no longer available on the show's streaming home. He traced the move back to a decision from Paramount+'s German division, which he claimed cited “sensitivities” over the “Nathan for You” episode's engagement with the Holocaust as a reason to pull it. The decision appeared to have ripple effects throughout the massive entertainment conglomerate, and the episode is now unavailable around the world.

Fielder used the episode's removal to make a broader point about the availability of Jewish content on Paramount+. “Currently on the Paramount app, there are 50 results for ‘nazi,' 10 for ‘Hitler' and zero for ‘Judaism,'” he said at one point during “The Rehearsal” episode. “We've been erased.”

Fielder admitted that he was in an awkward situation. Although he was no longer making “Nathan for You” for Paramount, the company backed his Showtime series, “The Curse,” which has yet to be renewed for Season 2. But even if the confrontation carried professional risk, Fielder was prepared to get to the bottom of the situation by hiring actors to help him prepare for a meeting with the head of Paramount+ Germany.

 










“Horseback Riding/Man Zone” is currently streaming on Max along with all episodes of “Nathan for You.” A Paramount+ spokesperson confirmed to IndieWire — following The Hollywood Reporter — that the “Nathan for You” episode was removed from the streaming service following a “standards review.” IndieWire has reached out for additional comment.

EXCLUSIVE: Following her star-making performance in the FX series Shōgun, Anna Sawai looks to have found her big follow-up. Sources tell Deadline that the Emmy winner is set to co-star in Amazon MGM Studios' How to Rob a Bank, from director David Leitch, Imagine Entertainment and 87North Productions. Sawai joins previously announced stars Nicholas Hoult and Pete Davidson, and sources say the film will be released in theaters. 


	Plot details are being kept under wraps, but given Leitch's track record of delivering on big thrills and fun set pieces in films like Bullet Train, Deadpool 2 and most recently The Fall Guy, expect something similar in scope.

	











	87North's Kelly McCormick and Leitch will produce alongside Imagine's Brian Grazer, Jeb Brody and Allan Mandelbaum. Mark Bianculli (Hunters, upcoming Cliffhanger reboot) wrote the script and will executive produce. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sawai took the town by storm last year following her Emmy-winning performance in Shōgun, winning the Golden Globe for Actress in a Television Series – Drama, an Emmy for Lead Actress in a Drama Series and a SAG Award for Female Actor in a Drama Series.


	Sawai is currently in production on (Saint) Peter, a coming-of-age dramedy executive produced by Peter Farrelly, and has recently wrapped production on the second season of Apple TV+'s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. She can also be seen in Seasons 1 and 2 of the Apple TV+ adaptation of Pachinko; Justin Lin's F9, the ninth installment of Universal's The Fast and the Furious franchise; the Netflix/BBC series Giri/Haji; and James McTeigue's Ninja Assassin for Warner Bros.

EXCLUSIVE: Production is underway in Vancouver on The Marshmallow Experiment, a raunchy coming-of-age comedy from Canadian production and finance company Big Picture Cinema Group.


	The film stars Dafne Keen (Deadpool & Wolverine), Sam McCarthy (Dead to Me), Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire), Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Josh Lucas (Ford v. Ferrari) and Sarah Chalke (Scrubs) in the story of a young internet-addicted teen (McCarthy) who, after bombing in bed with his dream girl, embarks on a wild, cringe-filled journey of digital detox. With influencer parents, rogue AI avatars and a talking gorilla as his guide, The Marshmallow Experiment tackles intimacy, identity and growing up unplugged — in the most online way possible.

	The U.S.-Canada co-production is written and directed by Richard Goldgewicht (Pablo), Matt Hamilton and Abe Frank.

	Essential is handling worldwide sales at the upcoming Cannes market and co-repping North America with UTA.


	Producer Jayce Barreiro commented: “Big Picture can't be more excited to be a part of this amazing film. The market is primed for the return of the raunchy comedy, which is not only relevant to today's youth and the struggles that only they have faced during their adolescence but also relates so closely to us parents as a reminder of the days when we were teens, trying to figure life out in an avalanche of doubt, confusion and sexual tension. We can't wait to have the audience laugh with us on The Marshmallow Experiment.”


	Director Goldgewicht added: “It's a comedy about impulse control and digital overload. We wanted it to feel funny, awkward, and heartfelt — something that taps into what it's like to be a teenager right now, stuck between screens, cravings, and a constant flood of noise.”

Drag entertainer and “RuPaul's Drag Race” alumni Jiggly Caliente, also known as Bianca Castro-Arebejo, passed away on Sunday, April 27, following a “serious health set back” that led to the amputation of her right leg. Since Jiggly's passing was announced by her family on Instagram, “RuPaul's Drag Race” stars from around the world have paid tribute to the late queen's legacy. 

“It is with profound sorrow that we announce the passing of Bianca Castro-Arebejo, known to the world and cherished by many as Jiggly Caliente,” wrote her family in a private statement, adding that “Biance passed away peacefully on April 27, 2025 at 4:42 am, surrounded by her loving family and close friends.

“A luminous presence in the worlds of entertainment and advocacy, Jiggly Caliente was celebrated for her infectious energy, fierce wit, and unwavering authenticity,” the statement continued. “She touched countless lives through her artistry, activism, and the genuine connection she fostered with fans around the world. Her legacy is one of love, courage, and light. Though her physical presence is gone, the joy she shared and the space she helped create for so many will remain forever.”

In the hours following the news of Jiggly's passing was announced, fans and fellow drag queens alike have released heartfelt tributes in her memory. 

Ginger Minj, who competed alongside Jiggly on “RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars 6,” responded to the news on Instagram, writing, “Jiggly was one of the fiercest, funniest, most loyal friends I've ever had. Over the past 11 years she taught me to stand up for myself, held me accountable when necessary, and never failed to make me laugh til I cried…Grateful I got to say goodbye, heartbroken I had to.”

“My jiggles,” added “Drag Race” judge Michelle Visage, “The laughter was endless, our talks were special, your energy was contagious. You were and remain so loved. This world has lost an angel and we want you to soar high.” 

Jiggly originally appeared on Season 4 of “RuPaul's Drag Race” in 2012 where she placed 8th. The queen later returned to compete on “All Stars 6” in 2021, where she placed 12th. In 2022, Jiggly was confirmed as a rotating judge for the spin-off series “Drag Race Philippines” and was set to join the judging panel for the upcoming series “Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.”

“Drag Race Philippines” judge Kalad Karen similarly paid tribute to Jiggly following her passing, writing, “Thank you for everything my dearest sister. Rest in power. ‘Drag Race Philippines' wouldn't be the same without you. I love you.”

World of Wonder, the company that produces “Drag Race” and its various spin-offs around the world, also released a statement paying tribute to the late queen. “We are devastated to hear of the passing of Bianca Castro, aka Jiggly Caliente. Jiggly's humor, love, and light touched so many in the ‘Drag Race' family and beyond. Her legacy will continue to uplift the communities she advocated for,” wrote the production company. 

The news of Jiggly's passing comes just days after her family shared a devastating health update, telling fans that “due to a severe infection, she was hospitalized and, as a result, has undergone the loss of most of her right leg,” adding that the 44-year-old queen's recovery would be “extensive.” 

In addition to her appearances on “Drag Race,” Jiggly has also had roles in series like “Broad City” and “Pose” as well as co-hosting “Translation,” the first major talk show on a major network (Out TV) hosted by an all-transgender cast. Jiggly co-hosted the show with fellow trans “Drag Race” contestants Carmen Carerra, Peppermint, and Kylie Sonique Love. 

Jiggly Caliente, 44, is the second “Drag Race” queen to pass away in 2025, following  “RuPaul's Drag Race UK” Season 1 winner The Vivienne, who passed away in January following a cardiac arrest that resulted from a ketamine overdose.

	When Mariah Carey received her second nomination for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year, the institution's foundation chairman John Sykes issued a statement celebrating the latest batch of nominees. “These remarkable nominees have each created their own musical style and attitude impacting generations of music lovers,” he wrote. Carey appeared on this year's ballot alongside Phish, Outkast, Oasis, Billy Idol, Cyndi Lauper, Joy Division/New Order, Soundgarden, the White Stripes, Joe Cocker, Bad Company, Black Crowes, Chubby Checker, and Maná.


	Carey was on the ballot in 2024, too. That time, she appeared alongside Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, Oasis, Sinéad O'Connor, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, Dave Matthews Band, Eric B. & Rakim, Foreigner, Peter Frampton, Jane's Addiction, Kool and the Gang, Lenny Kravitz, and A Tribe Called Quest. At the time, Sykes shared another iteration of his celebratory statement: “These artists have created their own sounds that have impacted generations and influenced countless others that have followed in their footsteps,” he said.

	











	The criteria expressed in these statements were no less true in 2024 or 2025 than they were in 2016, when Carey first became eligible for the prestigious honor. In fact, it barely took a decade after the release of her debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990 for her influence to begin crafting a new generation of pop divas who would take charge arranging their own vocals in the studio with the same authority they'd wield onstage. And yet, for the second year in a row, the singer, songwriter, and producer has been shut out from being inducted. Bad Company, Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, OutKast, Soundgarden, and the White Stripes will join the Class of 2025. With each passing year, the legacy Carey has crafted only becomes more indisputable. What else does the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame want from her? 


	Last year, Carey admitted to being slightly disappointed when she wasn't selected to be part of the Hall's class of 2024. “Everybody was calling me going, ‘I think you're getting in!' and so I was excited about it,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “But then it didn't happen.” She felt a similar sense of inevitability when her 1995 opus Daydream racked up six nominations at the Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. “One Sweet Day,” “Always Be My Baby,” and “Fantasy” — all of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 — were up for awards. “All those songs in a row ended up being so big,” she said, surely at least one would win, right? “Then I sat there the whole time and I didn't get anything. I was like, ‘This is not fun. But what can I do?'”

	Those three songs make up only a fraction of the 19 Number One singles Carey has earned in the past 35 years, 18 of which she is credited with co-writing. By 1998, she had enough hit singles to release her first greatest-hits compilation, Number 1's, featuring the 13 she had accumulated in only eight years. The musician is currently in the midst of celebrating the 20th anniversary of The Emancipation of Mimi, an album that caught an entirely new generation of pop listeners up to speed on her prowess as a hitmaker. It gave us “We Belong Together,” “Shake It Off,” “Don't Forget About Us,” and “It's Like That,” small pieces of what Carey told Rolling Stone in 2024 became “my favorite body of work that I've done.” 


	In the history of the Hall, some artists, like Patti Smith and Solomon Burke, were nominated between seven and nine times before being inducted. Chic has been nominated 11 times and has yet to be inducted (though Nile Rodgers was inducted into the Hall in 2017, receiving the Award for Musical Excellence). It took Janet Jackson and Joni Mitchell three nominations in three years long after their eligibility periods began to make it in. For Donna Summer, it was five nominations in five years. Even Brenda Lee, whose “Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree” goes head-to-head on the charts with “All I Want for Christmas Is You” each year, wasn't inducted until 2002, after three nominations. Like many of these artists, Carey should never have needed more than one.

	In 2022, Carey was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Her speech played up the dramatics that she's known for, but it also emphasized the years she spent “walking by myself and coming up with melodies and writing words in a book.” That accolade in particular meant a lot. She's “constantly” having to remind people that she's a songwriter, she said. But it was more than that. Questlove explained why. “That's the power of success, especially at Mariah Carey's level,” he said, “because you can be overlooked in certain respects and people will forget that you are an artist. People forget, and suddenly you just become the product.” 


	There's always been a prominent thread of resilience woven throughout Carey's career. She never lingers in the dark for long before stepping back into the spotlight (or the twinkling lights every holiday season). She's encountered her share of both real and contrived rivalries — par for the course for most pop stars — but never anything explosive enough to disrupt her unbothered aura of tranquility. She's released 15 studio albums and won six of her 34 career Grammy Award nominations. Her legacy was built on a concrete foundation of personal strength and one of the most singular voices music has ever known. Mariah is in the same vein as Janet and Whitney. Mariah is at the root of Christina and Ariana. One of one. 

	











	“There truly are no words that suffice. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this dream come true and for sprinkling your brilliance and magic on my little song,” Grande said when Carey, “the one and only, queen of my heart and lifelong inspiration,” appeared on the remix of her single “Yes, And?” in 2024. This is what Carey always wanted. “I don't want to just be categorized as ‘of this era.' My goal is to have a career that stands. Otherwise, what's the point?” she told Vibe in 1998. This is what she worked for. “[Sony] would put out like only four singles from one of my albums,” Carey said. “Where, like a Janet, would put out, like, seven, and they'd be working the same album for, like, two years. But with me it was like, ‘Get in the studio! More records! Sing! Sing!'”

	More than 1,200 artists, historians, and industry professionals — the Hall of Fame's voters — shape music history with boxes checked on a nominee ballot. The Hall selection criteria is meant to take into account an artist's impact on music culture, like Carey's trailblazing success as a female pop producer and songwriter in the face of corporate misogyny. It's also the influence an artist has had on other musicians, like Latto repurposing “Fantasy” into a hit for the 2020s with “Big Energy,” or Megan Thee Stallion boasting, “I feel like Mariah Carey/Got these niggas so obsessed” on her Number One single “Hiss.” The Hall also values range and longevity as they relate to both an artist's career and their body of work, reflected in Carey's positioning at the intersection between pop, R&B, and hip-hop (she even has a secret alt-rock/grunge album sitting in a vault somewhere).


	Whatever it is they're looking for, Carey has it. It's in her voice, it's in her songs, it's in her legacy. She's checked all the boxes. Now, it's the Hall's turn. Maybe the third time will be the Charmbracelet, but it's already overdue.

EXCLUSIVE: Following his work on Best Picture Oscar nominee Conclave, director Edward Berger looks to have zeroed in on his potential next project and is teaming with one of the town's biggest stars. Sources tell Deadline that, following a competitive situation, A24 has landed the hot package The Riders with Academy Award winner Brad Pitt on board to star and Berger set to direct. David Kajganich will adapt Tim Winton's novel. 


	The novel follows Fred Scully (Pitt), who, after traveling through Europe for two years, winds up in Ireland with his wife and daughter. And on a mystical whim of his wife Jennifer, they buy an old farmhouse that stands in the shadow of a castle. While Scully spends weeks alone renovating the old house, Jennifer returns to Australia to liquidate their assets. When Scully arrives at Shannon Airport to pick up Jennifer and their 7-year-old daughter, Billie, it is Billie who emerges — alone. There is no note, no explanation, not so much as a word from Jennifer, and the shock has left Billie speechless. In that instant, Scully's life falls to pieces.

	











	Scott Free's Ridley Scott and Michael Pruss will produce the film alongside Kajganich and Berger's nine hours, and Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner and Dede Gardner for Plan B Entertainment. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Scott Free has been developing the script for some time after Kajganich brought the 1994 novel to the company a decade ago, with the prodco at one point considering it as a potential directing vehicle. It recently caught the interest of Berger, who worked with Scott Free TV on AMC's The Terror, which Kajganich created and Ridley Scott executive produced. The script eventually landed in front of Pitt, and once he gave his commitment, it soon became one of the top packages to hit the market this year. And given the pedigree and star power, A24 was aggressive in its pursuit, ultimately landing the project.


	Production will commence in early 2026 and shoot in multiple locations across Europe. A24 will finance and handle the worldwide theatrical release of the film. 


	Pitt is expected to shoot The Continuing Adventures of Cliff Booth for Netflix next. The pic featuring one of Pitt's most iconic characters has David Fincher directing from a script by Quentin Tarantino.

	











	As for Berger, the Oscar-nominated All Quiet on the Western Front director had a number of options following the success of his Oscar-nominated Vatican thriller Conclave. He did recently attach himself to the Evan Gershkovich package that landed at United Artists, but with Pitt on board and The Riders a go script, this will likely be his next film.


	Next up for Pitt is the tentpole F1, which bows in June and was directed by Joseph Kosinski. Berger has the Netflix drama The Ballad of a Small Player bowing this fall. Colin Farrell is set to star, and the film is expected to be another contender this awards season.


	Pitt is repped by CAA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners, Berger is repped by CAA, Range and Casarotto Ramsay and Kajganich is repped by UTA and Anonymous Content.

“Wuthering Heights” fans are already up in arms over Emerald Fennell‘s adaptation of the Emily Brontë novel. 

Controversy ensued when the two “Wuthering Heights” leads were first announced, with Jacob Elordi reuniting with his “Saltburn” writer/director to play Heathcliff and Margot Robbie (who produced Fennell's prior two films through her LuckyChap banner) as Catherine. Was Robbie too old to play teen Catherine? Was Elordi the wrong casting for a character described in the novel as being “dark-skinned gipsy in aspect”? Add in the historically inaccurate wedding gown that Robbie wears in a first look at the film, and it seemed for some that the Brontë adaptation skewed from its source.

“There's definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy,” Cochrane said while at the Sands Film Festival in St Andrews, Scotland, per Deadline. “There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot. But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don't need to be accurate. It's just a book. That is not based on real life. It's all art.”

Cochrane added, “Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.” 

As for the alleged whitewashing, Cochrane said that she prefers racially blind casting. 

“If something is clearly written as white, for example, a script reads ‘she tied her blonde hair back,' but there's no specific reason for it, I will just put people on tape,” Cochrane said. “And then it's almost like I dare someone to question why I've done it, and they don't. So then it just becomes normal. Years ago, I would get people saying, ‘Did you read the brief?' And I'd say yeah, and this is my interpretation of it, just like when you can read a book.”

Hong Chau, “Saltburn” alum Alison Oliver, and Shazad Latif also star in “Wuthering Heights.” Warner Bros. opens the film February 13, 2026.

Cochrane said that along with Fennell, her favorite directors to work with include Robert Eggers, Alex Garland, and Lena Dunham.

 










“We've just got a really good thing going. And I genuinely feel safe in my workplace with them,” she said. “I feel like I can say to them, ‘Oh, look what if we do this,' and I'm not worried about getting fired, because that is a real fear, especially when you're on some of the studio stuff. I got fired recently. I don't want to work like that. I can't do my best work if I'm scared to offer an opinion.”

Beyoncé is all saddled up and ready to get her rodeo on the road. In a few hours, the musician will kick off the Cowboy Carter tour in Los Angeles, the first of 32 stadium shows scheduled in support of her country opus. On the eve of opening night, Beyoncé shared a preview of the elaborate stage design planned for the tour, paired with the caption: “She's Coming.”


	The video begins high in the rafters. As the camera moves forward, the expanse of SoFi Stadium comes into view. It captures crew members still hard at work assembling the set. The base of the stage is built in the shape of a star with three additional catwalks extending from there. It appears as though there are four additional risers and sections in place on the floor. 

A post shared by Beyoncé (@beyonce)


	Also known as the Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, the run of live shows follows 2023's Renaissance world tour. Beyoncé offered the first taste of Cowboy Carter live when she headlined the NFL Christmas Game Day halftime show, dubbed the Beyoncé Bowl. Her set that night included the ballads “16 Carriages” and “Blackbiird,” performed alongside country singers Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, and Reyna Roberts. She called back to the Renaissance era with “My House” and welcomed collaborators Shaboozey and Post Malone to the field.

	Beyoncé delivered live performances of “Texas Hold ‘Em,” “Ya Ya,” “Jolene,” “Spaghettii” mixed with “Riiverdance,” “Levii's Jeans,” and “Sweet Honey Buckiin.'” When the Cowboy Carter tour kicks off tonight, the audience, some of whom are already lined up outside the stadium, will be the first to hear selections from the extensive album track list live. “Bodyguard,” “Tyrant,” and “Ameriican Requiem” are among the most anticipated songs fans are hoping make the cut. For reference, the Renaissance tour set spanned between two and a half and three hours.


	The Cowboy Carter tour will extend through July 11. Beyoncé will make stops in Chicago, New Jersey, London, Paris, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.

The Beths have signed to Anti- Records, and, with that announcement comes plenty more news. The New Zealand indie-rockers are heading out on a lengthy tour of North America and Europe, and they've shared a video for the new song “Metal.” It's the first new music the Beths have released since the expanded edition of their 2022 album, Expert in a Dying Field. Watch the clip, and see their full list of tour dates, below.

In a statement, singer-guitarist Elizabeth Stokes said “Metal” is about living in a human body and her personal “health journey” as of late: “For parts of the last few years, I kind of felt like my body was a vehicle that had carried me pretty well thus far but was breaking down, something I had little to no control over. All of the steps in the Rube Goldberg machine of life are so unlikely, and yet here we are in it. I have a hunger and a curiosity for learning about the world around me, and for learning about myself. And despite all the ways that my body feels like a broken machine, I still marvel at the complexity of such a machine.”

She continued: “I can hold that knowledge in one hand, and yet with the other hand I can point to my reflection and just be like ‘you are shit.' Or ‘ugly.' Or ‘worthless.' I can reliably respond to any suggestion that I might be able to achieve any small thing with ‘no.' And these are variations of the ‘short word' referenced in the song.”

The Beths' tour begins in Dublin, Ireland, on September 18. From there, they'll perform across Europe and the United Kingdom before heading to North America to perform in dozens of cities in the United States and Canada. Opening select concerts are Phoebe Rings, Flight of the Conchords' Bret McKenzie, Squirrel Flower, and Illuminati Hotties.

George Lucas broke down the origins of Yoda's “very distinctive way of talking” at a 45th anniversary screening of The Empire Strikes Back at the 2025 TCM Classic Film Festival last week.


	Lucas was asked about Yoda's particular patter, which often found the character doing away with typical sentence structure and essentially delivering his heady insights and mighty koans backwards. For example: “Luminous beings are we”; “Anger, fear, aggression — the Dark Side are they”; and, “Wars not make one great.”


	All of that was done intentionally, Lucas said, to make sure audiences were paying attention. “If you were speaking regular English, people don't listen that much,” Lucas said. “But if you have an accent, or it's really hard to understand what he's saying, they focus on what he's saying.”


	The Star Wars creator continued, “He was basically the philosopher of the movie, so he was talking about all the things. I had to figure out a way to get people to actually listen, especially 12 year olds.”

	Yoda first appearance in the Star Wars universe came in The Empire Strikes Back, when Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) seeks out the Jedi Master to learn the ways of the Force. Yoda was voiced and “portrayed” (or controlled) by the legendary puppeteer and actor Frank Oz, who reprised the role in Return of the Jedi and continued to voice Yoda in the Star Wars prequel and sequel movies.

	In a 2021 interview with Rolling Stone, Oz spoke about playing Yoda, and all the different creatives who helped build the character. “It was really George [Lucas] and Larry [Kasdan] who wrote it. And [designer/make-up artist] Stuart [Freeborn] made it,” Oz said. “Jim [Henson] helped to a degree, and other people. But at the end of the day, what I did was put it together as a living, breathing thing. But I couldn't have done it without those people. I'm the only one who's ever done Yoda. So I feel good about that.”

The special, set to run May 1, will also feature reports from Jacob Soboroff on the impact of the DOGE cuts.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle will host a primetime special featuring an audience of federal workers whose jobs were slashed by DOGE.


	“100 Days of Trump: A Town Hall With Forced Out Federal Workers,” will air Thursday, May 1 at 9 p.m.




	“It has been like drinking from a fire hose, whether it's executive orders, deportations, tariffs, and what's happened to all the federal workers because of the DOGE situation,” Ruhle tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. “We thought DOGE and this enormous impact on federal workers would be a great way for us to press pause and show people what's happening.”

	Ruhle says that the audience of the town hall will feature a range of former federal workers, including some forced out by Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, Veterans Affairs and other agencies.

	“I'm viewing our audience as part of this conversation, not just there to stand up and ask questions the way you often see a traditional town hall,” Ruhle says. “I see every person in that room as also an important guest, an important voice, because this is not about partisanship. This isn't about this administration. This is about America, because much of what the President is trying to do right now is reshape the way we live, the way we work, the way we see our country, the way other countries see us.”


	Jacob Soboroff, meanwhile, will deliver stories about how the cuts will impact different parts of the country.


	He's headed to West Virginia next week to show what these jobs are and where they are,” Ruhle says. “Think about West Virginia. It is a state that has been crushed in terms of its economy. It's one of the lowest ranking states in terms of health care, in terms of education, and now we're going to see massive job cuts.


	“Take a state like Alabama, a deep red state, I don't think people would realize that the largest employer in the state of Alabama is the University of Alabama, which is obviously tied to their hospital system,” Ruhle adds. “It's why you've got Republican senator Katie Britt in Alabama urging the President not to have these sweeping cuts, because when you take cuts like that, you're going to impact millions and millions and millions of potential lives if we're cutting off medical research.”


	For Ruhle, who frequently covers business and economics given her background as a financial reporter, the cuts are part and parcel of the sweeping tariffs announced earlier this month as part of an effort to reshape the economy. Though she notes that many Americans do want to shake up what had been the status quo.

	











	“It's a lot of chaos. But there is some boldness to it if you want to shake up the status quo, and most people would argue they have some appetite for shaking up status quo, right?” Ruhle says. “But there's a difference between shaking up the status quo, optimizing the government, optimizing what we do and how we spend. There's a large gap between that and where we are right now.


	“When people think about federal workers, they just think bloated D.C. And you know, there is a big positive appetite for the idea of DOGE,” Ruhle says. “You can speak to people at any income level, any demographic, any political affiliation, and people will say the government is too big, the government is too bloated, the government doesn't work for me. And that led way to the openness to the idea of DOGE. Then DOGE came, and what it's actually doing is having a sweeping effect on all different parts of this country and our economy, and we want to shine a spotlight and show it, because it's not something that's just happening in DC.”

	Within three years of releasing their first single, the rising global girl group XG were at Coachella to help close out the festival at the Sahara Tent. Members Jurin, Chisa, Hinata, Harvey, Juria, Maya, and Cocona delivered an electrifying set that spanned their discography from fan-favorite tracks like “LEFT RIGHT” and “IS THIS LOVE,” which had a viral moment due to their “Glitch Dance,” to powerful all-rap anthem “WOKE UP,” which showcases XG's strengths as rappers. 


	Despite being one of the final acts to perform both weekends, XG drew a sizable crowd, with fans chanting “XG! XG! XG!” ahead of the members taking the stage in their signature, avant-garde fashion and makeup looks. They always bring something out-of-the-box and original on stage, a mission that stems from their label, XGALX, making their performances truly a sight to see. 


	The group is currently finishing up their first world tour, known as the first HOWL, which kicked off in 2024 in their home base of Japan, and spanned across Asia, Europe, and North America, with a number of additional shows added this year in Europe, South America, and the U.S, and grand plans to wrap the tour at the renowned Tokyo Dome on May 14. The conclusion of the tour will come with new music, with the release of their single “MILLION PLACES.” The track draws inspiration from XG's journey across the globe throughout their world tour and reflects on the love they've received from their fans, ALPHAZ. 

	











	XG sat down with Rolling Stone to reflect on their journey thus far, dive into what makes them “Xtraordinary”, and share their goals for the future.


What was your reaction when you heard you were performing at Coachella? Hinata: At first, we couldn't believe it — we all froze and were like, “Wait, what?” It was a dream stage for us, so the fact that we were able to stand on it this early was such a surprise, and we were just filled with happiness.


Do you remember who the first person you told was when you found out?Hinata: I wanted to keep it a surprise from my family, so when the announcement came out, I got tons of messages — they were honestly so shocked!

Being based in Japan, what did you know about Coachella before?Cocona: Every year, we always set aside time to watch Coachella performances together. We've watched primarily Main Stage performances, but since we were performing on the Sahara Stage this time, we went back and watched past performances from that stage as well. 












What was your impression of the festival before, and what is your impression now that you've seen it in person?Cocona: I hadn't been in person, so preparing based only on imagination was quite challenging. Once we actually arrived, we realized how much the wind could vary from day to day — it could get really strong — and the air was super dry, which made performing difficult in many ways.


How was that? I remember the wind was crazy for week one, especially during “IN THE RAIN.”Cocona: Doing a show in such a different environment was tough, but it also taught us a lot and turned out to be an incredible experience. I want to take everything I learned from this and keep pushing forward toward even more growth!


Were there any challenges or surprises while preparing for your set?Jurin: I think this was the period of our careers when we faced the most challenges ever — from last-minute setlist changes to editing and adding audio, as well as adjusting costumes.


You definitely never know what to expect with big performances like this, especially in unique environments like Coachella. Another thing about festivals is that you're given the opportunity to reach audiences who may not be familiar with your music yet. What do you want people who don't know XG to think after watching your performance?Harvey: We'd be so happy if the visual and auditory impact leaves them thinking of us as a seven-member group of aliens. [Smiles.] We hope they can feel the bond that unites us as one, witness the strength of our unity, and see how much we truly enjoy music — and we'd love for the fans to share and resonate with that moment together with us!

If you had to describe XG as a group in three words, what would they be and why?Juria: “Xtraordinary,” just like our name, XG [Xtraordinary Girls]. I believe our style is all about making our own path without being bound by norms, standards, or common sense. “Aliens” — when you think of XG, I think “aliens” definitely comes to mind. We've always believed in them ever since we were trainees, and we really, really want to meet them! Aliens have no limits — there's nothing they can't do, and that makes them the strongest in my eyes. I want to become just like them. [Laughs.]  And “wolves.” Our unity and collective strength are just like that of a wolf pack.  We're always moving as one, supporting and helping each other every step of the way — that kind of teamwork really reminds me of wolves!

	











To that point about acting and moving as a pack, how has your teamwork grown over the past couple of years? Chisa: Over the past year on our world tour, we naturally started gathering more frequently for meetings and had so many more chances to talk about each other's strengths and roles within the group. I truly feel our bond has grown stronger and our teamwork has improved so much.


What do your members mean to you?Chisa: To me, my members are like people who understand me as well as I understand myself— and I think it's one of our biggest strengths that we all feel that way about each other. We're like a real family, like sisters — always together, whether we're having fun, feeling down, or facing anything in between. I can confidently say that I understand their joys and pains better than anyone. They're the ones I connect with the most in my life right now. They're pure love… love you so much! [Smiles.] 


You flew to Seattle between weekend 1 and weekend 2 of Coachella for a tour stop — how do you stay energized with such a busy schedule? Juria: I think it's really important to refresh ourselves by doing things like going shopping or enjoying delicious local food!


Any fun memories in particular thus far? Juria: The day after Coachella, we all went to In-N-Out Burger — it was so good, I was seriously about to cry from how delicious it was. [Laughs.] We also did a lot of shopping at Sephora!


Now that you've performed at Coachella, what are some goals you have, personal or as a group? I know you have a Tokyo Dome show coming up very soon, so exciting!Hinata: We have so many goals! Topping the Billboard Hot 100, performing on the main stage at Coachella, winning a Grammy — there are so many dreams we want to make come true. But more than anything, we want to enjoy the journey and use our music and performances to bring courage and love to people all around the world!


And what's something you've learned during your careers since debut? Whether it be a technical skill or something you've learned about yourselves.Cocona: That of course, the opinions and evaluations from others are important, but what matters most isn't that. What's truly important is our dreams and goals. “What do we, as XG, want to achieve? What do we want to leave behind in this world?” Keeping that at the core and moving forward with that mindset every day is something I believe is really important.

	











	I also feel more and more how vital communication is. In the past, most of our communication was just between the members and our producer Simon, but now that we have a much larger team and so many staff involved, we're constantly working on how to share ideas more effectively and efficiently. We're always learning and adjusting how we communicate to keep everything running smoothly.


	There's so much to learn every day. And while it can be challenging at times, I'm truly grateful to be in an environment where we can keep growing and learning together.

I feel like there's never a time when I feel 100 percent satisfied with my performance, but I don't take that as a negative thing because nobody's perfect and there's always a place for improvements. And that's totally normal. That's why I like to be honest with myself and make sure I have time to reflect.


	Everyday is a new day because there's always so many different things to learn. I want to challenge myself into doing new things and learn so I can grow and do better in the future!

	A day before the kick-off of her anticipated Cowboy Carter and the Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit Tour, Beyoncé gave the Beyhive a preview of the outings massive set. In a dramatic 16-second greyscale video titled “SHE COMING” the camera slowly pans from the darkness inside the concourse of Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium into the light of the empty arena.


	As it crests and dips down toward the floor, viewers get a brief glimpse of the elaborate stage set-up, which appears to feature a large star-shaped stage bisected by a long runway in the middle and what looks like a big screen across the back. The tour in support of Queen Bey's 2024 Grammy Awards album of the year winner Cowboy Carter LP is slated to kick off on Monday night (April 28) with the first of five dates at SoFi Stadium. From there, the singer will play three nights at Soldier Field in Chicago (May 15, 17, 18) and five shows at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. (May 22, 24, 25, 28 and 29).

	The outing will then jump to Europe for six shows at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London (June 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 and 16) and three in Paris at Stade de France (June 19, 21 and 22) before she hops back stateside for two gigs in her hometown at Houston's NRG Stadium (June 28, 29). The tour is slated to wind down in July with a pair of shows in Washington,D.C. four nights at Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta and two gigs at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on July 25 and 26.

	Three U.S. citizen children were illegally removed from Louisiana and flown to Honduras on Friday, their attorneys say, in a story that has swiftly caught national attention. 


	Legal counsel for the two Louisiana families tells Rolling Stone that both mothers say they were not given the option of keeping their U.S. citizen children in the country. They say the mothers were told their children were being deported alongside them, despite their citizenship status and even though both families had lawful custodians willing to take custody of the children. 


	Over the weekend, after news of the deportations caused outrage across the country, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, went on television to defend the removals by insisting the mothers chose to take their children with them. Rubio called the story “misleading,” saying: “Three U.S. citizens ages four, seven, and two were not deported. Their mothers, who are illegally in this country, were deported. The children went with their mothers.”

	











	Homan went as far to say the kids couldn't have been deported because deportations are ordered by an immigration judge.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Meanwhile, attorneys for the families say their clients were not afforded any kind of due process, nor were they given access to lawyers, a hearing, or even phone calls. This is despite multiple legal motions being filed to try and delay the deportations until a judge could hear their cases.


	Erin Hebert, a senior associate at the Ware Immigration law firm in the New Orleans area, is representing the mother of the seven-year-old girl and the four-year-old boy, the latter of whom is in active treatment for metastatic cancer. (The boy is the second U.S. citizen child with cancer that Trump has deported so far in his second term.) Over the weekend, Hebert was in contact with the mother, who is now in Honduras with her two kids. The children's father remains in the U.S.


	“She was told she was being deported with her children and she asked, ‘Why my children?'” says Hebert. “They refused to answer her. They gave her no options, no ability to make arrangements. She never signed anything. She never gave them permission. She never indicated that she wanted them to come with her.”

	On Thursday morning, the mother reported to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices for what she thought was a standard check-in. In less than 24 hours, she and her two children were on a plane to Honduras. 


	“We were immediately working on arranging for alternate custody so that those kids would not get removed with [their] mother once they were all detained,” says Hebert. She says ICE had known prior to the check-in that the four-year-old was in active treatment for cancer. They removed him from the country without his medication and without consulting with his doctors.


	Hebert is part of a group of legal experts and advocates that sprung together to try to make sure the two families weren't deported. Among that group is also Gracie Willis from the National Immigration Project of National Lawyers Guild. Willis represented the two-year-old U.S. citizen child of the pregnant mother who was deported, who is known in court papers as V.M.L.


	Both Hebert and Willis attempted to file legal motions to at least temporarily stop the families from being deported, but they were unable to confer with their clients until after they'd arrived in Honduras.


	“What has become entirely clear is that ICE's portrayal of consent is undeniably false and flatly a lie,” alleges Willis. “ICE did not provide the mothers with any alternative other than their U.S. citizen children coming with them. They were not provided a choice. They were not provided options.”

	Willis explains that ICE presented a note they claim V.M.L's mother handwrote. In Spanish it reads, “I will take my daughter with me to Honduras.” Willis says the letter seems to have been written on a hotel notepad, with parts blacked out to hide the name and location of the hotel.


	“It's not an expression of want, it's not an expression of wish, it's not an expression of desire,” says Willis. “It is an expression of a fact that she was told by ICE.”


	Mich Gonzalez, who works at Sanctuary of the South, is one of the attorneys for V.M.L's mother. “Both mothers have clearly communicated that they felt under extreme duress in this situation, that ICE essentially coerced them into accepting this deportation with their children,” says Gonzalez. “Both have stated that ICE repeatedly denied their requests, for a phone call, for a legal process, requests to speak to a judge, request to speak to anyone via phone call, including family members or potentially lawyers.”

	











	In both cases, the fathers involved stayed in the U.S. “The fathers are distraught by this cruel separation from their families,” says Gonzalez.


	On Sunday, Rubio went on Meet the Press and suggested several times that the two mothers chose to take their U.S. citizen children with them when they were deported.


	“Those children are U.S. citizens. They can come back into the United States if there's their father or someone here who wants to assume them,” Rubio said. “Ultimately, who was deported was their mothers, who were here illegally. The children just went with their mothers. But it wasn't like — you guys make it sound like ICE agents kicked down the door and grabbed the two-year-old and threw him on an airplane. That's misleading.” (The two-year-old child who was deported is a girl.)


	Rubio asserted that if a parent is being deported, they have two options: Take their child or leave the child behind. “The parents make that choice,” he claimed, adding that, otherwise, journalists would be printing headlines like: “U.S. Holding Hostage Two-Year-Old, Four-Year-Old, Seven-Year-Old, While Mother Deported.”


	Willis disagrees, responding, “Secretary Rubio is repeating the same lies from ICE, never having spoken to these families.”


	Gonzalez adds, “All three children had the legal right to stay here, with people ready and willing, with the legal right to receive them. And none of them were provided that opportunity by ICE.”


	Homan went on Face the Nation and repeated Rubio's claim that the mothers chose to take their children with them. “No U.S. citizen child was deported,” said Homan. “Deported means ordered by an immigration judge.”


	A federal judge in Louisiana has issued a brief order asking why the Trump administration sent two-year-old V.M.L to Honduras when her father had tried to stop his daughter from being deported.

	Doughty set a hearing for May 16, saying he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process” and affirming that it is “illegal and unconstitutional to deport” a U.S. citizen.

	To celebrate Minogue's latest accolade, several leading artists and industry peers shared tributes to her career and influence. Longtime collaborator, Neighbours co-star Jason Donovan, praised her “dedication and focus to her craft,” describing her as “a hardworking and authentic Melbourne girl who is proud of her Australian heritage.”

	Fellow Australian songwriter Kylie Sackley declared, “Kylie Minogue walked so the rest of us Australian music makers could run,” hailing her as “an innovator and an inspiration.”


	Ben Lee reflected on Minogue's lasting cultural impact, calling her a “mirror” through which audiences see themselves, and Gretta Ray credited Minogue with making the path toward pop stardom less daunting for emerging Australian artists. “She has inspired me to be courageous in my creativity,” Ray said.


	Missy Higgins noted Minogue's remarkable longevity: “She continues to tour consistently and remain exciting and relevant,” while The Wiggles, who once collaborated with Minogue when she portrayed the honorary “Pink Wiggle,” applauded her “unstoppable artistry” and “special Kylie-magic.”


	Minogue's career, spanning over four decades, has earned her international acclaim. She has amassed 10 ARIA No. 1 albums, including her most recent project Tension, which debuted atop the Australian Albums Chart in September 2023. Minogue made history on the Billboard charts when “Padam Padam,” the lead single from Tension, became her first solo track to reach the top 10 on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart in 2023.


	Minogue's influence on generations of artists remains unmatched. Julian Hamilton of The Presets, who curated a special performance for the APRA Awards night, said, “With so many hits to her name, it hasn't been the easiest of tasks.”


	Tim Nelson of Cub Sport summed it up best, calling Kylie “a true global icon who has filled countless lives with joy, expression and a sense of belonging for decades.”

The Tool singer says he's "preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best" in regard to July's Back to The Beginning concert in England.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan has expressed an air of concern about what to expect from Ozzy Osbourne's final performance this July.


	Keenan and his Tool bandmates are one of the many acts scheduled to appear at the Back to the Beginning concert, which takes place in Birmingham, England on July 5. The event will feature names such as Osbourne's own Black Sabbath performing their final-ever show, while acts such as Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, and myriad others join the bill.


	While Osbourne hasn't performed a full set since Dec. 31, 2018 – two months before his diagnosis of Parkinson's – he's previously tempered expectations for the upcoming gig, noting he isn't “planning on doing a set with Black Sabbath,” but rather “little bits and pieces” with the group. “I am doing what I can, where I feel comfortable,” he explained.

	Despite this, Osbourne told fans only last week that he's been undertaking “endurance training” ahead of the gig in an effort to “wake up” his body after years spent recovering from numerous surgeries. “I haven't done anything for, this will be seven years, and so I've been through all this surgery,” he explained. “It really is like starting from scratch.”

	While Osbourne was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in October 2024 as a solo artist (he was previously inducted as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006), Keenan was on hand with the likes of Wolfgang Van Halen, Billy Idol, and Jelly Roll to perform a tribute set to honor his legacy. 


	Speaking to the Loudwire Nights podcast recently, Keenan noted that his experience with Osbourne at the induction ceremony has left him unsure of what to expect at the July event.


	“I think for me, seeing Ozzy moving around at [the Rock Hall ceremony], the idea of him playing a show at all, if we're being honest, the conversation about going to do the song was just like, ‘We'll have this conversation, but, ahh… I don't know that this [concert] gonna happen,'” Keenan told the podcast..


	“And even now, I'm cautious about saying, ‘Yeah! All in, he's gonna do it.' Because man, I don't know what kind of modern miracles we'll come up with to get him on stage to do the songs, but this is gonna be a challenge for them.”


	Keenan closed by noting he feels privileged to be included in the forthcoming event, though added he's “preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.”

	











	Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello will be the musical director for the show that will mark Osbourne's first time on stage since a brief 2022 set at the NFL Kickoff in Los Angeles; his last full show was in December 2018 at the Forum in L.A. as part of his No More Tours 2 outing. 


	Other acts slated to perform at the final Sabbath blowout include: Halestorm, Gojira, as well as appearances by Smashing Pumpkins leader Billy Corgan, Guns N' Roses' Duff McKagan and Slash, Wolfgang Van Halen, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, Lzzy Hale, Disturbed's David Draiman, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Sammy Hagar and many more.

Bella Ramsey breaks down their toughest scene, which came during the third episode of season two on Sunday. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


Bella Ramsey‘s Ellie experiences quite a bit of action, heartbreak and turmoil in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us. 


	But a quiet scene from Sunday's third episode was actually the toughest for them to shoot. 




	Ramsey recalled that the scene where Ellie weeps over the loss of Joel (Pedro Pascal) while smelling one of his jackets in the closet was the scene they were most worried about pulling off.


	“Oh God, in the closet, that was the hardest [scene],” the 21-year-old Emmy nominee said. “So I really struggle with crying in scenes. I can get a tear out, but that's different to crying. And even getting the tear, it doesn't come easy for me. I don't cry in front of people in my everyday life. A very, very limited amount of people in my life will see me cry. And so having to do that on a set full of people with the monitor and then more people watching the monitors…it's virtually impossible for me. So I was really worried about that scene, and that was the toughest one for me to shoot.”

	But Ramsey eventually pulled it off, and what worked was rather ironic. 


	“I've tried [before in crying scenes] to think about something really sad in my own life and try and evoke emotions that way,” Ramsey said. “That doesn't really work for me because it takes me out of the truth of the situation for Ellie. So I was remembering the happiest of memories that I have with Pedro.” 


	“The thing that is always the saddest for me is remembering the happy things,” they continued. “I was remembering us the first few times that we met and the whole of shooting season one together, and the funniest moments. I was remembering all of that and through the lens of losing him — not just Joel and Ellie, but like me and Pedro — because the memories of me and Pedro and Joel and Ellie are so intertwined for me.” 


	During last week's The Hollywood Reporter cover story, Ramsey elaborated on their feelings about parting ways (in the workplace, at least) with Pascal. 


	“Understanding [from the show's outset] the limited time me and Pedro have together has made us really cherish each other more,” Ramsey says. “It was something that we got quite emotional about while we were shooting. We'll be in each other's lives forever, and we'll be in each other's hearts forever.”

	











	Ramsey also discussed what it was like ascending to become the HBO hit's sole lead now that Pascal's character was killed off. 


	“I would never consider myself a leader,” Ramsey says. “But there's something that happens when I'm given responsibility where I really like the feeling and I take the responsibility very seriously. I'm very happy to lead a set and have a lot of influence over the tone and dynamic, especially given there's preconceived ideas about a young person who's No. 1 on the call sheet…. Everybody should know they're valued as a crewmember, as a castmember, and that we're all equals.”

“Excalibur” star Helen Mirren teams with Pierce Brosnan in “The Thursday Murder Club,” coming to Netflix at the end of Summer 2025. Here's a preview of the project and everything we know so far.

The story follows a group of four aging but sprightly friends who enjoy solving cold case murders as a hobby. The retirement home residents find themselves pulled into their most intense adventure yet when a mystery death takes place uncomfortably close to home. A thrilling whodunit unfolds as the group's just-for-fun sleuthing turns into a high stakes search for the killer. 

The tale is based on Richard Osman's bestselling 2020 novel, which has sold over 1 million copies and spent 57 weeks at the top of the original fiction charts. Osman talked in a 2024 “This Morning” interview about his inspiration for the book and how he felt about bringing it to the screen.

Osman said observing his mother's life in a retirement home made him think, “I have to write about this generation and the extraordinary things they've done. And the life that's still in them, and the adventure that they have.” 

On bringing his work to life on Netflix, Osman said “anyone who likes ‘The Thursday Murder Club' will like it. Viewers can expect “British humor and a few tears,” according to the author.

The movie features an impressive cast. Helen Mirren and Pierce Brosnan, the fifth actor to portray James Bond, are joined by Celia Imrie, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Tom Ellis, Jonathan Pryce, David Tennant, Paul Freeman, Geoff Bell, Richard E. Grant, and Ingrid Oliver.

Katy Brand and Suzanne Heathcote wrote the screen play. The project is directed by Chris Columbus, who famously directed two films from the “Harry Potter” universe: “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,” and “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.” 

The movie's executive producers are Jo Burn, Richard Osman, Eleanor Columbus, Holly Bario, Jeb Brody.

Pierce Brosnan previously worked with “The Thursday Murder Club” director Chris Columbus on 1993's “Mrs. Doubtfire.” According to a People report, he's enthusiastic about teaming back up. The outlet says he told them when he got the call from the director about appearing in the Netflix mystery, “I was halfway there already. By the time I'd read the book by Richard Osman I was completely hooked.”

The film will hit Netflix on August 28, 2025. Subscription plans currently star at $7.99.

Carrie Underwood may have been crowned the “American Idol” season 4 winner, but she admits that there's still one aspect of the show that gives her anxiety. Find out why she feels a little bit of PTSD every time she hears the iconic theme song.

A post shared by Carrie Underwood (@carrieunderwood)

In an April 21 Instagram post, Underwood revealed how the “American Idol” theme song makes her feel, all these years later. Spoiler alert: it's stressful for her.

“The ‘Idol' theme song gives me anxiety. For real!” she explained in the caption.

In the video, Underwood shared, “For the record, the ‘American Idol' da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da baaa-errr, the music, like gives me anxiety.”

The singer added, “I get like this flash of fear in my heart, like nervousness, because it's the same! PTSD.”

The “Idol” alum is putting her PTSD aside and carrying on with the job at hand however.

In an interview with ET Online after the April 21 live show, Underwood shared what her experience has been like as a judge so far. “It's a lot of fun. More than anything, I love to just like be a fan,” the country singer said. “I love sitting out in the audience, and there's a song I know, and everybody's having fun with it, it's fun for me! I'm having a blast.”

In addition to the fun, however, the judges have work to do and that can prove challenging, given all the talent on the show.

“It was one of those things where we try to think of what people want to see, the talent is insane and somebody's gotta be voted off,” she explained.

Underwood added, “I don't take it lightly that we have people's futures in our hands, and I really would like just America to vote. I don't want to be put in that position again, so it's up to you guys. You have to vote for your favorites.”

When the interviewer noted, “I heard you had a rough night,” Underwood agreed, responding, “I did. I mean, my night was paling in comparison to the contestants that are no longer a part of the competition, but it is an extremely tough spot to be in.”

She added, “I really just wanted to pass the buck off to Luke [Bryan] and Lionel [Richie], but I feel like we were on the same page.”

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Season 2, Episode 3. For earlier coverage, check out last week's review.]

It didn't take long for Gail to become a survivalist all-star. For her “Last of Us” debut, Catherine O'Hara's cynical therapist walks into a session with Joel (Pedro Pascal) half in the bag and with another glass of whiskey at the ready. Then she accepts payment via weed, which she judges almost as harshly as she does Joel — cursing at him, refusing to hear his “boring” problems, and calling him a liar. Turns out, Gail had good reason to be angry with the soon to be deceased: He killed her husband, Eugene — presumably, after Eugene became infected, but still. That's a tough pill to swallow, no matter how stiff the drink to help it down.

In Episode 3, Gail's heroics continue. She's the last line of defense between Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and the cold world waiting outside her hospital room. She raptly observes the town council meeting where Ellie pleads to send a 16-person posse to Seattle to avenge Joel's death. She sits in the outfield of a Little League game, drinking beer from her own cooler, and writes an early epitaph for our 19-year-old protagonist: When Tommy (Gabriel Luna) asks how to best protect Ellie, his de facto niece, Gail's advice boils down to a simple, dire sentiment: “Some people just can't be saved.”

I don't want to believe Gail, but history tells me I should. Not only do I like Gail — she seems like an ideal hang during the post-apocalypse — I'm also meant to like Gail. Clue No. 1: She's played by Catherine Freaking O'Hara. Clue No. 2: Therapists in TV shows are often wise, trustworthy figures. Their voices are respected and their opinions reliable. When a patient listens to them, things seem to get better, and when they don't, well, they don't. 

But Gail isn't your typical therapist. There's the drinking (before sessions, during sessions) and the smoking (“as much weed as I can”), sure, but those are symptoms of larger issues. Gail is mourning the loss of her husband, which is still a raw, recent tragedy, amid the broader, longer-term tragedy of society's ongoing collapse. Jackson offers community — and a better version of it than we've seen anywhere else — but it's not a replacement. It doesn't have everything for everyone, even if it offers certain services that feel like luxuries. 

 










I mean, what post-apocalyptic story features survivors sitting down to protect their mental health? Just this one, and that's great for them, but what about Gail? “I'm supposed to see a shrink myself, to help process it all — [but] I'm the only one here,” she says in Episode 3. Earlier, she acknowledges that she's overwhelmed with appointments. If any of them go like the one we saw with Joel, than “brutal” wouldn't just describe her workload. It would describe the treatment, too. 

So what does that mean for her assessment of Ellie? Clearly, some of it is spot on. Ellie lies often enough and convincingly enough to be described as “a liar,” rather than just someone who lies. She lies to Gail's face at the hospital. She wants out, she wants to go after Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), and she's not going to think twice about it — no matter what Gail asks. She's made up her mind already, and Gail won't change it. “Your final moment with someone doesn't define your whole time with them,” Ellie says. “It shouldn't,” Gail says, “but it often does.” 

That warning feels prescient as Ellie embarks on her revenge mission, despite losing the council's support. At the start of the episode, when she first wakes up in the hospital, she sees Joel dying and she screams. And she screams, and she screams. Three months later, the screaming has stopped, but there's no reason to think the visions have quieted. She still sees Joel dying, her final moments with him, and she's still fixated on killing the person responsible. 

 










Little by little, throughout Episode 3, she collects his mementos and assumes his role. She takes his gun from his room to use on Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). She becomes the gruff, silent type on the trail with Dina (Isabela Merced), asking for silence while her companion cracks jokes and plays game. Ellie even admits to attempting to “sound like a badass,” like she's trying on a persona she admired and lost. She's becoming Joel as a way to remember him, but that's exactly what Tommy is worried about. 

“I just don't her to go down the same paths that Joel did,” he says to Gail — and here's where Gail's advice gets dubious. “Turns out nurture can only do this much,” she says, gesturing to a small amount. “The rest is nature. If she's on a path, it's not one Joel put her on. … Take it from a psychotherapist of 40 years, some people just… some people just can't be saved.”

Whether or not we believe Gail's assessment now becomes the central question in “The Last of Us” Season 2. Is Ellie already doomed to repeat Joel's mistakes, or can she make different decisions? Broadening that out, are we all doomed to repeat the past, or can we still save our future? The town council meeting offers an interesting perspective there, seeing that the board votes against revenge, even when there are adamant, persuasive pleas to seek vengeance. If everyone in that room got a vote, would it have gone down the same way? Or would Seth (Robert John Burke) have convinced the room to act out of fear? To lash out at others as a means of protecting themselves? To follow their instincts rather than act with sense and compassion? 

 










The latter option is voiced by Carlisle (Hiro Kanagawa), and watching his thoughtful sentiments get drowned out by vitriol feels sadly familiar. “People came and killed Joel, so why wouldn't we want to take our vengeance?,” he says. “Well, because we're not supposed to: forgive and be forgiven. No grudges, no revenge. … That's what separates us from the raiders and the murderers: our capacity for mercy.”

Right now, Ellie has none. Can she find it in Seattle? Can she find it before it's too late? Or is Gail right about her? Some people, perhaps, just can't be saved.

“The Last of Us” Season 2 releases new episodes Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO and Max.

• The visual and audible combination of Ellie crying into one of Joel's old shirts and Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting score has to be a slight nod to one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinematic history, which featured the same character action and the same composer. (Honestly, the moment was so evocative of “Brokeback Mountain,” it pulled me out of it. But I still have to respect the homage.)

• OK, the Scars — the whistling band of travelers who all have long, angular cuts on their faces — seem slightly creepy, but the “wolves” seem much, much worse. After all, the Scar father told his daughter they were on their way through the woods to get “distance” from “war,” and yet the W.L.F. forces caught up with them anyway. A coincidence? Seems unlikely. Seems much more likely the wolves went hunting. Why? Who knows, but we'll certainly see more of each in Seattle, given the many, many W.L.F. soldiers shown at the end of the episode. 

 










• Is Dina a tease, or should Ellie make a move already? Discuss amongst yourselves.

“The Valley” star Brittany Cartwright is opening up about co-parenting her son, Cruz, 4, with her estranged husband, Jax Taylor. 

In an April 2025 Access Hollywood interview, Cartwright referenced that their son was diagnosed with autism in late 2024. According to Cartwright, the diagnosis was “a little bit harder for Jax to accept than it was for [her] to accept.” She clarified that Taylor adores Cruz. 

“He loves his son,” said Cartwright, who filed for divorce from Taylor in August 2024. 

She also said she “deal[s] with all the doctors and the therapists” for Cruz. She said while Taylor “doesn't see as much as [she] see[s] that goes into it,” he is “learning” about autism. 

“We're both learning. It's brand new. It hasn't always been easy. It hasn't been but I wouldn't change anything about Cruz. Ever,” said Cartwright to the publication.

While speaking to Access Hollywood, Cartwright explained why she went public with her son's diagnosis. 

“I can use my platform for something amazing. And I can help other families that are going through this,” said Cartwright during the interview. 

In addition, she said she wants to spread the message that “early intervention is so important” for children with autism. 

“With other families that are going through it, they need to realize that early intervention is so important to give their child the best life they can have,” said Cartwright. 

During an April 2025 interview with People magazine, Cartwright said her son attends preschool with a therapeutic companion and goes to speech and occupational therapy. Cartwright stated that she is “trying to do everything [she] possibly can to help him live the happiest life ever.” 

“I just make sure that he never misses a class, never misses a therapy session. If I have to work, I have the most amazing nanny in the entire world, she is literally my family. I don't know what I would do without her. Sometimes Jax will take him,” said Cartwright to the publication. “I want him to learn things as well, but the majority of the time, it's me. And I feel like I need to be there, I need to be learning what's going on, so that I can really work with him at home as well.”

In a different April 2025 interview with Access Hollywood, Taylor spoke about his son. He said he decided to receive mental health help and get sober for the sake of Cruz. He then referenced his child's autism diagnosis. 

“My little boy needs me more than ever. And I feel like it's just a sign from God. Brittany and I are really coming together about this. Our little boy is our priority and making sure that he has the best life possible. And knowing that me and his mom will love him more than anything,” said Taylor to Access Hollywood.

"None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires," Scott Pelley said at the end of Sunday's broadcast.


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


	Sunday's episode of 60 Minutes ended by addressing executive producer Bill Owens' surprise departure last week.


	In the show's “The Last Minute” segment, correspondent Scott Pelley took a moment to address Owens' resignation as executive producer, a position he'd held since 2019. 




	Noting that 60 Minutes has covered many controversial stories during its nearly six-decade run, Pelley gave Owens credit for making sure those stories “were accurate and fair. He was tough that way.”

	He continued: “But our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”

	Pelley noted that Owens had been with CBS News for 40 years — 26 of those at 60 Minutes — and that “no one here is happy about” his departure. Owens was only the third executive producer in the history of the CBS newsmagazine. Last year, he added oversight of CBS Evening News to his plate.


	Owens announced his shock resignation last week. In an email to staff, he cited an inability “to make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes.”


	“Over the past months, it has…become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it,” Owens wrote. “To make independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes, right for the audience. So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.”


	Read Pelley's full comments on 60 Minutes below:


In tonight's last minute, a note on Bill Owens, who until this past week was executive producer of 60 Minutes. He was our boss.


Bill was with CBS News nearly 40 years, 26 years at 60 Minutes. He covered the world, covered combat, the White House. His was a quest to open minds, not close them.


If you've ever worked hard for a boss because you admired him, then you understand what we've enjoyed here. 


Bill resigned Tuesday. It was hard on him and hard on us, but he did it for us and you.


Stories we pursued for 57 years are often controversial. Lately, the Israel-Gaza war and the Trump administration.












Bill made sure they were accurate and fair. He was tough that way. But our parent company, Paramount is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it.


Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.


No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing: He was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.

This is the sixth consecutive year that one or more rap acts has been in the induction class.


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Chubby Checker, whose “The Twist” was a global smash in 1960, has been eligible for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame since the first class was inducted in 1986, but he was never even nominated until this year. Despite having been ignored for decades, he made it in his first time on the ballot.


	So did first-time nominees Bad Company, Joe Cocker and Outkast, as well as Cyndi Lauper and The White Stripes, who had each been nominated once before, and Soundgarden, which had been nominated twice before. These seven acts were all inducted in the performer category.

	











	The inductees were announced by Ryan Seacrest on ABC's American Idol on Sunday night (April 27).




			Trending on Billboard		







	There are six other inductees this year in other categories. Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon are set to receive the musical influence award; Philly Soul producer Thom Bell, English studio pianist/organist Nicky Hopkins and studio bass guitarist Carole Kaye (who was part of the fabled Wrecking Crew of top L.A. studio musicians) will receive the musical excellence award; and producer and label executive Lenny Waronker will receive the Ahmet Ertegun Award.


	Sadly, several of these people didn't live to see their inductions. Hopkins died in 1994 at age 50; Zevon in 2003 at 56; Chris Cornell of Soundgarden in 2017 at 52; and Bell in 2022 at 79.


	Checker had to wait even longer for induction than Cher, who was finally inducted last year, 59 years after Sonny & Cher's breakthrough smash “I Got You Babe.”


	With Outkast and Salt-N-Pepa both being inducted this year, this is the sixth consecutive year that one or more rap acts has been in the induction class.


	With Lauper, Salt-N-Pepa, Meg White of The White Stripes and Carol Kaye being inducted this year, this is the fourth consecutive year that four or more female acts were in the induction class.


	Bell won the first Grammy Award ever presented for producer of the year, non-classical, in 1975. By coincidence, Waronker was among the other nominees in the category that year. Waronker was also nominated for record of the year that year for producing Maria Muldaur's classy and sexy “Midnight at the Oasis.” Waronker's many other hits as a producer include Gordon Lightfoot's Hot 100-topping “Sundown,” Rickie Lee Jones' “Chuck E.'s in Love” and Randy Newman's “I Love L.A.,” which Dawes performed as the opening song on this year's Grammy telecast.

	











	Carol Kaye, 90, is this year's oldest inductee. Checker and Waronker are both 83, but will both be 84 by the time of the Nov. 8 induction ceremony.


	All of the artists who were induced in the performer category have landed top five albums on the Billboard 200. Three of them reached No. 1: Bad Company (Bad Company, 1974), Outkast (Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, 2003) and Soundgarden (Superunknown, 1994). Three more reached No. 2: Chubby Checker (Your Twist Party, 1962), Joe Cocker (Mad Dogs and Englishmen, 1970) and The White Stripes (Icky Thump, 2007). Lauper climbed as high as No. 4 twice, with She's So Unusual in 1984 and True Colors in 1986.


	Both of the artists who are receiving musical influence awards made the top 10. Salt-N-Pepa reached No. 4 with Very Necessary in 1994. Zevon hit No. 8 with Excitable Boy in 1978.


	Lauper won the Grammy for best new artist in 1985. She's the sixth artist who was a past winner of that award to go on to a Rock Hall induction.


	Outkast won the Grammy for album of the year in 2004 for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. André 3000 was nominated again in that category at this year's ceremony for New Blue Sun.


	Two of the inducted acts are duos – Outkast (André 3000 and Big Boi) and The White Stripes (Jack White and Meg White).


	The other seven nominees in the performer category were denied admission to the Rock Hall – this year, anyway. Oasis and Mariah Carey were both passed over for the second year in a row. Both were surprising snubs – Oasis is reuniting for a global tour in 2025; Carey's profile, never low, has been boosted in recent years by her status as the uncontested Queen of Christmas. Of the other passed-over artists, Joy Division/New Order were previously on the ballot in 2023; this was the first time on the ballot for The Black Crowes, Billy Idol, Maná and Phish.

	











	The voters showed no love for brother acts this year. Oasis includes Liam and Noel Gallagher; The Black Crowes includes Chris and Rich Robinson.


	Maná was vying to become the first rock en español act to make the Rock Hall. Joy Division/New Order was vying to join the short list of two related acts being inducted in tandem, following Parliament/Funkadelic in 1997 and The Small Faces/Faces in 2012.


	Phish, which won this year's fan vote, has never landed a Hot 100 hit, but the band is a powerhouse live attraction, as evidenced when it played the Sphere in Las Vegas in April 2024.


	Idol was a mainstay of early MTV – as was Lauper, who did get in. In an interview with Vulture, Idol said of his guitarist Steve Stevens, “Because of our special relationship, if I get in, they will induct him as well.” This would have echoed Pat Benatar's induction three years ago, where the Rock Hall inducted both Benatar and her husband and musical partner, Neil Giraldo. But it's academic, as Idol didn't make it this year.


	The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction will be live on Saturday, Nov. 8 at the Peacock Theater at L.A. Live in Los Angeles. The 2025 ceremony will once again stream live on Disney+, with a special airing on ABC at a later date and available on Hulu the next day. The 2024 ceremony aired on New Year's Day.


	Here's the full list of 2025 inductees:

Four Supernatural stars reunited over the weekend in a very fitting location, five years after the show ended. For fifteen seasons, Supernatural covered the fantastical adventures of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) as they stepped into the family business of monster hunting. The series developed a passionate and dedicated fanbase over the course of its run, and even now, it remains one of the most popular shows online. Recently, Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins, who played the angel Castiel, were scheduled to appear at The Road So Far... the Road Ahead convention in Minneapolis from April 25 to 27.

Now, in an Instagram post shared by Collins, the three Supernatural stars were joined by another surprise guest in Dean's trademark black 1967 Chevrolet Impala, nicknamed Baby. Ruthie Connell, who played Rowena on the show, can be seen sitting in the backseat with Collins. As teased in the caption, their "innocent" reunion took a turn in the third photo. Check out the post below:

This year's convention featured several members of the Supernatural cast beyond the four shown above, including Mark Sheppard (Crowley), Jim Beaver (Bobby Singer), and Alexander Calvert (Jack). Conventions have become a popular place for actors to interact with both their fans and their former co-stars, and in the case of Supernatural, they have helped to keep passion for the series alive even well after the show's completion. It is clear that this is a show that will live on for a very long time.

Even though Supernatural ended in 2020, the series still occupies a place in the cast's and fans' hearts. Recently, it has been confirmed that Padalecki, Ackles, and Collins will all appear in The Boys season 5, though it isn't yet clear what roles they will all play beyond Ackles, who already has the part of Soldier Boy. Their desire to keep working with each other shows how much they enjoyed their time on Supernatural. While there's been no official announcement about a reboot, creator Eric Kripke and the series' leads have all expressed interest in revisiting the Winchesters' world.

 It evokes a lot of feelings seeing Sam and Dean sitting in the Impala again with Castiel in the backseat. Even though the four stars are not posing for the show specifically, they are perfectly in character. The "Baby" reunion is very Supernatural-flavored; given Castiel's record of being tempted by demons, women, and such, it's not shocking that he would develop a particular interest in Rowena, who is in charge of Hell by the time of Supernatural's ending. 

Ackles and Padalecki also reacted to the development similarly to how their characters would've reacted on the show. Overall, it seems that the core cast had a lot of fun during the convention weekend, and honestly, there haven't been enough Supernatural reunions since the show ended. Hopefully, The Boys will provide many more.

If you happened to be in Europe on March 24th, 2025 and you looked up into the night sky, you may have seen something quite surprising.

A giant swirl of blue light appeared, leaving many people mystified.

Was it aliens?

No. Instead it is said to be from the launch of SpaceX's NROL-69 Mission, which is classified.

SpaceX did confirm that this launch took place on their website, saying:

“On Monday, March 24 at 1:48 p.m. ET, Falcon 9 launched the NROL-69 mission from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This was the second flight for the first stage booster supporting this mission, which previously launched a Starlink mission.”

According to a 2024 Reuters interview, SpaceX is working with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on technology that could be used to help with spy satellites. SpaceX may be sending up large numbers of smaller satellites that are able to coordinate together in a swarm in low-Earth orbit. They can then be used to image the Earth.

The launch was successful, but the fuel from it spread across the skies in this blue spiral, making it quite a spectacle to see. The spiral pattern is caused by the Falcon 9 rocket's exhaust system. This was explained on a post on X:

“We've received many reports of an illuminated swirl in the sky this evening. This is likely to be caused by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launched earlier today. The rocket's frozen exhaust plume appears to be spinning in the atmosphere and reflecting the sunlight, causing it to appear as a spiral in the sky.”

Similar patterns have been seen during previous launches, though typically not as bright due to differences in the time and location of the launch. In a statement after a previous launch, geophysicist Don Hampton (Poker Flat Rocket Range chief scientist) explained:

“It is likely either exhaust from a rocket burn to bring the second stage down over the Pacific, or perhaps dumping extra rocket fuel after that burn. The spiral pattern indicates that the second stage was spinning when it exhausted the gasses. Any water vapor would turn into ice at these altitudes, and the ice would reflect sunlight where the rocket was, and make a bright cloud visible on the ground in Alaska where the sun was well below the horizon. It looks really bright in those pictures, but it is likely just a few pounds of water.”

So, while not as exciting as aliens, the bright light certainly was beautiful and will likely be something that is seen more in the future.

If you weren't lucky enough to catch it in person, you can see it in this brief YouTube video:



I wish I had seen it.

Then I could decide for myself.

If you thought that was interesting, you might like to read about the mysterious “pyramids” discovered in Antarctica. What are they?

This circus coming to Minnesota quite literally isn't for everyone, but it is bound to be a frightfully good time.

A relatively new brand of circus will be making a handful of stops in Minnesota this spring, including Duluth, St. Cloud, the Twin Cities, and Rochester, and if you enjoy the paranormal and other creepy things, this show is for you.

Picture it if you dare...you're under a black and red big-top tent where illusionists, mysterious creatures, aerial acrobats, and "freaky" performers assemble a show that combines circus, theatre, and cabaret into an experience that will "scare, amuse, and surprise".

This animal-free show is wildly imaginative, transporting you to what might feel more like a dark, twisted dream than what you're used to when you think of a circus. Here's a little taste from a show a few years ago:

Paranormal Cirque has an explicit "R-rating" on their website due to adult language and content in the show that's not intended for children.

Organizers warn that anyone under the age of 18 will need to be accompanied by an adult. Those ages 13-17 are welcome, as long as they are accompanied by someone 21 or older.

This isn't the first time this experience has come through Minnesota. Maybe you caught one of their 2023 shows, and you want to experience what is new this time around - or maybe you are just hearing about it for the first time.

Paranormal Cirque will be touring through Minnesota in May and June, making several stops along the way. Each stop will see the big top tent set up in a mall parking lot, starting with a stop in Rochester and ending their Minnesota tour in Duluth.

Here's where they'll be:

Rochester, MN at The Apache Mall: May 2-5, 2025 (Show details)

Albertville, MN at the Albertville Premium Outlets: May 9 - 12, 2025 (Show details)

Saint Paul, MN at the Maplewood Mall: May 16 - 19, 2025 (Show details)

Saint Cloud, MN at The Crossroads Center: May 23 - 26, 2025 (Show details)

Duluth, MN at the Miller Hill Mall: May 30 - June 2, 2025 (Show details)

"Does anyone else think that maybe just maybe all those Drones flying around New Jersey may have had something to do with this big Forest fire going on right now," says one April 23, 2025 post on Facebook.

The post -- and other similar messages blaming drones for the historic blazes that ravaged New Jersey in April -- come after reports of unidentified aircraft flying over the northeastern state dominated social media in late 2024 and early 2025, stoking fears among residents.

Some posts have claimed these drones ignited the blazes using directed energy weapons, which harness concentrated electromagnetic energy and are being developed in the United States for drone and missile defense.

The wildfires erupted April 22 in the pine forests of New Jersey and grew to 15,000 acres, devastating one of the largest protected areas on the east coast and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. The state was put under drought alert in March (archived here).

But the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office said in an April 24 statement that "the cause of the fire was determined to be incendiary by an improperly extinguished bonfire," alleging that a 19-year-old resident set wooden pallets on fire and then left the area without it being fully extinguished.

Authorities charged the individual with aggravated arson.

New Jersey's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Shawn LaTourette, told AFP in an April 23 email that they "have not received any credible report of mysterious drone activity and we are not aware of any legitimate evidence that suggests such activity, if it exists, is related to the cause of the Jones Road Wildfire."

The claims about directed energy weapons ignited the blazes are also baseless -- and echo conspiracy theories previously shared about similar disasters.

In an article on the technology, Iain Boyd, director of the University of Colorado's Center for National Security Initiatives explained that "the power level needed to ignite vegetation with a high-energy laser from the sky would require a large power source installed on a large aircraft" (archived here and here).

As of time of publication, 65 percent of the fire had been contained and evacuation orders fully lifted.

Drones are not allowed to fly during fire emergencies. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service has repeatedly reminded its residents to refrain from flying recreational drones in fire zones.

"Please remember, 'No Drones in Fire Zones - If YOU fly, WE can't!'" the agency said on Facebook April 25 (archived here).

The video shared in some of the posts on social media faulting drones for the fire has been online for months, reverse image searches revealed. The clip dates to at least December 2024, when public hysteria over the drone sightings peaked.

Despite assurances from the Biden administration, narratives about foreign attacks and UFOs gained massive traction in late 2024.

In December, the Department of Defense said an investigation concluded: "To date, we have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent" (archived here).

Just after taking office, the Trump administration also responded to the situation. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a January 28, 2025 press briefing: "The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) for research and various other reasons," (archived here).

"Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones," she said, adding: "It got worse due to curiosity, this was not the enemy."

AFP has previously debunked similar claims about wildfires and directed energy weapons.

The detection of life beyond Earth would be one of the most profound discoveries in the history of science. The Milky Way galaxy alone hosts hundreds of millions of potentially habitable planets. Astronomers are using powerful space telescopes to look for molecular indicators of biology in the atmospheres of the most Earth-like of these planets.

But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers—including the paper's authors—aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. A detection of life would be a remarkable development.

The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," in regard to searching for alien life. It conveys the idea that there should be a high bar for evidence to support a remarkable claim.

I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. But to reach this threshold of finding life beyond Earth, a result needs to fit several important criteria.

There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up?

First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide.

On Earth, dimethyl sulfide is associated with biology, in particular bacteria and plankton in the oceans. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life.

Second, the detection needs to be strong. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise.

The K2-18b detection has a significance of 3-sigma, which means it has a 0.3% probability of arising by chance.

That sounds low, but most scientists would consider that a weak detection. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range.

The "gold standard" for scientific detection is 5-sigma, which means the probability of the finding happening by chance is less than 0.00006%. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013.

Third, a result needs to be repeatable. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated—ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism.

In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars.

Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability.

Lowell was misled by his visual observations, and he was engaging in wishful thinking. No other astronomers could confirm his findings.

In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite.

However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. That extraordinary claim has dissipated.

More recently, astronomers detected low levels of methane in the atmosphere of Mars. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily—but not exclusively—by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another.

The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. And in the absence of definitive evidence that this very low level of methane has a biological origin, nobody is claiming definitive evidence of life on Mars.

Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular.

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI, has been underway for 75 years. No messages have ever been received, but in 1977 a radio telescope in Ohio detected a strong signal that lasted only for a minute.

This signal was so unusual that an astronomer working at the telescope wrote "Wow!" on the printout, giving the signal its name. Unfortunately, nothing like it has since been detected from that region of the sky, so the Wow! Signal fails the test of repeatability.

In 2017, a rocky, cigar-shaped object called 'Oumuamua was the first known interstellar object to visit the solar system. 'Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. However, the object has already left the solar system, so there's no chance for astronomers to observe it again. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet.

While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan.

These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study.

A cautionary tale comes from attempts to show that the universe went through a period of extremely rapid expansion a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Cosmologists call this event inflation, and it is invoked to explain why the universe is now smooth and flat.

In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. Within a year, however, the team retracted the result because the signal had a mundane explanation: They had confused dust in our galaxy with a signature of inflation.

On the other hand, the discovery of the universe's acceleration shows the success of the scientific method. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Physicists were startled by this result.

Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.

On scales large and small, astronomers try to set a high bar of evidence before claiming a discovery.

U.S. President Donald Trump reacted to the tragic death of Virginia Giuffre. Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew accuser Giuffre died on April 25. Trump's remark came as online conspiracy theorists link her sudden passing to jail cell death of Epstein. Giuffre worked at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate as a teenage spa attendant. It was at the time when she was approached by Epstein's fixer Ghislaine Maxwell. WATCH-

A team of astronomers recently made the bold claim that they had found "the strongest evidence yet" that life exists anywhere else besides Earth – setting off a media frenzy.

By studying data from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers at the University of Cambridge announced April 17 that they had found possible biosignatures hinting at the existence of microbial organisms on a distant exoplanet.

That star-orbiting exoplanet, K2-18b, has long fascinated astronomers who consider it among the best ocean worlds to search for signs of extraterrestrial life.

But one independent researcher is already casting doubt on the recent sensational discovery.

Jake Taylor, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford, took another look at the Webb telescope data used in the study and came to a much different conclusion: Taylor found no evidence of the atmospheric clues that were so integral in the Cambridge study's findings.

“I don't personally think that this is a detection of life on K2-18b,” Taylor said in a skeptical video shared on TikTok. “We need way more observations.”

K2-18b, which orbits a red dwarf star more than 120 light-years from Earth, has for years intrigued astronomers who believe it exists in what they refer to as the "habitable zone" – where conditions could be right for water to pool on the surface.

Observations have allowed scientists to conclude that the exoplanet, which is 8.6 times bigger than Earth, could be a Hycean world covered by ocean water underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

The latest findings on K2-18b came from a team of researchers led by Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge in England.

The team studied data from Webb's infrared instrument to study the light from K2-18b's parent star as the exoplanet passed in front of it from Earth's vantage. That's what led Madhusudhan and his team to detect hints of sulfur-based gases dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere – both molecules from the same chemical family.

On Earth, the gases are only produced by life, primarily microbial life such as marine algae like phytoplankton, according to the researchers.

But according to Taylor, those molecules can also be produced naturally including, for instance, by comets.

Taylor was also critical in the TikTok video of the researchers' decision to compare the molecules found to nitrogen-rich atmospheres like Earth, as researchers aren't certain how those molecules would behave on a world with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

“The data they use are not appropriate for these type of atmospheres,” Taylor said.

In his own study, published to arXiv, Taylor used a common data model for exoplanet studies and found no conclusive traces of either sulfur-based gases.

"I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features," Taylor wrote in the study.

Taylor and Madhusudhan, however, may agree on one point: Additional analysis is needed of K2-18b to determine if anything does indeed live on the planet.

Madhusudhan readily acknowledged that his team's observations could have occurred by chance or could be the result of previously unknown chemical processes at work on K2-18b.

“It's important that we're deeply skeptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,” Madhusudhan said in a statement announcing his own findings. “That's how science has to work.”

Independent scientists are sure to analyze the data soon to see if they come to the same conclusion.

Our current AI systems may one day evolve into a superintelligent entity, but scientists aren't yet certain what this might look like and what the implications are.

Rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) is prompting people to question what the fundamental limits of the technology are. Increasingly, a topic once consigned to science fiction — the notion of a superintelligent AI — is now being considered seriously by scientists and experts alike.

The idea that machines might one day match or even surpass human intelligence has a long history. But the pace of progress in AI over recent decades has given renewed urgency to the topic, particularly since the release of powerful large language models (LLMs) by companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic, among others.

Experts have wildly differing views on how feasible this idea of "artificial super intelligence" (ASI) is and when it might appear, but some suggest that such hyper-capable machines are just around the corner. What's certain is that if, and when, ASI does emerge, it will have enormous implications for humanity's future.

"I believe we would enter a new era of automated scientific discoveries, vastly accelerated economic growth, longevity, and novel entertainment experiences," Tim Rocktäschel, professor of AI at University College London and a principal scientist at Google DeepMind told Live Science, providing a personal opinion rather than Google DeepMind's official position. However, he also cautioned: "As with any significant technology in history, there is potential risk."

Traditionally, AI research has focused on replicating specific capabilities that intelligent beings exhibit. These include things like the ability to visually analyze a scene, parse language or navigate an environment. In some of these narrow domains AI has already achieved superhuman performance, Rocktäschel said, most notably in games like go and chess.

The stretch goal for the field, however, has always been to replicate the more general form of intelligence seen in animals and humans that combines many such capabilities. This concept has gone by several names over the years, including “strong AI” or “universal AI”, but today it is most commonly called artificial general intelligence (AGI).

"For a long time, AGI has been a far away north star for AI research," Rocktäschel said. "However, with the advent of foundation models [another term for LLMs] we now have AI that can pass a broad range of university entrance exams and participate in international math and coding competitions."

This is leading people to take the possibility of AGI more seriously, said Rocktäschel. And crucially, once we create AI that matches humans on a wide range of tasks, it may not be long before it achieves superhuman capabilities across the board. That's the idea, anyway. "Once AI reaches human-level capabilities, we will be able to use it to improve itself in a self-referential way," Rocktäschel said. "I personally believe that if we can reach AGI, we will reach ASI shortly, maybe a few years after that."



Once that milestone has been reached, we could see what British mathematician Irving John Good dubbed an "intelligence explosion" in 1965. He argued that once machines become smart enough to improve themselves, they would rapidly achieve levels of intelligence far beyond any human. He described the first ultra-intelligent machine as "the last invention that man need ever make."

Renowned futurist Ray Kurzweil has argued this would lead to a "technological singularity" that would suddenly and irreversibly transform human civilization. The term draws parallels with the singularity at the heart of a black hole, where our understanding of physics breaks down. In the same way, the advent of ASI would lead to rapid and unpredictable technological growth that would be beyond our comprehension.

Exactly when such a transition might happen is debatable. In 2005, Kurzweil predicted AGI would appear by 2029, with the singularity following in 2045, a prediction he's stuck to ever since. Other AI experts offer wildly varying predictions — from within this decade to never. But a recent survey of 2,778 AI researchers found that, on aggregate, they believe there is a 50% chance ASI could appear by 2047. A broader analysis concurred that most scientists agree AGI might arrive by 2040.

The implications of a technology like ASI would be enormous, prompting scientists and philosophers to dedicate considerable time to mapping out the promise and potential pitfalls for humanity.

On the positive side, a machine with almost unlimited capacity for intelligence could solve some of the world's most pressing challenges, said Daniel Hulme, CEO of the AI companies Satalia and Conscium. In particular, super intelligent machines could "remove the friction from the creation and dissemination of food, education, healthcare, energy, transport, so much that we can bring the cost of those goods down to zero," he told Live Science.

The hope is that this would free people from having to work to survive and could instead spend time doing things they're passionate about, Hulme explained. But unless systems are put in place to support those whose jobs are made redundant by AI, the outcome could be bleaker. "If that happens very quickly, our economies might not be able to rebalance, and it could lead to social unrest,” he said.

This also assumes we could control and direct an entity much more intelligent than us — something many experts have suggested is unlikely. "I don't really subscribe to this idea that it will be watching over us and caring for us and making sure that we're happy," said Hulme. "I just can't imagine it would care."

The possibility of a superintelligence we have no control over has prompted fears that AI could present an existential risk to our species. This has become a popular trope in science fiction, with movies like "Terminator" or "The Matrix" portraying malevolent machines hell-bent on humanity's destruction.

But philosopher Nick Bostrom highlighted that an ASI wouldn't even have to be actively hostile to humans for various doomsday scenarios to play out. In a 2012 paper, he suggested that the intelligence of an entity is independent of its goals, so an ASI could have motivations that are completely alien to us and not aligned with human well-being.



Bostrom fleshed out this idea with a thought experiment in which a super-capable AI is set the seemingly innocuous task of producing as many paper-clips as possible. If unaligned with human values, it may decide to eliminate all humans to prevent them from switching it off, or so it can turn all the atoms in their bodies into more paperclips.

Rocktäschel is more optimistic. "We build current AI systems to be helpful, but also harmless and honest assistants by design," he said. "They are tuned to follow human instructions, and are trained on feedback to provide helpful, harmless, and honest answers."

While Rocktäschel admitted these safeguards can be circumvented, he's confident we will develop better approaches in the future. He also thinks that it will be possible to use AI to oversee other AI, even if they are stronger.

Hulme said most current approaches to "model alignment" — efforts to ensure that AI is aligned with human values and desires — are too crude. Typically, they either provide rules for how the model should behave or train it on examples of human behavior. But he thinks these guardrails, which are bolted on at the end of the training process, could be easily bypassed by ASI.

Instead, Hulme thinks we must build AI with a "moral instinct." His company Conscium is attempting to do that by evolving AI in virtual environments that have been engineered to reward behaviors like cooperation and altruism. Currently, they are working with very simple, "insect-level" AI, but if the approach can be scaled up, it could make alignment more robust. "Embedding morals in the instinct of an AI puts us in a much safer position than just having these sort of Whack-a-Mole guard rails," said Hulme.

Not everyone is convinced we need to start worrying quite yet, though. One common criticism of the concept of ASI, said Rocktäschel, is that we have no examples of humans who are highly capable across a wide range of tasks, so it may not be possible to achieve this in a single model either. Another objection is that the sheer computational resources required to achieve ASI may be prohibitive.

—AI can now replicate itself — a milestone that has experts terrified

—32 times artificial intelligence got it catastrophically wrong

More practically, how we measure progress in AI may be misleading us about how close we are to superintelligence, said Alexander Ilic, head of the ETH AI Center at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Most of the impressive results in AI in recent years have come from testing systems on several highly contrived tests of individual skills such as coding, reasoning or language comprehension, which the systems are explicitly trained to pass, said Ilic.

He compares this to cramming for exams at school. "You loaded up your brain to do it, then you wrote the test, and then you forgot all about it," he said. "You were smarter by attending the class, but the actual test itself is not a good proxy of the actual knowledge."

AI that is capable of passing many of these tests at superhuman levels may only be a few years away, said Ilic. But he believes today's dominant approach will not lead to models that can carry out useful tasks in the physical world or collaborate effectively with humans, which will be crucial for them to have a broad impact in the real world.

Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered "smoking gun" evidence of a hidden feeding supermassive black hole in a distant spiral galaxy.

Scientists have long believed that monster-sized supermassive black holes lurk at the heart of all large galaxies. That means that the failure to detect such a cosmic titan at the heart of the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy, officially known as Messier 83 (M83), has been a frustrating conundrum.

Now, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers may have cracked this puzzle, finding the first evidence of a supermassive black hole at the heart of M83, also known as NGC 5236, a spiral galaxy located around 15 million light-years away.

"The JWST is revolutionizing our understanding of galaxies," team member Linda Smith of the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a statement. "For years, astronomers have searched for a black hole in M83 without success. Now, we finally have a compelling clue that suggests one may be present."

Supermassive black holes have masses millions or even billions of times that of the sun. Situated at the hearts of distant galaxies, these black holes are pretty conspicuous when they are actively feeding and surrounded by gas and dust that they heat, causing them to glow brightly.

These regions, known as "active galactic nuclei" or "AGNs," can often be seen even in galaxies that are otherwise too distant and too faint to be detected.

This has led scientists to speculate that either the supermassive black hole at the heart of M83 is dormant (not actively feeding on matter), or that the AGN it powers is hidden by a thick shroud of dust.

That second explanation is favored by new data from the JWST which takes full advantage of the $10 billion space telescope's unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution.



Clumps of highly ionized gas were the "smoking gun" hinting at the presence of an obscured AGN at the heart of M83.

"Our discovery of highly ionized neon emission in the nucleus of M83 was unexpected," team leader Svea Hernandez, a European Space Agency (ESA) scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said. "These signatures require large amounts of energy to be produced, more than what normal stars can generate.

"This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN that has been elusive until now."

Even the explosive death of massive stars in supernovas couldn't provide enough energy to create the signature spotted by the JWST. That makes an AGN the most likely suspect. But, not the only suspect.

The team behind this discovery now needs to eliminate other possible candidates for the creation of highly ionized neon gas, such as shockwaves travelling through the gases that exists between stars, the "interstellar medium."

—Newly 'awakened' black hole is releasing 100 times more energy than scientists have ever seen before

—Black holes can destroy planets — but they can also lead us to thriving alien worlds. Here's how.

Astronomers will now follow up the investigation of M83 with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the Very Large Telescope (VLT). In the meantime, this research proves how effective the JWST is at discovering hitherto unseen structures in the cosmos.

"This discovery showcases how the JWST is making unexpected breakthroughs," Smith concluded, "Astronomers thought they had ruled out an AGN in M83, but now we have fresh evidence that challenges past assumptions and opens new avenues for exploration."

The team's research was published April 17 in The Astrophysical Journal.

TechTron 2025, the University of Asia Pacific (UAP)'s most anticipated flagship technology event, commenced on Friday, 25 April, with a vibrant celebration of innovation, engineering excellence and academic-industry collaboration.

The national-level festival has been jointly organised by the UAP EEE Project Club and the IEEE UAP Student Branch, under the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE), UAP.

The grand opening ceremony took place at the UAP Plaza, with Prof. Dr. Qumrul Ahsan, Vice Chancellor of UAP, as chief guest.

In his inaugural speech, Prof. Dr. Qumrul Ahsan remarked, TechTron 2025 is an exemplary event that inspires students not only to excel academically but also to contribute to society through real-life innovations. Events like these build bridges between academia and industry, and UAP remains committed to encouraging such impactful initiatives.

Prof. Dr. GR Ahmed Jamal, Dean of the School of Engineering, stated, to lead technological advancements in today's world, students must be empowered with innovation, practical knowledge, and problem-solving skills. TechTron provides an ideal stage for showcasing those abilities.

AHM Jadidul Karim, Head of the Department of EEE, credited the successful execution of the event to the joint efforts of the EEE Project Club and the IEEE UAP Student Branch. He expressed pride in UAP's role in organizing a festival that unites aspiring engineers from across Bangladesh.

TechTron 2025 brought together students from over 35 universities across the country, engaging them in a variety of technology-based competitions and exhibitions, including innovative project showcases, robotics challenges, poster presentations, and online gaming contests. The event served as a dynamic platform for young engineers to exhibit their creativity, problem-solving capabilities, and technical knowledge.

The day concluded with an awards ceremony, celebrating the achievements of participants and reinforcing UAP's role as a national leader in promoting STEM education, innovation, and industry readiness. Architect Mahbuba Haque, Chairperson of the Board of Trustees, UAP, was chief guest at the closing event.

Distinguished special guests included Engr. Muhammad Jahangir Alam, Chief Engineer, Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB); Dr. Md Shamiul Fahad from Intel Corporation, Oregon, USA; and Fahim Mahmud, UAP EEE alumnus and Country Manager at Crown Micro Global Bangladesh Ltd. Their presence highlighted the strong link between academia and industry—a key theme of this year's event.

From its cavernous domed bazaar to its ravishingly muscular museum, the Uzbek capital has one of the world's wildest collections of modernist gems. Will its bid for world heritage status succeed?

A pair of huge turquoise domes swell up on the skyline of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, perching on the jumbled horizon like two upturned bowls. One gleams with ceramic tiles, glazed in traditional Uzbek patterns. The other catches the light with a pleated canopy of azure metal ribs. Both recall the majestic cupolas that crown the mosques of the country's ancient Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara. But here, they cover structures of a very different kind.

The ribbed metal dome crowns the home of the state circus, its futuristic-looking big top seeming to have been crossed with a UFO. Built in 1976, it's big enough to hold an audience of 3,000. The ceramic dome, meanwhile, looms over the bustling chaos of the city's main market, Chorsu Bazaar, built in 1980 as a wonderworld of fruit, meat and fish, sprawling across an area the size of two football pitches. Both are dazzling works of Soviet modernism, and part of a remarkable group of buildings that the country has just submitted to Unesco, in the hope of having them granted world heritage status.

“People tend to think of Uzbek heritage as our ancient Islamic monuments,” says Gayane Umerova, chair of the country's Art and Culture Development Foundation (ACDF). “But we need to realise that we are in danger of losing the more recent layers of history, due to urban development. We have to act now.”

Over the last few years, the ACDF has been highlighting Tashkent's unique postwar heritage, hosting conferences, commissioning expert research, and now publishing two hefty books about the period, as well as putting the topic in the global spotlight with an exhibition at the Venice architecture biennale, opening shortly. This push was triggered in 2018, following a public outcry over the demolition of a beloved cylindrical concrete movie theatre, the House of Cinema, built in 1982. It was hastily bulldozed to make way for a $1.3bn commercial development, a bloated cluster of generic glass towers known as Tashkent City.

“It was a big loss for our society,” says Umerova. “It wasn't just about the building –people had grown up with the cinema as a place to go on dates, see friends, hang out. Its sudden loss made us look at what else might be in danger.”

In the line of fire, potentially, is one of the most unusual collections of modernist buildings anywhere in the world. About 2,000 miles from Moscow, Tashkent occupies a fascinating position in the history of the Soviet Union as a showcase city, bridging east and west. It was designated a “beacon of socialism in the east”, conceived as a vast vitrine to display the successful socialist transformation of a non-Russian city. Its image of prosperity, abundance, leisure and progress would show how communism could be adapted to the diverse, far-flung populations of Central Asia – and therefore to the rest of the world.

An earthquake in 1966 provided a convenient excuse to raze much of the historic city and impose a masterplan of wide avenues dotted with grand, orientalist structures that would speak of Tashkent's new role as the modern gateway to Asia. The buildings are a fascinating mix, combining the latest technologies and construction techniques of international modernism with ornamental details that hark back to the 15th-century architecture of the Timurid dynasty. That became adopted as the official national style, and remains so to this day, despite it being of little historic relevance to Tashkent.

“Interestingly, the buildings designed for Tashkent in Moscow were much more decorative and ‘orientalist' than those designed locally,” says Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Russian architect whose Milan-based practice Grace has been leading the preservation strategy. “It was like they were trying to present an imaginary, exoticised image of Tashkent back to local people.”

She is standing outside the former Lenin Museum, now the state history museum, a gleaming white marble jewellery box. Wrapped with supersized latticework screens, it appears to float above a recessed glass lobby on a hidden steel frame. The building was created in 1970 by the snappily titled Central Scientific Research and Experimental Project Institute for Entertainment and Sport, an elite Moscow bureau that delivered prestige projects across the USSR. Despite the bold modernist form, its design consciously draws on tradition, with the geometric screens referencing vernacular Uzbek panjara, or latticework grilles that provide shading and ventilation, as well as Islamic patterns (a fact not mentioned at the time). “The design was criticised locally for being superficial,” says Golovatyuk. “But it launched a new direction. Gradually, this would become the language of modernist Tashkent.”

The domed circus is a striking example of how these aesthetic attitudes evolved. It was first drawn up in the early 1960s, by architects Genrikh Aleksandrovich and Gennady Masyagin, as a brutalist flying saucer, studded with porthole windows. Construction began in 1965, but was halted by the earthquake. As time went on, the space-age design became historicised, clothed in traditional fancy dress. The inspiration was no longer a UFO, but an Uzbek piala, or teacup. Decorative concrete sunshades were added, in a form that echoed ancient Kufic script. The interior is a surreal mashup, where concentric cosmic rays radiating from the doorways became encrusted with traditional ornamentation, like a spaceship decked out in chintzy wallpaper.

Other experiments to celebrate the regional context focused less on decoration than on local typologies. One of the most radical projects of the era is the Zhemchug (or Pearl) housing block, designed as a vertical expression of the traditional mahalla courtyard homes. Built in 1985, the 16-storey tower features a pair of communal courtyards every three storeys, providing space for children to play, while elderly residents sit out playing chess and drinking tea. Front doors are reached via outdoor galleries that look down into these back yards in the sky.

“I love its uniqueness,” says Dilara, who has lived here for decades. “We've used the courtyards for weddings, barbecues and drinking beer together. There is a strong sense of community.” A rooftop swimming pool, now a pond, was added to increase stability in the event of an earthquake. It is surrounded by mushroom-shaped sunshades that double as ventilation for all the kitchens down below.

Sadly, this inventive design didn't take off. “It was the first building in Uzbekistan to use sliding concrete formwork,” says Golovatyuk, referring to a system where the moulds are moved up while concrete is poured continuously. “It was supposed to be cheaper and faster, but it turned out to be slower and much more expensive.” Still, its occupants seem to love it. They've even curated a little exhibition about its female architect, Ophelia Aydinova, in the lobby.

Cost may have deterred any repeat, but money was no object when it came to symbols of national pride. As the planned economy began to falter in the 1980s, the baubles of Soviet pomp became ever grander. As Golovatyuk puts it: “When a regime isn't doing so well, the need for representation gets even bigger.” She is standing outside a prime example, the gargantuan Palace of People's Friendship. Unveiled in 1981, its ornate hall seats over 4,000 in a pharaonic temple of culture, dripping with gilded ceramics and crystal chandeliers.

Designed by the team behind the Lenin Museum, led by Yevgeny Rozanov and Elena Sukhanova, it is a tour de force of Uzbek modernism. Raised on a plinth, the museum is wrapped in a muscular facade of panjara-inspired grille-work, crowned with a colossal frieze of abstract muqarnas, the sculptural stalactite motifs found inside the domes and niches of Islamic architecture. Inside, the ceiling of its triple-height atrium groans with pearly chandeliers, evoking dangling branches of cotton bolls, while the walls are lined with fluted blue tiles and expressionistic ceramic sculptures by Alexander Kedrin. The floors, meanwhile, writhe with geometric marquetry. It has the look of an immense marble Transformer, seemingly about to unfold into a great robotic creature and march towards the circus.

There are more wonders dotted throughout the city, beautifully photographed by Karel Balas for a Rizzoli coffee-table book, and meticulously examined in a 900-page tome for Lars Müller, with pictures by Armin Linke. The metro system is a particular treat, especially Kosmonavtlar (or Cosmonauts) station, built in 1984 as a cosmic fantasy of blue tiled walls, green glass columns and celestial light fittings, evoking the wonders of space exploration.

Perhaps the most spectacular of all lies an hour outside the city, perched on a hillside in Parkent. Looking like something dreamed up by a Bond villain, the Sun Heliocomplex is an astonishing sight, a 20-storey convex cliff of mirrors, able to channel the sun's energy to a temperature of 3,000C. Completed in 1987, it was designed to test the resistance of materials to nuclear explosion and develop heatproof ceramics for the Soviet military. Since the collapse of the USSR, it has hobbled along, working with agriculture, textile and mining industries. Although it was a classified project, off-limits to most, it was intended as a showcase of applied arts, featuring sculptural ceramic screens and dazzling planetary chandeliers by artist Irena Lipene. A seven-tonne example will be shown in Venice, capturing in crystal the end-of-the-world glamour of the nuclear age.

Sergo Sutyagin, a leading Uzbek architect, hailed this “cosmic architecture”, praising how it “poetically and fantastically emerges” from the hillside, “prompting philosophical reflections on the reality of the unreal, on the possibility of the impossible”. The space race having moved elsewhere, you can now visit the complex and harness the immense power of the sun to boil a kettle or fry an egg.

Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Peter Dutton? Charisma has been linked to electoral victory (just ask Bob Hawke), but defining it can be difficult

For all the gen Z slang that has been thrown around by politicians in recent months, one term has been largely absent from the election campaign: “rizz”. Oxford University Press's 2023 word of the year is defined as “style, charm or attractiveness”; in gen Z parlance it refers specifically to romantic appeal.

On the campaign trail, neither major party leader, thankfully, has deployed the term to cringeworthy effect. But a trait to which rizz is inextricably linked – charisma – has historically been linked to electoral victory.

As a quality, charisma can be difficult to pin down: you know it when you see it, but articulating why someone possesses it is a more difficult endeavour. Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, had it in spades. As does – depending on who you ask – Barack Obama, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump.

The German sociologist Max Weber is credited for the term charisma in its modern usage, which he defined as an individual “treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary.”

In the past, Weber's definition has been taken to mean that leaders intrinsically possess a preternatural je ne sais quoi – an interpretation that Alex Haslam, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland, takes issue with. “Actually what he says is: it's about being regarded as having those things,” Haslam says.

Charisma, Haslam argues, is in the eye of the beholder, rather than an innate trait. “Is Anthony Albanese charismatic? Is Peter Dutton charismatic? It depends on who you ask. We treat charisma as if it's a property or a thing that they possess, but it's clearly based on our relationship with them,” he says.

“We perceive people as charismatic to the extent that they represent us, we see them as one of us, we see ourselves in them.”

Michael Platow, a professor of psychology at the Australian National University, agrees. “It's not something that you are born with,” he says. “The idea that there's something about you that was always predestined to get other people to engage with you and follow you is just wrong,” Platow says, referring to the “great man” theory that was popularised by historians in the 19th century, which assumed that leaders innately possessed traits that set them apart from the masses.

In Haslam and Platow's book, The New Psychology of Leadership, co-authored with Prof Stephen Reicher, they characterise charismatic leaders as those who are most successful in creating a sense of shared social identity – a sense of “us-ness”. Leaders must articulate not only their policies to voters, Platow says, but also “a vision of us collectively. Politicians try to place themselves at the centre of that ‘us'.”

Platow cites Trump as an example of charisma being conferred by followers rather than an inherent quality of a leader. “There are a lot of people who think he's their saviour, and … there are millions who don't,” he says. “He's trying to define what America is in particular terms … and he is succeeding in many ways in doing that for a subset of the population.”

One way researchers measure charisma is simply to ask people what they think of someone. “It's subjective,” Platow concedes. “But in the end, voting is subjective.”

Ample evidence supports the idea that charisma is not a fixed, innate trait. Studies show that success contributes to perceptions of charisma. Research has found that for a given description, a business executive is perceived as more charismatic if people are told the performance of their company improved. “If Anthony Albanese were to win this election, then his supporters would perceive him to be much more charismatic,” Haslam says.

A linked phenomenon in politics is the incumbency effect: “If the economy is doing well or if other macroeconomic factors are good, then people like who is currently in office, because they basically attribute the success to that person,” says Lisa Lu, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, whose dissertation focuses on leadership and charisma.

Success is only one ingredient in the secret sauce, however. One analysis of five Australian prime ministers from Gough Whitlam to John Howard, based on monthly public opinion polling, found that “Bob Hawke was the only one of the five to exhibit significant charisma; his approval rating was over 10 percentage points higher during his period of office than would otherwise have been expected by his economic or political performance.” Keating, it found, “was the least charismatic, by about the same margin”.

Central to Hawke's public image was that of a quintessentially Australian beer-skolling, sports-loving larrikin. Charismatic leadership has been characterised by some researchers as being grounded in values, “beliefs and symbolism”, as well as emotive and expressive communication. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2020 survey of political scientists and historians ranked Hawke first among Australian prime ministers for “communication effectiveness”, as well as his “relationship with the electorate”. His overall performance as prime minister rated second overall after John Curtin.

“As we move into the election, watch how each candidate defines ‘us', how they position themselves as being the ‘prototypical' Australian,” Platow says. “It's not just kissing babies, it's working at Bunnings selling sausages … it's having a beer at the pub.”

Perceptions of charisma are also bound up in factors an individual cannot change. How tall one is, for example: height is associated with greater charisma in male leaders, and US presidents have been much taller than the average American man. Some studies have found that followers attribute greater charisma to women than men, but Assoc Prof Jessica Flanigan has pointed out that these tracked perceived emotional intelligence rather than overall likability.

The historical dearth of female heads of state is “a product of the fact that we live in a sexist world”, Haslam believes. “When I was growing up, you were presented with almost no plausible female candidates that we were encouraged to perceive as charismatic … I think that's different now.”

Given charisma isn't innate, what should a leader desperate to increase their appeal do? One sure-fire but drastic way is to die. Research co-authored by Haslam studied 48 heads of state who died in office between 2000 and 2013. The study found that the leaders were twice as likely to be described as charismatic in death.

Haslam attributes the effect to a posthumous focus on the leader's social contributions over personal shortcomings. “You can think of all the things they did for us,” he says. “In a way, you get this very pure, undistilled image of them as a group member.”

In life, charisma can be taught, other research suggests. Associate Prof Philippe Jacquart of EM Lyon Business School and Prof John Antonakis of the University of Lausanne have identified nine rhetorical and three non-verbal strategies commonly used by leaders considered charismatic.

Looking at nomination speeches of US Democratic and Republican presidential candidates between 1916 and 2008, they measured use of the verbal strategies – including metaphors, stories and anecdotes, demonstrating moral conviction and sharing sentiments of the collective – as a marker of charisma. The more charismatic candidate, as defined by their model, won 23 out of 24 US presidential elections they studied.

Even a cursory survey of history's autocrats – Hitler and Mussolini among them – and cult leaders like Jim Jones reveals the dark side of charisma. “It's pretty obvious that in toxic groups, where they have those kinds of leaders, that's going to be a problem,” Haslam says.

As Lu says, charisma is “a tool that can be used for good or for bad … even if you can develop it in people, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody should.”
