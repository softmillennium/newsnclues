                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U. S. Men's National team is two months away from a crucial test in the Gold Cup, a biennial tournament that decides North America's strongest soccer team. This is a less-than-stellar season for AC Milan, which was eliminated from the Champions League before the knockout rounds and sits ninth in Italy's Serie A. Pulisic, Milan's leading goal scorer this season, is putting together one of the stronger seasons for an American abroad in history. "It's always good to get goals and assists," Pulisic said after the match, per goal.com. Sure, but some players do that job better than others — and Pulisic is doing it better than just about everyone. Defense has been a weak spot for the USMNT for years, but 25-year-old Alabama native Richards is looking to change that. He played in all 90 minutes of Crystal Palace's 3-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday in an FA Cup semifinal. He and his Palace back line have conceded just one goal on their way to the final against Man City on May 17. "Hopefully we can make it just one goal conceded for the whole tournament," Richards said, per the Crystal Palace website. Defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers and Auston Trusty | Celtic, Scotland Carter-Vickers and Trusty, Celtic's American center back pairing, lifted the Scottish Premiership trophy on Saturday after beating Dundee United 5-0. It's Celtic's 55th Premiership title, which levels it with Glasgow rival Rangers for the most wins in Scottish Premiership history. Cardoso led Betis to an impressive 5-1 win over Valladolid in La Liga on April 24. The win lifted Betis to sixth in La Liga and put it just one point outside of the Champions League qualification spots for next season. Cardoso is a composed, cerebral midfielder vital to Betis' success but is rarely the star of the show. Don't let his lack of flash fool you, though. His fitness, consistency and intelligence make him a crucial depth piece for the USMNT. Luna scored twice Saturday against San Diego FC, but it was his first goal — an impressive solo effort that began with a muscly interception and ended with a looped shot into the top corner — that showed off his skill set best.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti will leave Real Madrid at the end of the La Liga season and take over as Brazil head coach, according to multiple reports. Following a deflating elimination from the UEFA Champions League losing both quarterfinal legs to Arsenal, reports of Ancelotti's departure started to take off. Real Madrid are still competing for the La Liga trophy with one final Clasico scheduled for Saturday, May 11. The Brazilian Football Confederation want Ancelotti on the touchline for Brazil's friendlies in June against Ecuador and Paraguay, according to Fabrizio Romano. It would be a quick turnaround going from Real Madrid's final game on May 25 to the Brazil national team on June 4, but there's little time to waste if he's going to install his tactics and system with the World Cup just over a year away. Ancelotti leaves Real Madrid for the second time with two La Liga titles, a Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de Espana and UEFA Champions League trophies. He also won the UEFA Super Cup in 2022 and 2024 plus the old FIFA Club World Cup. He'll continue to manage the likes of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Endrick with Brazil while aiming to get the most out of other talent like Raphinha, Gabriel, Bruno Guimaraes and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2024-2025 season may have been a largely disappointing one for Norwich City in the EFL Championship, English soccer's second tier behind only the Premier League, but for U.S. Men's National Team forward Josh Sargent, it has been another solid campaign. Sargent's excellent form led to him being named to the EFL's Championship Team of the Season, alongside teammate Borja Sainz. Meanwhile, with Norwich staring down another season in the Championship, they now face the prospect of taking on Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham twice next year after they confirmed their third-straight promotion. “Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out with the results for the team, but very happy on an individual note for both of us to make this team.” While he may be a fan of the league, it seems he may soon be set to leave the Championship, with Sargent's form having attracted interest from teams in the Premier League and Bundesliga, as per Florian Plettenberg. With his current contract not set to expire until the summer of 2028, he could fetch around €15-20M ($17-22.8M). Sargent has experience in both leagues, having spent three seasons in the German top tier with Werder Bremen, scoring 11 goals in 71 games prior to their relegation in 2021.A subsequent move to then-Premier League side Norwich saw Sargent find the back of the net just twice as they too were ultimately relegated. Over the last year, Sargent has made five appearances for the USMNT, including three under new head coach Mauricio Pochettino. Unfortunately, despite his upturn in league form and opportunities on the national stage, the scoresheet continues to evade him, with his most recent international goal having come back in 2019. Now with friendlies against Turkey and Switzerland scheduled for early June and the CONCACAF Gold Cup taking place shortly after, Sargent has a battle on his hands if he's to convince Pochettino to give him another chance. This may have been made ever harder by Haji Wright's return from injury and solid form for Coventry City, Brian White's excellent season with the Vancouver Whitecaps, and Folarin Balogun's recent return from a lengthy injury layoff with AC Monaco.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elsewhere, Johnny Cardoso and Paxten Aaronson turned heads in La Liga and the Eredivisie, but Wolfsburg's Kevin Parades suffered a blow as he continues his return from a foot injury. Read on as this week's USMNT Player Tracker brings you all the ups and downs of the players national head coach Mauricio Pochettino will turn to this summer. The USMNT star was unflappable when presented with an early unexpected chance to score against Venezia on Sunday, on what manager Sergio Conceicao said was a small, dry pitch that wasn't easy for his players. An error from the hosts at the Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo, when they gave the ball away cheaply in their own half, allowed Milan's Youssouf Fofana to seize possession and play in Pulisic at close range. Like a hot knife through butter 🧈😮‍💨#VeneziaMilan #SempreMilan Brought to you by @SN4IFUN pic.twitter.com/70yBTIen7i That was it for another agonizing 91 minutes, as Milan had to fight against the relegation-battling Venetians before Santiago Gimenez made it 2-0 in stoppage time at the end. Pulisic's big moment earned him the nod from Milan fans as man of the match, and he also put himself in elite statistical company. According to Opta, the goal meant he is now only one of the three Serie A players to have been directly involved in at least 50 goals (31 goals and 19 assists) in the last two seasons in all competitions, alongside Atalanta's Ademola Lookman (50) and Lautaro Martinez (54) of Inter. In terms of what it means for his club, they are still eight points away from the Champions League qualifying spots with four league games remaining. It will be a tall order to drag themselves ahead of the teams above them, not least Weston McKennie's Juventus, who are currently fourth and also won on Sunday. But after springing something of a surprise win over rivals Inter last week to reach the final of the Coppa Italia, then winning in Venice, at least Pulisic and co are developing upward momentum in the closing stages of what remains a below-par season. It was an altogether more decisive win for Pulisic's international team-mates in Scotland on Saturday. But USMNT defender Cameron Carter-Vickers probably did not envisage spending a few minutes picking tangerines off the field before later celebrating his team being crowned champions. That aside, it was easy work for Carter-Vickers and his team, who have now won the Scottish top flight 13 times in the past 14 seasons. Carter-Vickers was a happy man, then, but he disagreed when asked afterwards whether Celtic had to set the record straight in their next game, which happens to be against rivals Rangers, who have dented an otherwise glittering season by beating them twice. “I wouldn't personally use that kind of language because for me, it's not just like one or two games in the season, but the whole 38. It might have been a less perfect afternoon for Carter-Vickers' U.S. team-mate Auston Trusty, who was benched and did not make it onto the field in the game that confirmed their title. Trusty, who recently became a new father, has not featured in three of his team's four most recent games. Chris Richards took his usual place in Crystal Palace's indomitable back three at Wembley in their hugely impressive 3-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa. Before Palace's big win, Richards did the media rounds and chatted with Men in Blazers, who asked him about the USMNT's woeful performances in March's Concacaf Nations League semi-final and third-place games. Then asked why the U.S. players haven't always been able to translate successful club form onto the international scene, he added: “One of the reasons I think that everyone has been so successful at their clubs is you're in that environment every day. “I know it's hard to emulate that when it comes to national team, but I think that's why guys seemed so much more in tune or sharper — you're playing with these guys every single day and when you're coming to national team, these are guys you only train with, depending on flights, depending on times, maybe two days leading up to a game. “I understand that's what every national team is doing, so there's no excuse, but we needed to be more competitive in the last camp and I think going forward, not just from the players' aspect but from the coaching aspect… we kind of had a coming-to-Jesus meeting after the last game and we can't let something like the last camp happen again — especially leading up to a World Cup.” Name: Ethan Horvath Club: Cardiff City Position: Goalkeeper Appearances (all competitions): 18 Horvath experienced the low of relegation with his Welsh club on Saturday when their 0-0 draw with U.S.-owned West Brom sealed their EFL Championship fate. Paredes was so impressive on his return from long-term injury last time out, creating a goal in the 2-2 draw with Mainz, that he kept his place for Wolfsburg's game against Freiburg on Saturday. However, it was a difficult afternoon for Ralph Hasenhuttl's side, who were reduced to 10 men after just 26 minutes and ended up losing 1-0. That is believed to be a minor strain and while he is likely to miss the next game against Gio Reyna's Borussia Dortmund, he should be back in contention for Wolfsburg's final two fixtures of the Bundesliga campaign. The 21-year-old, who fell to his knees and sobbed when his young U.S. side were knocked out of the men's soccer tournament during last summer's Olympics, is hoping that his will to win (and electric talent) catches Pochettino's eye. Now he must end the season with Wolfsburg strongly and earn a chance to feature in the USMNT's summer friendlies or Gold Cup campaign. Name: Paxten Aaronsen Club: FC Utrecht Position: Midfielder Appearances: 35 He grabbed an assist as Utrecht won 4-0 away at RKC Waalwijk in the Eredivisie. Aaronson has been a key part of this push for Champions League football, with seven league goals to his name so far and having created four more. “We are in talks with Frankfurt,” said Utrecht coach Ron Jans recently. Een jongensdroom die uit is gekomen voor Paxten Aaronson 💭 Johnny Cardoso is having a fine old time with his club Real Betis. Cardoso's performances have caught the eye and he has been praised by former USMNT player Charlie Davies. “Johnny Cardoso: we have to talk about him now, at the moment,” Davies said on CBS Sports Golazo America. “(He's) 23 years old, killing it at Real Betis, another massive goal for him at the club, and he was near perfect on the ball (in Betis' previous win over Girona). I think he's really found a good role within this team and Isco is the guy that makes this team tick, but in terms of being an outlet and being able to shuttle the ball across, he has great positioning.” By Saturday, we will know if Antonee Robinson has recovered from the knee pain that has plagued him lately to face Aston Villa in the Premier League (7:30am, Peacock Premium). Also on Saturday, Bournemouth and Tyler Adams are charged with trying to end their season on a high after their promise stalled, leaving them in mid-table. Finally, next Monday, see if Pulisic and Milan's belated mini-revival can keep going when they take on Genoa (2:45pm, Paramount+). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Thomas Müller's tenure at Bayern Munich coming to a close very soon, the attention is towards all the titles he can bag with the club before his departure. Müller's legacy at the club is unforgettable — he has played a pivotal role in the club's history. The trophies play testament — he is the second most decorated German player with 33 trophies after Toni Kroos. This statistic is however subject to change, with Kroos' retirement last year after bagging 34 trophies. However to Müller, titles do not mean everything. Per FIFA and @iMiaSanMia, he spoke on the upcoming Club World Cup. But that's not what makes you happy,” he stated. Further elaborating, he said that the journey matters more. “The journey there is what excites me. It's about constantly taking on the pressure, both physically and competitively – and winning,” he said. Looks like the Raumdeuter still enjoys winning but he just wants to do it in style. He explained his excitement about this tournament. In this format, it feels a bit more like a World Cup,” he described. It goes without being said that all eyes will be on the CWC as it will be one last dance. For, the most unbelievable statement is now the truth — Thomas Müller will be playing his last game at Bayern Munich at the age of 35 years. The same age where the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Yann Sommer, Manuel Neuer, Robert Lewandowski and Luka Modric were considered to still play at near-full capacity. Hell, they all bagged trophies at this age. One can only wonder what could have been, for it is only possible for us to enjoy the little time we have left with our own one club man.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It sounds as if Hoffenheim want some financial compensation if Bischof is to join Bayern for the CWC. The tournament has been met with very mixed reception, but it will give incoming players a chance to immediately prove their mettle at their new clubs. Enter Tom Bischof, who has already agreed a free transfer to Bayern Munich for the summer. The 19-year-old Germany youth international will look to get a chance to prove he can compete with the likes of Joshua Kimmich and Aleksandar Pavlović for a prominent role. Bischof's contract ends on the 30th of June, as is the nature of most contracts in European football, but the Club World Cup begins in mid June. If Bischof were to simply join in July, he would miss the group stages of the tournament, a very inconvenient situation indeed. Hoffenheim will need to release their youth academy graduate early from his contract, something their sporting director, Andreas Schicker, is willing to do. Still, a “good solution” will need to be found before Bischof can leave Hoffenheim: We won't stand in Tom Bischof's way. If a good solution can be found, he can take part in the Club World Cup,” Schicker tells reporter Dennis Bayer (via @iMiaSanMia). “I'm confident that a solution will be found.” It sounds for all the world as if Hoffenheim want to receive a financial compensation in order to release Bischof from his contract, even though Hoffenheim will contest no matches during June. Would Bayern be willing to part with money to get Bischof in a few weeks sooner? Looking for more thoughts and analysis of Bayern Munich's current transfer situation heading into the summer transfer window? What will the backline look like next season? Is Florian Wirtz truly the answer to Bayern Munich's problems? Let's talk about all that and more on this edition of the Bavarian Podcast Works — Weekend Warm-up Show.

Pep Guardiola has addressed recent reports claiming Kevin De Bruyne has no intention of representing Manchester City at the FIFA Club World Cup at the United States after being told he has no future at the Etihad Stadium.

De Bruyne will leave Manchester City at the end of the season after a decorated, trophy-laden decade in sky blue that has put him up there with the Premier League's best-ever imports and amongst the greatest midfielders to have played in England.

The 33-year-old was hopeful of a new deal to extend his stay at the Etihad Stadium but club bosses – including incoming sporting director Hugo Viana – relayed to the Belgium international that he does not feature in the club's plans next season.

     

Since his announcement confirming his impending departure earlier this month, De Bruyne has revealed in interviews he was left disappointed with the club's decision, admitting he was away from his family when Manchester City officials relayed their stance to the playmaker.

City are due to participate in the 32-club FIFA Club World Cup in the United States between June and July – between the end of their Premier League and FA Cup campaign(s) and the beginning of pre-season preparations for the 2025-26 campaign.

It emerged last week that De Bruyne has informed club bosses and Guardiola of his reluctance to travel with City to the United States for the Club World Cup amid fears of injury and a desire to take some time off to rest, recover and assess offers to make a decision on his future with his family.

After refusing to take questions on De Bruyne's future initially whilst speaking to the press ahead of Manchester City's FA Cup semi-final triumph over Nottingham Forest at the weekend, Guardiola was asked if there was any truth to De Bruyne's hesitation to play at the Club World Cup.

“I don't know any info about that,” said Guardiola, who kept De Bruyne on the bench for the entirety of Manchester City's 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Forest at Wembley on Sunday, with the Belgian expected to return to the lineup against Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although Carlo Ancelotti has a contract with Real Madrid until 2026, his future has been in doubt in recent weeks. According to Relevo, Madrid would have almost certainly decided to dismiss Carlo Ancelotti after La Liga, at the end of May. This farewell could occur at Bernabéu, in a calm match, as the league options were reduced after the defeat against Barcelona. If Madrid doesn't close the gap with Barcelona, May 25 against Real Sociedad could be the farewell of Ancelotti and his son, Davide. With Carlo Ancelotti's departure, Real Madrid has already begun to think about the immediate future. According to reports from 'Relevo,' the club would have already spoken with Santiago Solari to take charge of the first team during this competition. Solari, who is currently the Director of Soccer at Real Madrid, already has experience leading the first team. In 2018, when Julen Lopetegui was dismissed, Solari took on the responsibility of leading the team and achieved important victories, including the first major bet on Vinicius Jr. Florentino Pérez sees Solari as the natural option for the Club World Cup, until hiring a long-term coach. This coaching change would be a provisional solution, as the club is searching for a coach for the next season. Xabi Alonso remains the favorite in the betting, although his situation at Bayer Leverkusen could complicate his arrival.</p>

Los Angeles Tourism has scored a double goal, named Official Tourism Board Promoter and Host City Supporter for FIFA World Cup 26 and Super Bowl LXI in 2027, making it the only tourism organisation in the region with official rights to promote both major events.

With LA hosting eight World Cup matches (including the US Men's opening game) and the Super Bowl returning to the Californian city for the ninth time in February 2027, the initiative is set to deliver major tourism impact for the region. 

The LA region will welcome visitors locally and from around the world for these premier global events, tapping into the sports tourism trend and bringing far-reaching economic benefits.

In partnership with the Los Angeles Sports & Entertainment Commission, LA Tourism will lead efforts to spotlight the city as a global sports and entertainment capital, enticing visitors to attend the events and experience everything LA has to offer beyond SoFi Stadium. 

Through this partnership, the teams will develop resources to promote FIFA World Cup 26 to local and international visitors.

This will include destination information, tips and a calendar of events and activities spanning the entire 39-day tournament, including official World Cup matches, Fan Celebrations, watch parties and activities across the LA region.

Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board President & CEO Adam Burke said: “Los Angeles continues to solidify its place as one of the world's premier sports capitals, and we are honoured to be named as Host City Supporter and the Official Tourism Board Promoter for the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host City and Super Bowl LXI Host Committee.”

“Whether you're visiting for the first time or returning to explore more, LA is ready to roll out the red carpet and showcase everything our region has to offer.”

American Airlines was recently named the Official North American Airline Supplier for FIFA World Cup 26.
