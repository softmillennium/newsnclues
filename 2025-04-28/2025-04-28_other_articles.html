                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For fifteen seasons, Supernatural covered the fantastical adventures of Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) as they stepped into the family business of monster hunting. Now, in an Instagram post shared by Collins, the three Supernatural stars were joined by another surprise guest in Dean's trademark black 1967 Chevrolet Impala, nicknamed Baby. This year's convention featured several members of the Supernatural cast beyond the four shown above, including Mark Sheppard (Crowley), Jim Beaver (Bobby Singer), and Alexander Calvert (Jack). Conventions have become a popular place for actors to interact with both their fans and their former co-stars, and in the case of Supernatural, they have helped to keep passion for the series alive even well after the show's completion. Recently, it has been confirmed that Padalecki, Ackles, and Collins will all appear in The Boys season 5, though it isn't yet clear what roles they will all play beyond Ackles, who already has the part of Soldier Boy. While there's been no official announcement about a reboot, creator Eric Kripke and the series' leads have all expressed interest in revisiting the Winchesters' world. It evokes a lot of feelings seeing Sam and Dean sitting in the Impala again with Castiel in the backseat. The "Baby" reunion is very Supernatural-flavored; given Castiel's record of being tempted by demons, women, and such, it's not shocking that he would develop a particular interest in Rowena, who is in charge of Hell by the time of Supernatural's ending. Ackles and Padalecki also reacted to the development similarly to how their characters would've reacted on the show. Created by Eric Kripke, Supernatural is a fantasy/drama series that premiered in 2005. The series follows the adventures of Dean and Sam Winchester - two men wronged by supernatural beings as children who now spend their days investigating and hunting demons, ghosts, and monsters across the United States.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A giant swirl of blue light appeared, leaving many people mystified. SpaceX did confirm that this launch took place on their website, saying: ET, Falcon 9 launched the NROL-69 mission from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This was the second flight for the first stage booster supporting this mission, which previously launched a Starlink mission.” According to a 2024 Reuters interview, SpaceX is working with the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on technology that could be used to help with spy satellites. SpaceX may be sending up large numbers of smaller satellites that are able to coordinate together in a swarm in low-Earth orbit. They can then be used to image the Earth. “We've received many reports of an illuminated swirl in the sky this evening. This is likely to be caused by the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, launched earlier today. Similar patterns have been seen during previous launches, though typically not as bright due to differences in the time and location of the launch. In a statement after a previous launch, geophysicist Don Hampton (Poker Flat Rocket Range chief scientist) explained: “It is likely either exhaust from a rocket burn to bring the second stage down over the Pacific, or perhaps dumping extra rocket fuel after that burn. So, while not as exciting as aliens, the bright light certainly was beautiful and will likely be something that is seen more in the future. If you weren't lucky enough to catch it in person, you can see it in this brief YouTube video: If you thought that was interesting, you might like to read about the mysterious “pyramids” discovered in Antarctica.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Does anyone else think that maybe just maybe all those Drones flying around New Jersey may have had something to do with this big Forest fire going on right now," says one April 23, 2025 post on Facebook. The post -- and other similar messages blaming drones for the historic blazes that ravaged New Jersey in April -- come after reports of unidentified aircraft flying over the northeastern state dominated social media in late 2024 and early 2025, stoking fears among residents. Some posts have claimed these drones ignited the blazes using directed energy weapons, which harness concentrated electromagnetic energy and are being developed in the United States for drone and missile defense. The state was put under drought alert in March (archived here). New Jersey's Commissioner of Environmental Protection, Shawn LaTourette, told AFP in an April 23 email that they "have not received any credible report of mysterious drone activity and we are not aware of any legitimate evidence that suggests such activity, if it exists, is related to the cause of the Jones Road Wildfire." The claims about directed energy weapons ignited the blazes are also baseless -- and echo conspiracy theories previously shared about similar disasters. In an article on the technology, Iain Boyd, director of the University of Colorado's Center for National Security Initiatives explained that "the power level needed to ignite vegetation with a high-energy laser from the sky would require a large power source installed on a large aircraft" (archived here and here). Drones are not allowed to fly during fire emergencies. "Please remember, 'No Drones in Fire Zones - If YOU fly, WE can't!'" Despite assurances from the Biden administration, narratives about foreign attacks and UFOs gained massive traction in late 2024. In December, the Department of Defense said an investigation concluded: "To date, we have no intelligence or observations that would indicate that they were aligned with a foreign actor or that they had malicious intent" (archived here). White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a January 28, 2025 press briefing: "The drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) for research and various other reasons," (archived here). "Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones," she said, adding: "It got worse due to curiosity, this was not the enemy." AFP has previously debunked similar claims about wildfires and directed energy weapons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The universe is filled with countless galaxies, stars and planets. Astronomers may find life one day, but they will need extraordinary proof. Credit: ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay), G. Anselmi But so far, no solid evidence of life has ever been found beyond Earth. A paper published in April 2025 claimed to detect a signature of life in the atmosphere of the planet K2-18b. And while this discovery is intriguing, most astronomers—including the paper's authors—aren't ready to claim that it means extraterrestrial life exists. The astronomer Carl Sagan used the phrase, "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence," in regard to searching for alien life. I'm an astronomer who has written a book about astrobiology. Over my career, I've seen some compelling scientific discoveries. There are three criteria for a scientific result to represent a true discovery and not be subject to uncertainty and doubt. How does the claim of life on K2-18b measure up? First, the experiment needs to measure a meaningful and important quantity. Researchers observed K2-18b's atmosphere with the James Webb Space Telescope and saw a spectral feature that they identified as dimethyl sulfide. However, it can also arise by other means, so this single molecule is not conclusive proof of life. Every detector has some noise from the random motion of electrons. The signal should be strong enough to have a low probability of arising by chance from this noise. There are many molecules that could create a feature in the same spectral range. For example, physicists at CERN gathered data patiently for two years until they had a 5-sigma detection of the Higgs boson particle, leading to a Nobel Prize one year later in 2013. Results are considered reliable when they've been repeated—ideally corroborated by other investigators or confirmed using a different instrument. For K2-18b, this might mean detecting other molecules that indicate biology, such as oxygen in the planet's atmosphere. Without more and better data, most researchers are viewing the claim of life on K2-18b with skepticism. In the past, some scientists have claimed to have found life much closer to home, on the planet Mars. Over a century ago, retired Boston merchant turned astronomer Percival Lowell claimed that linear features he saw on the surface of Mars were canals, constructed by a dying civilization to transport water from the poles to the equator. Artificial waterways on Mars would certainly have been a major discovery, but this example failed the other two criteria: strong evidence and repeatability. In 1996, NASA held a press conference where a team of scientists presented evidence for biology in the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Their evidence included an evocative image that seemed to show microfossils in the meteorite. However, scientists have come up with explanations for the meteorite's unusual features that do not involve biology. Like dimethyl sulfide and oxygen, methane on Earth is made primarily—but not exclusively—by life. Different spacecraft and rovers on the Martian surface have returned conflicting results, where a detection with one spacecraft was not confirmed by another. The low level and variability of methane on Mars is still a mystery. Detecting microbial life on Mars or an exoplanet would be dramatic, but the discovery of extraterrestrial civilizations would be truly spectacular. This signal was so unusual that an astronomer working at the telescope wrote "Wow!" 'Oumuamua's strange shape and trajectory led Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb to argue that it was an alien artifact. And some researchers have gathered evidence suggesting that it's just a comet. While many scientists think we aren't alone, given the enormous amount of habitable real estate beyond Earth, no detection has cleared the threshold enunciated by Carl Sagan. These same criteria apply to research about the entire universe. One particular concern in cosmology is the fact that, unlike the case of planets, there is only one universe to study. In 2014, astronomers claimed to have found evidence for inflation in a subtle signal from microwaves left over after the Big Bang. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that the universe was expanding. Then, in 1998, evidence emerged that this cosmic expansion is accelerating. Two research groups used supernovae to separately trace the expansion. In a friendly rivalry, they used different sets of supernovae but got the same result. Independent corroboration increased their confidence that the universe was accelerating. They called the force behind this accelerating expansion dark energy and received a Nobel Prize in 2011 for its discovery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of astronomers recently made the bold claim that they had found "the strongest evidence yet" that life exists anywhere else besides Earth – setting off a media frenzy. That star-orbiting exoplanet, K2-18b, has long fascinated astronomers who consider it among the best ocean worlds to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. But one independent researcher is already casting doubt on the recent sensational discovery. K2-18b, which orbits a red dwarf star more than 120 light-years from Earth, has for years intrigued astronomers who believe it exists in what they refer to as the "habitable zone" – where conditions could be right for water to pool on the surface. Observations have allowed scientists to conclude that the exoplanet, which is 8.6 times bigger than Earth, could be a Hycean world covered by ocean water underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. That's what led Madhusudhan and his team to detect hints of sulfur-based gases dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the atmosphere – both molecules from the same chemical family. But according to Taylor, those molecules can also be produced naturally including, for instance, by comets. Taylor was also critical in the TikTok video of the researchers' decision to compare the molecules found to nitrogen-rich atmospheres like Earth, as researchers aren't certain how those molecules would behave on a world with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. “The data they use are not appropriate for these type of atmospheres,” Taylor said. In his own study, published to arXiv, Taylor used a common data model for exoplanet studies and found no conclusive traces of either sulfur-based gases. "I conclude no strong statistical evidence for spectral features," Taylor wrote in the study. Taylor and Madhusudhan, however, may agree on one point: Additional analysis is needed of K2-18b to determine if anything does indeed live on the planet. Madhusudhan readily acknowledged that his team's observations could have occurred by chance or could be the result of previously unknown chemical processes at work on K2-18b. “It's important that we're deeply skeptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,” Madhusudhan said in a statement announcing his own findings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our current AI systems may one day evolve into a superintelligent entity, but scientists aren't yet certain what this might look like and what the implications are. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Increasingly, a topic once consigned to science fiction — the notion of a superintelligent AI — is now being considered seriously by scientists and experts alike. The idea that machines might one day match or even surpass human intelligence has a long history. Experts have wildly differing views on how feasible this idea of "artificial super intelligence" (ASI) is and when it might appear, but some suggest that such hyper-capable machines are just around the corner. What's certain is that if, and when, ASI does emerge, it will have enormous implications for humanity's future. "I believe we would enter a new era of automated scientific discoveries, vastly accelerated economic growth, longevity, and novel entertainment experiences," Tim Rocktäschel, professor of AI at University College London and a principal scientist at Google DeepMind told Live Science, providing a personal opinion rather than Google DeepMind's official position. However, he also cautioned: "As with any significant technology in history, there is potential risk." Traditionally, AI research has focused on replicating specific capabilities that intelligent beings exhibit. These include things like the ability to visually analyze a scene, parse language or navigate an environment. This concept has gone by several names over the years, including “strong AI” or “universal AI”, but today it is most commonly called artificial general intelligence (AGI). "However, with the advent of foundation models [another term for LLMs] we now have AI that can pass a broad range of university entrance exams and participate in international math and coding competitions." Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Related: GPT-4.5 is the first AI model to pass an authentic Turing test, scientists say This is leading people to take the possibility of AGI more seriously, said Rocktäschel. And crucially, once we create AI that matches humans on a wide range of tasks, it may not be long before it achieves superhuman capabilities across the board. Once that milestone has been reached, we could see what British mathematician Irving John Good dubbed an "intelligence explosion" in 1965. He argued that once machines become smart enough to improve themselves, they would rapidly achieve levels of intelligence far beyond any human. Other AI experts offer wildly varying predictions — from within this decade to never. A broader analysis concurred that most scientists agree AGI might arrive by 2040. The implications of a technology like ASI would be enormous, prompting scientists and philosophers to dedicate considerable time to mapping out the promise and potential pitfalls for humanity. The hope is that this would free people from having to work to survive and could instead spend time doing things they're passionate about, Hulme explained. This also assumes we could control and direct an entity much more intelligent than us — something many experts have suggested is unlikely. "I don't really subscribe to this idea that it will be watching over us and caring for us and making sure that we're happy," said Hulme. The possibility of a superintelligence we have no control over has prompted fears that AI could present an existential risk to our species. This has become a popular trope in science fiction, with movies like "Terminator" or "The Matrix" portraying malevolent machines hell-bent on humanity's destruction. In a 2012 paper, he suggested that the intelligence of an entity is independent of its goals, so an ASI could have motivations that are completely alien to us and not aligned with human well-being. Bostrom fleshed out this idea with a thought experiment in which a super-capable AI is set the seemingly innocuous task of producing as many paper-clips as possible. "We build current AI systems to be helpful, but also harmless and honest assistants by design," he said. While Rocktäschel admitted these safeguards can be circumvented, he's confident we will develop better approaches in the future. Typically, they either provide rules for how the model should behave or train it on examples of human behavior. Instead, Hulme thinks we must build AI with a "moral instinct." His company Conscium is attempting to do that by evolving AI in virtual environments that have been engineered to reward behaviors like cooperation and altruism. Currently, they are working with very simple, "insect-level" AI, but if the approach can be scaled up, it could make alignment more robust. "Embedding morals in the instinct of an AI puts us in a much safer position than just having these sort of Whack-a-Mole guard rails," said Hulme. Not everyone is convinced we need to start worrying quite yet, though. Another objection is that the sheer computational resources required to achieve ASI may be prohibitive. —'Their capacity to emulate human language and thought is immensely powerful': Far from ending the world, AI systems might actually save it —AI can now replicate itself — a milestone that has experts terrified More practically, how we measure progress in AI may be misleading us about how close we are to superintelligence, said Alexander Ilic, head of the ETH AI Center at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Most of the impressive results in AI in recent years have come from testing systems on several highly contrived tests of individual skills such as coding, reasoning or language comprehension, which the systems are explicitly trained to pass, said Ilic. But he believes today's dominant approach will not lead to models that can carry out useful tasks in the physical world or collaborate effectively with humans, which will be crucial for them to have a broad impact in the real world. AI can handle tasks twice as complex every few months. What does this exponential growth mean for how we use it?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have discovered "smoking gun" evidence of a hidden feeding supermassive black hole in a distant spiral galaxy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Scientists have long believed that monster-sized supermassive black holes lurk at the heart of all large galaxies. Now, using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), astronomers may have cracked this puzzle, finding the first evidence of a supermassive black hole at the heart of M83, also known as NGC 5236, a spiral galaxy located around 15 million light-years away. Now, we finally have a compelling clue that suggests one may be present." Related: Did the James Webb telescope really find evidence of alien life? Situated at the hearts of distant galaxies, these black holes are pretty conspicuous when they are actively feeding and surrounded by gas and dust that they heat, causing them to glow brightly. These regions, known as "active galactic nuclei" or "AGNs," can often be seen even in galaxies that are otherwise too distant and too faint to be detected. This has led scientists to speculate that either the supermassive black hole at the heart of M83 is dormant (not actively feeding on matter), or that the AGN it powers is hidden by a thick shroud of dust. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. That second explanation is favored by new data from the JWST which takes full advantage of the $10 billion space telescope's unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution. "Our discovery of highly ionized neon emission in the nucleus of M83 was unexpected," team leader Svea Hernandez, a European Space Agency (ESA) scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute, said. "These signatures require large amounts of energy to be produced, more than what normal stars can generate. "This strongly suggests the presence of an AGN that has been elusive until now." —James Webb telescope reveals truth about 'impossible' black hole thought to be feeding at 40 times the theoretical limit —Newly 'awakened' black hole is releasing 100 times more energy than scientists have ever seen before "This discovery showcases how the JWST is making unexpected breakthroughs," Smith concluded, "Astronomers thought they had ruled out an AGN in M83, but now we have fresh evidence that challenges past assumptions and opens new avenues for exploration."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From its cavernous domed bazaar to its ravishingly muscular museum, the Uzbek capital has one of the world's wildest collections of modernist gems. One gleams with ceramic tiles, glazed in traditional Uzbek patterns. But here, they cover structures of a very different kind. Built in 1976, it's big enough to hold an audience of 3,000. “People tend to think of Uzbek heritage as our ancient Islamic monuments,” says Gayane Umerova, chair of the country's Art and Culture Development Foundation (ACDF). “But we need to realise that we are in danger of losing the more recent layers of history, due to urban development. This push was triggered in 2018, following a public outcry over the demolition of a beloved cylindrical concrete movie theatre, the House of Cinema, built in 1982. It was hastily bulldozed to make way for a $1.3bn commercial development, a bloated cluster of generic glass towers known as Tashkent City. “It was a big loss for our society,” says Umerova. “It wasn't just about the building –people had grown up with the cinema as a place to go on dates, see friends, hang out. Its sudden loss made us look at what else might be in danger.” About 2,000 miles from Moscow, Tashkent occupies a fascinating position in the history of the Soviet Union as a showcase city, bridging east and west. Its image of prosperity, abundance, leisure and progress would show how communism could be adapted to the diverse, far-flung populations of Central Asia – and therefore to the rest of the world. An earthquake in 1966 provided a convenient excuse to raze much of the historic city and impose a masterplan of wide avenues dotted with grand, orientalist structures that would speak of Tashkent's new role as the modern gateway to Asia. That became adopted as the official national style, and remains so to this day, despite it being of little historic relevance to Tashkent. “Interestingly, the buildings designed for Tashkent in Moscow were much more decorative and ‘orientalist' than those designed locally,” says Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Russian architect whose Milan-based practice Grace has been leading the preservation strategy. Despite the bold modernist form, its design consciously draws on tradition, with the geometric screens referencing vernacular Uzbek panjara, or latticework grilles that provide shading and ventilation, as well as Islamic patterns (a fact not mentioned at the time). “The design was criticised locally for being superficial,” says Golovatyuk. Gradually, this would become the language of modernist Tashkent.” The domed circus is a striking example of how these aesthetic attitudes evolved. It was first drawn up in the early 1960s, by architects Genrikh Aleksandrovich and Gennady Masyagin, as a brutalist flying saucer, studded with porthole windows. Construction began in 1965, but was halted by the earthquake. As time went on, the space-age design became historicised, clothed in traditional fancy dress. The inspiration was no longer a UFO, but an Uzbek piala, or teacup. Decorative concrete sunshades were added, in a form that echoed ancient Kufic script. The interior is a surreal mashup, where concentric cosmic rays radiating from the doorways became encrusted with traditional ornamentation, like a spaceship decked out in chintzy wallpaper. Built in 1985, the 16-storey tower features a pair of communal courtyards every three storeys, providing space for children to play, while elderly residents sit out playing chess and drinking tea. Front doors are reached via outdoor galleries that look down into these back yards in the sky. “I love its uniqueness,” says Dilara, who has lived here for decades. “We've used the courtyards for weddings, barbecues and drinking beer together. It is surrounded by mushroom-shaped sunshades that double as ventilation for all the kitchens down below. “It was the first building in Uzbekistan to use sliding concrete formwork,” says Golovatyuk, referring to a system where the moulds are moved up while concrete is poured continuously. They've even curated a little exhibition about its female architect, Ophelia Aydinova, in the lobby. Cost may have deterred any repeat, but money was no object when it came to symbols of national pride. As Golovatyuk puts it: “When a regime isn't doing so well, the need for representation gets even bigger.” She is standing outside a prime example, the gargantuan Palace of People's Friendship. Designed by the team behind the Lenin Museum, led by Yevgeny Rozanov and Elena Sukhanova, it is a tour de force of Uzbek modernism. Raised on a plinth, the museum is wrapped in a muscular facade of panjara-inspired grille-work, crowned with a colossal frieze of abstract muqarnas, the sculptural stalactite motifs found inside the domes and niches of Islamic architecture. Inside, the ceiling of its triple-height atrium groans with pearly chandeliers, evoking dangling branches of cotton bolls, while the walls are lined with fluted blue tiles and expressionistic ceramic sculptures by Alexander Kedrin. It has the look of an immense marble Transformer, seemingly about to unfold into a great robotic creature and march towards the circus. There are more wonders dotted throughout the city, beautifully photographed by Karel Balas for a Rizzoli coffee-table book, and meticulously examined in a 900-page tome for Lars Müller, with pictures by Armin Linke. The metro system is a particular treat, especially Kosmonavtlar (or Cosmonauts) station, built in 1984 as a cosmic fantasy of blue tiled walls, green glass columns and celestial light fittings, evoking the wonders of space exploration. Completed in 1987, it was designed to test the resistance of materials to nuclear explosion and develop heatproof ceramics for the Soviet military. Although it was a classified project, off-limits to most, it was intended as a showcase of applied arts, featuring sculptural ceramic screens and dazzling planetary chandeliers by artist Irena Lipene.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charisma has been linked to electoral victory (just ask Bob Hawke), but defining it can be difficult For all the gen Z slang that has been thrown around by politicians in recent months, one term has been largely absent from the election campaign: “rizz”. Oxford University Press's 2023 word of the year is defined as “style, charm or attractiveness”; in gen Z parlance it refers specifically to romantic appeal. Bob Hawke, Australia's longest-serving Labor prime minister, had it in spades. As does – depending on who you ask – Barack Obama, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. The German sociologist Max Weber is credited for the term charisma in its modern usage, which he defined as an individual “treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers. In the past, Weber's definition has been taken to mean that leaders intrinsically possess a preternatural je ne sais quoi – an interpretation that Alex Haslam, a professor of social and organisational psychology at the University of Queensland, takes issue with. We treat charisma as if it's a property or a thing that they possess, but it's clearly based on our relationship with them,” he says. Michael Platow, a professor of psychology at the Australian National University, agrees. “It's not something that you are born with,” he says. In Haslam and Platow's book, The New Psychology of Leadership, co-authored with Prof Stephen Reicher, they characterise charismatic leaders as those who are most successful in creating a sense of shared social identity – a sense of “us-ness”. Leaders must articulate not only their policies to voters, Platow says, but also “a vision of us collectively. Politicians try to place themselves at the centre of that ‘us'.” One way researchers measure charisma is simply to ask people what they think of someone. Ample evidence supports the idea that charisma is not a fixed, innate trait. Research has found that for a given description, a business executive is perceived as more charismatic if people are told the performance of their company improved. A linked phenomenon in politics is the incumbency effect: “If the economy is doing well or if other macroeconomic factors are good, then people like who is currently in office, because they basically attribute the success to that person,” says Lisa Lu, a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales, whose dissertation focuses on leadership and charisma. Success is only one ingredient in the secret sauce, however. One analysis of five Australian prime ministers from Gough Whitlam to John Howard, based on monthly public opinion polling, found that “Bob Hawke was the only one of the five to exhibit significant charisma; his approval rating was over 10 percentage points higher during his period of office than would otherwise have been expected by his economic or political performance.” Keating, it found, “was the least charismatic, by about the same margin”. Central to Hawke's public image was that of a quintessentially Australian beer-skolling, sports-loving larrikin. It is unsurprising, then, that a 2020 survey of political scientists and historians ranked Hawke first among Australian prime ministers for “communication effectiveness”, as well as his “relationship with the electorate”. “As we move into the election, watch how each candidate defines ‘us', how they position themselves as being the ‘prototypical' Australian,” Platow says. Perceptions of charisma are also bound up in factors an individual cannot change. How tall one is, for example: height is associated with greater charisma in male leaders, and US presidents have been much taller than the average American man. Some studies have found that followers attribute greater charisma to women than men, but Assoc Prof Jessica Flanigan has pointed out that these tracked perceived emotional intelligence rather than overall likability. “When I was growing up, you were presented with almost no plausible female candidates that we were encouraged to perceive as charismatic … I think that's different now.” Given charisma isn't innate, what should a leader desperate to increase their appeal do? Research co-authored by Haslam studied 48 heads of state who died in office between 2000 and 2013. “You can think of all the things they did for us,” he says. In life, charisma can be taught, other research suggests. The more charismatic candidate, as defined by their model, won 23 out of 24 US presidential elections they studied. Even a cursory survey of history's autocrats – Hitler and Mussolini among them – and cult leaders like Jim Jones reveals the dark side of charisma. As Lu says, charisma is “a tool that can be used for good or for bad … even if you can develop it in people, that doesn't necessarily mean everybody should.”</p>
