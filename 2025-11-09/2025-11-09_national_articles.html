                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Thanksgiving travel in question: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday as airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights. The procedural vote would move to break a Democratic filibuster of a House-passed bill that would have funded the government through November 21. It's not clear whether this new ​measure will garner enough Democratic support. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said the working plan would only guarantee a future Senate vote on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, not an extension of the credits that some Democrats have made a key demand in exchange for their votes. At least 5,731 flights have been delayed, according to flight tracking site, FlightAware. More cancellations and delays are expected as airlines will be required to gradually increase their schedule reductions over the next week, unless Congress can come up with a funding compromise to reopen the government. The US Department of Agriculture on Saturday ordered states to cease issuing full food stamp benefits. For weeks, the 42 million Americans who rely on food stamp benefits have gotten inconsistent cues as lawsuits over distributing the aid have worked their way through federal courts. October 10: The Department of Agriculture indicates it will not tap into contingency funds to supply the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which nearly 42 million Americans rely on, and tells states to not issue benefits for November. October 16: Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins tells reporters that the program will run out of money in two weeks. October 28: A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states sue the Trump administration to keep SNAP benefit funds flowing. November 1: SNAP benefits were scheduled to begin distribution, but still face delays for the Department of Agriculture and states to get money flowing again. November 4: After a threat from Trump to withhold assistance, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tells reporters that she spoke with the president and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some benefits flowing. November 5: The USDA issues revised guidance to states that will result in food stamp enrollees receiving somewhat larger partial benefits. November 6: A federal judge in Rhode Island says the Trump administration must fully cover food stamp benefits. November 7: Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover full food stamp benefits. Jackson's “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case. CNN's Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, Marshall Cohen, Sarah Ferris, John Fritze and Adam Cancryn contributed reporting. United Airlines said Sunday it has finalized more than 600 flight cancellations through Tuesday, November 11, to comply with Federal Aviation Administration-mandated airline schedule reductions due to the US government shutdown. CNN has reached out to other major airlines for lists of planned FAA-mandated cancellations. Additional cancellations and delays may occur due to ongoing air traffic control staffing issues. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that cargo is being slowed and warned that “we could end up with shortages, whether it's in our supply chain, whether it's for the holidays” because of the ongoing government shutdown. The economy has been in focus amid the shutdown, as inflation has climbed and with the Supreme Court hearing arguments last week about President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs, which include duties as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil. Earlier today, Trump defended his tariff policy on Truth Social. That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind!” In a separate post, Trump said those who are against tariffs “are FOOLS!” the president posted. “I think this madness ends today,” Graham said on “Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” explaining that federal workers missing paychecks, Americans losing food stamp benefits and flight cancellations across the country shows the Democrats' “political terrorism” is “backfiring.” We're not going to talk about health care until it does,” he said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune threw cold water this weekend on a proposal by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would offer enough Democratic votes to end the shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of enhanced ACA Thune told reporters on Saturday that they were “getting close” to having legislation drafted, though it is not yet clear how a top sticking point for Democrats will be resolved. GOP leaders rejected a proposal earlier this weekend by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to vote on a one-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of a plan to reopen the government. President Donald Trump further muddied the waters with a Truth Social post yesterday suggesting that the billions of dollars used to offset ACA premium costs instead get sent directly to Americans to spend on purchasing their own health insurance, a proposal that Democrats have expressed no interest in pursuing. The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to cease issuing full food stamp benefits and to “immediately undo” steps taken to issue full benefits for the month of November, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay 42 million Americans their full allotments. In the Saturday directive, obtained by CNN, the USDA warned states who failed to comply that they could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as holding states financially responsible for over issuances of benefits. The directive follows  a memorandum from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and the process should be completed later Friday. We're hearing from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who said today that he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, which is less than three weeks away. As for today, more than 1,000 flights so far have been canceled, according to FlightAware. More cancellations are expected as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight. If you're just joining us, here's more on what we know about flight cancellations and delays: • Today's delays: Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed an average of more than two hours — and up to four and a half hours — Sunday morning due to staffing issues, according to information from the Federal Aviation Administration. • Today's staffing shortages: Air traffic control for some of the country's busiest airports was understaffed today or expected to be, according to an FAA advisory, potentially causing widespread delays. Meanwhile, federal employees picketed outside Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport after more than a month of working without pay under the government shutdown. • More reductions to come: Airlines have started implementing a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest US airports, following an order from the FAA. CNN”s Samantha Waldenberg, Lauren Mascarenhas, Chris Boyette and Adrienne Vogt EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said today his agency will see a new round of furloughs that will impact “environmental protection across the board” on November 21 if the government shutdown continues. “This is the last pay period before a far more severe, drastic furlough is going to kick in at the EPA, we're going to see impacts for environmental protection across the board,” Zeldin said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.” CNN has previously reported that employees at the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management received intent to RIF notices last month. The division focuses on hazardous waste cleanup and responding to hazardous waste sites, including overseeing the Brownfields program that helps states clean up and reuse previously contaminated sites. Air traffic control for some of the country's busiest airports was understaffed Sunday or expected to be, according to an FAA advisory, potentially causing widespread delays. As Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warns air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of Thanksgiving, let's take a look at the extent of ongoing disruption to flights across the country. Our chart below breaks down the number of cancellations by airline. Let us know here and you could be a part of our coverage. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said today he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. We have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays, they want to see their family, they want to celebrate this great American holiday,” Duffy told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.” “Listen, many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if (the government) doesn't open back up.” Airlines have started implementing a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest US airports, following an order from the Federal Aviation Administration. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's proposal to vote on a one-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in order to reopen the government while casting distrust on Republicans intentions to negotiate on healthcare, highlighting the tenuous state of talks on Capitol Hill to end the record-breaking shutdown. Jeffries told NBC's “Meet the Press” he had previously rejected the idea of a one-year extension discussed by rank-and-file House Republicans because, he warned, House GOP leadership has “no interest in driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans.” The Schumer proposal, which has already been shut down by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, was offered “in good faith,” Jeffries argued, adding that it “also provides a path toward bipartisan negotiations for a multi-year extension, which would provide the type of certainty that the American people need.” He is expected to depart Palm Beach at around 2.45 p.m. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump defended his trade agenda in a Truth Social post this morning, calling opponents of his tariffs “fools” and promising rebate checks for Americans. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Trump has previously weighed the idea of $2,000 rebates through revenue generated from tariffs. In an interview with OAN on October 1, Trump said. For context: Layering rebate checks on top of tariffs “is a very serious risk,” which can cause a more widespread and lasting inflation increase, David Kotok, co-founder of Cumberland Advisors, told CNN in August. “If you do it as the workforce is shrinking, which is what we have now, then you risk triggering a wage-price spiral,” Kotok said. Remember: Trump's comments come after the Supreme Court heard arguments last week over Trump's authority to impose tariffs through a series of executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. It's shaping up to be another messy travel day of flight cancellations and delays to continue as the government shutdown drags on. Are you flying out of a chaotic airport today? Let us know about your experience by using the form below: Federal employees picketed outside Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport after more than a month of working without pay under the government shutdown. The Federal Aviation Administration employees, including inspectors, technicians, and other specialists, gathered to raise awareness about how working without compensation has impacted their lives, CNN affiliate KNXV reported. “At some point, people are going to stop showing up for work… Equipment will fail eventually if people don't come into work,” FAA technician and union representative Ashley Cioffi told KNXV. We all have somewhere to be,” Holguin told the Associated Press. “I'm hoping that the government can take care of this.” Many travelers struggled to navigate a system already stretched thin. Diana Alvear, who had planned a family trip to California, canceled her flight due to concerns over the shortage of air traffic controllers. “It's really weighing on our hearts that we had to do this,” Alvear told the AP. Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed an average of more than two hours — and up to four and a half hours — Sunday morning due to staffing issues, according to information from the Federal Aviation Administration. At least 871 flights within, into, or out of the United States were delayed Sunday, according to FlightAware. Not every staffing shortage results in a delay, as controllers can sometimes reroute flights. However, in some cases, planes must be slowed to maintain safety.</p>

Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explains how the Trump administration's agreements with third-party countries for deportations play a "vital" role in U.S. national security. President Donald Trump's administration called on a federal judge to approve the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia on Friday, arguing all legal hurdles had been cleared. The Friday filing is the latest in the administration's efforts to deport Abrego Garcia a second time following his return from El Salvador earlier this year. The Justice Department called on U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis to clear the deportation, saying Abrego Garcia had failed to establish that he would face persecution in Liberia. "Petitioner's claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event," the DOJ argued. "This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia." Attorneys for the U.S. also said Liberia has made "sufficient and credible" arguments that Abrego Garcia will not face harm. Kilmar Abrego Garcia is facing deportation to Liberia. Nevertheless, lawyers for Abrego Garcia argue that he has not received sufficient due process to justify his deportation. It does not," his attorneys wrote in their own Friday filing. His attorneys further argue that Abrego Garcia is the victim of retaliatory prosecution, noting that Costa Rica has already offered to accept his deportation flight on a refugee status. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia argue he is facing retaliation from the U.S. government. "The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation," the attorneys argued. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blamed "activist" judges for the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia earlier this year. Earlier in the case, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would persecute or torture him if he were removed there.

(AP Photo/Robert Simmons) Get the AP Top 25 college football poll delivered straight to your inbox every week with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts. The biggest winner in Week 11 of college football didn't touch the field this week. Despite being idle, Georgia Tech is set to reclaim the Atlantic Coast Conference lead after losses by No. 9 Texas Tech squared off in a showdown between the conference's top two contenders. Texas Tech came out on top and is set to leapfrog the Cougars in the rankings, taking sole possession of the conference. 2 Indiana narrowly avoided its first loss of the season and a potentially significant drop in the rankings in a last-minute thriller against Penn State. Fernando Mendoza found Omar Cooper Jr. in the end zone with 36 seconds remaining, carrying Indiana to the 27-24 win. 6 Oregon tough, but the Hawkeyes fell just short in the final moments as the Ducks kicked a game-winning field goal. The 18-16 loss marks Iowa's third of the season and jeopardizes its playoff path. – Texas Tech handed BYU its first loss of the season on Saturday, defeating the Cougars with a convincing 29-7 win. The Red Raiders rank directly below BYU in the AP Top 25 and College Football Playoff rankings and are poised to move up. Texas Tech running back Cameron Dickey (8) runs for a touchdown during the second half of an NCAA college football game against BYU, Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. — The rankings could shift in No. 18 Miami's favor after the Hurricanes' 38-10 rout of Syracuse on Saturday. 16 Georgia Tech could capitalize on the losses by Virginia and Louisville to return to the highest ranking in the ACC. – BYU will drop after a loss in what was the first top-10 matchup for a Big 12 conference game since 2021. The Tigers trailed in all four quarters and were outplayed on both sides of the ball in their first outing after quarterback Beau Pribula's season-ending injury. It marks Missouri's third loss this season. 22 Memphis lost 38-32 to unranked Tulane on Friday night. The Tigers scored 15 straight points in the fourth quarter, but Tulane held them off for the win. 14 Louisville lost in a 29-26 overtime thriller to California. The Cardinals tied it in the fourth quarter, but settling for a field goal in overtime wasn't enough as California answered back with a touchdown to win it. 24 Washington's stint in the AP Top 25 will be short-lived after a 13-10 loss to Wisconsin. The Huskies cracked the rankings last week despite being idle. 12 Virginia failed to find the end zone in a 16-9 loss to Wake Forest. The Cavaliers lost quarterback Chandler Morris early in the game to an injury from a hard hit and couldn't get momentum rolling offensively under quarterback Daniel Kaelin. — James Madison is two spots out of the AP Top 25, and a 35-23 win against Marshall, paired with a Memphis loss to Tulane, could be enough to crack the rankings. It was a solid performance for a Dukes' team that believes it's worthy of consideration for the CFP's Group of Five spot. — Iowa nearly pulled off the upset against No. Oregon answered with a game-winning field goal with three seconds on the clock, solidifying the 18-16 victory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) foreshadowed bleak midterm elections for the Republican Party unless its members can address those struggling with healthcare. Van Drew expressed his desire to draft a “solid, thorough replacement for what is terrible Obamacare” on Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street on Saturday. “In the short term, people are getting the renewal notices, their premiums are doubling, so I'm saying we need to deal with that now because otherwise, No. 1, it is the right thing to do just morally, No. If people are just struggling with their healthcare, it's not going to help us,” Van Drew added. But we gotta put our thinking caps on. We have to be smarter; that's the bottom line.” In Van Drew's state of New Jersey, voters elected Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) over the Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. The Democratic Party also maintained control of the state General Assembly, with 49 seats called for Democrats and 19 seats for Republicans. However, if they permanently expire, the number of people without health insurance would rise by an average of 3.8 million annually by 2034. As of Saturday, the government has been shut down for 40 days.</p>

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt says fake threat calls to college campuses are costing universities millions of dollars on ‘The Will Cain Show.' On Oct. 24, as Howard University was hosting its annual homecoming event, one woman, three men and a teenage boy were shot just steps from the campus in Washington, D.C. Although none of the victims were students, one individual was reportedly enrolled at Maryland's Morgan State. Police arrested two 19-year-old suspects and recovered three guns in connection with the shooting, according to FOX 5. Five people were reportedly injured in a shooting near Howard University's homecoming event in Washington, D.C., last month. Over the same weekend, one person was killed and six were injured by gunfire at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, according to authorities. One suspect was subsequently taken into custody in connection with the shooting. "The sad commentary is, in these communities, you're finding that there are individuals who are armed and also enjoy athletic events," criminal and civil trial attorney Ted Williams, a former police officer in the capital, told Fox News Digital. "They are armed with guns and decide to attend these athletic events, and they also bring their guns with them." Additionally, a shooting at South Carolina State University's homecoming killed a 19-year-old visitor and injured another attendee, according to Inside Higher Ed. A shooting occurred at Hugine Suites, a student residency hall on South Carolina State University's campus in Orangeburg, South Carolina, on Oct. 4, 2025. Another incident involving three individuals being arrested at Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana's homecoming after they were allegedly caught carrying guns on campus, the outlet reported. "These are individuals who are outside of the college community itself, [and] are creating problems and havoc for individuals who just want to go to one of these athletic events that are occurring on a HBCU campus without being shot," Williams said. Two additional HBCUs – Jackson State University and Alcorn State University – also reportedly saw shootings break out at their homecoming events, with one person fatally shot at Alcorn State. A juvenile was shot at Jackson State University on Oct. 11, 2025. "No one should have to live this way, but we do have thugs out here who attend these HBCU events and they're hell-bent on creating havoc," Williams said. Swatting is the act of falsely reporting an emergency – such as a bomb threat or school shooting – in an attempt to prompt a large law enforcement response. According to a UNCF study, HBCUs disproportionately receive more threats than other institutions throughout the country. In light of the uptick in threats and seemingly random acts of violence on HBCU campuses, many schools have opted to increase security in an effort to keep students safe. Since 2022, numerous campuses have added new safety features – such as installing more cameras on campus and hiring additional police officers – while also working to strengthen their relationships with federal and local law enforcement, according to Inside Higher Ed. The moves can help officials keep track of who is coming on and off campus as the vast majority of instances involve perpetrators who are unaffiliated with the school. Williams pointed to schools potentially using magnetometers at events, while employing additional law enforcement to patrol the perimeter of large gatherings. However, the threat to personal safety while attending college can linger in the back of a student's mind, potentially stoking fear among those who are just trying to earn their education. "The fact that HBCU college students cannot attend an event without fear is harming their educational experience," Williams said. "I think that it is devastating to a young college student, or their parents and relatives and friends who want to be able to go to these HBCU events and not be killed, shot, maimed or injured – and that is not happening right now."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against arguments that his sweeping global tariffs lacked a constitutional legal basis. In April, Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact “Liberation Day” tariffs against a host of countries. The move was swiftly challenged in court, with the Supreme Court now considering whether Trump must have congressional signoff for such tariffs, or if the president was within his lane when he unilaterally invoked IEPPA to trigger the tariffs. Trump issued a fiery Truth Social post over the weekend, slamming critics for questioning his power, arguing “that was not what the founders had in mind.” “That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? The justices appeared skeptical of Solicitor General D. John Sauer's arguments that the president's tariffs under IEEPA are lawful. IEEPA is a 1977 law that grants the president authority to regulate certain economic activity during a “national emergency.” On April 2, Trump declared a national emergency due to concerns that there were gaping trade imbalances between the United States and other countries. He then invoked IEEPA to address the national emergency by placing tariffs on those countries to correct trade deficits. Besides concerns that the president lacked a proper legal basis to carry out his tariff agenda, critics have argued that Trump's sweeping protectionist policies could raise prices for consumers by undermining the principles of free and competitive trade they believe have led to the high standard of living enjoyed by U.S. citizens. However, in another post on Sunday, Trump called those who are against tariffs “fools.” “We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. will be paid to everyone,” he wrote, alleging in a follow-up message that without tariffs, “we have none” of those benefits.</p>

Criminal justice expert Michael Rushford breaks down how a felon's recent gun-related arrest is intensifying questions about leniency and public safety. A Nebraska felon whose prison sentence was reduced under a Biden administration clemency initiative is accused of possessing a gun linked to multiple crimes, intensifying scrutiny over whether reform efforts have come at the expense of public safety. Federal prosecutors say 31-year-old Khyre Holbert, who had served roughly seven years of a 20-year federal sentence for gun and narcotics offenses, was arrested after an Oct. 4 shooting in Omaha's Old Market district. Holbert's sentence had been commuted in January 2025 despite objections from the U.S. Attorney's Office, which warned of his gang ties, long criminal record and prior weapons convictions. Months later, he's accused of reoffending and his case has thrust former President Joe Biden's clemency program back into the national spotlight. Officials say Khyre Holbert, who was charged in a shooting in Omaha's Old Market earlier this month, now faces a federal firearms charge. For Michael Rushford, founder and president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, Holbert's arrest is more than a tragedy. "I don't think you can delegate clemency," Rushford told Fox News Digital. I think what we saw were clemencies being granted without the president's direct knowledge. Why would he sign off on 31 drug dealers? Why would you sign off on a murderer?" Rushford said cases like Holbert's reflect a failure in judgment and vetting during Biden's final year in office. "With drug traffickers, especially those already convicted, this isn't their first party. It's hard to get into federal prison," he said. "When you let one go, you have to realize he's going to go out and commit more crimes. He questioned whether Biden's Justice Department properly reviewed who was being released. "You have to look and see if there was a real injustice in the case," Rushford said. "With the Biden administration, I'm not sure that was done. The Justice Department under him was not really interested in fighting crime." In March 2025, authorities in Alabama arrested Willie Frank Peterson, another Biden clemency recipient, on new drug- and gun-related charges, just months after his release. His sentence was also commuted in Biden's Jan. 17, 2025 clemency wave, which freed 2,490 inmates, mostly for drug and gun offenses, according to the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney. Rushford said that by the time offenders reach federal prison, most have already exhausted their "second chances." "It's hard to get into federal prison," he explained. "You don't just commit one crime and go, unless it's murder. He said clemency should be narrowly used to correct genuine injustices and not as a political gesture. "It's got to be a very specific process evaluating who's in there," Rushford said. But it shouldn't be for political allies or people who gave you money. And I think that was happening under Biden." "I don't see the kind of straight criminals being let loose like Biden had done," he said. "I hope the Trump Justice Department raises the integrity level and makes sure we're not letting out hardened criminals and drug traffickers." "The president we have now knows what's going on," Rushford added. "He has a Justice Department that's very engaged in fighting crime and reducing drug trafficking. Beyond clemency, Rushford blames a broader political climate that he says favors offenders over victims. "The defund-the-police movement was an admission that they didn't want to protect the public – that their sympathies were with criminals," he said. "There's a large segment of the political environment that doesn't agree criminals belong in prison." Rushford added that some major cities still have mayors and governors that think counselors will solve the problem. Michael Rushford criticized the defund-the-police movement and a broader political climate that he said favors offenders over victims. "We still have mayors and governors in big cities that think we should send counselors to talk to criminals who are beating their wives with a broom handle — and that's ridiculous," he said. Rushford said that attitude, combined with policies allowing repeat offenders back onto the streets, has eroded public trust and endangered communities. Rushford believes real reform only comes after tragedy. "When they found the repeat offender who kidnapped and killed her, everybody said, ‘We've got to stop this.' I hate to say this, but I think it's going to be one of those horrible cases before the country wakes up." A California judge rejected convicted killer Richard Allen Davis' request for a resentencing hearing for his death-penalty sentence after murdering Polly Klaas in 1993. The 1993 murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, kidnapped from a sleepover in Petaluma, California, by a repeat offender, led to California's "three-strikes" law and remains one of the state's most infamous cases. Shawn Laval Smith, 34, was convicted for the 2022 killing of Brianna Kupfer, 24, who was stabbed multiple times while working alone in a Los Angeles furniture shop. Rushford said these cases show "what happens when repeat offenders keep getting another chance." He believes the tide is turning but says it won't happen fast. "People who are victimized by these repeat offenders, they're not going to be comforted by the fact that in 20 years, we're going to get this straightened out." With two clemency recipients, in Nebraska and Alabama, now back in custody, Rushford said the question isn't whether mercy has a place in justice, but whether the system can survive when mercy replaces accountability. You don't just get them because a politician wants to look compassionate."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The biggest message New York City voters sent on election night was not their choice of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who got a little more than 50% of the vote. City voters gave larger margins of approval to a trio of housing-related initiatives meant to set off a building boom to generate more affordable housing and leave a mark that should last much longer than Mamdani's four-year term. Taking cues from Austin, Texas, residents voted to sidestep their own city council and zoning boards to fast-track the construction of affordable housing, simplify zoning review and create an appeals board to give rejected building projects a second chance. New York's housing crisis is extreme and unique, but it is also part of a broader problem across the country. Many voters of all stripes do not feel they can afford to live. Supporters hope the new system will help nonprofit developers get past red tape and set off a building boom that still respects the character of neighborhoods. Finding that balance is going to be a massive challenge. I spoke by phone with Amit Singh Bagga, who is principal of Public Progress Solutions, a campaign strategy and public affairs firm, and who was campaign director for the “Yes on Affordable Housing” campaign to learn more about New York's housing crisis and how the passage of these three amendments should be viewed by the rest of the country. Here are some excerpts of that longer conversation. BAGGA: New York City has been experiencing a very acute housing crisis for several years now, which is primarily the result of our inability to build sufficient housing generally, as well as sufficient affordable housing. Just to understand the scope and scale of the crisis: Only one out of every 100 apartments in New York is currently available for rent. Fifty percent of renters and homeowners are cost-burdened, which means they're spending more than 30% of their gross monthly income on rent. We now shamefully have 154,000 public school kids in our system that are considered homeless. WOLF: Why was passing these three initiatives such a big deal? BAGGA: New York City has just become the very first city in the nation to pass this type of overhaul to our local land-use and zoning regulations. The bill SB 79, which has gotten enormous amount of coverage in California, is a state bill to override a lot of local zoning regulations that had to be introduced in Sacramento and was bitterly fought over in the California State Legislature. So it is, I think, really notable that New York City voters took matters into our own hands. BAGGA: The proposals essentially make it faster, less expensive and more affordable to build housing in all parts of the city. Currently, we have 12, what are called community districts — groupings of, let's call it two to four neighborhoods — that have built as much housing in New York City as the other 47 community districts combined in the last 10 years. That tells you that we are not producing nearly enough housing in New York City to meet our current demand. We're producing about 15,000 to 20,000 units a year in the last several years. But the current system can be far too easily weaponized by small groups of individuals to force local council members, who have had an outsized amount of power when it comes to land use and housing, into very difficult positions and impossible choices. The choice being: Block affordable housing or lose your seat. We've seen this play out in the New York City Council several times, including just a couple of years ago, where, in the East Bronx, which is a relatively low-density area, the Democratic city council member who supported a rezoning that increased some density and added some affordable housing ended up losing her seat to a Republican, which was the first time in 40 years that that district had been represented by a Republican. WOLF: Zoning boards were developed for a reason. Why do you think that system has failed? BAGGA: The system has failed because it places an enormous amount of power in the hands of individual local council members. We have 51 council members who represent New York City, collectively. And essentially, the local council member is the individual that has the power to say thumbs up or thumbs down on anything from even just maybe one building or two buildings in their neighborhood, all the way up to a much larger project or a larger neighborhood rezoning. The logic behind this is that every individual council member, in theory, knows what's best for their neighborhood and is also navigating their own local politics in a very particular way, and they don't want other council members to have a say over what goes on in their backyard. One could argue there's a little bit of an inherent logic to this, and it is really designed to insulate local council members from interference from their own colleagues when it comes to local political decisions. The flip side, however, is that this system has been weaponized by almost always, small minorities of people in individual council districts to block the creation of affordable housing WOLF: Will this lead to a new era of public housing projects like we saw built in cities in the ‘60s and ‘70s? All of these projects are going to be proposed by for-profit or nonprofit development. It's only one out of the four types of housing that would be taxpayer-financed, but those projects are not owned and operated by the city. This is not creating huge complexes of public housing at all. Ultimately that housing is owned and operated by nonprofit developers. It's not owned and operated by the city. WOLF: What is the waiting list like for subsidized housing in New York City? There was an example given last year where for 10,000 units of housing, there was a waiting list of 6 million people. There is also an example given by the Chinese American Planning Council, which is the largest and oldest immigrant rights organization in New York City, one of our coalition partners. It took them 10 years to build just 150 units of 100% taxpayer-financed affordable housing for immigrant seniors, people who have low fixed incomes and no opportunity to make more money. WOLF: What lessons should other cities take from this election in New York City? BAGGA: I would reframe that slightly to say New York is learning a lesson from other places, and in particular Austin, which experienced a tremendous amount of economic growth as a result of becoming a tech hub and did not initially build nearly enough housing to keep up with its new demand. But beyond the sprawl, Austin loosened many of its restrictions on development when it came to, for example, height, and as a result, was able to add a lot of density in places where there previously had been none. When it did so successfully, which took just a couple of years, rents in Austin plummeted by an average of 20%. What we in New York did on Tuesday night is follow an example of another city. It was easier for them to do it because Texas is a different type of state with a different set of laws and rules. But we are taking the Austin example and saying, “Unless we are able to get the local politics out of land use, we're not going to be able to solve this problem.” The state had to take matters into their own hands.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's vow to wage the biggest domestic deportation program in American history – expelling a million people a year – is one of his signature goals. His administration has enlisted multiple federal agencies to bolster immigration enforcement operations nationwide. Camo-clad officers are flexing their presence in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Washington, DC and New York, often clashing with protesters along the way. Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration's deportation policy. Full federal border inspections under a new agency began in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the  September 11 terror attacks, when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security created Customs and Border Protection in 2003. Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US's borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests. “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified in a lawsuit filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino. Tensions from the summer's violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America's largest cities. Jason Houser, a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they're not equipped to handle. “They're trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren't for de-escalation of a protest or riots. But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP's use of force policy. “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,” Bovino told CBS News in October. Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a fleet of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones. The equipment was put to use in an overnight raid in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes. “I've been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,” said neighbor Darrell Ballard. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable. “If they're not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick's Day?” While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole. The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. Judge orders improvements at a Chicago-area immigration facility after claims of inhumane conditions But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation's interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency's website says. To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where agents “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.” “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI, told ABC News last year, a few months before retiring. Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration. The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.” Migrants have been pulled from cars, off streets and tackled in courthouses by masked agents. The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear demonstrators. ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said. Illinois' Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters. “They're the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.” Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of pointing a gun at him when he was following an ICE vehicle. Their badges aren't very clear,” Huynh told CNN. DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.” Huynh's encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol's own tactical unit. A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren't clearly identified, issuing an order that all agents “must have visible identification.” “The way that they're carrying on without any visible identification – even that they're law enforcement, much less what agency they're with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it's very dangerous,” said Scott Shuchart, a senior ICE official during the Biden administration. DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said federal officers are covering up to protect their families after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives. “I'm not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it's going to keep officers safe, it's going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families' information, then by all means I'll let them do it,” he told NewsNation in October. “When you're at ICE and you're at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what's necessary to protect them, but I think there's no doubt it's gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it's the exception, not the rule,” he said. Illinois state representative says ICE agents pointed a gun at him and threatened to bash his car windows The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a merger of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports. It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard's unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role. It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate KCRA. Last month, Coast Guard “personnel defensively fired their weapons” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a protest had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area. Trump later stood down on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime. Video shows federal agents strike man pinned to the ground during enforcement act Prior to Trump's call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was coordinated with state officials at the time. The Trump administration's attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that's come up against legal challenges over and over again. The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in Chicago and Portland, comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion” there. But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military. More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch. The ongoing mission costs about $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN. Young and others said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Almost everyone agrees that the US air traffic control system is broken. And now, air traffic controllers are caught in the middle of a political tug of war that has nothing to do with their operations. The government shutdown has left controllers working unpaid, six-day-weeks. That's worsened a staffing crisis, with some airports' control towers occasionally being without any controllers at all. And now that crisis, combined with the shutdown, has led to Federal Aviation Administration limits on flights at the nation's 40 largest airports, with hundreds of flight cancellations daily and disruptions across the country. But some experts say there are solutions that could change the dynamic in relatively short order — either privatize air traffic control or set up a separate government corporation that can run the system. “It opens a window to have this looked at seriously,” said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank, which has been working on ATC privatization since 1981. The US Postal Service already operates as a separate government-controlled corporation, providing service to communities large and small. And while the USPS has its own problems, its employees are still getting paid during the shutdown and mail deliveries haven't been reduced. Poole and other advocates want the service privatized either an independent not-for-profit corporation — as was done in Canada in 1995 — or as a separate government-controlled corporation with a dedicated revenue stream from fees and taxes collected from airlines and passengers. Privatization or separation from the FAA would be more efficient than the current system, said Michael McCormick, professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Being tied to the annual (congressional) appropriation bill means you don't get secured funding, and you can't really engage in active planning for investments, particularly capital investments,” he said. With some form of privatization, McCormick said, “you can plan better for how you're going to develop infrastructure.” He added that there are different forms of privatization, with some services more under the control of the government than others, but none are a for-profit model that would allow investors to demand profit over safety. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has declared privatization a non-starter and a distraction from efforts to improve the system, despite Trump's support of the idea in the past. “Privatization is a fight that someone else can have at some other point,” Duffy said at an August press conference. But he said private plane owners and pilots and operators of business jets were able to kill the bill over concerns their ATC costs at smaller airports would jump. Those groups have a surprisingly powerful lobby, McCormick noted, with enough members of Congress who are pilots to form a “general aviation caucus.” And the business travel sector serves the interests of many of the nation's largest and most powerful corporations. The private plane owners and business jet operators have a financial incentive to fight privatization, as they currently are paying only about 10% of the cost of providing ATC at small airports through fees and fuel taxes, according to McCormick. Those groups are still opposed to privatization. Others have pointed to a privatized model … if you look at some of them around the globe, you'll see that they have almost the same problems as the United States does with respect to staffing, with respect to funding,” said Jim Coon, senior vice president for government affairs and advocacy for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. “A privatized, economic-based air traffic control system really hurts the small world communities around the country, where their airports are really sometimes a lifeline of these communities,” he said. The airlines trade group pointed to a joint letter it and other aviation groups sent to Congress in February calling for unity in support of modernizing the ATC system. That money is a new opportunity for the country's ATC system, said Coons. “Congress has debated this issue, and they put it aside,” he said. “I think we have a rare chance here to get everyone together and get our system modernized as fast as possible.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts delivered a controversial statement regarding its relationship with Tucker Carlson following Nick Fuentes's appearance on his podcast, something resembling a civil war broke out among conservatives. Some, siding with Roberts, felt he was right to assert that Christians should be able to critique Israel without being accused of antisemitism, that Carlson should be free to interview controversial figures without being attacked for doing so, and that Roberts's denunciation of Fuentes was sufficient. Others, however, argued that the Heritage Foundation's refusal to condemn Carlson more strongly for giving what some have called a “softball” interview to a right-wing activist represented a moral failing, that his statement on American-Israeli relations was red meat for antisemites, and that he wasn't stern enough in rebuking Fuentes. Representatives of both these camps have spent the past few days arguing their positions on social media and even within the Heritage Foundation. “I think what we are seeing here in this schism is a predominantly older, southern-centered conservative establishment being forced to come to terms with a younger, geographically northern Trumpist element that they are unable to resonate with,” Ohio College Republican Federation chairman Gabe Guidarini, who has a large social media presence, told the Washington Examiner. “The ideological underpinning of the Trump movement is repurposed Buchananism, which appeals more to young people and Catholics, and it's abundantly clear these older groups have no intention of coming on board with it, which has led to this proxy conflict,” he added. Indeed, 50% of Republicans between 18 and 49 have an unfavorable view of Israel, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center in March. Feelings like these came up during a Heritage Foundation meeting, footage of which leaked to the press, when one unidentified female staffer told Roberts that a “handful of young colleagues and I had no issue with the points you made in the original video,” explaining they believe that “Christian Zionism is a modern heresy” and that Generation Z has “an increased unfavorable view of Israel.” True conservatism is about gratitude, duty, faith, freedom, and moral order — not cynicism, conspiracies, or resentment. What we're seeing now is a generation that confuses provocation with conviction. Institutions and top figures in the conservative movement, such as the Wall Street Journal's editorial board and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), have criticized Roberts's initial statement, whereas a number of social media influencers popular among Gen Z conservatives have offered their support. Fuentes himself has cultivated a massive audience primarily composed of younger viewers. Rod Dreher, an influential conservative writer and friend of Vice President JD Vance, recently claimed that a reliable source told him that “30% to 40% of D.C. GOP staffers under the age of 30 are Groypers,” a term Fuentes's followers use to describe themselves. On Fuentes specifically, Roberts advocated against “canceling” him despite “abhor[ing]” his views, and recommending debate instead. Roberts has since called that initial statement a “mistake,” claiming ignorance of Fuentes's beliefs and criticizing Carlson for hosting him. “Old school conservative elements have wanted Roberts gone for a long time because of his embrace of National Conservative ideas that American voters have routinely signaled they support, and it's the same reason why they relentlessly lobbied against JD Vance's vice presidential selection. The academic also pointed out that many of the people attempting to tone police Heritage, including Cruz, were once enemies of Trump's movement. Tiana Lowe Doescher, for example, pointed out that his tenure as president and subsequent alignment with the New Right figures has been followed by stagnant fundraising and asserted that the foundation has less input over federal staffing than it has in previous GOP administrations. He did, however, offer light resistance when Fuentes claimed conservative media was controlled by “Zionist Jews,” pointing out that Fox News is run by the Murdoch family. “This isn't about canceling anyone,” said Griffith, who now works as a senior fellow at Advancing American Freedom, an advocacy group affiliated with former Vice President Mike Pence. The concern is that you lend the credibility of your organization, the most important think tank in the world, to someone who very clearly is spreading antisemitic propaganda … When you see a mainstream organization welcoming that, it indicates to people that this is an acceptable point of view.” While he doesn't believe Roberts himself is antisemitic, Griffith says that he unfairly criticized those on the Right who are concerned about the rise of antisemitism and felt that he danced around Carlson's platforming of anti-American voices, such as apologists for the Russian and Iranian regimes. He also took issue with Roberts's assertion that “globalists” were pushing support for Israel, pointing out that the majority of the world is anti-Israel and that the pro-Israel movement in America is largely funded and staffed by Americans. Mandel pointed out that “globalist” has been used as a dog whistle. Roberts ultimately apologized for his characterization of Carlson's critics. Griffith has been working in conservative politics for about 12 years and, echoing the sentiment of others, says that the rise in anti-Israel views among right-wing staffers is a recent phenomenon, stating that it wasn't “really a problem up until about three years ago.” One young D.C. conservative staffer, who requested anonymity, found Roberts's statement imprudent but has been disappointed by some of the criticism it has received. “This controversy is forcing a reckoning: Do we stand for the ideas that built the movement — free enterprise, limited government, a strong national defense, and traditional values — or do we drift toward the kind of nihilism that corrodes all of that from within?” Mandel asked. “This will be a huge division within institutional conservative organizations and for donors,” the anonymous staffer said. “I don't believe the grassroots will care as much, and in fact may be turned off by gratuitous accusations of antisemitism.” The anonymous academic, meanwhile, predicted that we'll continue to see conflicts between individuals who have criticized Roberts and figures like Vance and Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh, who they say have harnessed support among young conservatives which threatens to displace more centrist Republicans. “Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Syrian interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa waves as he enters a polling station where electoral college members are voting in a parliamentary election in Damascus, Syria, Oct. 5, 2025. In this photo released by the Saudi Royal Palace, President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Syria's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 14, 2025. BEIRUT (AP) — Two decades ago, Ahmad al-Sharaa was held in a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq after joining al-Qaida militants fighting against American forces there. Few would have predicted that he would go on to become the first Syrian president to visit Washington since the country's independence in 1946. Since rebel forces he led ousted former Syrian President Bashar Assad last December, al-Sharaa — who cut ties with al-Qaida years earlier — has gone on a largely successful charm offensive to establish new ties with countries that had shunned Assad's government after its brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011 spiraled into a 14-year civil war. Al-Sharaa met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia in May, where Trump announced that he would lift decades of sanctions. Apart from that agreement, al-Sharaa will use the visit to push for a full removal of the remaining sanctions imposed on his country. Al-Sharaa's media adviser, Ahmad Zeidan, told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV that the “foremost” issue on the president's agenda in Washington is to call for a repeal of the Caesar Act, which imposed sweeping sanctions over human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces. Days ahead of al-Sharaa's visit, Trump told reporters that he had moved to lift sanctions from Syria “to give them a fighting shot, and I think (al-Sharaa's) doing a very good job so far.” “It's a tough neighborhood and he's a tough guy, but I got along with him very well, and a lot of progress has been made with Syria,” he said. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council voted to lift sanctions from al-Sharaa and his interior minister, and the U.S. then removed them from its “specially designated global terrorist” list. Meanwhile, senators have advanced a repeal of the Caesar Act through an annual defense authorization bill, but the final legislation is being negotiated with the House, where some top Republicans want to put conditions on it. Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has expressed reservations about a full repeal. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is close to Trump, has also pushed for conditions on the repeal, including security and representation for religious and ethnic minorities, “maintaining peaceful relations with other states in the region, including the State of Israel,” and removing foreign fighters from government and security institutions. Skeptics of al-Sharaa point to eruptions of sectarian violence over the past year during which pro-government Sunni gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze religious minorities. Al-Sharaa has promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but minority communities remain wary. Since Assad's fall, Israel has seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and pushed for a demilitarized zone south of Damascus. Shaheen said that “we have a real opportunity in the Middle East right now that we haven't had in my lifetime.” Advocates say it is unfair to keep sanctions that were specifically imposed on Assad's government as leverage over the new authorities and that the threat of a Caesar snapback would prevent international companies from investing in rebuilding the war-battered country. “But to use Caesar for that is like using a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel — you're going to kill the person you're operating on,” Moustafa said. U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said last week that Syria will “hopefully” soon join the coalition of some 80 countries working to prevent a resurgence of IS. A Trump administration official said Al-Sharaa is expected to sign an agreement to join the coalition during his visit. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to comment when asked about the possibility. Another U.S. official with knowledge of the situation said that while Syrian forces had already been fighting IS, their formal entry into the coalition will be a “milestone” and will enable U.S. forces to work more closely with the Syrians. Both officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. While the Islamic State lost hold of all of the territory it once held in Syria and Iraq years ago, cells of the extremist group have continued to carry out attacks in both countries and abroad. Before Assad's fall, al-Sharaa — then known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani — led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamic insurgent group controlling much of northwestern Syria. While Damascus and the SDF have agreed in principle to do so, implementation has stalled amid tensions that have sometimes escalated into clashes between the two sides.

They took the stage for a medley of their hits, opening with “Shoop” then sliding into “Let's Talk About Sex” before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit “What a Man.” James apologized to the fans who “got in trouble for cutting their hair like us,” a line that reverberated later when Roan said that Lauper showed you could “have whatever hair color you want.” Outkast didn't perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first. He choked out the words, “Great things start in little rooms.” “When you looked into his eyes, it's like eternity was staring back,” Carrey said. “For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.” Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell's mighty wail, backed by his band mates on “Rusty Cage” and “Black Hole Sun.” “Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,” Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. “Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. The White Stripes reunion that some fans had also hoped for didn't happen. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo's stadium-shaking anthem “Seven Nation Army” and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist delivered an acoustic version of “We're Gonna Be Friends.” Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of “Seven Nation Army” then remembered his thoughts on meeting them. Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is “the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.” He was joined by an ad hoc super group that included Robinson and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson, who blasted through “Feel Like Makin' Love” and “Can't Get Enough.” “Warren Zevon is in my Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” Letterman said. Other inductees who got video tributes in the theater were Chubby Checker, session bassist Carole Kaye, session piano man Nicky Hopkins and record producer and executive Lenny Waronker.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two U.S. Coast Guardsmen move a life raft from the freighter Edmund Fitzgerald across the dock in Sault Ste. Atkins, now 86, was a news reporter in Detroit when he was sent to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to write about the Fitzgerald. The freighter was transporting iron ore from Wisconsin to Zug Island in Detroit when it encountered a terrifying storm. Ahead of the anniversary, Atkins recounted what he saw that fateful day in a recent interview with AP, his former employer. Atkins, who now resides in Savannah, Georgia, said he was working on the AP Detroit broadcast desk when the bureau heard something was wrong. A Whitefish Bay resident that Atkins described as an “old hermit” was listening to radio communications from ships on the water and called radio stations to relay what he heard. “He could figure out that the Fitzgerald was not doing well,” Atkins said. “We are holding our own,” the Fitzgerald's captain said. Atkins said he worked up a quick story about how the ship was in trouble and then drove overnight to Sault Ste. Marie, about 347 miles (559 kilometers) north of Detroit. He set up shop at the Sault Ste. “I got the Yellow Pages,” Atkins said, “and started looking for an airplane.” Atkins said he found a retired Navy pilot with a four-seat aircraft “with the wings above the cockpit instead of below,” to fly him and a photographer out over nearby Whitefish Bay. When they arrived at the Canadian side of the lake, Atkins said he could see two two freighters, two Coast Guard boats and one other vessel pointed at each other “like the Chrysler star.” “So we had to figure the Fitzgerald's down there in the middle of where all those boats were pointed,” Atkins recounted. From the skies, Atkins said, he saw a lifeboat and vest. But no bodies of the crew were ever recovered. To this day the Fitzgerald remains beneath 535 feet (165 meters) of water, about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north-northwest of Whitefish Point, Michigan. The wreck is protected as a gravesite under Canadian law. He wrote in his “lede,” the first paragraph of his story: “Rescuers searched Lake Superior's chilly waters Tuesday for the 29-member crew of the sunken ore-carrier Edmund Fitzgerald but found only an oil slick, empty lifeboats and life jackets.” Atkins went on to be a longtime sports journalist for the AP in Michigan. “It's a haunting ballad,” Atkins said, his voice thick with emotion. But he didn't realize just how infamous the disaster was until 25 years later, when he first saw news coverage of the anniversary. “To think that 29 guys were alive yesterday and dead today,” Atkins said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Illegal gold mining is growing in the West African nation of Ghana, one of the world's top gold producers. JEMA, Ghana (AP) — As day broke in a remote part of western Ghana, a priest, farmers and other residents combed through the forests, looking for signs of illegal gold mining. They have done this for the past year as part of a grassroots task force created to combat the mining that has poisoned rivers in one of the world's largest gold producing countries. Members of a local anti-illegal gold mining task force patrol a river polluted by illegal gold mining in the Jema community of the Western North Region, Ghana, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. The task force's 14 members call themselves the Jema Anti-Galamsey Advocacy, and their arrests of suspected illegal miners have sparked debate in Ghana's Western North region over their potential abuse of power. Members point to the 450-square-kilometer (173-square-mile) Jema area's relatively clean water bodies as evidence that their approach can be effective. Rampant illegal mining, or galamsey — local shorthand for “gather and sell” — is a growing concern in this West African nation, Africa's top gold producer. Nearly 39% of youth are unemployed, according to government data, pushing thousands into illegal mining. The illegal mining has contaminated significant portions of Ghana's water bodies with cyanide and mercury, according to government authorities and environmental groups. It said nine of them were “completely taken by armed thugs.” Since 2015, the Jema community of about 15,000 people has banned all mining on its land, empowered by a law that grants local chiefs powers to make and enforce customary law. The new task force usually patrols water bodies and the Jema Forest Reserve, wielding sticks in place of guns, at least once a week, watching for changes in water color as a sign of mining activity upstream and for new clearings in the forests. When it receives a tip-off from villagers, it arrests the suspects and hands them over to the district police office. “All our water bodies that take their source here are clean because of our strong resistance to galamsey,” said Joseph Blay, a Catholic priest and Jema resident who helped to form the task force. A woman fetches water from a stream in the Jema community in the Western North Region, Ghana, Thursday, Sept. 11, 2025. Another member, Patrick Fome, said the local Ehole River was starting to turn a milky brown color, a sign that illegal miners appeared to be working upstream. “We cannot go there now without adequate preparation,” Fome said, calling their unarmed patrol work dangerous. A year ago, Ghana saw nationwide protests against illegal mining. President John Mahama, who took office in January, has inaugurated a national task force to combat the practice. But he has rejected calls for a state of emergency, which would grant more powers to police and the military to tackle the issue, saying his government has not exhausted all other approaches. The government's inability to crack down on illegal mining points to a lack of political will, said Daryl Bosu, deputy national director for the A Rocha Ghana conservation nonprofit. While the Jema task force could have its benefits, operating without the supervision of security forces could lead to human rights abuses by its members, said Festus Kofi Aubyn, a regional coordinator with the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, a civil society group. “If the task force is not properly regulated by the state, it could have dangerous consequences, including ethnic targeting or stereotyping,” he said. Some Jema residents said they don't support the task force because they want to work with the illegal miners for financial gain. One 27-year-old resident said he was willing to sell his land to the miners, citing the lack of profit in farming. Local leaders acknowledged that declining farming income and limited job opportunities could create divisions and weaken community enforcement of the mining ban. Residents called for investment in other work to make illegal mining less attractive. “And if the government is really serious to fight, we can use the Jema template to also diffuse it in other communities,” he said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemingly fueled speculation on Saturday that the new Washington Commanders stadium could be named after President Donald Trump, calling the prospect “beautiful.”

Leavitt was responding to an ESPN report that revealed discussions have taken place between the White House and the Commanders ownership group about having the NFL team's new, nearly $4 billion stadium in Washington, D.C., bear Trump's name. While Trump has not spoken publicly about such a desire, a senior White House source told the outlet “It's what the president wants, and it will probably happen.”

In her statement, Leavitt hailed the idea, saying “it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser and Commanders owner Josh Harris reached a deal in April to return the team to Washington, D.C., which coincided with the first few months of Trump's second term. The deal, earmarked at $3.7 billion, includes the development of a new 65,000-seat stadium at the site of RFK Stadium, where the team played for 35 years before moving to Landover, Maryland.

The DC Council ultimately voted to approve the entire development project in September, but not before Trump waded into the deal with a threat to block construction unless the team reverted back to its old name, the Redskins.

The deal went through despite Trump's effort, greenlighting construction of the new stadium, which won't begin until sometime next year.

Trump could be similarly hard put to force the Commanders owners' hands to name the stadium after him, since the naming rights will likely be sold to a corporate sponsor. Of the 32 NFL teams, 29 of them have sold their naming rights to corporations.

Still, a source with knowledge of the stadium deal told ESPN that Trump has “plenty of leverage” to make it happen.</p>
