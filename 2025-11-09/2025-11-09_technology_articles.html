                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Apple's iPhone already supports texting, calling emergency services, and contacting roadside assistance via satellite connectivity, the company has many more satellite-powered features in the works, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In-development features reportedly include an API allowing app makers to support satellite connections in their own apps, a version of Apple Maps that allows users to navigate without a cell or WiFi connection, adding photos to messaging, and increased support for “natural usage,” allowing users to connect to a satellite even if their phone isn't pointed directly at the sky. Another potential upgrade, first reported by The Information, could improve 5G networks by allowing them to connect to satellites for increased coverage. The basic features would be free, Gurman says, with customers paying carriers for more advanced support.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A YouTuber managed to boot and game on AMD's BC-250 mining board built around PS5 silicon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Back in 2021, AMD's crypto-mining-focused BC-250 graphics card, powered by the Sony PlayStation 5's APU instead of regular GPU chips, started popping up on eBay for around $500. The unit also included a standard 8-pin PCIe connector to feed power and an I/O shield. To power up the board, a standard 1,000W PSU was used along with an SSD, peripherals, monitor, CMOS battery, and a standard 120mm fan to actively cool the heatsink. After loading Linux, initial testing with Half-Life 2 and 3DMark's Time Spy and Fire Strike benchmarks failed, likely due to issues with Linux drivers. After some tinkering, the YouTuber was eventually able to run Half-Life 2 at over 200 FPS, however, 3DMark benchmarks did not show any signs of stability. Additionally, more games were tested, including GTA V Enhanced Edition, which ran at an average of 65 FPS at 1440p high settings and 25–30 FPS with ray tracing enabled. Counter-Strike 2 rendered fairly well at 1440p in a competitive setting, averaging 130 FPS. While the performance of the custom BC-250 board may not be able to replace your Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon GPU-powered gaming rig any time soon, it is interesting to see a PS5 APU converted into a working desktop. At $120, it might be one of the cheapest gaming PCs out there, but in reality, it is truly a collector's item and highlights how inventive PC enthusiasts can get when given the right hardware and a bit of determination.

It died because the watch decided to suck in water during a reboot while swimming, they quoted me almost the full price to repair it, even though it was clearly a software bug that caused another advertised feature (namely it's ipx rating) to fail.And while I also wouldn't give Xiaomi iot devices on the network full internet access, at least I can use those things normally. And while I also wouldn't give Xiaomi iot devices on the network full internet access, at least I can use those things normally. I don't know how they can be considered a premium product. I would never use one of their phones again. I'm surprised they don't inject ads into the photos you take. They have ads everywhere else - even in the phone dialing app. Once they start putting LTE radios in them to download ads without wifi, I will be done with those too. Even if you don't suspect malfeasance / advertising / surveillance, a lot of these devices and their software are sloppily developed and highly insecure (Doesn't work if you actually want the internet, and not just wifi, related features of course) (Doesn't work if you actually want the internet, and not just wifi, related features of course) I use ControlD and it's blocking 38% of all DNS requests in my household. It's unbelievable how much of this bullshit is built into the products we use. Moral of the story is... always double check your router settings to make sure enshittified iot devices aren't making you look like a newb. Not that I visit fridges alleys in stores on a regular basis but I have never actually seen one. It's getting so you don't have a real choice. You can buy a fridge (or any appliance pretty much) that is basic and doesn't do the connected thing. But often you want the upscaled models because of real hardware features that are desirable. And these are always bundled with the “connectivity” options. It used to be you just ignored these bits. most updates are downgrades in my experience unless it addresses something very specific But Samsung's ad behavior led me to buy a Vizio TV instead. Their smart TV stuff used to be marginally interesting. When Samsung TV Plus launched it was fantastic. They weren't yet sure of how to handle ads so even the ad space was still nice, and marginally useful.As they figured out the ad strategy, apps started disappearing and new ones appeared that couldn't be uninstalled.Then the OS updates started cratering performance. I have a Samsung smart TV from after 2020 that takes about 4 seconds to register a single remote control command in the smart TV GUI.

Their response to the situation has been that they won't buy Samsung appliances ever again.So if enough of us do that. Edit: I checked because one shouldn't be outraged without fact checking. So you absolutely don't want any Samsung appliances, even the non 'smart' ones. In my market Samsung has driven away all the service techs. We managed to find one, and he said he only works on Samsung because it's a captive market now. He complained that Samsung micromanages field services to a degree that they're killing the service ecosystem for their appliances.We had him try to fix an issue with a dryer. On his way out he looked at the fridge and said “has the ice maker stopped working yet?” It actually had stopped working a year earlier. We didn't get it fixed then because Samsung didn't have anyone to send, and there were no third parties we could find (even unauthorized).We've been replacing all our appliances with other brands.Edit: PS - depending on the model of fridge, the ice maker infrastructure (typically near the filter) eventually start pooling water and might freeze in inconvenient places.

All tvs from all manufacturers have microphones and they do listen an sell info.Everyone things Facebook is listening but it really is your tv. You can refuse to give them a direct WiFi connection, but just wait until they start using IOT mesh networks like Amazon Sidewalk as a fallback channel (assuming some aren't quietly doing that already). In 2030, it will be "Well, the TV sends a 24/7 video of my living room to Samsung, plays a 5 minute ad every 10 minutes of content, displays in 480i unless I pay a $100/mo subscription, and it will kill my pets, but hey, it has the best display in the world, so I'm thinking about buying it." Also, I assume you can still do what I did for my current LG TV, skip the wifi setup, plug in AppleTV and use it purely as dumb TV. I get that, but at some point you're installing it in your house with non-color corrected lighting and viewing it during the daytime with your terrible human eyes. I get why 200-300 lumens of peak brightness can make a difference, but does 2-3% of color correctness really matter to people as they watch their low bitrate netflix stream?Maybe we'd all be better off if we calmed down a bit on chasing the specs, and focused on something else for a while.

Then the advertisers could buy more accurate information to improve product placement in movies/tv shows.The sci-fi version could be a TV that can recognize what kind of things are in the room or clues for the viewer's socioeconomic status and emotional state to bring up content (or even change it in real time) to maximize resonance with the viewer.

And it can't register anything placed in the flex drawer, freezer, or fridge doors. In order to actually take advantage of its fridge inventory system, you still have to manually enter in or correct every single item you place into your fridge.It's inconvenient for looking up recipes, since fridges are not placed for visibility from your countertop.

This is the model for every ad-supported device and service to date, I'm not sure they're going to reinvent those economics for a fridge. There's already parallels around this to an extent. I pay Apple money every month for storage, ad-free TV, music and games, confident my data is my data. As a result, they might have a customer for life, because the alternatives are awful in comparison even if I pay less per month or overall for them. The thing that makes corporations give better warranty support is not more money. In the EU, consumer goods have a minimum two-year warranty period. this attitude strikes me as remarkably naive in 2025. apple is well on its way down the slippery slope.

But maybe the same people who put ads on the gas station pumps that I use?Those things blare at max volume and I still have no idea what they're selling.Amusing anecdote: About 60 years ago, my grandfather (immigrant who was not well versed in mass-production) wrote a letter to the local newspaper asking that they omit the advertisements when they built his copy of the paper. "I never read them" he said.My mother had to explain to him how his copy was gonna be just like everyone else's.

But the fact that this gets retrofitted to fridges that people already bought, without any way of opting out or other mitigation, is criminal. Stop trying to shove ads 24/7 in every millimeter of available space.On the upside, it will be very easy to find more reliable and cheaper fridges than that.

I would never buy Samsung again, unless they started a new trend where all repairs are covered for 10 years (not sold as an add-on during checkout). The real killer feature Samsung needs is an automatic warranty. I would never buy Samsung again, unless they started a new trend where all repairs are covered for 10 years (not sold as an add-on during checkout). They're so deep in advertising that the only feature they can think their customers are interested in are related to seeing ads. I've been shopping for a new fridge lately, and from what I gather most "smart" fridges are still extremely expensive and that makes "non-smart" fridges still very desirable. In other words, "smart" features may not be new, but they aren't standard on a typical fridge... yet. I have a Samsung Bespoke, for example, and you can 100% turn the ice-making off and just use that part of the freezer for more freezer space. I just want a high quality, decent-looking box that stops food from going off. What would you need consensus and immutability for?Nonsensical. I wouldn't consider buying a smart/Samsung refrigerator at all but I'm curious, is having blockchain, AI, and a Samsung account mandatory here? Also, while "smart" Samsung fridges are the topic of this article, the concept generalizes to any internet connected devices within "smart" homes which exhibit a combination of "hackable" and revealing-of-occupancy. Samsung refrigerators are unlikely to be the most attractive vector when there are e.g. "smart" light bulbs out there which are vulnerable and never going to be patched because the manufacturer went out of business.FWIW, I'm not a pen tester or security specialist — just a security-conscious generalist software developer.

I see evidence left behind of scanning attacks in web logs, but haven't actually crafted such mass attacks myself. The problem is that even if you can amass such an IOT botnet, you still need people on the ground to conduct such burglaries, and that scales poorly. drug users who want their next fix) are fickle and are very eager to snitch on you to the police, making it very likely that your botnet gets dismantled. On the other hand running a DDoS or "residential proxy" botnet comes with none of these hassles. We need a law that requires IoT devices have a method of shutting off connectivity entirely, and requiring that core functionality remains intact. I can't always avoid the latter category on principle. But a personally funny thing about this particular episode, to me, is that when I left a very nice CS PhD program, to switch schools, to work on AI+HCI for software agents (before the enabling AI tech was ready)... the most common soundbite that the PI gave to prospective corporate sponsors who visited most days, was something like... "You could have a 'digital butler', who knows what you have in your fridge, and orders milk when you're running out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you weren't alive, or weren't news-cognizant, back in 2007 when the slow motion debt crisis all around us started to give way to The Great Recession, what was eerie was that it felt like you were always hearing about refinancing debt. You couldn't turn on a TV, or click a page on MySpace, without someone offering to refinance your debt. This piece at the Onion captured the moment well.You could get a cheap mortgage weirdly easily because of mortgage backed securities. This involved repackaging people's mortgages—as in mortgages on their homes—as lucrative, tradable assets, and these assets were being purchased on behalf of entities like investment banks and retirement funds. Lehman Brothers, for instance, was a staid, boring financial institution that was heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities.Mortgage-backed securities were everywhere in the economy, and the entities that owned them were the pillars of economic stability. When, slowly but surely, people defaulted on their mortgages in higher and higher numbers, the mortgage-backed securities that had been thought of as valuable were suddenly thought of as doodoo. In 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, and the world was plunged into chaos. We're in a different world, where things don't work the same way. We have different problems.Today, all U.S. economic growth is driven by investment in AI. Entire U.S. towns are banking on the idea that data centers being built in their communities will sustain their economies forever, or at least until some other type of business exists to create a different kind of boom. It's the defining fact of this economic moment. But in surveys, people who don't work in AI largely doubt it's good for the world. With that in mind, Ian Frish at the New York Times' DealBook newsletter wrote something a little unsettling yesterday. It seems that a company called QTS Data Centers, “the biggest player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market,” is entirely owned by the investment company Blackstone. And Blackstone, it seems, is seeking to refinance $3.46 billion in QTS's debt. DealBook apparently got a peek at an offer sheet showing that Blackstone is about to put this debt up for sale. Things are not the same now, like I said. If OpenAI fizzles and never figures out how to make revenue, and the investors all lose their hats, I'm sure other AI investors like, say, Elon Musk and the Saudis will pick up the slack and find a way to drive revenue from AI and keep that crazy amount of AI debt valuable. I'm sure the contagion won't spread too far, and there will be some other perfectly healthy area of the economy, with a wholesome, substantive, real driver of value at its center.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Adobe Firefly feels like the best-kept secret in software right now. Adobe is aggressively talking up the app and its capabilities at events like Adobe MAX, but even with so much limelight, it doesn't get nearly the attention that competitors do. The Firefly app is a creative AI playground that lets you use generative models to create images, videos, and more, but it can do more, from batch editing photos to turning a single frame into a full video. Firefly isn't just a text-prompt AI generation tool. It's powerful, combining dozens of models, including those from Adobe, Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Topaz, to create a one-stop shop for AI creation. Here's everything you need to know about using the app. Adobe Firefly is a suite of generative AI tools built around creative workflows, be it vector graphics, photo and video editing, or even creative ideation. There are several Firefly features built into Adobe's Creative Cloud apps, from Photoshop to InDesign, but I'm focusing on the web-based Firefly application here. It combines all of Adobe's generative AI features in one spot, and it's integrated with other web-based tools, including Photoshop Web and Adobe Express. I won't be able to cover everything Firefly is capable of, but its functionality broadly breaks down into four main categories: Firefly is an AI tool, but as you can see from even a broad description of its functionality, it goes far beyond generating AI images. These tools are integrated with Adobe's web-based ecosystem, too, so you can take an AI-generated image out to Photoshop Web or combine multiple generated assets through Adobe Express. The other thing Firefly does is combine dozens of AI models under one roof. There are constantly new AI models making headlines, from the recent craze around Google's Nano Banana to the early stages of AI video generation through models like Runway. There are four different Firefly plans, and I'll dig into them below, but it's better to think of Firefly along the lines of generative credits than any specific plan. With each plan, you get a certain allocation of credits, and you can spend them to generate different types of content. Each model and feature in Firefly will consume different credit amounts, and the amount of credits a model consumes is subject to change. For instance, Google's Nano Banana costs 10 credits per generation and Imagen 4 costs 20 right now, but that's only for a limited time since these are newer models. Further, some models will consume more credits depending on the output. Similarly, the Luma AI Ray2 video model costs 50 credits per second for a 720p output, but it costs 150 credits per second with a 4K output. Adobe tells me that these credit amounts are subject to change, which can be for the better. As time goes on and models require fewer computing resources, the cost can drop. If you have a paid Firefly subscription (or Creative Cloud Pro), you have unlimited access to Standard features, leaving your monthly credit allowance for Premium generation. With a free Firefly plan, you'll need to spend credits regardless of whether a feature is classified as Standard or Premium; however, Standard features usually only consume one credit per generation. These credits aren't exclusive to Firefly, further complicating matters. Generative Fill in Photoshop is classified as a Standard feature, for instance, while Generative Extend in Premiere Pro is a Premium feature. With each of these additional credit plans, you'll get access to an additional 100 GB of cloud storage, as well, and they renew monthly just like a normal Adobe subscription. Quick Actions largely don't use generative credits, and tools like Boards and the Firefly Video Editor don't inherently use credits, either. You'll only spend credits when using a feature that leverages generative AI. You should think of the free plan more as a trial. You can also access Firefly with a Creative Cloud subscription. Creative Cloud Standard gives you 25 monthly credits, and it works similarly to Firefly Free; that is, you'll need to spend those credits on generative AI, regardless of whether you're using a Standard or Premium feature. Creative Cloud Pro, on the other hand, basically includes Firefly Pro, with 4,000 monthly credits and unlimited access to Standard generative AI features. There isn't a desktop application for Adobe Firefly, but you can access the app in your browser at firefly.adobe.com. Log in or sign up for an account, and you'll be greeted with a text prompt and several boxes suggesting different actions you can take. There's also a menu on the left side to help you navigate. Firefly is powerful, and I won't be able to cover everything you can do with it. Instead, I'll walk you through a simple workflow of generating an image using an AI model, and then using that image as the starting frame to generate a short, looping video. For this example, choose Image under the generate section. At the top of the sidebar, you can select your model and aspect ratio, as well as upload a reference image. In the prompt field, you'll see how many credits a generation costs, as well as a prompt suggestion toggle. Now you have an image, but that's really just the starting point. If the image is close, but not perfect, you can hover over it, select Edit, and then choose Use As Reference Image to feed it back into the AI model. In this same menu, you can also choose Edit Image, which will allow you to tweak the generated image by chatting with the AI model. For this example, I asked Veo 3.1 to add natural motion and loop it, and it did a surprisingly good job without any further guidance. You can find them in the bottom toolbar, and Adobe gives you some preset options like turning an image into a cartoon or changing the perspective of a photo. Adobe Firefly is billed as a tool with commercial applications, meaning you can leverage it for things like advertising by generating assets. Adobe's own Firefly models are safe for commercial use. Adobe says that it trains its models on proprietary data, and you own the output. Firefly also includes partner models, which may not be safe for commercial use. If you're worried, it's best to stick with the Firefly models. Other generative AI features generally don't have issues with royalties or commercial use.

Amazon just dropped the price from $149 to $99, which makes this the cheapest entry point into having a central hub that manages your smart home, handles video calls, and streams your favorite shows. The built-in smart home hub means you can control compatible lights, locks, and cameras without buying separate equipment. This latest version adds spatial audio that fills the room with sound, and turns your smart display into something you'll want to use for music. This 8-inch HD display provides a resolution of 1280 x 800 which should be clear enough for watching cooking videos, checking security cameras, or having video calls with family members. The display hits a sweet spot in size: big enough that I can see details from across the room, and compact enough to fit on a nightstand or kitchen counter without taking up too much space. The 13 MP camera represents a significant upgrade compared to previous models and competing smart displays. Higher megapixel counts translate to sharper video quality during calls with friends and family, so they can actually see your facial expressions clearly instead of looking at a pixelated mess. The camera tracks movement with auto-framing, allowing you to pace during a call without walking out of frame. Noise-reduction technology reduces the background noise from dishwashers, air conditioners, and traffic, and cleans up what the other person will hear instead of your voice competing with ambient noise. The smart home hub, which is built-in, supports Zigbee, Matter, and Thread protocols and eliminates the need to buy separate hubs for different ecosystems in your smart home. You can pair compatible smart bulbs, door locks, thermostats, and sensors directly to the Echo Show 8, then control everything from the touchscreen or via voice commands. You can also make calls hands-free by simply asking Alexa to call specific contacts, which is fantastic while you are cooking, getting ready for work, or managing kids. At $99, you are getting a smart display for $50 less than regular price while offering features that competitive devices charge significantly more to provide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This standalone 25 MHz GPU outputs at 320 x 240 pixels with 4-bit color, performing 3D rasterization, transformations, and lighting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Amateur FPGA designer and retro PC enthusiast Pongsagon Vichit has just gone public with the TinyGPU v2.0. 0Vichit, AKA @MattDIYgraphics on X, also says that this GPU has been submitted to the upcoming Tiny Tapeout shuttle, where it will be hewn from ~200,000 transistors across the max permissible 4x4 tile project size. In contrast, the market-leading Nvidia RTX 5090 has 92.2 billion transistors, but naturally, it comes with exponential amounts of performance as a result of its heftier transistor budget. While this is a significant upgrade from the same designer's Tiniest GPU, from nearly a year earlier, its specs aren't going to set the world alight. In terms of performance, the v2.0 at 25 MHz only manages frame rates between 7.5 and 15 fps. Moreover, this is for rather low-polygon 3D models, at render resolutions of 320 x 240 pixels (or below) and using 4-bit color (max 16 simultaneous colors). While graphics of such resolution and color depth might belong firmly in the early 1980s home computer era, there are some much more advanced processes going on here. Namely, Vichit explains that the TinyGPU v2.0 performs interactive 3D vector-to-raster conversion, and it uses GPU transformation & lighting technology that first hit consumer-land with Nvidia's milestone GeForce 256 in October 1999. Other tech niceties of the TinyGPU v2.0 include its “4-bit double buffer, 8-bit depth buffer store on QSPI RAM, max 1K triangles, backface culling, 1 dynamic directional light, [and] flat shading.” Its max permissible 16 tiles design will cost Vichit roughly $1,500. You can read more about it, dive into Verilog source files, and poke through other resources via the top-linked GitHub repository. Back in April 2024 we covered the news of a different Tiny GPU, which was designed “from scratch with no prior experience,” by Adam Majmudar. It was made ready for its silicon debut via Tiny Tapeout 7 (TT7). Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, Vichit also took part in TT7 with what was dubbed the Tiniest GPU. It was interesting to compare this enthusiast's original and newest Tiny GPU projects, but they are quite different beasts, with the first model extremely lean, with its support for a maximum of two polygons (much less than the 1,000 of v2). On screen render output was manipulated using keyboard cursor controls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I feel no compunction telling you the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite gaming headset wasn't made for most of the people reading this review. It comes with a special GameHub that will hook up to three consoles or PCs at once to let you seamlessly swap between all your devices. It has some of the best premium audio I've heard from a gaming headset all year. It will ask you to fork over $600 for the privilege. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite isn't doing anything we haven't seen before, even when its price tag is one of the highest we've seen. The $400 Logitech G Astro A50 X used a large base for video passthrough to hook up all your devices to one place. The more recent $180 Astro A20 X does something similar to the Arctis Nova Elite, though with only two instead of three outputs for different consoles on a miniature station. The $400 Razer Kraken V4 Pro's base station lacks the extra console and PC outputs, but its metal frame feels more premium when it's sitting on your desk than SteelSeries' plastic. SteelSeries was adamant this is the first “Hi-Res” gaming headset, mostly due to it receiving certification from the Japan Audio Society. But there are other companies promising their gaming headsets can offer players the audiophile experience. Gizmodo Senior Writer James Pero recently reviewed the $360 VZR Model One MK II hi-fi headest. So, no, this is not the first gaming headset with any variety of audiophile-level sound. Instead, the Arctis Nova Elite is the first gaming headset I've used that has everything (and like an everything bagel, that certainly won't please everyone). It's sporting some quality active noise cancellation (ANC), though not the best in its class. Its audio capabilities are certainly top tier (though I may still prefer the Sony Inzone H9 II for pure gaming audio bliss). The headset makes connecting to every one of my devices seamless, and it supports four separate streams of simultaneous audio (though it will require downloading the Arctis app to your phone and the GG app to your computer to adjust equalization options for each device individually). In that very specific case, this is one of the best headsets I've used. The Arctis Nova Elite alone costs more than a PlayStation 5 console even after price hikes. I've used enough SteelSeries headsets to know its typical design ethos. In effect, the Arctis Nova Elite is an upgraded version of the Nova Pro Wireless, with metallic frames and a metallic volume wheel. This gaming headset looks especially good with its cream and gold colorway. The twin carbon fiber drivers offer a clean audio presence at its baseline. It's capable of lossless 24-bit, 96kHz wireless audio, though consoles like the Xbox Series X and PS5 are limited to 48k/16-bit. It may take a few hours of listening, but eventually I came to recognize the Arctis Nova Elite's true potential once I put it through its paces in various titles of various styles. If you're so used to shoving your AirPods in your ears every morning commute, hearing quality audio from a dedicated hi-fi headset can honestly leave you in tears. There's a reason some people become obsessed with audio quality. Once I connected the Arctis Nova Elite to my phone, I wasn't forced to disconnect from PC or consoles. It makes living your life inside the headset easier. I couldn't stand it for too long, though. While the memory foam cups are plush with a pillow-like softness surrounding my ears, the headset wants to hug my head tighter than others to get that perfect seal. There was a growing pressure between my eyes as I used it, forcing me to take intermittent breaks. The Arctis Nova Elite could easily be my one and only gaming headset. That being said, I don't really know many people who bother with more than one. Maybe somebody with a thinner cranium would enjoy them for longer. SteelSeries has a ludicrous number of game-specific profiles for some of the most popular games around and even more you would not expect the company to bother with (there's a preset for Doki Doki Literature Club!, for goodness' sake). So if you load up into your Cyberpunk 2077 save, and enter without the preset bass profile, it won't have anywhere near the levels you want to make your machine gun fire truly pop. Inevitably, you'll come across a game that's too new for it to have an EQ profile. I've been playing The Outer Worlds 2, which has a soundtrack that's equal parts mystery and nostalgia. I just know deep in my soul the game could sound better with a few knobs twisted. If you scroll through all the preset EQ options, you can find one or two that will sound better to your ears. For instance, I played Gears of War: Reloaded with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preset and it sounded much better than with the stock standard profile. Swapping between Bluetooth and the 2.4GHz connection doesn't require much input. SteelSeries' “flat” profile is fine for most listening experiences, including music or when talking on video calls. When I got on with some of my coworkers, they told me I sounded extremely clear, nearly—but not quite—podcast levels of clarity. That's impressive considering the telescoping mic wasn't even wearing a pop filter. The mic offers 16-bit 32kHz recordings, and listening to myself back I can confirm it's of good quality. There's an additional mute button the left earcup if you need to avoid any back chatter when gaming with friends or even chatting with workmates. There's a lot of positive qualities to this design. I could walk 30 feet away from the GameHub with a wall in between me and my desktop, and still hear my game as clear as if I was standing next to it. The ANC is good enough I would repeatedly miss what my colleagues were saying even if they were talking right next to me. Still, I could occasionally hear ambient noise, like the distant pop of a fire truck siren or a loud bang on a conversation my boss was having on the other side of the room. The Arctis Nova Elite is more than enough for your gaming den when you want to hole up like a happy otter and ignore the rushing river waters around you. It just won't offer anything close to the sensory deprivation chamber sensation of some high-end ANC wireless headphones like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen). If there's one thing missing from the Arctis Nova Elite, it's a battery life equal to its $600 price tag. SteelSeries promises you can get 60 hours of active listening, but that's only when you make use of two separate batteries. Swapping in a fresh battery will immediately turn the headset on and return you back to your various connections. By comparison, a $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless can go for 250 hours before you need to plug it in. I keep bringing up other headsets that cost less just to explain where we are with the current landscape of gaming cans. Nothing I've tried has even came close to SteelSeries' price point. There are other gaming headsets that promise hi-fi audio or let you connect all your consoles. There's certainly a few folks out there who are glued to their gaming chairs and want a headset for every single device they own. I can't think of anything better than the Arctis Nova Elite. And it's not just the Switch 2 that could use a taste of Grand Theft Auto. And they're made partially of real wood, because why not? Even if you don't care about streaming, it's a sign of what's to come with the rumored handheld PlayStation 6.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in China, unlike the U.S., the state can and does regulate tech with a heavy hand, and in that context such a sentiment comes across as slightly more substantive than when, say, OpenAI's Sam Altman hypes up his future investment by saying things like, “A.I. Following its breakout success, the DeepSeek team has been pretty tight-lipped for most of the year, but DeepSeek senior researcher Chen Deli has finally broken the company's silence on whether or not what they are doing is good or bad for society. According to Chen: quite possibly bad!“I'm extremely positive about the technology but I view the impact it could have on society negatively,” Chen said onstage in Wuzhen at the government-organized World Internet Conference. Back in January, Chen was in a better mood, tweeting that he was “beyond words right now,” and that the astronomical benchmark ranking of his company's low-cost model “feels like a dream.” That was January. Then in February, Deepseek's Founder Liang Wenfeng met with President Xi Jinping at a televised symposium. After that, as Reuters notes, no one from the company has addressed the public, until Chen's depressing appearance at the World Internet Conference.According to Chen, AI will threaten jobs in the next decade as it becomes good enough to get people replaced, but AI firms have a job to do when it comes to staving off disaster for humanity. “Society could face a massive challenge,” Chen said, “so at the time tech companies need to take the role of ‘defender'.”Realistically, U.S. companies are probably not the companies Chen has in mind as “defender.” His company has close ties to other Chinese companies, many of which have scrambled to integrate DeepSeek AI products into their own ever since the R1 model was released earlier this year, apparently part of the increasingly DeepSeek-centric plan for “algorithmic sovereignty”—cutting-edge achievements in AI without foreign involvement, basically. A little over a month ago, DeepSeek released what it called an “experimental” version of its LLM, a version notable not so much for its efficiency gains or new capabilities, as for its creation of an alternative to Nvidia's CUDA API, and its support for Chinese GPUs.A little over a week ago, Xi said at the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that there should be a global body that governs AI, and that such an international governmental organization would be in the interest of making AI a “public good for the international community.” Yes, when an AI billionaire from the U.S. says this sort of thing, it's probably just hype. Chen's statement, on the other hand, sounds less like tech business swagger and more like the literal party line.
