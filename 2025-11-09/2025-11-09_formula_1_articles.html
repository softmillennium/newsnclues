2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris pipped Kimi Antonelli to the top spot in Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix in Sao Paulo.

Lando Norris put together an impressive lap to edge out Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc for pole position in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver still has the greatest challenge of the 71-lap race to tackle, but the weekend has been a success story for him so far, having taken pole and victory for the Sprint, followed by the top spot in Qualifying.

Norris bounced back from a lock-up in Q3 that initially relegated him to P10, charging ahead on his final attempt to clock a time of 1m 09.511s and leave Antonelli 0.174s adrift.

A statement from the team after Q1 read: “The crew did a formidable job trying to get Gabriel's car ready for Qualifying. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get him out in time for him to set a lap, but this should not detract from the effort every single team member in the garage put in. We will now shift our focus to the race.” "Having a crash of that magnitude and for the driver to be fine, get out and go to the medical centre..." Obviously we saw it happen and then waited for a replay, but then before you know it, your first thought is to make sure the driver is okay. "That's what I focused on really after the session. It looked like one of the biggest crashes I've seen for a while, frankly. The news rounded off a frustrating Sprint for Sauber, with Nico Hulkenberg skidding off the track in a similar vein to the incident that saw Oscar Piastri's Sprint come to an early end.</p>

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Following a difficult Q1 exit in Saturday's Qualifying session, Max Verstappen is set to start the Sao Paulo Grand Prix from the pit lane.

Max Verstappen will start Sunday's Sao Paulo Grand Prix from the pit lane after Red Bull made sweeping changes to his car off the back of a disappointing Qualifying display.

Verstappen dramatically dropped out in the Q1 phase at Interlagos as his and Red Bull's Sprint weekend struggles worsened – the Dutchman complaining that he had “no grip” and had to “massively under-drive”.

With a long race ahead from P16 on the grid, Red Bull have elected to fit a new Honda power unit to Verstappen's RB21, as well as making various set-up changes under Parc Ferme conditions, triggering a move to the pit lane for lights out.

On Sunday morning, the FIA confirmed that a new Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Turbocharger (TC), Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), Energy Store (ES) and Control Electronics (CE) have been fitted to Verstappen's car – exceeding his season allocations for all elements.

Haas' Esteban Ocon is another driver to have taken on a fresh ICE, similarly going beyond his allocation, while Verstappen also has a new Exhaust System (EX), but without exceeding the limit on that front.

“All the above listed PU elements were changed during Parc Ferme without the approval of the FIA Technical Delegate,” read a pre-race note from F1's governing body.

“Also changes have been made to the set-up of the suspension of car number 01 (Verstappen) without the approval of the FIA technical delegate.

“Therefore car numbers 01 and 31 (Ocon) should now be required to start the race from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 a) of the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations.”

Verstappen now faces an even bigger task in Sunday's race as he looks to remain in title contention, a year on from his remarkable recovery from P17 to victory in torrential rain.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Oscar Piastri's championship ambitions were thrown off course in Brazil as he found the barrier during the Sprint.

Oscar Piastri dramatically spun into the barrier during the Sprint in Sao Paulo, putting a dent in his hopes of picking up maximum points in a remarkably tight championship battle.

Conditions around Interlagos were treacherous from the formation lap onwards, with parts of the track appearing damp and slippery, making it tricky to find a racing line that was both dry and effective.

This came to a head on Lap 7, when Piastri drifted onto the kerb at Turn 3. The slick surface sent up a spray of water, forcing him into a spin that ended with his McLaren crashing into the wall and out of the Sprint.

There were eerily similar incidents for Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto, both of whom dropped a wheel onto the kerb before finding the barrier. The amount of debris resulted in the red flag being waved, temporarily halting the session.

Click go on the video player above to watch the moment that cost Piastri a handful of points.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day at Interlagos.

Lando Norris is enjoying a commanding weekend so far in Sao Paulo, having won the Sprint from pole and taken P1 on the grid for the Grand Prix itself, while his title rivals Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen are starting from fourth and 16th respectively.

Happily for the chasing pack though, a race at the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace is never decided on grid position. Even if it doesn't rain – and there's a decent chance it will – it's going to come down to making good strategy choices… with some interesting variables in play.

The 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix was very wet, even by Interlagos standards. Verstappen won, with a double Alpine podium behind him, all running an inter>inter strategy.
