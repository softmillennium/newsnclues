                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A wartime killer who used the blackout to escape justice is one of the oldest crimes among more than two dozen Greater Manchester cold cases highlighted in a new crime map revealing 1,000 unsolved murders. This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives. Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers with no apparent motive. It was believed Minnie had been strangled with her own scarf, which was missing, along with her underwear, indicating she had also been the victim of a sex attack. Tragically, around two weeks earlier, a 15-year-old had been murdered in a similar fashion in Liverpool, and Minnie's mother had warned her “never to allow herself to be drawn into conversation with strangers”. You can search our interactive map to find out if there are any unsolved murders near you. The online map has been produced to support the special publication Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers. It seeks to reexamine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades. Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel Harper and Alice Pittman, who were both strangled during the wartime blackout. Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Of course, that refers to Victor Wembanyama, who already has an alien-themed nickname and wears number 1, while Stephon Castle wears number 5. With Wembanyama and Castle emerging as a dynamic duo, Spurs fans are understandably interested in seeing more of the pairing. His knack for attacking the basket, finishing in traffic, and tendency to draw free throws at an extraterrestrial rate have helped him make a big leap in his sophomore season. Meanwhile, Wembanyama has changed his game dramatically, taking far fewer threes and replacing those shots with much higher percentage attempts in the paint. That has also helped him draw more free throws, pushing his scoring average up this season. With Castle and Wembanyama both taking a huge step forward, the Spurs should be loving what they are seeing out of Area 51. He is developing faster than expected, even though there were some concerns about his shooting and what position he would play in the NBA. After turning the ball over 42 times in the team's first nine games, he has had some growing pains as a lead playmaker. That being said, it has been for the best. He played physical defense against Devin Booker, looked comfortable being the primary shot creator while keeping his turnovers down, and confidently knocked down shots. Add in that he was able to get to the rim and the free-throw line, and it was a glimpse into an exciting future for Castle. Fox now back, it will be fascinating to see how the trio plays together. Or, as I suspect, Fox could help unlock other parts of Castle's game. Castle's jumper has been much better this season, and his playing off-ball means that he will have to take more jumpers, possibly allowing him to become a true shooting guard. He'll still have plenty of opportunities to create with the ball in his hands, but far fewer than he does now. That might be for the best, with him being able to further cut down on his turnovers and play to his strengths. As a physical driver who can get into the paint and finish or earn trips to the line, being forced to pick his spots and shoot more from outside could be just what he needs. That would allow him to finish rounding out his game and become the Spurs' third star. Ultimately, the Spurs' early-season success has been a result of Wembanyama and Castle's improved play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What if they made a spy series for goth kids? That question has been answered with Talamasca: The Secret Order, the latest branch in AMC's firmly rooted tree of Anne Rice adaptations. Talamasca stars Nicholas Denton as a new recruit into an agency (called Talamasca) that monitors the activities of the various supernatural beings that populate Rice's stories. Elizabeth McGovern, William Fichtner, and Maisie Richardson-Sellers fill out the cast. Rice, of course, was the phenomenally successful New Orleans-based author of fantasy literature whose well-worn paperbacks still adorn every Airbnb you've ever stayed at, and whose diehard fans continue to grow in number despite her no longer being of mortal plane (though considering her subject matter, this does seem appropriate). It's entirely possible that you've been itching for a Talamasca series ever since you first read the group mentioned by name in the 1988 best-seller Queen of the Damned (no doubt while playing Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me by the Cure in your dimly lit bedroom). Or you may be someone who always wanted to get into Anne Rice, but never picked up a book, saw any of the movie adaptations, and have slept on the previous AMC series. But if you'd like a little cheat sheet for the mythical creatures that permeate Anne Rice's Immortal Universe, we are here for you. Let's start with the beings that built Anne Rice into a household name: vampires. With eternal life, Rice's vampires achieve a remarkable physical beauty, but also an ennui that have made these characters so richly loved by millions of readers. Think of it like borrowing money from your pain-in-the-butt relative who will always want something back in return. The origins of this species remains a little hazy, but it is believed that they are the souls of humans who have escaped from Hell. The journey and long spans of time, however, make their memories a bit untrustworthy. Witches in Rice's world are humans born with special supernatural sensitivities, oftentimes extra sensory perceptions or the power of telekinesis. The ability to practice witchcraft is usually genetic, but not always. (Rice doesn't like sticking to preestablished rules, explaining much of her popularity.) We're basically getting into monster cereals territory here, but mummies play a big part in Rice's fiction. They aren't usually called mummies, though, but rather Immortals. They first come up in The Vampire Chronicles as a legend — creatures impervious to death who aren't harmed by sunlight. Over time, we learn their origins are with the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, who drank a stolen, magical elixir. Oddly enough, it was the third book in this series about eternal life that Rice was working on when she passed away. First introduced in 1990's The Witching Hour and given prime focus in Taltos four years later, the taltos are a species that, on first glance, look human, but are usually taller, thinner, and have bones mostly made of cartilage. In ancient times, the taltos, who originated in the very north of today's Scotland, tended to be rather clumsy and childlike. The taltos have superior strength and an enhanced libido. Though The Wolf Gift Chronicles sold well, they were poorly received by readers. (If you want to see some howling reviews, poke around on Reddit.) They are the souls of mortal beings who have died, but can become visible to witches (or other groups that have supernatural sensitivities). They can sometimes inhabit corporeal form, though it's not easy — and just temporary. Ghosts aren't just humans — witches and taltos can die, and so can vampires (though it takes some extra effort) — so in a way, ghosts aren't really their own species. Angels are noncorporeal creatures who exist outside of typical time and space. Their main gig is to perceive the Universe and remark upon its beauty. One such angel, however, decided to rebel against this way of life. His name was Memnoch, though most of us know him as Satan or the Devil. This does not involve Leonardo DiCaprio trudging through the snow and eating buffalo hearts, but in Rice's world, revenants have it pretty rough. They are mortals who are in the process of being turned into vampires ("The Dark Gift," it is called), but are buried, entombed, or prevented in some way from feeding for long enough that their evolution is prevented — and they go a little nutty. The revenants in Anne Rice's Immortal Universe on AMC thus far have functioned essentially as "zombie vampires" — mindless, dangerous, and certainly gross. They were dispatched to Earth to assassinate a rogue named Amel, a spirit who is actually the progenitor of the vampire race. The replimoids rebelled against their creators and have been hanging around ever since. They are mortal but have extremely long lifespans, and can basically pass for human. Each generation of replimoid is a little less like the ones originally made by "The Parents" — you can kinda tell by how much gold is in their hair. Another creation that appears in Rice's fiction is God. For it is He who created the angels, and thus Memnoch, a fallen angel, who God basically sees as the loyal opposition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-replicating alien probes may already be operating in our solar system, quietly carrying out long-term missions. These so-called von Neumann probes, named after the mathematician who conceptualized them, could potentially explain the absence of direct contact with alien civilizations—if we know where, and how, to look. Over time, scientists involved in SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) have considered these probes as one of the most efficient ways an advanced species could explore the galaxy. Now, a new paper by Professor Alex Ellery, an engineer at Carleton University's Centre for Self-Replication Research, is reigniting interest in this hypothesis by pointing out that such probes may have already visited—if not remain operational—in the solar system. The study, published as a preprint and highlighted by Universe Today, emphasizes that future SETI efforts should expand beyond the search for radio signals and focus instead on hunting for technosignatures left behind by these potential machines. According to Ellery's findings, self-replicating probes would likely follow a systematic, resource-efficient process. They would begin by harvesting materials from moons and asteroids, chosen for their accessible raw components. These activities, in turn, could lead to more advanced missions, including long-term observation or even engineering projects such as O'Neill cylinders. The predictable pattern of their activities, Ellery argues, would likely generate detectable technosignatures. These could include unusual isotope ratios or subsurface magnetic anomalies, particularly on the Moon, which he identifies as an ideal staging ground due to its composition and proximity. As Ellery explains in comments to Universe Today, the driving forces behind such missions might be far more utilitarian—or even existential. Whether facing the threat of stellar evolution, hostile civilizations, or runaway technologies, advanced species might choose to send autonomous machines as military scouts, colonization tools, or even as cultural emissaries. “Science per se is not much of a driver,” he noted. Ellery's research positions the Moon as a potential hotspot for finding traces of alien technology. According to his study, specific isotopes like Thorium-232, Neodynium-144, and Barium-137 might reveal the presence of nuclear-powered replication systems. These materials could indicate that probes had once operated nearby—or still do. The Moon's rich subsurface metals, particularly nickel, cobalt, and tungsten, would have made it an ideal target for resource extraction. Ellery even raises the possibility that advanced civilizations might leave behind “gifts”, such as buried universal constructor machines—technologies only accessible to species that reach a certain level of advancement. While speculative, this idea points toward the need for a broader definition of SETI success, one that accounts for indirect signs of intelligent life rather than explicit communication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A serial killer who was never detected by police may have been pinpointed by a new ‘murder map' of 1,000 unsolved cases in the UK. According to renowned criminologist Professor David Wilson, the likelihood is that once a predator starts such a violent pattern of behaviour, they won't stop until they are caught. However, the wartime environment that made it possible for a predator to get away with murder may have also brought the killing spree to an end before a third victim was killed, the number of murders required to define a serial killer. Professor Wilson, a former prison governor and emeritus professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, said: “I was really intrigued by this. Could the murder of these two women in Cardiff be linked? Search our interactive map below to find out if there are any unsolved murders near you. Read more:  Woman's 'chilling' scream before having throat slit with killer still at large The 53-year-old widow was attacked and beaten so savagely that a pathologist later said that her injuries may have been enough to kill her. A married couple walking along the street that night actually saw the killer as he sat astride Mabel, but assumed they were lovers and walked on. Three months later, a second woman, 29-year-old Alice Pitman, was similarly attacked in Cardiff. Her body was found in Cathays Park on Sunday, November 7, 1943, less than two miles away from where Mabel was murdered. Like Mabel, she had been strangled, this time with her own stockings. This second murder garnered far less attention in the press, likely because police almost immediately swooped in to arrest a man who worked with Alice at a munitions factory, David Emlyn Davies. While that could be because detectives were convinced they had the right man for Alice's murder, police resources were badly stretched during the war. Many seasoned officers had left to join the fighting, to be replaced by inexperienced volunteers, like the War Reserve Police. Professor Wilson, whose latest book, A History of Modern Britain in Twenty Murders, includes an analysis of crime during the Second World War, said: “The Blitz and the war really did allow a number of murders to take place and go undetected. It is well documented that a number of killers deliberately staged how they left their victims' bodies, so it looked like they might have been killed by falling masonry. “It's no surprise that two serial killers started their cycle of murders during the war, John Christie and Gordon Cummins, who was known as the Blackout Ripper.” Christie, the Rillington Place Strangler, murdered his wife and a neighbour's baby daughter in 1943, and went on to strangle a total of eight women, hiding their bodies at his flat. However, whoever murdered Mabel and Alice has never faced justice. And they were not the only Cardiff and South Wales victims of wartime killers who have never been caught. Five-year-old Joyce Cox vanished as she walked home from school in 1939. Her body was later found on a railway embankment. A spokesperson for South Wales Police said: “All historic murder cases, often referred to in the media as ‘cold cases,' are allocated to the Major Crime Review Unit and remain under active consideration and will be subject of re-investigation as and when new information is received or when there are opportunities following advances in forensic science. If information comes in from the public or other forces we act on it. “South Wales Police has had considerable success with cold case reviews, being one of the first forces in the country to set up a review team in 1999 to conduct cold case reviews.” The possibility of a Cardiff blackout strangler was uncovered during research to map a database of 1,000 unsolved murders. Our exclusive list was sourced from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, and supported with research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives. The database - including many in-depth features focusing on specific cases - has now been published in a new special publication, Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders volume II: Midnight Stalkers. Each case has also been included in our searchable, interactive online map. Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel and Alice. Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers, as well as violent robberies, gangland killings, and contract murders. Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ocean liner, once a symbol of British power that helped defeat Hitler, has become a favorite setting for horror films In 1937, the renowned 40-year-old American journalist Paul Gallico made the bold decision to stop writing sports news to reinvent himself and dedicate his life to what he loved: fiction. One morning, at breakfast, his destiny and that of the ship became permanently intertwined, far beyond the European port they were heading for. Listing much more than it had ever been before, the ship seemed suspended and gave the impression that it would never right itself.” Gallico didn't write that paragraph in a memoir, but in one of the most celebrated novels of the disaster subgenre, The Poseidon Adventure (1969), made more popular by its 1972 film adaptation starring Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine; partly filmed, in fact, on the Queen Mary. The discovery that, in 1942, while transporting Allied troops, a 28-meter wave tilted the ocean liner at a 52-degree angle (just three degrees from capsizing) further fueled his nightmares. In 1941, its austere Art Deco ornamentation had to be removed and urgently replaced with bunks to transport between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers per voyage during World War II. Adolf Hitler had offered $250,000 and the Iron Cross to whoever sank the Queen Mary, a symbol of hope and an exceptional asset to his enemies. Operational until 1967, when it was decommissioned following a drop in revenue after the golden age of ocean liners had ended, the legacy of the Queen Mary was far from over. If it had ended up anywhere other than Southern California, it's unlikely its star status would shine as brightly as it does now,” Jonathan Quayle, a maritime enthusiast specializing in the ship's history, tells EL PAÍS. The U.S. city of Long Beach has been home to the ocean liner for almost 60 years, now without most of its machinery and adapted to house a restaurant, tourist attractions, and even a hotel. “Being located just outside Hollywood, it was the natural choice when a crew needed a location for an episode of Murder, She Wrote [1984], Charlie's Angels [1976], The X-Files [1993]... The list of productions filmed on board is enormous. The ship is unique; there's nothing else like it in terms of size, both inside and out, making it an incredibly rare resource for the film industry. There's nowhere else where you can rent a huge, three-story English ballroom, built in the 1930s and decorated with the finest woods,” Quayle explains. The ship has featured in many other on-screen moments. Martin Scorsese used it in The Aviator (2004). In Assault on a Queen (1966), Frank Sinatra led a gang of thieves who, taking advantage of the discovery of a sunken Nazi submarine, tried to sneak onto the ship (which, at the time, still had a year of service remaining) at sea to steal the contents of its safe. And, on the other hand, there are those “imposing and beautiful interiors” that The Poseidon Adventure revealed to later audiences, about which Quayle is preparing a book. “The ship's interiors were pioneers of British design in the 1930s, but their place in that history has been largely forgotten,” he laments, “with specifically commissioned artworks, fixtures and decorative elements.” Woods from various colonies of the then-British Empire were used, while the first-class dining room was dominated by a gigantic map depicting its transatlantic voyage, complete with a small motorized model of the ship to mark its position along the route. The map of the grand dining room plays a significant role in La maldición del Queen Mary (in English, The Curse of the Queen Mary), a horror film released this year in Spain via Amazon Prime Video. A change in the model indicates that, as in the episode of The X-Files, a time jump has occurred, leading a married couple of audiovisual creatives in crisis to become entangled with a gruesome parricide committed aboard the ship (with no known basis). Quayle admits to having a complicated relationship with it. “While I have no problem with these events, or with the revenue they generate when it is reinvested in the ship's upkeep, I don't like that half of the facilities are inaccessible due to shows that could be located anywhere on the property, nor that historic spaces that could otherwise be restored, opened up, and enjoyed are kept untouched,” he says, referring to horror tours, mazes, and other attractions whose appeal lies in the fact that they take place in normally unusable areas of the ship, which are deliberately kept in their original state to give the impression that the visitor is walking through eerie ruins. With an eye toward developing a future DisneySea theme park (which it would eventually build in Tokyo in 2001), Disney created a Ghosts & Legends tour. “Before, nothing related to ghosts or demons was mentioned in the promotion,” says Quayle. “Disney, with its magic wand, took elements of history and exploited them to create macabre tales that had no connection to events, purely for entertainment. It was in poor taste, as the ship had decades of incredible stories to share, and Disney didn't need to invent things or embellish the truth. For better or worse, it was a resounding success.” Rumors have been circulating ever since: accounts of German or Italian prisoners who died there, of the souls of the HMS Curacoa (which the Queen Mary sank in an accident) wandering the corridors, of children's voices heard in the old nurseries… The official website offers up to three different paranormal activities, as well as a form for tourists to submit their video or audio recordings of unexplained experiences recorded on board. Steps are being taken in that direction, further encouraged by recognitions such as the Queen Mary's designation as one of America's Historic Hotels. “Those in charge seem to appreciate that the ship is more than just a handful of stories. Its history of war and peace far surpasses any macabre spectacle.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition Cada uno accederá con su propia cuenta de email, lo que os permitirá personalizar vuestra experiencia en EL PAÍS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated on:  November 9, 2025 / 7:16 AM EST / CBS News Mark and Marla Palumbo were concerned when their friend and business partner Dr. Henry Han failed to show up for a meeting on March 23, 2016. Dr. Han, his wife Jennie, and their 5-year-old daughter Emily were found dead in the garage of their Santa Barbara home. Mark Palumbo had just seen them on his way back from a business trip. Mark Palumbo: We went out for dinner … played Connect Four with Emily. Marla Palumbo: He brought his phone to me and I'm just looking at all these pictures of Emily … and they were … taken the Friday before … … and she's just goofing around with a book … making all these funny faces and … you could tell … she was loving life. The Palumbos had recently embarked on a new business venture with Dr. Han. Mark Palumbo: I really loved the guy. Marla Palumbo: He had to come with food … and in shorts and flip-flops you know … just no …  air about him. Natalie Morales: But what made you trust him? Don Goldberg had known Dr. Han for more than 25 years and thought of him as a brother. Don Goldberg: I was … approximately 10 years older than Henry, but he still called me his younger brother. When they met, Henry Han was making a name for himself after emigrating from China, where he came from a family of physicians. He would soon take over the Santa Barbara Herb Clinic. … And it was like, I gotta meet this guy. Dr. Glenn Miller, a psychiatrist, says he and Henry Han developed a mutual respect and even partnered on a book about how Eastern and Western medicine could work together to improve patients' quality of life. Dr. Glenn Miller: Henry's practice was flourishing … as far as active patients, he would see like in a month, it was hundreds … but he also tried to balance it. In 2009, that balance he was seeking became a reality, when Henry met and married Jennie Yu. Marla Palumbo: Jennie … was absolutely warm and lovely. When they had Emily, the dream was complete. Don Goldberg: Henry was just … on cloud nine. They were often together at the clinic, where Jennie had quickly become Henry's right hand, says her friend Isaiah Oregon. In the spring of 2016, they were getting ready to celebrate Emily's 6th birthday. Isaiah Oregon: We were making plans for her birthday party and … you know, had all her presents wrapped. Don Goldberg: I don't really have adequate words to describe h — how I felt … The sadness … is too deep. As night fell on the Han estate on Wednesday, March 23, Goldberg tried to process what he had just witnessed. He had called 911 when he couldn't find the Hans anywhere, and he was with sheriff's deputies when they discovered the bodies in the garage wrapped in plastic. Don Goldberg: None of it made any sense at all. Prosecutor Ben Ladinig says it was shortly before midnight when Santa Barbara sheriff's investigators obtained a search warrant and began to piece together what had happened inside the house. Natalie Morales: What did that tell you about the depravity of the kind of person who could do something like that? Ben Ladinig: We didn't know what he was after. But … the depravity I've never seen anything like it. Ben Ladinig: The smell of bleach … was there. …We had bleach bottles found … There were bleach … stains on the carpet and throughout other items upstairs … and then you see bloody things in … a washing machine. And within there are a huge group of bloody sheets … Three matching shell casings were found within the wrapping of Jennie's body, and one was later found lodged between the baseboard and box spring of Emily's bed. Ben Ladinig: We had one bullet that was a through and through … it was perfect for comparison … for … the murder weapon. Ben Ladinig: As things are going, we start to find clues as to … who potentially could be involved. Inside a paper bag next to Henry's bed, detectives found a document signed the last day Henry was seen alive. Ben Ladinig: It's basically a four-page business contract between two partners. Don Goldberg: I did not think that … Pierre was capable of … murder … I never really saw Pierre become angry or agitated. But the Palumbos had a bad feeling. Natalie Morales: You didn't trust him? Kymberlee Ruff: It was like a bomb exploded … Nobody could move for weeks. Kymberlee Ruff says Dr. Han treated her family for two decades — ever since she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer shortly after giving birth to her son. … No matter how scared you might be, or- or frightened, you just left feeling like it's gonna be OK. Yeah, he was something. Instilling hope may have been one of the secrets to why his patients say Dr. Han could heal just about anything. Sheri Buron: Dr. Han, like, saved my life. Sheri Buron was also a young mother with cancer when she went to Dr. Han. Sheri Buron: There were so many people that passed away around me. Natalie Morales: What was the impact for you of his loss? Sheri Buron: It's the fear of … if something comes back. … And I'm … trying every day to be positive and … try to stay with his level of calm and how much confidence he had that like everything's taken care of. That conviction is what had drawn the Palumbos — who worked in the skincare industry — into their partnership with Dr. Han, hoping to treat various skin maladies. Marla Palumbo: Henry was very interested in CBD. Having used CBD in his practice to treat pain and inflammation, Henry Han wanted to harness its full potential. Don Goldberg: Pierre … from what we gathered had a lot of experience, uh, in laboratories … in this case relating to CBD. Henry Han had taken a liking to Haobsh after meeting him through another associate, but the Palumbos were uncomfortable with Pierre from the start. Mark Palumbo: It was always this kind of little boiling simmer. Marla Palumbo: What we came to find out was he was using toxic materials … when … we called him on it … he said, you know, "I'm just learning more about the molecules" … it was just weird. As it turned out, Haobsh wasn't a formally trained scientist. He didn't even have a college degree. Mark Palumbo: The more you got under that surface, the more you realize that he could, uh, talk a game and stay over the folks' heads a bit scientifically … Natalie Morales: Sounds like he was sort of … a snake oil salesman-type, right? There was more eyebrow-raising behavior — Haobsh had also made odd charges on Henry Han's account. After Marla Palumbo flagged the charges to Henry Han, he discovered they were for escort services. Marla Palumbo: Henry was, "You won't believe this! Natalie Morales: That was the final straw. Marla Palumbo: That was Henry's final straw. Marla Palumbo: Henry mentioned that he had learned a lot more about Pierre's upbringing … how much Pierre had to overcome from his childhood. We didn't want to have Pierre back in our fold at all. The Palumbos were not alone in being wary of Pierre Haobsh. Jennie Han's friend, Isaiah Oregon, says Jennie also had concerns and confided in him about them four days before the murders. Isaiah Oregon: It was weighing on her heavily. But Pierre Haobsh had already ingratiated himself back into Henry's good will. Don Goldberg: Henry had a very trusting nature … Henry had shared with me that Pierre told him that he was … ill … that it was late-stage cancer and that, uh, he was going to do what he could to help Pierre. There was that contract found in the master bedroom they had signed the last day of Henry's life. But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig says it didn't seem legitimate. Detectives had found something else of interest. Ben Ladinig: A brilliant detective …  found … packaging to … the plastic … wrapping … that all three of the Han family were wrapped in … In a trash can, in the kitchen area next to packaging … of 3M duct tape, similar to the duct tape that was used to wrap all three of the bodies. He recognized the plastic wrap was a Home Depot brand and reached out to the company's security department. Ben Ladinig: And Home Depot was, within hours of us … gaining an entry into the house, able to run those two items together, to see if they had been purchased in the Southern California region within the last several days or weeks. A Home Depot in Oceanside, California, had security footage of a man who matched the DMV photo of Pierre Haobsh, who also happened to have an Oceanside address. … He's walking out with three huge plastic rolls … and sure enough, duct tape. Natalie Morales: So within hours of … the crime scene being discovered, Pierre Haobsh became … a person of interest. Data from the Hans' cellphones — which were missing — showed they were traveling south, further, and further from Santa Barbara. Ben Ladinig: Then inexplicably, Henry's phone goes dark … but Jennie's is still on and it keeps going south. …We're getting basically digital footprints leading down to the Oceanside area from a dead woman's phone. Anthony Flores (driving): Anytime you're trying to stop somebody that is wanted for homicide, the stakes are gonna be high. Anthony Flores and his partner were part of the local Oceanside Police team assisting the Santa Barbara investigation. Anthony Flores: We had come in to work with our Special Enforcement section … And we were gonna be the stop car for that day. Meanwhile, undercover detectives were conducting surveillance at the residence Pierre Haobsh shared with his father and updating all units — including the homicide team that had driven down from Santa Barbara with Prosecutor Ben Ladinig. The surveillance team followed Pierre Haobsh's father as he drove to a Walmart parking lot, where security cameras captured him meeting up with none other than Pierre. Ben Ladinig: That's dad driving in … sedan and then you see the Lexus following shortly behind … They appear to be communicating briefly together … you can just see that trunk pop — on dad's car. After transferring two large duffel bags to Pierre Haobsh's car, they both drove off. Ben Ladinig: We gotta move quickly. Ben Ladinig: Then all of a sudden, you see … an unmarked car … drive right through the middle of that intersection … sparks fly and … it just basically comes in, pulls in and lays on the brakes … Two huge dudes get outta the car and pull gun on him and prone him out. Natalie Morales (at ARCO station): What do you remember about that arrest? Anthony Flores: I remember it going down really fast …  all of our senses were heightened ... Pierre Haobsh waived his Miranda rights and started talking to detectives. What he told them was something out of a spy thriller. He claimed that his life was in danger. PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): Over the past couple of days, I—I kid you not I've been shot at. … probably about five individuals so far that I shot in self-defense. Pierre Haobsh said he had gone to Dr. Han's house earlier in the week to install one of his perpetual energy devices and that the plastic wrap and duct tape he was seen purchasing were for that purpose. HENDERSON: There's more to this story that you're not telling me. … I had —no clue that — oh my gosh. Everything was perfectly fine when I left. Pierre Haobsh was adamant he would never hurt the family and insisted the shadowy figures who had been after him had killed the Hans and were trying to frame him for murder. PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): … I invented a technology that changes the world… oil companies and people don't want this technology out there. Ben Ladinig: It was this massive conspiracy to keep this … next-level energy system from getting out to market. … "James Bond," "Mission Impossible" … this fantastical life. Pierre Haobsh's outlandish story continued, but then detectives received an unexpected call from someone who claimed to have information about the murders. TJ Direda: I'm a pretty rough around the edges guy … I have rough around the edges friends. TJ Direda was a marijuana grower who said Dr. Han had approached him about supplying CBD-rich strains. TJ Direda: Dr. Henry had told me … that he was … like a prodigy street chemist … he had done some stuff that was ahead of his time. TJ Direda: Oh, he absolutely trusted me. As Direda revealed to detectives, Pierre Haobsh had reached out to him via text the morning of the murders. The message sent at 09:39 a.m. said: "I need your help with something urgently... Like its urgent!!!!!" Natalie Morales: What was he asking for? TJ Direda: Uh, he needed my help. He says Pierre Haobsh told him he was in Santa Barbara and needed to talk face to face. So Direda had him come to his house in Thousand Oaks, about an hour away. TJ Direda: The first thing out of his mouth … "just so you know, I'm a monster." Direda told detectives Pierre Haobsh said he had tried to put the bodies in his car, but they wouldn't all fit and Henry was too heavy — details Ladinig says only the killer would know. Direda told detectives Pierre Haobsh had also revealed his motive: $20 million that he planned to drain from Henry's accounts after killing the family. Direda says he didn't know if what he was hearing was another one of Haobsh's far-fetched stories. TJ Direda: I just wanted to get him out of the house and confirm whether what he had just said was true or not. Once Pierre Haobsh was gone, Direda tried to reach Dr. Han and anyone who might have information, to no avail. Around 5 p.m., when Direda still hadn't provided any assistance, Haobsh texted him with a proposition. What did you think the reason for that all-of-a-sudden trip to Vegas? TJ Direda: At that point, I wasn't sure. Natalie Morales: You were gonna be the fall guy. Direda made up an excuse why he couldn't go. And Haobsh would send him one final text at 7:35 p.m. that night: "Yep. Only if I got to it all sooner." Ladinig says Pierre Haobsh had just returned to the crime scene with a big truck to transport the bodies, but law enforcement had beaten him to the scene. Ben Ladinig: He knew his goose was cooked. Pierre Haobsh's arrest near Oceanside, California, had come at a critical juncture. He also had his passport and those duffel bags, which he had received from his father minutes earlier. The next day, during a closer examination of Haobsh's car at the crime lab, "You name it we found it in that car," said Ladinig. There was Henry's wallet, credit card and Social Security number, along with an expended shell casing. There were also the victims' phones and tablet, all wrapped in aluminum foil, in an attempt to evade tracking. Pierre Haobsh was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, making him eligible for the death penalty. Christine Voss: It was one of the most challenging cases, if not the most challenging case I ever came upon. They painted him as a career con man who up until the murders flaunted his intelligence and supposed wealth. Marla Palumbo: His entire life's drive was being rich. Ben Ladinig: He … sent … screenshots of his Chase account from anywhere from about $3 million up to $940 million dollars to various people attempting to dupe them that he's this jet setting, billionaire. Pierre Haobsh claimed he had received big offers for his energy technology. But several years before the murders, Haobsh was actually being paid to build one. Samantha Spidell: It was gonna be a new source of energy as if he was, you know, an Elon Musk … Samantha Spidell met Pierre Haobsh circa 2012 when he moved into a penthouse apartment in a luxury high-rise she managed in Tempe, Arizona. Samantha Spidell: He … pulled up … and had this … bright red Ferrari … it was very flashy. Ladinig says Haobsh had duped a group of high-rolling investors into financing his invention, until they realized it didn't actually work. Ben Ladinig: He had basically defrauded all these people and the money dried up … When the murders were committed I think he had less than $500 to his name. Prosecutors presented a detailed timeline retracing Haobsh's movements, including his digital footprint, in the days before and after the murders. They say as early as March 17 — six days before the murders — he had looked into impersonating the doctor at his bank. Ben Ladinig: He's searching for Asian disguises and real flesh masks. Natalie Morales: Like a "Mission Impossible" face mask. … this is his fantastical world that he lived in. There's no evidence he ever purchased a mask. But a time-stamped receipt and security video placed him at an Arizona gun store four days before the murders — purchasing ammunition and two firearms, including the alleged murder weapon. To their surprise, investigators also found the keylogger on Pierre Haobsh's laptop. On March 21, while Haobsh was still at the Han's home, the keylogger had recorded chilling search terms on his laptop. Ben Ladinig: What part of the skull is more penetrable? Natalie Morales: As a guest in Dr. Han's house – Ben Ladinig: A guest— he'd been staying there – Natalie Morales: -- for the two nights before ... Planning, this execution-style murder. They say later that day he began frantically trying to siphon money from Henry Han's accounts. He's doing all these things from … personal identifying information of Dr. Han's that he stole earlier that week. A Chase fraud alert had flagged an attempted payment for $72,000. Meanwhile, Pierre Haobsh also rented that big truck he allegedly drove to the crime scene hoping to move the bodies. Ben Ladinig: There are black and whites all over that house. The Palumbos say the meeting they were supposed to have with Henry Han just hours after he was murdered had foiled Pierre Haobsh's plans. Marla Palumbo: He thought … that he had that whole day to clean up his mess before Henry would be missed. Mark Palumbo: He wasn't fast enough. Marla Palumbo: I think we screwed it up for him, happily. That's when prosecutors say he fled, driving south toward Oceanside. Ladinig argues Pierre Haobsh's subsequent searches betray his guilty conscience: "is car searched entering tijuana"; "How Crime Scene Investigation Works"; and "how long do fingerprints take to process". Incredibly, he even consulted an online psychic named Count Marco and asked him "will I get causght for what I did?" Ben Ladinig: And Count Marco replies, well, what did you do, Pierre? Pierre Haobsh never gave Count Marco an explanation, but on the stand, he couldn't stop talking. Christine Voss: This was a tough case … but that didn't change the fact that Pierre was entitled to a vigorous defense. Defense Attorney Christine Voss was in an unusual position. Christine Voss: This was a really well investigated case. … Because my client wanted to have a trial and wanted me to turn every stone, I did. Turn every stone and raise any possible reasonable doubt. Voss expressed concerns that the alleged murder weapon and silencer found in Haobsh's car didn't match up. Christine Voss: It absolutely did not connect to the firearm that they believed was the murder weapon. She seized on discrepancies in the location data from Haobsh's car and phone that the prosecution had used in its timeline. Christine Voss: He could not possibly have been in San Diego and Santa Barbara simultaneously, or Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara simultaneously. But that's what the GPS data showed. Voss questioned why Direda waited nearly two days to contact authorities, and argued in that time, he could have gotten details about the crime scene that the prosecution claimed only the killer knew. Christine Voss: It was not the best kept crime scene … he was making various phone calls after he heard about the death of Dr. Han … But Voss concedes much of Direda's testimony was corroborated by the evidence. Ben Ladinig: This case was over within the first 72 hours. In fact, the only witness who provided testimony that someone other than Pierre Haobsh was the killer was Pierre Haobsh. During three days on the stand, he repeated the action-packed account he'd given detectives about having shootouts with shadowy figures. … which further made him believe it was the Department of Energy … And what about all that evidence investigators found? Christine Voss: It was difficult for me to embrace Pierre's testimony. Samantha Spidell: He was obsessed with the government. Samantha Spidell attests there were some kernels of truth in his stories. Samantha Spidell: Pierre mentions that his dad had ties to the CIA … And I could tell that he … wanted his dad's … approval. When his father died in 2023, his obituary stated he was, "a key player in clandestine Central Intelligence Agency operations during the 1980s." Pierre Haobsh also told Spidell that his sister was going to star in a reality TV show. Samantha Spidell: She got cast on a newlyweds reality show … and Pierre was gonna be in it … come to find out that was true. Pierre was even shown giving his brother-in-law a cooking lesson. But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig argued any grains of authenticity in Haobsh's life were far outweighed by deceit. On Nov. 24, 2021, Judge Brian Hill would get the case. None of Pierre Haobsh's family members attended his trial. The judge made his ruling: guilty on all counts. Natalie Morales: The judge, when he issued his ruling, said … his decision was beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely no doubt of Pierre Haobsh's guilt. Ben Ladinig: Yeah … very satisfactory to hear that. Natalie Morales: And what was Pierre's reaction upon hearing that ruling? Christine Voss: Well, he was visibly disappointed. On April 15, 2022, Pierre Haobsh was sentenced to three life terms without the possibility of parole. It was little comfort to those still mourning Henry, Jennie and Emily. Don Goldberg: I don't understand how there really could be justice. …  He took precious moments that … we'll never get. Marla Palumbo: I want him to feel every pain possible for what he did. Mark Palumbo: Not enough bad things can happen for him. Isaiah Oregon:  It's hard to think of them. Dr. Glenn Miller: He was a really good man. … you don't replace a Henry Han. … There's an old … phrase that … a good man and a good family lives for limited time, but a good name shall live forever … They lived too short … but … their name lives on forever. Haobsh's conviction was upheld by the California Court of Appeal in January 2025. He also petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to release him. Iris Carreras and Hannah Vair are the field producers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural did the thinkable in season 15's finale, as Dean Winchester met his untimely end. While official news on Supernatural season 16 has been unforthcoming over the past 5 years, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have each expressed their willingness to return when the time is right, all but guaranteeing the Winchester brothers will be back on our screens sooner rather than later. It goes without saying that, were Supernatural season 16 to ever happen, Sam and Dean Winchester would need to be reunited. Dean's death actually does very little to impede the siblings teaming up in a potential revival. As seen in The Winchesters, Dean enjoys more or less free rein roaming around different realities, so if his own timeline came under threat and Sam needed help, Dean could quite easily pop down to Earth on a temporary visit. As such, it's incredibly likely that Supernatural season 16 would be a "one last case" arrangement where Dean is given leave from the afterlife to assist Sam and protect the world from the latest spooky bad guy. The tragic expectation, however, would be that Dean ascends back to Heaven once again when Supernatural season 16's case is closed. Supernatural's finale all but confirms this, as we see flashes of Sam's life without Dean, right up until his own demise as an old man in a terrible wig. Dean Winchester dying in Supernatural's final episode had been a long time coming. As mentioned previously, however, the manner of Dean's last hunt proved disappointing. The Winchesters then removed any weight behind it by confirming Dean isn't exactly stuck in Heaven. At this point, it would be better for Supernatural to drop the idea of Dean being dead altogether. The show had an opportunity to kill off Dean properly in season 15's finale. Because there is another fitting ending that Dean could have after Supernatural season 16, and it involves a storyline from the main show that was never completely finished: Lisa and Ben. After living with Lisa and her (potentially their) son between Supernatural seasons 5 and 6, Dean ended up realizing that his presence put the pair in danger. He had their memories wiped and never spoke of them again, but there's no doubt Lisa and Ben represented Dean's "happily ever after." The most satisfying ending for Jensen Ackles' character in Supernatural season 16 would be a reunion with the family he left behind, and closure on an unfinished relationship that remains arguably Dean's biggest regret right up until Supernatural's final episode. As an added bonus, further Supernatural revivals could then avoid the obstacle of bringing Dean back from the dead altogether. The only problem would be how Supernatural can align Dean coming permanently back to life and having a family with Sam's flashforward from the series finale, in which Dean is very clearly still deceased. Under normal circumstances, blatantly backtracking on a flashforward could be viewed as a lazy retcon, but given the lack of love afforded to Supernatural's final episode - everything from Sam's older appearance to Dean's lackluster last hunt - it seems unlikely many would complain about Supernatural quietly relegating Sam's later years from official canon. Sam's own happy ending wouldn't need to change, of course. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Just have Sam wake up to heat of the moment by Asia problem solved👍🤓</p>
