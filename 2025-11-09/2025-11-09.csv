            Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese space satellites, which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers.
    


            The countries have in recent weeks highlighted frequent instances of Russia stalking, jamming and interfering with their satellites in space.
    


            “Russia's actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told a Berlin conference of space industry leaders in September.
    


            Targeting communications satellites can impact things like satellite imagery, telecoms and broadband satellite internet access. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND.
    


            The warnings come in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now well into its third year. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf.
    


            Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space.
    


            Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. IntelSat is a commercial satellite services provider whose fleet is used by governments and companies in the US and Europe.
    


            “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs.
    


            The head of the UK Space Command also sounded the alarm, saying that Russian satellites are stalking British assets in space, as well as jamming them on a “weekly” basis.
    


            “They've got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Jamming is conducted using ground-based infrastructure. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine.
    


            Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia's plans to develop nuclear weapons in space to disable and destroy satellites.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear weapons in space. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. China abstained from voting.
    


            In general, it's relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it's difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions.
    


            Authorities make assumptions about the intent of Russian satellites based on where the satellite is in space, what else it's near and historical patterns of what similar satellites have done, according to expert Clayton Swope, the deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, DC.
    


            For example, if a Russian satellite lingers for a long period of time near a European communications satellite, authorities can infer that it's there to spy.
    


            Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals.
    


            Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. Authorities can identify satellites that look similar to those equipped with projectiles to determine that they are a physical threat to other countries' assets.
    


            “The Russians have a history of having those types of satellites shadowing other satellites in a way that people might think it's a sleeper cell, waiting to strike at a moment's notice,” Swope said.
    


            “It's very hard to distinguish between a threat in the sense of a weapon and the threat in the sense of intelligence collection,” he added. “Sometimes you really are guessing a lot about what the capabilities of a satellite are as well as the intentions of the operator.”
    


            The Russian space agency has previously downplayed the danger of its weapons tests in space.
    


            Germany and the UK are just the latest countries to sound the alarm. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites.
    


            The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as “mysterious.”



Putin floats the possibility of fresh nuclear tests following Trump comments



            Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
    


            “So, these kinds of behaviors are not entirely new, but I think also need to be seen in the context of Ukraine, and to be seen in the context of the airspace violations that we see Russia conducting with regard to NATO airspace,” Suess told CNN of the recent reports of satellite spying and interference. “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.”
    


            China is just as much of a threat as Russia, if not more so, experts told CNN.
    


            Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.”
    


            Some of China's capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. For example, China has tested a satellite with a robotic arm that can shift other satellites into a different orbit.
    


            China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We're not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. Their resources are far too stretched for that.”
    


            Beijing's activities in space are very active and their objectives are more opaque, according to Swope, the CSIS analyst.
    


            “We don't always know what they're doing, and they're doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added.
    


            Germany said it will budget up to €35 billion ($40.2 billion) over the next five years for space projects.
    


            “It is a big number, for sure. I think it also reflects that there's a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. “Europe as a whole has a lot to catch up on. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.”
    


            A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.”
    


            The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a strategic review of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites.
    


            But an analysis from the London-based think tank Chatham House argued that even greater near-term investment is needed, and that the strategic review failed to recognize how urgent the threats in space truly are, putting the country at risk of falling behind.
    


            Meanwhile, France has “been very vocal about the need to have what they refer to as ‘bodyguard satellites,' so, satellites whose job it is to protect other satellites,” Swope said. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing.
    


            The US still has a historic advantage in space after investing much more in recent years, analysts said. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances.
    


            NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space. Article 5 is the principle that an attack on one NATO member is an attack on all members. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that NATO needs to “throttle up” on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time.
    


            While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China's advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers.

            Suess cited an example of a Russian fighter jet downed in Ukraine that was found with a built-in Russian navigation system but also a commercial GPS taped to the dashboard. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch.
    


            “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.

The North Korean football team has won the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup, claiming a fourth title on Saturday to become the most successful team in the competition's history.

The final took place at the Olympic Stadium in Rabat, Morocco, where the North Koreans scored all three goals in the first half to seal a 3-0 victory over the Netherlands, which was making its tournament debut.

North Korea, which also won the title in 2008, 2016, and 2024, is the only country to win four championships and is the second nation to win every match on the way to the cup, following Japan's undefeated run in 2014.

This was the first time the Under-17 Women's World Cup was held in consecutive years after FIFA decided to make it an annual competition to provide more opportunities for young players. The 2025 edition in Morocco also featured an expanded field of 24 teams, with four nations making their debut.

The defending champions advanced to the final after a 6-1 win over hosts Morocco, a 5-1 win against Japan, and a 2-0 semifinal victory against Brazil. In Rabat, they imposed themselves from the opening whistle, using a direct attacking approach that tore through the Dutch defense. Kim Won-sim opened the scoring in the 14th minute, followed by Pak Rye-yong, and Ri Ui-gyong added a third before halftime.

The 3-0 win marked the largest margin ever recorded in a final, reaffirming the country's dominance in women's youth football.

North Korean players also dominated the individual awards, with Yu Jong-hyang receiving the Golden Ball as best player and the Golden Boot as top scorer with eight goals. Kim Won-sim took the Silver Ball and Silver Boot after netting seven.

NATO will not send troops to Ukraine as it could lead to a direct clash with Russia, the bloc's former secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin warned in September that Moscow would consider any unauthorized Western military personnel in Ukraine as “legitimate targets.” The “dragging of Ukraine into NATO was one of the causes of the conflict” between Moscow and Kiev, he stressed.

In an interview with The Times on Saturday, Stoltenberg recalled that NATO members made two key decisions during a meeting in Brussels after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.

“One was to step up our support for Ukraine, as we did. The other was to do what we could to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine and become a full-scale war between Russia and NATO,” he said.

The former NATO chief cited then-US President Joe Biden, who stated at the time that “we will not risk a third world war for Ukraine.”

According to Stoltenberg, Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky also understood that. “He called me from a bunker in Kiev… and he said: ‘I accept you are not sending in NATO ground troops, though I disagree. But please close the airspace,'” he said.

Stoltenberg said he denied the request to shut down airspace over fears of escalation, but described it as “extremely painful” to end the call that way. Later in the conflict, Zelensky continued to urge NATO to put boots on the ground.

Stoltenberg admitted that there is an “element of contradiction” when NATO says it wants Kiev to prevail but refuses to deploy its own troops to Ukraine and only focuses on arms deliveries. He added, however, that he believes this is “the right approach.”

The bloc needs to supply even more weapons to Ukraine to “make it stronger on the battlefield” so that Moscow agrees to a ceasefire along the current contact line proposed by Kiev and the West, Stoltenberg insisted.

Russia has rejected the idea of a truce, saying that Ukraine and its NATO backers will only use it to rearm and set up new defense lines. According to Moscow, the conflict requires a permanent solution that would address its root causes.

Congressional approval would likely be required for plan to take effect, an idea Trump has floated before

Donald Trump on Sunday mused about giving most Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenues collected by the president's administration – an evident bid to rally public support on the issue.

“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday.

The post also made it a point to call people against tariffs “FOOLS!”

For such a plan to take effect, congressional approval would likely be required. Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing $600 in tariff rebates for nearly all Americans and their dependent children.

“Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families' savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would “allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump's tariffs are returning to this country”.

However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration's main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt – not to give rebate checks to Americans.

According to the treasury department's September report, $195bn in tariff duties were collected during the first three quarters of the year.

As of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from the Yale Budget Lab. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers.

This isn't the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. In October, he said that he was considering offering Americans checks from the revenue, worth somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000. In July, the president again suggested that the government might consider tariff rebate checks.

In February, he and tech mogul Elon Musk, who at the time was still advising the White House, said they were considering the idea of a $5,000 “dividend” check based on savings generated by the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge). These payments never came to be as the national deficit actually increased under Doge, and the amount cut from federal spending was significantly exaggerated.

The US supreme court heard arguments on Wednesday on Trump's sweeping global tariffs and appeared skeptical of their legality.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Over 2,500 flights cancelled as transportation secretary says flight reductions could reach 20% if shutdown persists

Flight cancellations and delays are set to grow as airline passengers across the United States spent the weekend grappling with those issues at major airports nationwide after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated a 4% reduction in air traffic in response to the ongoing federal government shutdown.

If the shutdown continues, the FAA has instructed airlines to cut 6% of flights on Tuesday – and to do the same to 10% by 14 November. The transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, has warned that flight reductions could reach 20% if the shutdown persists, and on Sunday he predicted a “substantial” number of people in the US would be unable to celebrate the upcoming holidays with their families if the shutdown wasn't resolved.

“You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,” Duffy said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. “We have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays. They want to see their family … Listen, many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up.”

The FAA's requirement for airlines to cut 4% of daily flights at 40 “high traffic” US airports began Friday and represented an attempt to ease the mounting pressure on air traffic controllers. Like other federal employees, those controllers have not been paid for weeks amid the government shutdown, which has become the longest in history and reached its 40th day.

“We are seeing signs of stress in the system, so we are proactively reducing the number of flights to make sure the American people continue to fly safely,” the FAA administrator, Bryan Bedford, said earlier this week. He also said that between 20% to 40% of controllers had not been showing up for work over the last several days.

The first round of flight reductions led to around 800 cancellations on Friday and 1,460 on Saturday. As of 9am ET Sunday, more than 1,000 flights across the US had been cancelled for the day, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.

On Sunday, Duffy told CNN that the US is “short air traffic controllers” and that he was “trying to get more air traffic controllers into the towers and be certified, but I am about a 1,000 to 2,000 controllers short”.

Airlines were offering full refunds to customers for canceled flights.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has warned that the shutdown was worsening the staffing shortages and said that many controllers “are working 10-hour days and six-day workweeks due to the ongoing staffing shortage, all without pay.

“This situation creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work,” they said. “The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown.”

On Saturday, the union said it had delivered 1,600 handwritten letters from members to Congress calling for the shutdown to end.

As the shutdown drags on, Democratic and Republican lawmakers continued to blame each other for the impasse – and for the flight disruptions.

On Friday, the White House blamed Democrats for the cancellations and delays, saying they “are inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving”.

On Saturday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, accused the Republicans of “playing games” and said that “instead of negotiating with Democrats, Republicans would rather let air-traffic controllers go unpaid, they'd rather ground flights, and they'd rather punish travelers.”

For passengers, uncertainty remained about which flights would be canceled, and analysts warned that the disruption would likely intensify and spread beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.

The moderator of NBC's Meet the Press, Kristen Welker, asked Democratic US House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, if the shutdown would end before Thanksgiving. “I hope so,” Jeffries said.

Asked the same question by Welker, Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said “it absolutely needs to – it needs to open today if we can get it open”.

Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people simply canceled flights altogether.

Some analysts have pointed out that there was the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. There is also the possibility of higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, and further losses, from tourism to manufacturing, that will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues.

Hollywood star Angelina Jolie described how she was forced to wait while a drone flew over her during her recent trip to Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts, where she met families living on the front line of Russia's war. 

""The threat of drones was a constant, heavy presence. You hear a low hum in the sky,"" she wrote on Instagram on Nov. 9. 

""There was a moment when we had to pause and wait while a drone flew overhead. I was in protective gear, and for me, it was just a couple of days. The families here live with this every single day.""

The actress previously visited Ukraine in the spring of 2022, where she met internally displaced people in Lviv.

Jolie traveled with the U.K.-based Legacy of War Foundation to embattled southern Ukraine on Nov. 5. The city of Kherson is just over the river from Russian positions and comes under frequent and heavy shelling, with Russian troops frequently targeting and killing civilians. The actress wrote how Russian troops ""track, hunt, and terrorize"" locals constantly in a ""human safari."" During her visit, she noted how schools, clinics, and daycares were forced to operate underground, and she spoke to locals about the psychological impact of living under constant threats, as well as their fears about being forgotten by the world.

She called on governments to end the conflict and to protect civilians, both in Ukraine and also in Sudan, Gaza, Yemen, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while highlighting the work of several Ukrainian humanitarian organizations helping children, including Ukrainian Gen, Fight for Right, Help Ukraine, and Marsh Zhinok.

""If they can find the strength, governments ought to be able to do the same,"" she wrote.

Reports initially circulated that a Ukrainian man in Jolie's entourage was detained by military enlistment officers and that Jolie visited the recruitment office with the man.

Local media later confirmed that the man, a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue.

Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country.

Russian forces launched 69 drones at Ukraine overnight, with 32 hitting nine locations across the country, Ukraine's Air Force reported.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on a deadly Russian strike that killed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians allegedly during a military ceremony, prompting outrage and an internal investigation into security lapses.



The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has restored access to backup power for the first time in six months after its second power line was repaired, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Nov. 8. 

""The threat of drones was a constant, heavy presence. You hear a low hum in the sky,"" Jolie wrote on Instagram on Nov. 9. 

A thermal power plant in Voronezh, Russia was reportedly attacked overnight on Nov. 9. Residents said they heard explosions and experienced power outages after authorities warned of possible missile and drone threats.

""It is important for discussing the Ukrainian issue and advancing the bilateral agenda,"" Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told RIA Novosti. 

The number includes 970 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Russian forces targeted energy substations that power the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants overnight on Nov. 7-8, amid its large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.

A local power plant was reportedly damaged, causing widespread blackouts in the city of Belgorod and the surrounding region.

The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

When 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux realized an Associated Press photo of him at the Louvre on the day of the crown jewels heist had drawn millions of views, his first instinct was not to rush online and unmask himself.

Quite the opposite. A fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who lives with his parents and grandfather in Rambouillet, 30 kilometres from Paris, Pedro decided to play along with the world's suspense.

As theories swirled about the sharply dressed stranger in the “Fedora Man” shot – detective, insider, AI fake – he decided to stay silent and watch.

“I didn't want to say immediately it was me,” he said. “With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.”

Suspect in Louvre jewel heist has separate trial postponed due to high media profile

Louvre museum heist carried out by petty criminals, not organized crime, prosecutor says

For his only in-person interview since that snap turned him into an international curiosity, he appeared for the AP cameras at his home much as he did that Sunday: in a fedora hat, Yves Saint Laurent waistcoat borrowed from his father, jacket chosen by his mother, neat tie, Tommy Hilfiger trousers and a restored, war-battered Russian watch.

The fedora, angled just so, is his homage to French Resistance hero Jean Moulin.

In person, he is a bright, amused teenager who wandered, by accident, into a global story.

The image that made him famous was meant to document a crime scene. Three police officers lean on a silver car blocking a Louvre entrance, hours after thieves carried out a daylight raid on French crown jewels. To the right, a lone figure in a three-piece ensemble strides past – a flash of film noir in a modern-day manhunt.

The internet did the rest. “Fedora Man,” as users dubbed him, was cast as an old-school detective, an inside man, a Netflix pitch – or not human at all. Many were convinced he was AI-generated.

Pedro understood why. “In the photo, I'm dressed more in the 1940s, and we are in 2025,” he said. “There is a contrast.”

Even some relatives and friends hesitated until they spotted his mother in the background. Only then were they sure: The internet's favourite fake detective was a real boy.

Many thought he was a detective involved in the investigation into the audacious robbery, but the mysterious man turned out to be a 15-year-old fan of fictional detectives Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot.

The Associated Press

The real story was simple. Pedro, his mother and grandfather had come to visit the Louvre.

“We wanted to go to the Louvre, but it was closed,” he said. “We didn't know there was a heist.”

They asked officers why the gates were shut. Seconds later, AP photographer Thibault Camus, documenting the security cordon, caught Pedro midstride.

“When the picture was taken, I didn't know,” Pedro said. “I was just passing through.”

Four days later, an acquaintance messaged: Is that you?

“She told me there were five million views,” he said. “I was a bit surprised.” Then his mother called to say he was in The New York Times. “It's not every day,” he said. Cousins in Colombia, friends in Austria, family friends and classmates followed with screenshots and calls.

“People said, ‘You've become a star,'” he said. “I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.”

The look that jolted tens of millions is not a costume whipped up for a museum trip. Pedro began dressing this way less than a year ago, inspired by 20th-century history and black-and-white images of suited statesmen and fictional detectives.

“I like to be chic,” he said. “I go to school like this.”

In a sea of hoodies and sneakers, he shows up in a riff on a three-piece suit. And the hat? No, that's its own ritual. The fedora is reserved for weekends, holidays and museum visits.

At his no-uniform school, his style has already started to spread. “One of my friends came this week with a tie,” he said.

He understands why people projected a whole sleuth character onto him: improbable heist, improbable detective. He loves Poirot – “very elegant” – and likes the idea that an unusual crime calls for someone who looks unusual. “When something unusual happens, you don't imagine a normal detective,” he said. “You imagine someone different.”

That instinct fits the world he comes from. His mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, grew up in an 18th-century museum-palace, daughter of a curator and an artist – and regularly takes her son to exhibits.

“Art and museums are living spaces,” she said. “Life without art is not life.”

For Pedro, art and imagery were part of everyday life. So when millions projected stories onto a single frame of him in a fedora beside armed police at the Louvre, he recognized the power of an image and let the myth breathe before stepping forward.

He stayed silent for several days, then switched his Instagram from private to public.

“People had to try to find who I am,” he said. “Then journalists came, and I told them my age. They were extremely surprised.”

He is relaxed about whatever comes next. “I'm waiting for people to contact me for films,” he said, grinning. “That would be very funny.”

In a story of theft and security lapses, “Fedora Man” is a gentler counterpoint – a teenager who believes art, style and a good mystery belong to ordinary life. One photo turned him into a symbol. Meeting him confirms he is, reassuringly, real.

“I'm a star,” he says – less brag than experiment, as if he's trying on the words the way he tries on a hat. “I'll keep dressing like this. It's my style.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Ukraine's battle with Russia for Pokrovsk at pivotal point","https://www.dw.com/en/ukraines-battle-with-russia-for-pokrovsk-at-pivotal-point/a-74673910","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:58:37 GMT","

Fierce fighting continues on the streets of Pokrovsk in Donbas. Observers predict that the city will soon fall to Russian troops. What would that mean for the course of the war?

The battle for Pokrovsk has been the subject of military reports for days. For Ukrainian troops, the entrenched fighting on this stretch of the front line is critical.

Twenty-one months after the Russian invasion of Avdiivka, a suburb of Donetsk, Pokrovsk could now be taken by Russian troops as another logistical hub, which would be crucial for control of Ukraine's Donetsk region.

Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Pokrovsk had a population of about 60,000 and was an important industrial and transport node in the Ukrainian-controlled part of Donbas. By the summer of 2025, there were only about 1,500 people left.

Fighting for the city on the border with the Dnipropetrovsk region has been raging for over a year. The conflict recently spread to city streets.

Rob Lee, a senior fellow in the Eurasia Program at the American Foreign Policy Research Institute, told DW that Pokrovsk is a ""big gray area.""

""It is clear that Russian sabotage groups are advancing deep into the city, to the northwest and north,"" Lee said. ""How much of the entire area they control is still unclear."" He said Russia had significantly increased its troop strength in the city over the past week.

According to various estimates, this could involve 200 to 300 or even more soldiers. ""And the more soldiers there are in the city,"" Lee said, ""the more control Russia has over it.""

Marina Miron, an honorary researcher at the Centre for Military Ethics and the Department of Defence Studies at King's College London, told DW that the the main problem for Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk is the Russia's blocking of key logistics. ""Ukrainian troops are being supplied by drones, both aerial and ground drones, because the situation is very dangerous,"" Miron said. ""If you cannot supply the troops or evacuate casualties, it's like a ticking time bomb.""

Markus Reisner, a historian and active colonel in the Austrian Armed Forces, has analyzed the situation on the Ukrainian front since the start of the war. The Ukrainian armed forces have not left the city for several reasons, he said.

Resiner told the German news channel ntv that Ukraine needed to ensure a new line of defense beyond Pokrovsk and Kostyantynivka. He said Ukraine was trying to gain time by halting Russia's advance. Reisner suggested that Pokrovsk has already fallen.

That would have a significant effect on the course of the war. ""Pokrovsk is an important city,"" Lee said. “Russia has not achieved any major successes in significant cities. But the capture of Pokrovsk would be a major success for Russia in 2025. In media terms, the capture of the city by the end of the year would be very important.”

Reisner said Russia had not yet made an offensive breakthrough on the front line — which had been its goal in the summer. Though, he added, Kremlin forces had made significant territorial gains.

If Ukraine were to lose Pokrovsk, military experts say the city would become a central base for Russian troops in the region, as it had been for Ukraine. This would give Russia control of an area with high-rise buildings and dense development, a place where thousands of soldiers could be accommodated. Ukrainian forces, including drone pilots, electronic warfare and reconnaissance units, would have to retreat to forested areas.

Pokrovsk would be the first ""operational-tactical"" l success for the Russian occupiers since the occupation of Avdiivka, Ukrainian military observer Oleksandr Kovalenko told the Reuters news agency. Before that, he said, for over a year, Russia's successes had been mainly tactical in nature. ""Taking into account the amount of losses and time spent, as well as resources - this is a shame for such a large army,"" he said.

Analysts outlined two possible scenarios if Ukrainian forces were forced to evacuate Pokrovsk. Either Vladimir Putin would try to portray this as a victory in Russia in order to agree to negotiations with Ukraine and the West — or the capture of Pokrovsk would make the president determined to launch further offensives. That would mean that other cities in the Donetsk region, such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, could become targets, as well as the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region.

Reisner said Ukraine was attempting to force Russia to the negotiating table by exerting pressure through attacks on strategic targets deep in the Russian hinterland. In addition, Ukraine seeks to persuade the United States to sell long-range Tomahawk missiles to the armed forces.

Ultimately, despite heavy losses, Putin believes that he is on the path to victory, Reisner said.

The White House is poised to revoke the visa of the boss of a campaign group founded by Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.

Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), is facing deportation from the United States, after his charity pushed for restrictions on what can be published online.

The CCDH has campaigned for the deplatforming of Trump administration officials and tighter policing of offensive content posted online. Mr McSweeney helped found the organisation before he quit to work for Sir Keir.

The organisation's demands have raised alarm within Donald Trump's administration.

Mr Ahmed, a former Labour Party aide, has now been placed at the “top of the list” of people being considered for visa restrictions, The Telegraph understands.

The state and justice departments along with the White House are understood to be weighing the decision to restrict Mr Ahmed's visa.

A source with knowledge of the discussions said: “They want to send a message that they're not having it. They're not happy. They are very actively considering visa restrictions on him.”

The move is the latest example of Mr Trump's willingness to clamp down on British nationals complicit in censoring American citizens.

Earlier this year, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, warned that foreign nationals face being banned from the United States if they are found to have breached the free speech rights of American citizens.

The CCDH, which has charitable status in the US, claims to “disrupt the spread of digital hate and misinformation”, with branches in both the UK and the US.

Mr Ahmed, who works in the Washington office, but is understood to run the entire transnational operation, has found himself in the crosshairs of some of the president's closest allies, including Robert F Kennedy Jr and Elon Musk.

In 2021, the group named Mr Kennedy, the current Health Secretary, as one of its “Disinformation Dozen”, a list of 12 people it claimed should have their accounts removed from social media for posting anti‑vaccine content.

Leaked documents, thought to have been drawn up by the CCDH, also reportedly listed “kill Musk's Twitter” as one of the group's annual priorities last year.

The non-profit published a series of highly critical reports linking Mr Musk's takeover of the platform, now known as X, to rising misinformation and hate speech that was “spreading like wildfire”.

Mr Musk, the US president's former efficiency tsar, later sued the company, but the claim was thrown out by a judge.

The tech billionaire subsequently claimed the CCDH was violating laws against foreign interference in US elections. 

“Due to visa record confidentiality, we have no comment on department actions with respect to specific visa cases,” a state department spokesman told The Telegraph.

“We refer you to DHS for questions regarding travel to the United States under the visa waiver programme.”

The move is part of an American campaign to “step up pressure” on Britain's Online Safety Act. The law, which regulates online speech, allows the UK Government to levy massive fines on US companies such as Apple, Truth Social, and X if it finds that rules on hate speech have been broken.

Those in the president's inner circle see the potential penalties as an unwarranted foreign intervention into American free speech.

Since the law came into effect this year, Ofcom, the UK's online regulator, has written to several US firms ordering them to conform to the act.

It has sparked outrage from Congressmen and legal experts in the US, who say the overreach is a threat by the UK to silence America's companies and citizens if they refuse to comply with the British Government's view of what is acceptable to post online.

“The one thing everyone [in the Trump administration] agrees on is the need to dramatically pressure the UK over the Online Safety Act,” the source said.

The decision to revoke Mr Ahemd's visa would not be without precedent.

British self-proclaimed journalist Sami Hamdi is facing deportation from the US in the wake of being arrested and having his visa revoked, after allegedly praising the Oct 7 massacre.

British rap duo Bob Vylan were also banned from the States after the group's frontman called for the death of all Israeli soldiers during a performance a this year's Glastonbury festival.

In May, The Telegraph revealed how the president sent US officials to meet British pro-life activists over concerns their right to protest was being stifled.

The diplomats, from the bureau of democracy, human rights and labor (DRL) travelled to London in March in an effort to “affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe”.

Led by Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the state department, they met with officials from the Foreign Office and challenged Ofcom over the Online Safety Act.

Since then, the Trump administration has also raised questions about the conviction and sentencing of several high-profile cases, including that of Lucy Connolly.

Ms Connolly was jailed over a social media post she made expressing her outrage hours after Axel Rudakubana murdered three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport.

Imran Ahmed was contacted for comment.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas two years ago, high school teacher Josh Hirsch posted comments on social media in support of Israel. It was unrealistic for Hamas to expect a ceasefire, he wrote, as long as they were holding hostages.

Soon afterward, a former student called for his firing. A note taped outside the door of his Adams County, Colorado, classroom contained his wife's name and their home address. And a sticker that appeared on his chair read: “Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.” 

The reaction startled Hirsch, the only Jewish teacher in his school building. For the first time in his 14-year career, he considered quitting. He stayed and joined an educators' advocacy network created by the Anti-Defamation League, a way he saw to make schools more inclusive of diverse viewpoints.

“I've been a teacher and tried to keep my focus on being the best teacher I could,” he said.

Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war have spilled into schools around the U.S., with advocates reporting a rise in antisemitic harassment since the 2023 surprise attack on Israel. While some argue school leaders have failed to take the threat seriously, others warn criticism of Israel and the military campaign in Gaza are interpreted too often as hate speech.

The Trump administration has not punished school systems the way it has hit colleges accused of tolerating antisemitism, but schools are still facing pressure to respond more aggressively. Several states have pressed for new vigilance, including legislation that critics say would stifle free speech.

Lawmakers in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee have passed measures to increase school accountability for complaints of antisemitism, and a law signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, will provide training to identify and prevent antisemitism in schools. In Arizona, the Democratic governor vetoed a bill on how to deal with reports of antisemitism in schools, calling it an attack on educators. 

Many of the measures, including one signed by Oklahoma's Republican governor, call for adoption of a definition of antisemitism that casts certain criticism of Israel as hate speech.

“These bills make it clear that Oklahoma stands with our Jewish communities and will not tolerate hatred disguised as political discourse,” said Kristen Thompson, a Republican state senator in Oklahoma who authored the legislation.

Dozens of states have adopted the definition promoted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which is also recognized by the U.S. State Department. It lists 11 examples of antisemitic conduct, such as applying “double standards” to Israel or comparing the country's policies to Nazism.

While supporters of this definition of antisemitism say it is necessary to combat evolving forms of Jewish hate, civil liberties groups warn it suppresses pro-Palestinian speech. 

The Trump administration has leveraged antisemitism investigations in its efforts to reshape higher education, suspending billions of dollars in federal funding to Harvard, Columbia and other universities over allegations they tolerated hate speech, especially during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.

The White House has not gotten as involved at the K-12 level. At congressional hearings, House Republicans have taken some large school systems to task over their handling of antisemitism, but the administration largely has left it to the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to address complaints. 

In one of the cases under investigation, a complaint described students at the Berkeley Unified School District in California asking Jewish classmates what “their number is,” referring to numbers tattooed on Jews during the Holocaust. It also said teachers made antisemitic comments and led walkouts that praised Hamas.

The district did not respond to a request for comment.

In another California case, the family of a 14-year-old girl filed a federal lawsuit last year alleging she had to leave University Preparatory Academy, a charter school in San Jose, in 2023 because of antisemitic bullying. After the Hamas attack, she said students called her names, including “terrorist.” The California Department of Education and the school said they could not comment on pending litigation.

Nationwide, the ADL recorded 860 antisemitic incidents in non-Jewish schools last year, ranging from name-calling and swastikas etched on lockers to antisemitic materials being taught in classrooms. The number was down from over 1,100 recorded in 2023, but well above numbers in prior years, according to the ADL.

A Massachusetts state commission formed last year to combat antisemitism found it was a “pervasive and escalating problem” in schools. 

At one meeting, a commission co-chair, Democratic state Rep. Simon Cataldo, said the Massachusetts Teachers Association was sharing antisemitic resources with teachers, including a kindergarten workbook that describes Zionists as “bullies” and an image of a Star of David made of dollar bills. The union said those were singled out among hundreds of images in art and posters about Palestinians, and links to those materials were removed.

The union said it has engaged in efforts to confront increases in both antisemitism and Islamophobia and accused the commission of “offensive political theater.” 

“Those who manipulate antisemitism to achieve political objectives — such as undermining labor unions and public educators — are following the lead of the Trump administration,” the union said in a statement.

Margaret Litvin, an associate professor of Arabic and comparative literature at Boston University, said the commission was “deliberately conflating criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jews and bias against Jews.” That approach will be used to justify “heavy-handed” interference by the state in school district affairs, said Litvin, co-founder of the Boston-area Concerned Jewish Faculty and Staff group.

The tension reached the National Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union, which this summer weighed a proposal to drop ADL classroom materials that educators use to teach about the Holocaust and bias. Backers said the ADL had an outsize influence on school curricula and policy, with an underlying pro-Israel viewpoint.

Delegates at the union's representative assembly narrowly voted to approve the proposal, but they were overruled by the NEA board of directors. Union President Becky Pringle said the proposal “would not further NEA's commitment to academic freedom, our membership, or our goals.”

In the aftermath, the ADL invited K-12 educators to join a new network called BEACON: Building Educator Allies for Change, Openness, and Networks, which it said is intended to help educators learn from each other how to address and combat antisemitism and other forms of hate.

Hirsch, the teacher in Colorado, was among hundreds who expressed interest. 

Some of the blowback he faced stemmed from his online commentary about local activist organizations. After donating money to Black Lives Matter groups and supporting them with a sign in his yard, he expressed feelings of betrayal to see the groups expressing support for Palestinians and not Israel.

He said he was surprised by the reaction to the posts in his predominantly Hispanic school community. A former debate coach, he aims through his work with the ADL network to help students share their opinions in constructive ways.

“If we're giving them the opportunity to hate and we're giving them the opportunity to make enemies of someone, it really is counterproductive to what we're trying to do as a society,” he said.

Nov. 11, 1975, after the raft was plucked from Whitefish Bay by the freighter Roger Blough, a ship assisting in the search for the missing Edmund Fitzgerald, which sunk on Nov. 10, 1975, in Lake Superior. (AP photo/JCH, file)












LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Associated Press reporter Harry Atkins was far from Lake Superior on Nov. 10, 1975, “when the gales of November came early.” But his news coverage the following day of the infamous wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald helped shape its legacy. 

Atkins, now 86, was a news reporter in Detroit when he was sent to Michigan's Upper Peninsula to write about the Fitzgerald. The freighter was transporting iron ore from Wisconsin to Zug Island in Detroit when it encountered a terrifying storm. All 29 men aboard died, and the exact cause of the wreck remains a mystery.

The Fitzgerald was the last major shipwreck on the Great Lakes, thanks to technology improvements in the years after the disaster. The wreck also became the most famous of the region thanks to Gordon Lightfoot's eerie folk ballad that has kept it in public memory. 

Lightfoot wrote the ode to the Fitzgerald after reading Atkins' story about the wreck and a Nov. 24, 1975, article in Newsweek magazine. The song was released less than a year after the disaster in August 1976.

Family members and maritime devotees will gather Monday to honor the 50th anniversary of the wreck. Ahead of the anniversary, Atkins recounted what he saw that fateful day in a recent interview with AP, his former employer. 




Atkins, who now resides in Savannah, Georgia, said he was working on the AP Detroit broadcast desk when the bureau heard something was wrong. A Whitefish Bay resident that Atkins described as an “old hermit” was listening to radio communications from ships on the water and called radio stations to relay what he heard. 

“He could figure out that the Fitzgerald was not doing well,” Atkins said.

The last message ever heard from the Fitzgerald was sent to the Arthur Anderson, a vessel nearby. “We are holding our own,” the Fitzgerald's captain said. 

Atkins said he worked up a quick story about how the ship was in trouble and then drove overnight to Sault Ste. Marie, about 347 miles (559 kilometers) north of Detroit. He set up shop at the Sault Ste. Marie Evening News, a newspaper that had relayed the message from the radio eavesdropper to Detroit. 

“I got the Yellow Pages,” Atkins said, “and started looking for an airplane.”

Atkins said he found a retired Navy pilot with a four-seat aircraft “with the wings above the cockpit instead of below,” to fly him and a photographer out over nearby Whitefish Bay. When they arrived at the Canadian side of the lake, Atkins said he could see two two freighters, two Coast Guard boats and one other vessel pointed at each other “like the Chrysler star.” 

“So we had to figure the Fitzgerald's down there in the middle of where all those boats were pointed,” Atkins recounted. 

From the skies, Atkins said, he saw a lifeboat and vest. But no bodies of the crew were ever recovered. 

To this day the Fitzgerald remains beneath 535 feet (165 meters) of water, about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north-northwest of Whitefish Point, Michigan. The wreck is protected as a gravesite under Canadian law.

Once on land, Atkins called his colleagues in Detroit to relay his draft that spread the news. He wrote in his “lede,” the first paragraph of his story: “Rescuers searched Lake Superior's chilly waters Tuesday for the 29-member crew of the sunken ore-carrier Edmund Fitzgerald but found only an oil slick, empty lifeboats and life jackets.”

Atkins went on to be a longtime sports journalist for the AP in Michigan. He heard Lightfoot's song from time to time. 

“It's a haunting ballad,” Atkins said, his voice thick with emotion. “I get choked up every time.” 

But he didn't realize just how infamous the disaster was until 25 years later, when he first saw news coverage of the anniversary.

“To think that 29 guys were alive yesterday and dead today,” Atkins said. “I cared a lot about what I was writing.”

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Cyndi Lauper turned “True Colors” into a defiant call for courage and the music of Outkast, Soundgarden and the White Stripes brought waves of emotion Saturday night at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.

Partway through the song, Lauper shouted the line “don't be afraid!,” thrust her fist in the air and kept it there as the music stopped for a long and dramatic stretch.

She was then joined by Raye to sing “Time After Time” and Avril Lavigne for “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” backed by an all-female band that included Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. As Lauper called for the ladies to sing with her, Salt-N-Pepa — who earlier in the night donned their old tri-color jackets to rock the crowd with “Push It” for their induction — came dancing out and joined her.

Chappell Roan, who inducted Lauper while wearing a huge, ornamented, showgirl-style headpiece, said Lauper redefined what a pop star could look like, sound like, sing like.”

Lauper looked at Roan during her speech when she said, “I know that I stand on the shoulders of the women in the industry that came before me. And my shoulders are broad enough to have the women that came after me stand on mine.” 

Lauper came back for an all-star jam and sang a verse of inductee Joe Cocker's “With a Little Help From My Friends” along with Teddy Swims, Bryan Adams and Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes. Cocker's was one of several posthumous inductions, including a moving tribute to late Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell.




The power of women in music was called out loudly earlier in the evening at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles during the induction of Salt-N-Pepa. 

“This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her she couldn't,” Cheryl “Salt” James said in a rousing speech accepting her, Sandra “Pepa” Denton and DJ Spinderella's entrance into the hall.

James brought up their fight to reclaim their master recordings from Universal Music Group.

“The industry still doesn't want to play fair, Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight,” James said.

They took the stage for a medley of their hits, opening with “Shoop” then sliding into “Let's Talk About Sex” before En Vogue joined them for their joint hit “What a Man.”

James apologized to the fans who “got in trouble for cutting their hair like us,” a line that reverberated later when Roan said that Lauper showed you could “have whatever hair color you want.” 

Outkast didn't perform together for the first time since 2016 as some had hoped, but the duo stood together on stage, surrounded by a crew of friends and cohorts as they gave grateful speeches after doing rock-paper-scissors to decide who would go first.

Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech — “I'm freestylin' y'all!” — that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement “dungeon” in Atlanta in the early 1990s.

He choked out the words, “Great things start in little rooms.”

Andre sat out the performance but Big Boi, wearing shorts and a fur coat, started off an express tour through the Atlanta duo's discography that included Tyler the Creator, JID and Killer Mike.

Janelle Monáe joined them to shake her way through “Hey Ya” and Doja Cat delivered a sly and soulful take on “Ms. Jackson.”

Emotions ran deep during Soundgarden's segment of the night, starting with the induction speech of Jim Carrey, the actor and Soundgarden superfan who seemed to be fighting off tears throughout as he talked about Cornell, who died from suicide in 2017.

“When you looked into his eyes, it's like eternity was staring back,” Carrey said. “For all time, his voice will continue to light up the ether like a Tesla coil.”

Each of his band mates, all major godfathers of the Seattle grunge scene, paid their own tearful tributes.

One of Cornell's daughters, Lilian, spoke while another, Toni, sang a quiet rendition of his song “Fell on Black Days.”

“I am just really, really happy that he got to make music with his friends,” Lilian Cornell said.

Taylor Momsen, who co-starred as a child with Carrey in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” and Brandi Carlile showed serious vocal power with their versions of Cornell's mighty wail, backed by his band mates on “Rusty Cage” and “Black Hole Sun.”

Bassist Hiro Yamamoto was among the few who brought up the politics from the stage.

“Thanks to my parents, whose story is American citizens who are rounded up and placed into prison camps just for being Japanese during World War II,” Yamamoto said to some of the biggest cheers of the night. “Well that affected my life greatly, and it really echoes strongly today. Let's not add another story like this to our history.” 

The White Stripes reunion that some fans had also hoped for didn't happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway. Twenty One Pilots brought the house down with a version of the duo's stadium-shaking anthem “Seven Nation Army” and Olivia Rodrigo and Feist delivered an acoustic version of “We're Gonna Be Friends.” 

Their fellow Detroit rock legend Iggy Pop began his induction speech by leading the crowd in a chorus of “Seven Nation Army” then remembered his thoughts on meeting them. 

“Cute kids, they're gonna go places,” Pop said. “And they did.”

Drummer Meg White, who has led an almost entirely private life since the band broke up in 2011, did not show up for the ceremony, but Jack White said Meg, his ex-wife, helped him write the speech he delivered while wearing the band's signature red and white.

Jack White shouted out several great duos from across culture and said that kind of one-on-one collaboration is “the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist and musician.”

He nearly cried several times as he told an Adam-and-Eve-like tale of “the boy and the girl” who made magic together.

Stevie Wonder led a funky and flashy tribute to the late Sly Stone to open the show that streamed live on Disney+. An edited version airs on ABC on Jan 1.

Wonder was joined by Questlove, Leon Thomas, Maxwell, Beck, Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers for renditions of Sly and the Family Stone hits “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People” and “Thank You.” Jennifer Hudson joined them to wail through “Higher.”

Stone, who was inducted into the hall in 1993, died in June. Brian Wilson, who died two days later, got his own tribute from Elton John, who took the stage late in the show to sing the Beach Boys' “God Only Knows.”

Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac inducted Bad Company, calling the British group founded by Paul Rodgers and Mick Ralphs in 1973 “classic rock legends.”

Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member on the stage. He was joined by an ad hoc super group that included Robinson and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson, who blasted through “Feel Like Makin' Love” and “Can't Get Enough.”

The late singer-songwriter Warren Zevon was inducted by David Letterman, a friend and superfan who made Zevon a regular on his NBC late-night show, including an appearance when Zevon was dying of cancer in 2002. 

“Warren Zevon is in my Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,” Letterman said. “Actually his own wing.”

Other inductees who got video tributes in the theater were Chubby Checker, session bassist Carole Kaye, session piano man Nicky Hopkins and record producer and executive Lenny Waronker.

BEIRUT (AP) — Two decades ago, Ahmad al-Sharaa was held in a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq after joining al-Qaida militants fighting against American forces there.

Few would have predicted that he would go on to become the first Syrian president to visit Washington since the country's independence in 1946.

Since rebel forces he led ousted former Syrian President Bashar Assad last December, al-Sharaa — who cut ties with al-Qaida years earlier — has gone on a largely successful charm offensive to establish new ties with countries that had shunned Assad's government after its brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011 spiraled into a 14-year civil war.

Al-Sharaa met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Saudi Arabia in May, where Trump announced that he would lift decades of sanctions.

The two men will meet again on Monday in Washington, where Syria is widely expected to officially join the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State group. Al-Sharaa arrived in the U.S. on Saturday ahead of the meeting, according to Syrian state media.

Apart from that agreement, al-Sharaa will use the visit to push for a full removal of the remaining sanctions imposed on his country.

Al-Sharaa's media adviser, Ahmad Zeidan, told the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV that the “foremost” issue on the president's agenda in Washington is to call for a repeal of the Caesar Act, which imposed sweeping sanctions over human rights abuses by Assad's government and security forces.

The Caesar sanctions are currently waived by presidential order, but a permanent repeal will require a congressional vote. 

Days ahead of al-Sharaa's visit, Trump told reporters that he had moved to lift sanctions from Syria “to give them a fighting shot, and I think (al-Sharaa's) doing a very good job so far.”

“It's a tough neighborhood and he's a tough guy, but I got along with him very well, and a lot of progress has been made with Syria,” he said.

On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council voted to lift sanctions from al-Sharaa and his interior minister, and the U.S. then removed them from its “specially designated global terrorist” list.

Meanwhile, senators have advanced a repeal of the Caesar Act through an annual defense authorization bill, but the final legislation is being negotiated with the House, where some top Republicans want to put conditions on it.

Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has expressed reservations about a full repeal. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is close to Trump, has also pushed for conditions on the repeal, including security and representation for religious and ethnic minorities, “maintaining peaceful relations with other states in the region, including the State of Israel,” and removing foreign fighters from government and security institutions.

Skeptics of al-Sharaa point to eruptions of sectarian violence over the past year during which pro-government Sunni gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze religious minorities. Al-Sharaa has promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but minority communities remain wary.

The advocacy group Save the Persecuted Christians sent a letter signed by 100 U.S. religious leaders calling on Trump to address the “massacre” of minorities in Syria and to push al-Sharaa to open a humanitarian corridor from the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights to the Druze enclave of Sweida in southern Syria.

Since Assad's fall, Israel has seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and pushed for a demilitarized zone south of Damascus. The two countries, which do not have diplomatic relations, have been negotiating a potential security agreement.

Meanwhile, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, has led the effort for a full Caesar repeal. Shaheen said that “we have a real opportunity in the Middle East right now that we haven't had in my lifetime.”

Advocates say it is unfair to keep sanctions that were specifically imposed on Assad's government as leverage over the new authorities and that the threat of a Caesar snapback would prevent international companies from investing in rebuilding the war-battered country.

Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, which lobbied for the imposition of the Caesar sanctions but is now trying to get them removed, said the U.S. government can impose new targeted sanctions if warranted.

“But to use Caesar for that is like using a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel — you're going to kill the person you're operating on,” Moustafa said. 

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said last week that Syria will “hopefully” soon join the coalition of some 80 countries working to prevent a resurgence of IS.

A Trump administration official said Al-Sharaa is expected to sign an agreement to join the coalition during his visit. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to comment when asked about the possibility.

Another U.S. official with knowledge of the situation said that while Syrian forces had already been fighting IS, their formal entry into the coalition will be a “milestone” and will enable U.S. forces to work more closely with the Syrians.

Both officials were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Syrian officials declined to comment on the discussions about joining the coalition.

While the Islamic State lost hold of all of the territory it once held in Syria and Iraq years ago, cells of the extremist group have continued to carry out attacks in both countries and abroad.

Lt. Cmdr. Emily Pumphrey, a spokesperson for U.S. Central Command, said there have been 311 IS attacks in Syria and 64 in Iraq so far this year, down from 878 in Syria and 160 in Iraq in 2024.

Before Assad's fall, al-Sharaa — then known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani — led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamic insurgent group controlling much of northwestern Syria. It was formerly an offshoot of al-Qaida but later split from it. HTS and IS were rivals, and al-Sharaa cracked down on Islamic State cells in the area he controlled.

The main U.S. partner in the fight against IS at the time was the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country's northeast.

Since al-Sharaa took power, the U.S. military has expanded its cooperation with Damascus and Washington has pushed for a deal to merge the SDF and the new Syrian army. 

While Damascus and the SDF have agreed in principle to do so, implementation has stalled amid tensions that have sometimes escalated into clashes between the two sides.

The biggest winner in Week 11 of college football didn't touch the field this week. Despite being idle, Georgia Tech is set to reclaim the Atlantic Coast Conference lead after losses by No. 12 Virginia and No. 14 Louisville.

The action continued in the Big 12, as No. 8 BYU at No. 9 Texas Tech squared off in a showdown between the conference's top two contenders. Texas Tech came out on top and is set to leapfrog the Cougars in the rankings, taking sole possession of the conference.

No. 2 Indiana narrowly avoided its first loss of the season and a potentially significant drop in the rankings in a last-minute thriller against Penn State. Fernando Mendoza found Omar Cooper Jr. in the end zone with 36 seconds remaining, carrying Indiana to the 27-24 win.

Iowa played No. 6 Oregon tough, but the Hawkeyes fell just short in the final moments as the Ducks kicked a game-winning field goal. The 18-16 loss marks Iowa's third of the season and jeopardizes its playoff path.



– Texas Tech handed BYU its first loss of the season on Saturday, defeating the Cougars with a convincing 29-7 win. The Red Raiders rank directly below BYU in the AP Top 25 and College Football Playoff rankings and are poised to move up.

— The rankings could shift in No. 18 Miami's favor after the Hurricanes' 38-10 rout of Syracuse on Saturday. 

— No. 16 Georgia Tech could capitalize on the losses by Virginia and Louisville to return to the highest ranking in the ACC.








– BYU will drop after a loss in what was the first top-10 matchup for a Big 12 conference game since 2021.

— No. 19 Missouri lost 38-17 to No. 3 Texas A&M. The Tigers trailed in all four quarters and were outplayed on both sides of the ball in their first outing after quarterback Beau Pribula's season-ending injury. It marks Missouri's third loss this season.

– No. 22 Memphis lost 38-32 to unranked Tulane on Friday night. Memphis trailed for the majority of the game, tying it twice in the first quarter and early in the second. The Tigers scored 15 straight points in the fourth quarter, but Tulane held them off for the win.

— No. 14 Louisville lost in a 29-26 overtime thriller to California. The Cardinals tied it in the fourth quarter, but settling for a field goal in overtime wasn't enough as California answered back with a touchdown to win it. 

— No. 24 Washington's stint in the AP Top 25 will be short-lived after a 13-10 loss to Wisconsin. The Huskies cracked the rankings last week despite being idle. 

— No. 12 Virginia failed to find the end zone in a 16-9 loss to Wake Forest. The Cavaliers lost quarterback Chandler Morris early in the game to an injury from a hard hit and couldn't get momentum rolling offensively under quarterback Daniel Kaelin. 



— James Madison is two spots out of the AP Top 25, and a 35-23 win against Marshall, paired with a Memphis loss to Tulane, could be enough to crack the rankings. It was a solid performance for a Dukes' team that believes it's worthy of consideration for the CFP's Group of Five spot.





— Iowa nearly pulled off the upset against No. 6 Oregon, taking the lead with 6:45 remaining in the fourth quarter. Oregon answered with a game-winning field goal with three seconds on the clock, solidifying the 18-16 victory. Iowa came in at No. 20 in the initial College Football Playoff rankings.

Illegal gold mining is growing in the West African nation of Ghana, one of the world's top gold producers. But the government and environmental groups say the mining is contaminating rivers and other bodies.

JEMA, Ghana (AP) — As day broke in a remote part of western Ghana, a priest, farmers and other residents combed through the forests, looking for signs of illegal gold mining.

They have done this for the past year as part of a grassroots task force created to combat the mining that has poisoned rivers in one of the world's largest gold producing countries.

The group is also driven by the sight of Ghana's unemployed youth being attracted to illegal mining and the elusive promise of quick wealth. Meanwhile, the economy suffers: Ghana has lost $11.4 billion in the last five years to gold smuggling, the development nonprofit Swissaid said this year.

The task force's 14 members call themselves the Jema Anti-Galamsey Advocacy, and their arrests of suspected illegal miners have sparked debate in Ghana's Western North region over their potential abuse of power.

Members point to the 450-square-kilometer (173-square-mile) Jema area's relatively clean water bodies as evidence that their approach can be effective.



Rampant illegal mining, or galamsey — local shorthand for “gather and sell” — is a growing concern in this West African nation, Africa's top gold producer.




Ghana's once-promising economy collapsed under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation hit a 21-year high of over 50%. Nearly 39% of youth are unemployed, according to government data, pushing thousands into illegal mining.

The illegal mining has contaminated significant portions of Ghana's water bodies with cyanide and mercury, according to government authorities and environmental groups.

As of January 2024, illegal miners were present in 44 of the country's 288 forest reserves, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources data show. It said nine of them were “completely taken by armed thugs.”





Since 2015, the Jema community of about 15,000 people has banned all mining on its land, empowered by a law that grants local chiefs powers to make and enforce customary law. Chiefs and the heads of clans and families serve as land custodians.

The new task force usually patrols water bodies and the Jema Forest Reserve, wielding sticks in place of guns, at least once a week, watching for changes in water color as a sign of mining activity upstream and for new clearings in the forests.

When it receives a tip-off from villagers, it arrests the suspects and hands them over to the district police office. Such arrests are allowed by laws that grant powers to citizens to make arrests in certain cases.

So far, the group has arrested two Nigerien nationals caught attempting to mine gold in the forest. The court case has proceeded slowly, and villagers seek the establishment of special courts to try illegal miners.

Task force members say they are filling a void left by a lack of government enforcement.

“All our water bodies that take their source here are clean because of our strong resistance to galamsey,” said Joseph Blay, a Catholic priest and Jema resident who helped to form the task force.

“If we stop fighting, we will lose everything,” he said.

Another member, Patrick Fome, said the local Ehole River was starting to turn a milky brown color, a sign that illegal miners appeared to be working upstream. 

“We cannot go there now without adequate preparation,” Fome said, calling their unarmed patrol work dangerous. ”We sometimes receive death threats.”



A year ago, Ghana saw nationwide protests against illegal mining. Thousands took to the streets to demand a government crackdown.

President John Mahama, who took office in January, has inaugurated a national task force to combat the practice. But he has rejected calls for a state of emergency, which would grant more powers to police and the military to tackle the issue, saying his government has not exhausted all other approaches.

The government's inability to crack down on illegal mining points to a lack of political will, said Daryl Bosu, deputy national director for the A Rocha Ghana conservation nonprofit.

While the Jema task force could have its benefits, operating without the supervision of security forces could lead to human rights abuses by its members, said Festus Kofi Aubyn, a regional coordinator with the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding, a civil society group.

“If the task force is not properly regulated by the state, it could have dangerous consequences, including ethnic targeting or stereotyping,” he said.





Some Jema residents said they don't support the task force because they want to work with the illegal miners for financial gain.

One 27-year-old resident said he was willing to sell his land to the miners, citing the lack of profit in farming. Fertilizer prices have tripled since 2022. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Local leaders acknowledged that declining farming income and limited job opportunities could create divisions and weaken community enforcement of the mining ban. Residents called for investment in other work to make illegal mining less attractive.

Blay, the priest, proposed turning the Jema Forest Reserve into a tourism park to create sustainable jobs.

“And if the government is really serious to fight, we can use the Jema template to also diffuse it in other communities,” he said.

Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, explains how the Trump administration's agreements with third-party countries for deportations play a ""vital"" role in U.S. national security.

President Donald Trump's administration called on a federal judge to approve the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia on Friday, arguing all legal hurdles had been cleared.

The Friday filing is the latest in the administration's efforts to deport Abrego Garcia a second time following his return from El Salvador earlier this year. The Justice Department called on U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis to clear the deportation, saying Abrego Garcia had failed to establish that he would face persecution in Liberia.

""Petitioner's claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,"" the DOJ argued. ""This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.""

Attorneys for the U.S. also said Liberia has made ""sufficient and credible"" arguments that Abrego Garcia will not face harm.

Nevertheless, lawyers for Abrego Garcia argue that he has not received sufficient due process to justify his deportation.

""The Government insists that the unreasoned determination of a single immigration officer—who concluded that Abrego Garcia failed to establish that it is 'more likely than not' that he will be persecuted or tortured in Liberia— satisfies due process. It does not,"" his attorneys wrote in their own Friday filing.

His attorneys further argue that Abrego Garcia is the victim of retaliatory prosecution, noting that Costa Rica has already offered to accept his deportation flight on a refugee status. The U.S. said it would not send him to Costa Rica unless he agreed to plead guilty to human trafficking charges.

""The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,"" the attorneys argued.

Earlier in the case, Abrego Garcia's attorneys cited more than 20 countries he allegedly fears would persecute or torture him if he were removed there. Liberia was not among those listed.

""Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States' closest partners on the African continent,"" the DOJ argued in October.

Criminal justice expert Michael Rushford breaks down how a felon's recent gun-related arrest is intensifying questions about leniency and public safety.

A Nebraska felon whose prison sentence was reduced under a Biden administration clemency initiative is accused of possessing a gun linked to multiple crimes, intensifying scrutiny over whether reform efforts have come at the expense of public safety.

Federal prosecutors say 31-year-old Khyre Holbert, who had served roughly seven years of a 20-year federal sentence for gun and narcotics offenses, was arrested after an Oct. 4 shooting in Omaha's Old Market district.

Investigators allege Holbert discarded a loaded handgun fitted with a high-capacity magazine as officers closed in, a weapon later tied to several other violent crimes across Nebraska.

Holbert's sentence had been commuted in January 2025 despite objections from the U.S. Attorney's Office, which warned of his gang ties, long criminal record and prior weapons convictions. Months later, he's accused of reoffending and his case has thrust former President Joe Biden's clemency program back into the national spotlight.

Law enforcement groups have echoed that concern. The Omaha Police Officers Association blasted the decision to release Holbert, calling him ""no stranger to the law,"" while Attorney General Pamela Bondi described the case as ""a failure to hold criminals accountable.""

For Michael Rushford, founder and president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, Holbert's arrest is more than a tragedy. It's a warning.

""I don't think you can delegate clemency,"" Rushford told Fox News Digital. ""It was never intended that a president delegate that authority. I think what we saw were clemencies being granted without the president's direct knowledge. Why would he sign off on 31 drug dealers? Why would you sign off on a murderer?""

Rushford said cases like Holbert's reflect a failure in judgment and vetting during Biden's final year in office.

""With drug traffickers, especially those already convicted, this isn't their first party. It's hard to get into federal prison,"" he said. ""When you let one go, you have to realize he's going to go out and commit more crimes. The likelihood is very high. That doesn't make sense to me.""

He questioned whether Biden's Justice Department properly reviewed who was being released.

""You have to look and see if there was a real injustice in the case,"" Rushford said. ""With the Biden administration, I'm not sure that was done. The Justice Department under him was not really interested in fighting crime.""

The concern extends beyond Nebraska. In March 2025, authorities in Alabama arrested Willie Frank Peterson, another Biden clemency recipient, on new drug- and gun-related charges, just months after his release.

According to a federal complaint, Peterson, who had served more than a decade of a 20-year sentence, was caught with cocaine, meth and a loaded handgun. His sentence was also commuted in Biden's Jan. 17, 2025 clemency wave, which freed 2,490 inmates, mostly for drug and gun offenses, according to the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney.

Rushford said that by the time offenders reach federal prison, most have already exhausted their ""second chances.""

BIDEN'S AUTO-PEN PARDONS DISTURBED DOJ BRASS, DOCS SHOW, RAISING QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY BINDING

""It's hard to get into federal prison,"" he explained. ""You don't just commit one crime and go, unless it's murder. Second chances have been overblown. By the time you get somebody who's got three or four convictions, the second chances are over.""

He said clemency should be narrowly used to correct genuine injustices and not as a political gesture.

""It's got to be a very specific process evaluating who's in there,"" Rushford said. ""If there was an injustice, fine. But it shouldn't be for political allies or people who gave you money. And I think that was happening under Biden.""

""The people approving these releases,"" he added, ""weren't interested in protecting the public from criminals.""

Rushford said he expects the current administration to restore integrity to the clemency process.

""I don't see the kind of straight criminals being let loose like Biden had done,"" he said. ""I hope the Trump Justice Department raises the integrity level and makes sure we're not letting out hardened criminals and drug traffickers.""

""The president we have now knows what's going on,"" Rushford added. ""He has a Justice Department that's very engaged in fighting crime and reducing drug trafficking. It's a different regime making those decisions.""

Beyond clemency, Rushford blames a broader political climate that he says favors offenders over victims.

""The defund-the-police movement was an admission that they didn't want to protect the public – that their sympathies were with criminals,"" he said. ""There's a large segment of the political environment that doesn't agree criminals belong in prison.""

Rushford added that some major cities still have mayors and governors that think counselors will solve the problem.

""We still have mayors and governors in big cities that think we should send counselors to talk to criminals who are beating their wives with a broom handle — and that's ridiculous,"" he said. ""You need police officers to go in there and take that guy out and arrest him.""

Rushford said that attitude, combined with policies allowing repeat offenders back onto the streets, has eroded public trust and endangered communities.

Rushford believes real reform only comes after tragedy.

""The last time around, one of the big triggers was Polly Klaas,"" he said. ""When they found the repeat offender who kidnapped and killed her, everybody said, ‘We've got to stop this.' I hate to say this, but I think it's going to be one of those horrible cases before the country wakes up.""

The 1993 murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, kidnapped from a sleepover in Petaluma, California, by a repeat offender, led to California's ""three-strikes"" law and remains one of the state's most infamous cases.

Rushford also cited recent tragedies involving repeat offenders, including Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old UCLA graduate student fatally stabbed while working in a Hancock Park furniture store by a man with a lengthy record, and Iryna Zarutska, a woman who was murdered on a North Carolina train, allegedly by an ex-convict with a lengthy criminal history.

Rushford said these cases show ""what happens when repeat offenders keep getting another chance.""

He believes the tide is turning but says it won't happen fast.

""It didn't come this way overnight, and it's going to take a while to get rid of it,"" Rushford said. ""People who are victimized by these repeat offenders, they're not going to be comforted by the fact that in 20 years, we're going to get this straightened out.""

With two clemency recipients, in Nebraska and Alabama, now back in custody, Rushford said the question isn't whether mercy has a place in justice, but whether the system can survive when mercy replaces accountability.

""Second chances sound good,"" Rushford said. ""But you have to earn them. You don't just get them because a politician wants to look compassionate.""

McConaughey has long been considered one of Hollywood's most handsome leading men and was named People's Sexiest Man Alive in 2005.

A year later, he was photographed exercising shirtless on the beach — proving exactly why he earned the title, which he insists never expires.

""People tell me, 'You're no longer the Sexiest Man Alive, McConaughey,' for the last 19 years, every time someone else has been crowned. And I say, 'Well, I'm still alive. Come on!'"" he told People in April 2024. ""If you're named it, and you're still alive, you're still Sexiest Man Alive. That was my joke going forward with everything.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump bemoans lack of unilateral tariff authority as ‘NOT' what founders had in mind","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3880390/trump-tariff-power-founders-supreme-court/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:54:56 GMT","

President Donald Trump on Sunday railed against arguments that his sweeping global tariffs lacked a constitutional legal basis. 

In April, Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact “Liberation Day” tariffs against a host of countries. The move was swiftly challenged in court, with the Supreme Court now considering whether Trump must have congressional signoff for such tariffs, or if the president was within his lane when he unilaterally invoked IEPPA to trigger the tariffs. 

Trump issued a fiery Truth Social post over the weekend, slamming critics for questioning his power, arguing “that was not what the founders had in mind.”

“So, let's get this straight??? The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country (Which is far more onerous than a Tariff!), and LICENSE a Foreign Country, but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY,” the president questioned. 

“That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind! The whole thing is ridiculous! Other Countries can Tariff us, but we can't Tariff them??? It is their DREAM!!! Businesses are pouring into the USA ONLY BECAUSE OF TARIFFS. HAS THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT NOT BEEN TOLD THIS??? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???” he continued. 

The Supreme Court began hearing oral arguments on the Liberation Day tariffs case last Wednesday. The justices appeared skeptical of Solicitor General D. John Sauer's arguments that the president's tariffs under IEEPA are lawful. 

IEEPA is a 1977 law that grants the president authority to regulate certain economic activity during a “national emergency.” 

On April 2, Trump declared a national emergency due to concerns that there were gaping trade imbalances between the United States and other countries. He then invoked IEEPA to address the national emergency by placing tariffs on those countries to correct trade deficits. 

Besides concerns that the president lacked a proper legal basis to carry out his tariff agenda, critics have argued that Trump's sweeping protectionist policies could raise prices for consumers by undermining the principles of free and competitive trade they believe have led to the high standard of living enjoyed by U.S. citizens.

BESSENT SAYS HE'LL HAVE ‘RINGSIDE SEAT' AT SUPREME COURT TARIFF HEARING

However, in another post on Sunday, Trump called those who are against tariffs “fools.” 

“We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high-income people!) will be paid to everyone,” he wrote, alleging in a follow-up message that without tariffs, “we have none” of those benefits.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-NJ) foreshadowed bleak midterm elections for the Republican Party unless its members can address those struggling with healthcare.

Van Drew expressed his desire to draft a “solid, thorough replacement for what is terrible Obamacare” on Fox Business's Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street on Saturday. The current plan proposed by Senate Democrats was criticized by Van Drew because it has “just been subsidizing insurance companies.” 

“In the short term, people are getting the renewal notices, their premiums are doubling, so I'm saying we need to deal with that now because otherwise, No. 1, it is the right thing to do just morally, No. 2, we're gonna get killed,” Van Drew said.

“We have to win the midterms, and it's going to be a hard thing to do. If people are just struggling with their healthcare, it's not going to help us,” Van Drew added. “We're going to win. I believe we're going to win. I do because we're on the right side. But we gotta put our thinking caps on. The Democrats are smart at politics. We have to be smarter; that's the bottom line.”

In Van Drew's state of New Jersey, voters elected Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) over the Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. The Democratic Party also maintained control of the state General Assembly, with 49 seats called for Democrats and 19 seats for Republicans.

The premium tax credits initially drafted under the Affordable Care Act were enhanced under the Biden administration amid the coronavirus pandemic. A Congressional Budget Office report said that permanently extending the enhanced credits would cost the government $383 billion. However, if they permanently expire, the number of people without health insurance would rise by an average of 3.8 million annually by 2034.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemingly fueled speculation on Saturday that the new Washington Commanders stadium could be named after President Donald Trump, calling the prospect “beautiful.”

Leavitt was responding to an ESPN report that revealed discussions have taken place between the White House and the Commanders ownership group about having the NFL team's new, nearly $4 billion stadium in Washington, D.C., bear Trump's name. While Trump has not spoken publicly about such a desire, a senior White House source told the outlet “It's what the president wants, and it will probably happen.”

In her statement, Leavitt hailed the idea, saying “it was President Trump who made the rebuilding of the new stadium possible.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser and Commanders owner Josh Harris reached a deal in April to return the team to Washington, D.C., which coincided with the first few months of Trump's second term. The deal, earmarked at $3.7 billion, includes the development of a new 65,000-seat stadium at the site of RFK Stadium, where the team played for 35 years before moving to Landover, Maryland.

The DC Council ultimately voted to approve the entire development project in September, but not before Trump waded into the deal with a threat to block construction unless the team reverted back to its old name, the Redskins.

The deal went through despite Trump's effort, greenlighting construction of the new stadium, which won't begin until sometime next year.

TRUMP LOSING TOUCH WITH MAGA: WHITE HOUSE REPORT CARD

Trump could be similarly hard put to force the Commanders owners' hands to name the stadium after him, since the naming rights will likely be sold to a corporate sponsor. Of the 32 NFL teams, 29 of them have sold their naming rights to corporations.

Still, a source with knowledge of the stadium deal told ESPN that Trump has “plenty of leverage” to make it happen.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

After Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts delivered a controversial statement regarding its relationship with Tucker Carlson following Nick Fuentes's appearance on his podcast, something resembling a civil war broke out among conservatives.

Some, siding with Roberts, felt he was right to assert that Christians should be able to critique Israel without being accused of antisemitism, that Carlson should be free to interview controversial figures without being attacked for doing so, and that Roberts's denunciation of Fuentes was sufficient. Others, however, argued that the Heritage Foundation's refusal to condemn Carlson more strongly for giving what some have called a “softball” interview to a right-wing activist represented a moral failing, that his statement on American-Israeli relations was red meat for antisemites, and that he wasn't stern enough in rebuking Fuentes.

Representatives of both these camps have spent the past few days arguing their positions on social media and even within the Heritage Foundation.

“I think what we are seeing here in this schism is a predominantly older, southern-centered conservative establishment being forced to come to terms with a younger, geographically northern Trumpist element that they are unable to resonate with,” Ohio College Republican Federation chairman Gabe Guidarini, who has a large social media presence, told the Washington Examiner. “A lot of old school conservative groups have tried to keep the economic austerity, foreign policy hawkishness, and compassionate conservatism in the equation by latching on to [President Donald] Trump, but the majority of the Republican Party now believes what Trump actually talked about in 2015.”

“The ideological underpinning of the Trump movement is repurposed Buchananism, which appeals more to young people and Catholics, and it's abundantly clear these older groups have no intention of coming on board with it, which has led to this proxy conflict,” he added.

Indeed, 50% of Republicans between 18 and 49 have an unfavorable view of Israel, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center in March. In the same poll, only 23% of Republicans over 50 —who make up an outsized share of the electorate and party establishment — had negative feelings toward the Jewish state, providing evidence of a generational divide like the one described by Guidarini. Feelings like these came up during a Heritage Foundation meeting, footage of which leaked to the press, when one unidentified female staffer told Roberts that a “handful of young colleagues and I had no issue with the points you made in the original video,” explaining they believe that “Christian Zionism is a modern heresy” and that Generation Z has “an increased unfavorable view of Israel.”

Some conservatives view such developments with apprehension.

“Among many younger conservatives, there's clearly a lack of grounding in what the movement actually stands for,” Bethany Mandel, a cultural commentator who has long been involved in the conservative movement, told the Washington Examiner. “They've absorbed the aesthetics of rebellion but not the principles behind it. True conservatism is about gratitude, duty, faith, freedom, and moral order — not cynicism, conspiracies, or resentment. What we're seeing now is a generation that confuses provocation with conviction. That's partly a failure of institutions and mentors who haven't taught the intellectual and moral foundations of the Right.”

Institutions and top figures in the conservative movement, such as the Wall Street Journal's editorial board and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), have criticized Roberts's initial statement, whereas a number of social media influencers popular among Gen Z conservatives have offered their support. Fuentes himself has cultivated a massive audience primarily composed of younger viewers.

Rod Dreher, an influential conservative writer and friend of Vice President JD Vance, recently claimed that a reliable source told him that “30% to 40% of D.C. GOP staffers under the age of 30 are Groypers,” a term Fuentes's followers use to describe themselves.

On Fuentes specifically, Roberts advocated against “canceling” him despite “abhor[ing]” his views, and recommending debate instead. Roberts has since called that initial statement a “mistake,” claiming ignorance of Fuentes's beliefs and criticizing Carlson for hosting him. Fuentes denies that six million Jewish people died in the Holocaust, pushes antisemitic conspiracy theories, and frequently jokes about rape and genocide.

“The most troubling revelation is that Roberts says he didn't really know who Nick Fuentes is,” Mandel continued. “He's the head of a political think tank. Knowing the ideological actors in our ecosystem is the job. If you're outsourcing that judgment to staffers handing you scripts, you're admitting a deeper failure of leadership. The way forward is careful, deliberate accountability — own the mistake, affirm first principles, and stop elevating voices fundamentally at odds with them.”

Guidarini and others on the opposing side of the debate see things differently, characterizing the attacks on Roberts as an opportunistic means for one wing of the conservative movement to score points against its rival wing rather than a genuine effort to root out antisemitism.

“I don't think many of the critics of Kevin Roberts are being honest about what this is about,” Guidarini said. “Old school conservative elements have wanted Roberts gone for a long time because of his embrace of National Conservative ideas that American voters have routinely signaled they support, and it's the same reason why they relentlessly lobbied against JD Vance's vice presidential selection. The Tucker interview outrage is mostly manufactured, a desperate push using a strawman with the intention of adding a few more years to the inevitably doomed reign of D.C. Reaganites.”

Cruz, on the other hand, believes that antisemitism is at the heart of the issue.

“In the last six months, I've seen more antisemitism on the Right than I have in my entire life,” the senator said after Roberts released his initial statement. “If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you're a coward and you are complicit in that evil.”

In the telling of some, such a characterization is part of a playbook historically used to silence conservatives. 

“The people attacking Heritage for its ‘antisemitism' are using the exact same tacticsand language the Left uses when it comes to attacking ‘racism,'” one academic close to the conservative movement who requested to remain anonymous, said. “They use bullying,label you with denunciatory labels like ‘neo-Nazi' and ‘antisemite,' smear yourcharacter and malign your motives, and refuse to engage in rational arguments whichmight expose the barrenness of their argument.”

The academic also pointed out that many of the people attempting to tone police Heritage, including Cruz, were once enemies of Trump's movement.

Some, while still accusing Heritage of making light of antisemitism, have advanced other critiques of Roberts's conduct. Tiana Lowe Doescher, for example, pointed out that his tenure as president and subsequent alignment with the New Right figures has been followed by stagnant fundraising and asserted that the foundation has less input over federal staffing than it has in previous GOP administrations.

At the root of the problem is that Carlson's interview was widely viewed as “friendly,” with the former Fox News host often not pushing back on Fuentes's statements and at times agreeing with him. The interview began with Carlson and Fuentes having a conversation about the latter's upbringing and entrance into the political scene, then progressed to discussions on Jewish influence in American politics, race, and feminism.

Carlson did not push back on Fuentes after he said that he is a “fan” of Joseph Stalin, nor did he question Fuentes on his past praise of Hitler or Holocaust denial. He did, however, offer light resistance when Fuentes claimed conservative media was controlled by “Zionist Jews,” pointing out that Fox News is run by the Murdoch family.

Fuentes being normalized by Carlson and Carlson, in turn, retaining the backing of the Heritage Foundation, bodes ill for the health of the conservative movement, former Heritage Foundation fellow Joel Griffith told the Washington Examiner.

“This isn't about canceling anyone,” said Griffith, who now works as a senior fellow at Advancing American Freedom, an advocacy group affiliated with former Vice President Mike Pence. “When you're an organization, you have a fiduciary duty to your members and to your donors to align yourself with respectable people. The concern is that you lend the credibility of your organization, the most important think tank in the world, to someone who very clearly is spreading antisemitic propaganda … When you see a mainstream organization welcoming that, it indicates to people that this is an acceptable point of view.”

While he doesn't believe Roberts himself is antisemitic, Griffith says that he unfairly criticized those on the Right who are concerned about the rise of antisemitism and felt that he danced around Carlson's platforming of anti-American voices, such as apologists for the Russian and Iranian regimes. He also took issue with Roberts's assertion that “globalists” were pushing support for Israel, pointing out that the majority of the world is anti-Israel and that the pro-Israel movement in America is largely funded and staffed by Americans. Mandel pointed out that “globalist” has been used as a dog whistle.

Roberts ultimately apologized for his characterization of Carlson's critics.

Griffith has been working in conservative politics for about 12 years and, echoing the sentiment of others, says that the rise in anti-Israel views among right-wing staffers is a recent phenomenon, stating that it wasn't “really a problem up until about three years ago.”

One young D.C. conservative staffer, who requested anonymity, found Roberts's statement imprudent but has been disappointed by some of the criticism it has received.  

They conceded that Roberts's “response to the controversy, specifically the first video, was unnecessary and a tactical error,” but qualified that statement by claiming that the backlash has “really brought to light that many Zionists will not tolerate any criticism of Israel or reasoned debate whatsoever.”

What all sides can agree on is that this debate isn't going anywhere. 

“This controversy is forcing a reckoning: Do we stand for the ideas that built the movement — free enterprise, limited government, a strong national defense, and traditional values — or do we drift toward the kind of nihilism that corrodes all of that from within?” Mandel asked.

Guidarini argued that a victor in the current confrontation will have to emerge eventually and that he believes “the old establishment will have to find an off ramp” as “there is very little division in the Republican voter base, especially among young people, who almost unanimously lean towards the Buchanan-inspired underpinnings of the Trump movement.”

Some, however, see this as a very D.C.-centric debate.

“This will be a huge division within institutional conservative organizations and for donors,” the anonymous staffer said. “I don't believe the grassroots will care as much, and in fact may be turned off by gratuitous accusations of antisemitism.”

The anonymous academic, meanwhile, predicted that we'll continue to see conflicts between individuals who have criticized Roberts and figures like Vance and Daily Wire commentator Matt Walsh, who they say have harnessed support among young conservatives which threatens to displace more centrist Republicans. 

A spokeswoman for the Heritage Foundation referred the Washington Examiner to a statement issued by Roberts on Wednesday, in which he reiterated the organization's commitment to fighting antisemitism. 

FOREIGN AGENTS LOOK TO INFLUENCE CONSERVATIVE THINK TANKS IN TRUMP'S WASHINGTON

“Everyone has the responsibility to speak up against the scourge of antisemitism, no matter the messenger,” Roberts said. “Heritage and I will do so, even when my friend Tucker Carlson needs challenging.”

Despite the foundation's attempts to distance itself from controversy, a number of organizations and individuals have cut ties amid the fallout. Among these have been senior fellow Steven Moore, the National Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and the Coalition for Jewish Values.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A federal judge explains his reasoning for leaving the bench.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In 1985, President Ronald Reagan appointed me as a federal judge. I was 38 years old. At the time, I looked forward to serving for the rest of my life. However, I resigned Friday, relinquishing that lifetime appointment and giving up the opportunity for public service that I have loved.

My reason is simple: I no longer can bear to be restrained by what judges can say publicly or do outside the courtroom. President Donald Trump is using the law for partisan purposes, targeting his adversaries while sparing his friends and donors from investigation, prosecution, and possible punishment. This is contrary to everything that I have stood for in my more than 50 years in the Department of Justice and on the bench. The White House's assault on the rule of law is so deeply disturbing to me that I feel compelled to speak out. Silence, for me, is now intolerable.

When I accepted the nomination to serve on the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, I took pride in becoming part of a federal judiciary that works to make our country's ideal of equal justice under law a reality. A judiciary that helps protect our democracy. That has the authority and responsibility to hold elected officials to the limits of the power delegated to them by the people. That strives to ensure that the rights of minority groups, no matter how they are viewed by others, are not violated. That can serve as a check on corruption to prevent public officials from unlawfully enriching themselves. Becoming a federal judge was an ideal opportunity to extend a noble tradition that I had been educated by experience to treasure.

My public service began in 1974, near the end of Richard Nixon's presidency, at a time of dishonor for the Department of Justice. Nixon's first attorney general, John Mitchell, who had also been the president's campaign manager, later went to prison for his role in the break-in at the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex and for perjury in attempting to cover up that crime. His successor, Richard Kleindienst, was convicted of contempt of Congress for lying about the fact that, as instructed by the president, he'd ended an antitrust investigation of a major company after it pledged to make a $400,000 contribution to the Republican National Convention. The Justice Department was also discredited by revelations that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had obtained and disseminated derogatory information about political adversaries, including Martin Luther King Jr.

I joined the Department of Justice as a special assistant to the honest and able Deputy Attorney General Laurence Silberman. Soon after, in 1975, President Gerald Ford named Edward Levi as attorney general to restore confidence in the integrity of the department. Levi, then the president of the University of Chicago, had a well-deserved reputation for brilliance, honesty, and nonpartisanship. Ford told Levi that he wanted the attorney general to “protect the rights of American citizens, not the President who appointed him.”

David Frum: The Trump presidency's world-historical heist

I organized Levi's induction ceremony and was there when he declared that “nothing can more weaken the quality of life or more imperil the realization of the goals we all hold dear than our failure to make clear by word and deed that our law is not an instrument of partisan purpose.” For the next two years I served as one of Levi's special assistants, working closely with a man who was always faithful to this principle.

With Levi as my model, in 1981 I became the deputy United States attorney and chief federal prosecutor of public corruption in Massachusetts. In about four years, my assistants and I won more than 40 consecutive corruption cases. Many convictions were of defendants close to the powerful mayor of Boston at the time. As a result, I received the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award and was appointed a federal judge.

Some of the cases over which I presided as judge involved corruption and were highly publicized. Most notable was the prosecution of the notorious Boston mobsters James “Whitey” Bulger and Stephen “the Rifleman” Flemmi. Both, it turned out, were also FBI informants. Agents in the bureau, I discovered, were involved in crimes and egregious misconduct, including murders committed by Bulger and Flemmi. I wrote a 661-page decision detailing my findings. This led to orders that the government pay more than $100 million to the families of people murdered by informants whom the FBI had improperly protected. Their FBI handler was convicted twice and sentenced to serve a total of 50 years in prison.

I also presided over a six-week trial of a former speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. After he was convicted of demanding and accepting bribes, I sentenced him to serve eight years in prison.

I decided all of my cases based on the facts and the law, without regard to politics, popularity, or my personal preferences. That is how justice is supposed to be administered—equally for everyone, without fear or favor. This is the opposite of what is happening now.

As I watched in dismay and disgust from my position on the bench, I came to feel deeply uncomfortable operating under the necessary ethical rules that muzzle judges' public statements and restrict their activities. Day after day, I observed in silence as President Trump, his aides, and his allies dismantled so much of what I dedicated my life to.

When I became a senior judge in 2013, my successor was appointed, so my resignation will not create a vacancy to be filled by the president. My colleagues on the United States District Court in Massachusetts and judges on the lower federal courts throughout the country are admirably deciding a variety of cases generated by Trump's many executive orders and other unprecedented actions. However, the Supreme Court has repeatedly removed the temporary restraints imposed on those actions by lower courts in deciding emergency motions on its “shadow docket” with little, if any, explanation. I doubt that if I remained a judge I would fare any better than my colleagues.

Others who have held positions of authority, including former federal judges and ambassadors, have been opposing this government's efforts to undermine the principled, impartial administration of justice and distort the free and fair functioning of American democracy. They have urged me to work with them. As much as I have treasured being a judge, I can now think of nothing more important than joining them, and doing everything in my power to combat today's existential threat to democracy and the rule of law.

What Nixon did episodically and covertly, knowing it was illegal or improper, Trump now does routinely and overtly. Prosecutorial decisions during this administration are a prime example. Because even a prosecution that ends in an acquittal can have devastating consequences for the defendant, as a matter of fairness Justice Department guidelines instruct prosecutors not to seek an indictment unless they believe there is sufficient admissible evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Trump has utterly ignored this principle. In a social-media post, he instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek indictments against three political adversaries even though the officials in charge of the investigations at the time saw no proper basis for doing so. It has been reported that New York Attorney General Letitia James was prosecuted for mortgage fraud after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, one of Donald Trump's former criminal-defense lawyers, questioned the legal viability of bringing charges against James. Former FBI Director James Comey was charged after the interim U.S. attorney who had been appointed by Trump refused to seek an indictment and was forced to resign. Senator Adam Schiff, the third target of Trump's social-media post, has yet to be charged.

Trump is also dismantling the offices that could and should investigate possible corruption by him and those in his orbit. Soon after he was inaugurated, Trump fired, possibly unlawfully, 18 inspectors general who were responsible for detecting and deterring fraud and misconduct in major federal agencies. The FBI's public-corruption squad also has been eliminated. The Department of Justice's public-integrity section has been eviscerated, reduced from 30 lawyers to only five, and its authority to investigate election fraud has been revoked.

The Department of Justice has evidently chosen to ignore matters it would in the past have likely investigated. Some directly involve the president. It has been reported that at a lavish April 2024 dinner at Mar-a-Lago, after executives from major oil companies complained about how the Biden administration's environmental regulations were hurting their businesses, Trump said that if they raised $1 billion for his campaign he would promptly reverse those rules and policies. The executives raised the money, and Trump delivered on his promise. The law may be unclear concerning whether Trump himself could have been charged with conspiracy to bribe a public official or honest-services fraud. In addition, Trump himself may have immunity from prosecution if similar payments for his benefit continued after he became president. However, the companies that made the payments, and the individuals acting for them, could possibly be prosecuted. There is no public indication that this matter has been investigated by Trump's Department of Justice.

As a prosecutor and judge I dealt seriously with the unlawful influence of money on official decisions. However, Trump and his administration evidently do not share this approach. After Trump launched his own cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, his Department of Justice disbanded its cryptocurrency-enforcement unit. The top 220 buyers of Trump's cryptocurrency were invited to a dinner with Trump. Sixty-seven of them had invested more than $1 million. The top spender, Justin Sun, who was born in China and is a foreign national, reportedly spent more than $10 million. Sun also reportedly spent $75 million on investments issued by a crypto company controlled by Trump's family. It is illegal for people who are not U.S. citizens to donate to American political candidates, and the most that anyone can donate directly to one candidate is $3,500. Ordinarily, the Department of Justice would investigate this sort of situation. There is, however, no indication that any investigation has occurred. Rather, a few months after Sun started purchasing tokens from the Trump-family cryptocurrency company, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused its fraud suit against Sun and his companies pending the outcome of settlement negotiations. (Sun and his companies have denied any wrongdoing.)

Trump is not the only member of his administration whose conduct is apparently shielded from investigation. In September of last year, Tom Homan, who became Trump's “border czar,” reportedly was recorded accepting $50,000 in cash in return for a promise to use his potential future public position to benefit a company seeking government contracts. The FBI had created the fictitious company as part of an undercover investigation. Typically, an investigation of that sort would have continued after Homan became a Department of Homeland Security official, with the FBI seeking any additional evidence of bribery. However, after Trump took office, the investigation was shut down, with the White House claiming there was no “credible evidence” of criminal wrongdoing. Weeks after the FBI investigation was reported, Homan denied taking $50,000 “from anybody” and has said he did “nothing criminal.” An honest investigation could reveal who is telling the truth.

There is also the matter of Trump's executive orders. A good number are, in my opinion, unconstitutional or otherwise illegal. For example, contrary to the express language of the Fourteenth Amendment, one order declares that not everyone born in this country is a U.S. citizen. Trump's administration also has deported undocumented immigrants without due process, in many cases to countries where they have no connections and will be in great danger. Although many federal judges have issued orders restraining the government's effort to implement those executive orders, some appear to have been disobeyed by members of the Trump administration. Trump has responded by calling for federal judges to be impeached, even though the Constitution permits impeachment only for “high crimes and misdemeanors,” such as treason and bribery.

From the December 2025 issue: President for life

Trump's angry attacks on the courts have coincided with an unprecedented number of serious threats against judges. There were nearly 200 from March to late May 2025 alone. These included credible death threats, hundreds of vitriolic phone calls, and anonymous, unsolicited pizza deliveries falsely made in the name of the son of a federal judge, who was murdered in the judge's home in 2020 by a disgruntled lawyer.

Over the past 35 years I have spoken in many countries about the role of American judges in safeguarding democracy, protecting human rights, and combatting corruption. Many of these countries—including Russia, China, and Turkey—are ruled by corrupt leaders who rank among the worst abusers of human rights. These kleptocrats jail their political opponents, suppress independent media that could expose their wrongdoing, forbid free speech, punish peaceful protests, and frustrate every effort to establish an independent, impartial judiciary that could constrain these abuses. These kleptocrats have impunity in their countries because they control the police, prosecutors, and courts.

In my work around the world, I have made many friends, young and old, who have been inspired by the example of American judges, lawyers, and citizens. They have suffered greatly for trying to make their countries more like ours. Among them are impartial judges who have been imprisoned in Turkey, a brilliant young Russian lawyer who was alleged to be a spy and forced into exile, and a Venezuelan law student who almost lost sight in one eye while protesting his country's oppressive government. They courageously share what have historically been our nation's convictions. These brave people inspire me.

I resigned in order to speak out, support litigation, and work with other individuals and organizations dedicated to protecting the rule of law and American democracy. I also intend to advocate for the judges who cannot speak publicly for themselves.

I cannot be confident that I will make a difference. I am reminded, however, of what Senator Robert F. Kennedy said in 1966 about ending apartheid in South Africa: “Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.” Enough of these ripples can become a tidal wave.

And as Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney wrote, sometimes the “longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up, and hope and history rhyme.” I want to do all that I can to make this such a time.

What the photographer found in a tire pile in Modesto, California, and on the shores of Western Australia

Listen to more stories on hark

The Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has built a career documenting what he calls “altered landscapes”—tangled highway overpasses, sprawling oil refineries, mountainsides pockmarked by human exploitation. In 1999, he visited a tire-disposal site outside Modesto, California. It was surreal, he told me, almost sublime. He felt as if he had entered an entirely synthetic world: millions of tires stacked some five stories into the air, rubber hedgerows stretching to the horizon.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

A few months later, the tire pile was struck by lightning and burst into flames. The fire burned as hot as 2,000 degrees and filled the sky with a thick black smoke. After a month, it was at last extinguished, but the tires had melted into more than 250,000 gallons of molten oil that risked seeping into the soil and local water supply. Despite their unlikely beauty, Burtynsky's altered landscapes have always functioned in part as a warning.

But since 2012, Burtynsky has tried to dedicate time each year to photographing “pristine landscapes,” capturing images of nature that inspire something more like hope. Earlier this year, he traveled to Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site at Australia's farthest-western point. The bay is famous for the stromatolites studding its shore, layered rock structures formed over thousands of years by microorganisms that grow, die, and calcify with sediment into marine mushroom caps. Stromatolites are considered the oldest-known fossils on the planet, a living record; some in Shark Bay would have witnessed a time before humans invented the tire—or the wheel. Burtynsky viewed the stromatolites and the rest of Shark Bay's coastline only from the air, angling his camera out of the passenger window of a Cessna 210. The ground, he left untouched.

Restoring stability to American politics will require reviving an age-old concept: common ground.

When America's Founders wrote the declaration that gave birth to the new nation, they began by saying that “a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes.” Other nations had been born out of conquests or rebellions, many based on tribal or religious identities. But the United States was born out of an ideal, which they proclaimed in the next sentence:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

These truths became the creed that bound a diverse group of pilgrims and immigrants into one nation. For people of many different beliefs and backgrounds, it defined Americans' common ground.

Even in the work that went into composing that one sentence, we can see the quest to find this common ground. “We hold these truths to be sacred,” Thomas Jefferson wrote in his first draft. Benjamin Franklin, who was on the five-person drafting committee with Jefferson, crossed out “sacred,” using the heavy backslash marks he had often used as a printer, and wrote in “self-evident.” Their declaration was intended to herald a new type of nation, one in which rights are based on reason, not the dictates or dogma of religion.

But the sentence goes on to invoke “their Creator.” In Jefferson's first draft, he wrote that men are created equal, and “from that equal creation they derive rights.” That phrase was crossed out and replaced with “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.” Thus we see, in the editing of just one sentence, the Founders balancing the role of divine providence and that of reason in determining rights.

From the November 2025 issue: The American experiment

I remember researching this one evening when I was working at CNN years ago. At an editorial meeting the next morning, someone reported that an Alabama state judge, Roy Moore, had put a monument of the Ten Commandments in his courthouse. A federal judge had ordered him to remove it, and a clash was about to occur. “Great,” I remember saying. “Who should we have arguing for and against displaying the Ten Commandments?” That evening, it struck me that Jefferson and Franklin had carefully balanced the role of religion in American society in order to unite people, and that now politicians, and we in the media, were using the Ten Commandments, of all things, to divide them.

As the country approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, its people are embroiled in polarized debates about policies regarding health care, housing, immigration, and the role of religion in society. One way to restore stability to America's politics is to look at issues through the ideal that underlies the declaration's key sentence: common ground.

The concept of common ground has always been part of humanity's struggle to create a good society. Its simplest manifestation was a physical space: the land that was designated as “the commons”—that's where the word commoners comes from. In England, that was the land where commoners could all graze their herds. When the first English settlers came to America, such space was set aside in their towns, as with Boston Common and Cambridge Common.

Even the concept of private property, and the pursuit of property, grew out of the existence of common ground. John Locke, in his Second Treatise of Government—which deeply influenced Jefferson and Franklin—declared that humans can create private property by combining their labor with things they take from nature. But he included a famous limitation, known as the Lockean proviso: only “where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.”

The idea of the commons was not just about land. Societies have always put certain basic goods into the commons, such as schools, libraries, police, and fire protection. These are called the communiter bona, the “goods in common.”

In colonial Boston, the Puritan minister Cotton Mather wrote a popular book called Essays to Do Good, which said that people could best serve God by creating institutions that benefit the common good. Franklin, influenced by Mather's book, set up in Philadelphia a “leather-apron club” of tradesmen and small-business owners that launched a street-sweeping corps, volunteer fire and night-watchman corps, a hospital, a library, and the Academy for the Education of Youth, which became the University of Pennsylvania.

The library served as a commons where both poor tradesmen and wealthy merchants would come to read books. The spread of libraries, Franklin later wrote, “made our common tradesmen and farmers as intelligent as most gentlemen from other countries.”

Creating this type of common ground, where people were treated with equal dignity, was the best way, he said, to serve the Creator. As he put it in the motto that he wrote for the library, Communiter Bona profundere Deum est: “To pour forth benefits for the common good is divine.” But common ground also served a more practical purpose: It nourished the conditions for democracy in a free-market system.

Alexis de Tocqueville, who wins the award for being the most quoted but least read author about America, made an assertion that I think is wrong. He argued that there was an inherent contradiction in America between two opposing impulses: the spirit of rugged individualism versus the spirit of creating associations and common grounds. In fact, the two strands are woven together, the warp and woof of the American fabric. Fiercely independent individuals were equally fierce in their devotion to their community and its commons, and they voluntarily came together in barn raisings and knitting bees and militias and social-aid societies to serve the common good.

Juxtaposed against the commons is a person's right, important for a healthy economy, to also have property that is private. In Locke's time, Britain's Parliament passed a series of laws known as the Enclosure Acts. They allowed some people to build fences to enclose portions of the common land for their private use. These enclosures led to more efficient production, eventually an agricultural revolution that greatly increased the nation's wealth.

Both freedom and economic growth require that we allow individuals to reap the benefits that come from their labor. The American system does, and should, give ample rewards to builders and entrepreneurs and those who work hard, take risks, and even just have good luck.

But the idea of the commons still provides great moral and practical value. Back in feudal times, the existence of common grounds to which everyone had the same rights helped stabilize a society with wealth disparities by giving people a stake in the social order.

The same principle can hold today in a free-market system that allows the accumulation of great wealth. By making sure there remains, as Locke said, enough in the commons, we not only show our moral compassion to others who are less fortunate, but we also nurture the social bonds that temper resentments, political polarization, and populist backlash.

Much of American political debate these days is over which goods—health care, housing, schools, police—should be provided, and to what extent, in the commons. The answers require balance, an art that the country is lacking these days.

Franklin and Jefferson understood balance. They were part of the Enlightenment era, which embraced the scientific method of testing and revising beliefs based on evidence. Both of them studied the work of Isaac Newton, who explained how contending forces could be brought into equilibrium. Their goal on contentious issues was not to triumph but to find common ground, metaphorical this time, based on the right balance. Compromisers may not make great heroes, Franklin liked to say, but they do make great democracies.

The commons serves another purpose: It enables opportunity. That is the moral purpose of the commons. It forms the foundation for creating a land of opportunity and the American dream.

Jeffrey Rosen: The Founders' guide to happiness

That phrase was popularized by James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book The Epic of America. The American dream, he wrote, “is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.”

The example Adams used would have pleased Franklin: a library. He described the grandeur of the Library of Congress, open to all, and declared:

As one looks down on the general reading room, which alone contains ten thousand volumes which may be read without even the asking, one sees the seats filled with silent readers, old and young, rich and poor, black and white, the executive and the laborer, the general and the private, the noted scholar and the schoolboy, all reading at their own library provided by their own democracy. It has always seemed to me to be a perfect concrete example of the American dream.

America puts a lot of goods and services in the commons, including libraries and national defense, police and firefighters, road building and street sweeping, some education, and health care. But there has also been a process of enclosure that has been eroding the country's common ground. The philosopher Michael Sandel calls this the “skyboxification” of America, whereby places and practices that used to be in the commons are now roped off. Everyone used to sit in the stands together at the ballpark; they went through the same entrances and bought the same beer and soggy hot dogs. But now there are VIP entrances and skyboxes. At airports, people wait in different security lines. More neighborhoods are gated. And rare is the local public school that is shared by kids of different economic backgrounds.

The same has happened with media and information and ideas. People go to their own cul-de-sacs online, dive down different rabbit holes on the internet, listen to opposite ends of the talk-radio dial, and let algorithms turn their social-media feeds into echo chambers. The technology that promised to connect us, to be the public's common ground, found a better business model in dividing us.

This shrinkage of the country's commons led to the erosion of the American dream's core principle, which is that America should be a land of opportunity for all: If you played by the rules, there would be good jobs, decent schools, safe streets, and—most important—the prospect of an even better life for your children.

For the past 40 years, the country pursued economic policies based on a belief in free trade, free movement of capital, and free movement of people. This led to offshoring jobs, closing factories, and having immigrants do low-paying work. These policies were, for the most part, intended to fuel economic growth, and in that regard they succeeded. They led to a fast-growing globalized economy that produced more overall wealth and consumer goods.

These policies also led to the rise of a meritocratic elite in America based on educational credentials. The economy's rewards were geared toward those who went to college; the 62 percent who never finished college ended up feeling resentful, or were made to feel that it was their own fault that they were left behind.

Jefferson would have understood the trend toward a meritocratic elite. He favored creating what he called a “natural aristocracy” to replace the hereditary aristocracy that existed in England. In his Notes on the State of Virginia, he advocated for a school system in which the brightest students would be “selected, and continued six years, and the residue dismissed. By this means twenty of the best geniuses will be raked from the rubbish annually, and be instructed, at the public expense.”

The approach of raking an elite from the rubbish and dismissing the residue did not turn out well. The entrenchment of a meritocratic elite came at the expense of community and the American dream. The globalized economic system increased wealth, especially for the elite, but it reduced opportunities for those who used to have secure, working-class jobs.

It created an economy where people can buy a flatscreen television very cheaply at Walmart on a Sunday night, but on Monday morning, they are no longer able to take the bus to a job at a local factory. Their grandparents, on a single income, could have a house, a car, and two or three kids. But they can't afford even a house. In 1970, a house cost about 1.7 times the average salary; in 2022, it cost about seven.

Most problematic, such globalization led to an economy in which people can no longer believe that their kids will be better off than they were. It used to be easy for Americans to climb the economic ladder. Eighty percent of kids born in 1950 went on to earn more, in inflation-adjusted dollars, than their parents had earned. But for kids born in the 1980s, there is less than a 50 percent chance of achieving the same financial success as their parents. Less than 50 percent. No wonder there has been a populist backlash.

Franklin correctly saw the danger of creating a meritocratic aristocracy. His proposals for what became the University of Pennsylvania were designed not to filter a new elite but to provide opportunities and enrichment for all young people to succeed as best they could, whatever their level of talent. He aimed at what he called “true merit,” which he defined as “an inclination joined with an ability to serve mankind, one's country, friends and family, which … should indeed be the great aim and end of all learning.”

Given the resentments and polarization that afflict the country today, Franklin's wisdom should lead Americans to ask a basic question: What is the purpose of an economy? To increase wealth? Yes, that's good. Growth? Yes, good too. But the purpose of an economy is also something deeper. Its purpose is also to create a good society. A good, stable society where individuals can be free and flourish and live together in harmony. That requires nurturing the sense that Americans share common rights, common grounds, common truths, and common aspirations. Democracy depends on this.

At the official signing of the parchment copy of the Declaration of Independence, John Hancock, the president of the Second Continental Congress, wrote his name with his famous flourish. “There must be no pulling different ways,” he insisted. “We must all hang together.” Franklin replied, alluding to what would happen to them if their Revolution failed, “Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.”

As Franklin pointed out, America's life-or-death challenge as a nation, whether it be in 1776 or 2026, is this: When there are so many forces dedicated to dividing us, how can we best hang together?

From the November 2025 issue: Why did Benjamin Franklin's son remain loyal to the British?

One way is by reflecting on the country's fundamental principles, those proclaimed in the declaration's great sentence. Take any issue that is being debated around dinner tables or at city hall or in Congress. What policies can we adopt, what balances can we strike, that will strengthen our common ground?

In an era without universal military service, what institutions can instill a sense of shared patriotic service across class lines? What policies can help give every kid an equal opportunity? And when it comes to the country's media and daily discourse, how can we create news outlets, social-media platforms, public discussions, personal conversations, algorithms, and chatbots that seek to connect us rather than inflame our resentments, engage us through enraging us, and harvest clicks through sensationalism?

In short, we can try to be more like Franklin. He not only helped Jefferson write the sentence that defines our common ground. He lived it. He organized police, fire, and street-sweeping corps; a public library, hospital, and school; a widows' pension fund; and a mutual-insurance cooperative. He ran a newspaper that was dedicated to publishing a wide variety of opinions and following no party line. He bequeathed a revolving loan fund for young people to start enterprises. He donated to the building funds of each and every church in Philadelphia, and he helped lead the fundraising for a new hall that would provide a pulpit to visiting preachers of any belief, “so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.” And on his deathbed, he was the largest individual donor to Congregation Mikveh Israel, the first synagogue in Philadelphia. So when he died, 20,000 mourners watched his funeral procession, which was led by clergymen of every faith, including the local rabbi, walking arm in arm.

That's the ideal of common ground that our Founders fought for 250 years ago. And that's what Americans must continue to fight for today so that we can preserve, for ourselves and our posterity, the rights and aspirations that we all value, including life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Anne Lamott's stories, John Singer Sargent's paintings, and more culture and entertainment recommendations

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Nancy Walecki, an associate editor who has written about her father, a guitar guru to the rock gods; the Palisades Fire that ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year; and her quest to find the East Wing rubble.

Nancy is an avid reader of Anne Lamott, whose writing blends faith and humor. She also enjoys listening to Erroll Garner's songs, debating the merits of the latest Taylor Swift album, and revisiting John Singer Sargent's paintings.

— Stephanie Bai, associate editor

The last thing that made me snort with laughter: Traveling Mercies, by Anne Lamott. It tells the story of her journey to faith: She grew up in an atheist intellectual Bay Area family, became addicted to alcohol and drugs, lost her father to cancer, and eventually found her way to Christianity.

Some of the funniest bits are about her raising her son. When she's ashamed of yelling at him: “It's like bitch-slapping E.T.” When another mother in her son's class makes a passive-aggressive comment: “I thought such awful thoughts that I cannot even say them out loud because they would make Jesus want to drink gin straight out of the cat dish.”

The last thing that made me cry: Also from Traveling Mercies, in which Lamott describes God as a kind of adoptive parent who will take in even the most difficult children. “The mystery of God's love as I understand it is that God loves the man who was being mean to his dog just as much as he loves babies; God loves Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons, as much as he loves Desmond Tutu,” she writes. “So of course he loves old ordinary me, even or especially at my most scared and petty and mean and obsessive. Loves me; chooses me.”

A favorite story I've read in The Atlantic: I had to wipe away tears of laughter while reading Gary Shteyngart's “Crying Myself to Sleep on the Biggest Cruise Ship Ever.”

An actor I would watch in anything: Anthony Hopkins.

An author I will read anything by: Ann Patchett.

A quiet song that I love, and a loud song that I love: One of my favorite quiet songs is “Misty,” as performed by its composer, the pianist Erroll Garner. Listening to it makes even just a walk around the block dreamy. (Bonus: If you explore more of Garner's work, you'll notice he hums and vocalizes along while he plays!) For a loud one, I've been replaying “Nobody's Son,” by Sabrina Carpenter. Every sonic variable is perfectly calibrated to yield the ideal amount of bubblegum pop.

A culture debate I recently had: A friend and I debated whether the new Taylor Swift album, The Life of a Showgirl, is good. I'm a longtime Swift fan, but even I thought it sounded like ChatGPT's version of a Taylor Swift album. And yet, “The Fate of Ophelia” remains stuck in my head. I don't even like the song! Maybe this is what Swift meant when she said the album would contain “melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it.” [Related: Taylor Swift's fairy tale is over.]

Something I recently revisited: I recently wrapped up a magazine feature about my father's musical-instrument shop, which was a hub of the 1960s and '70s music scene in Los Angeles. Once the story went to press, I rewatched This Is Spinal Tap, because nothing (lovingly) parodies rock music better.

The last museum or gallery show that I loved: In general, I'm less affected by visual art than I am by music. The exception may be the “Sargent and Paris” exhibit at the Met earlier this year, which I saw four times. I especially love a painting of two young women on a rooftop in Italy; one appears to be dancing the tarantella, and the other is playing the tambourine. You can hear the music; you can feel the cool Capri air. Looking at the scene fills me with an emotion I haven't yet been able to identify, so I keep coming back.

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: I was actually wasting so much time on my phone (mostly on Instagram) that I had to remove every single fun app from it. But one of my favorite ways to waste time on my computer is Pinterest. It is, in my experience, a universally positive part of the internet. I use it as a tool to dream with—usually about the southwestern-style home I hope to one day own, where I will have lizards and coyotes for neighbors. [Related: What is Pinterest? A database of intentions.]

A good recommendation I recently received: The novel Piranesi, by Susanna Clarke. I'll describe it to you the way my friend did to me: It is a strange, beautiful little book unlike anything I've ever read, and it's best to know as little about it as possible before you start.

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

Essay

The Pantsless Trend Reaches Its Logical Conclusion

By Julie Beck

Celebrities seem to have developed a pants allergy. Bella Hadid and Julia Fox have been running errands in their underpants. Bodysuits, oversize blazers worn as dresses, and sheer fabrics that reveal the lingerie underneath are all common sights. This widespread pantsless trend has given rise to a new sort of garment, more micro than micro-shorts, bulkier than lingerie: I call it the “fashion diaper.”

Railing against Ukraine, Israel, and other outsiders is easy. Solving problems at home is not.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

If there's one belief that unites Americans across the political spectrum, it's that other countries are the reason we can't have nice things. “We sent $250 billion to Ukraine,” the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X in January. “And yet we can't get water to fight fires in California.” In 2023, Assemblyman (and now New York City Mayor-Elect) Zohran Mamdani told an audience at a Democratic Socialists of America conference that “we have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it's been laced by the IDF,” referring to the Israeli army. “Housing and insurance across the board are extremely high, and becoming out of reach for many,” Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted in July. “We do not want to give or sell weapons to Ukraine or be involved in any foreign wars or continue the never ending flow of foreign aid.” Some progressive activists have gone so far as to blame federal assistance to Israel for local budget cuts to New York City libraries.

For many Americans and their elected officials, foreign actors—whether Ukrainian, Israeli, or Chinese—are parasites who stand in the way of prosperity or otherwise corrupt the country. And to be fair, America's international posture, under this administration and the previous ones, certainly leaves much to critique. But when lashing out becomes a substitute for looking inward, such criticism devolves into conspiracism: a way to pin domestic problems on outsiders so as to avoid reckoning with their real causes at home. This rhetorical move may generate applause from partisans, but it's self-defeating, because societies that externalize their internal issues will fail to fix them.

Take the wildfires in Los Angeles earlier this year. At the time, Kirk and other conservatives implied that the failure to prevent the devastation and deal with its aftermath was partly the result of America sending aid to Ukraine. But the facts told a different story. As one of wealthiest and highest-taxed states in the country, and the fifth-largest economy in the world, California had the resources to address the perils posed by wildfires. Local authorities just failed to adequately prepare for a sadly predictable emergency. Any effort to avert a similar catastrophe in the future needs to reckon with this reality, not divert the debate to activities overseas.

Read: The GOP's great betrayal

Indeed, setting aside entirely the merits of U.S. support for Ukraine or Israel, those outlays are a rounding error in the American budget. Both countries could disappear tomorrow and America's health-care situation, education system, law-enforcement challenges, and disaster preparedness would remain the same, because America's predicament is the consequence of American political choices, not sinister foreigners hoodwinking the masses.

Similarly, Mamdani's suggestion that racialized police brutality perpetrated in America (established 1776) by the NYPD (established 1845) stems from Israel (established 1948) is an offense against not just U.S. history but also basic causality. Sourcing such violence to a handful of police exchange trips to Israel for counterterrorism training isn't just factually wrong—it ensures that the actual drivers of the violence go unaddressed and conveniently offloads a long-standing American pathology onto outsiders. When he becomes mayor in January, Mamdani may end the NYPD's Israel trips, but he will be left with the same local problem.

That's because most American ills are of our own making: the result of political choices, trade-offs, and citizen preferences. Many people struggle to find affordable housing because of constraining policies in New York City, California, and other blue strongholds. At this moment, many Americans are facing the loss of their SNAP benefits because of decisions made at the federal level to shut down the government, defund its services, and prevent an emergency fund from offsetting the shortfall. The country doesn't have Medicare for All because Americans are unwilling to pay the estimated $20 trillion it would cost per decade, not because of the approximately $500 billion we've sent to Ukraine and Israel over the course of those countries' entire existence.

Simply put, these situations prevail not because foreign actors defrauded America for the budgetary equivalent of pocket change, but because of policy choices made democratically here at home, for good and for ill. America's new wave of populist politicians are right to highlight the failings of the country's elite, both here and abroad. But if they resort to exporting blame for America's shortfalls in housing, health care, and other areas, rather than taking a hard look within, they will have only quack cures to treat very real ailments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Hundreds of Thousands of Anonymous Deportees","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2025/11/mass-deportation-immigration/684871/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Amid the president's fast-moving deportation campaign, the stories of most people being swept up are missed.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

One morning in March, as ICE was building momentum in carrying out President Donald Trump's mass-deportation campaign, dozens of people who had recently been detained throughout Virginia were being rushed through preliminary hearings. The government was using Zoom to save time, so Judge Karen Donoso Stevens sat in a mostly empty courtroom, adjourning some proceedings in less than two minutes each.

Donoso Stevens yelled at a man to “stop talking!” while his own case was being heard and became frustrated with another who got confused when she referred to him as “the man in the green jacket.” (He wasn't wearing a green jacket.) When a father said he was scared to leave the country without his 5-year-old, she ignored the comment and asked if he had enough money to pay for his ticket home. I was in court that day hoping to see how Trump's new deportation mandate was playing out, but the hearings were moving so quickly that I was having trouble keeping up.

Some people said they needed more time to find lawyers or fill out applications. I was getting only snippets of people's stories, as one bled into the next. But time seemed to slow around noon, when Donoso Stevens called a man from El Salvador with pale skin and short curly hair, wearing an orange jumpsuit, with his hands cuffed behind his back. “I'm very worried about my three babies,” he said in a slow, shaky voice. “The officers arrested me in front of the two littlest ones, who are 2 and 4.” He began to cry, explaining that his youngest had been sick, and that his 4-year-old's first words to him since his arrest had been to ask if the officers who took him away had hurt him.

After the hearing, I asked an attorney to try to reach the man. (Only lawyers can directly call people who are in immigration custody. Detainees have to initiate calls with anyone else.) She tried several times but never heard back. He seemed to vanish, leaving me wondering for months what had happened to him.

Read: They never thought Trump would have them deported

Since then, I've often thought of that man while scrolling social media, where the stories of other people arrested by ICE have gone viral, turning some into minor celebrities: There was Ming “Carol” Li Hui, a waitress and mother from Missouri whose Trump-supporting neighbors and customers wore Bring Carol home T-shirts; and Marcelo Gomes da Silva, a high-school student in Massachusetts whose friends posted signs of his face in their front yards; and Narciso Barranco, the California landscaper whose three sons, all Marines, went on national television to decry their father's violent arrest. These stories have spread because they seem—due to the young age of the person arrested, their contributions to the country, or the fact that they have young children at home—like exceptions whose treatment was uniquely harsh.

Sitting in immigration court, I saw firsthand that they represent the norm. There was at least one deportation case that most Americans would likely support—a man who had been convicted of child sodomy—but most detainees were people without a criminal history who were worried about getting back to their families and their jobs.

I wondered if the crying father might have also become a household name if his story were online. Instead, like most people who are detained across the country right now, he remained unknown and unreachable.

Most of Trump's deportation campaign is inaccessible because after arrests are made, it is moving quickly, far from public view. And because it is targeting people who have spent an average of 16 years in the United States, trying, in many cases, to avoid public attention, rather than court it. That makes it difficult to fathom the full picture of what's happening. In the age of virality, our devices offer up individual case studies, allowing us to congregate around them virtually. Although this is useful in helping us understand what happens when a person is plucked from their home, it takes our attention away from the larger story—more than half a million people deported, millions more at risk—and focuses us instead on a tiny part of it.

More than 70 percent of people in immigration custody have no criminal past. Although ICE has not released data on how many of them left children behind when they were arrested, the fact that an estimated 6 million kids in the United States have at least one parent without legal status suggests that this is the case for many. And detention centers for children have been packed since Trump took office. But none of this is easy to witness.

The high-profile incidents have also helped a select few who are slated for deportation raise money for lawyers, or even be released. But they risk creating the impression that sharing stories on social media might somehow keep ICE's work at bay. It won't: Congress recently tripled the agency's budget, making it the highest-funded law-enforcement agency in the country, and allocated $45 billion to expand its detention centers.

Read: ICE's mind-bogglingly massive blank check

When Marcelo Gomes da Silva, the Massachusetts high-school student, was released, he held a press conference, surrounded by supporters. He seemed most troubled not by his own arrest, which took place while he was driving himself and some of his friends to volleyball practice, but by the prevalence of experiences like his. He said that he had told the other men he was detained with, “When I'm out, if I'm the only one who was able to leave that place, I lost,” adding, “I want to do whatever I can to get them as much help as possible.”

Amid the barrage of stories flooding our phones, da Silva was conveying something that's easy to miss. For every person arrested whose name and story we've learned, there are thousands we haven't heard about. Despite becoming famous for being treated harshly, da Silva is one of the lucky ones.

Most people detained by ICE are being housed in sprawling complexes in rural areas, where the land is cheap and the protests are few. Akiv Dawson, a criminologist at Georgia Southern University, has been conducting research at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, which can hold up to 2,000 people at a time. She said that since Trump took office, courtrooms have been packed with immigrants whose experiences would, according to polling, trouble the average American—people who have lived in the U.S. for decades, have American-born children, and have never been convicted of a serious crime. She told me about a lawful permanent resident of 50 years whose child is a U.S. citizen and whose deceased wife was as well. The man explained in court that ICE agents had mistaken him for someone else when they arrested him. But he admitted in court to having a single criminal conviction—simple marijuana possession from 30 years ago—so the judge decided to let the deportation case against him proceed. The man told the judge that his belongings would soon be thrown into the street if he wasn't released; he needed to go back to work and pay rent. “He began to panic,” Dawson told me. “He said, ‘My people don't even know that I'm here. They came and took me from my bed.'” Dawson said the man asked the judge why this was happening after he had spent so many decades in the United States. She replied, “Sir, this is happening across the country.”

Dawson also told me about a young mother from Ecuador who had followed the legal process for requesting asylum and pleaded to be released on bail so that she could be reunited with her 2-year-old son, whom she had left with a neighbor. “She begged,” Dawson said, and recalled the woman saying, “Please, give me an opportunity so that I can do the process the right way.” The woman said she wouldn't be able to continue with her asylum case if she was going to have to do it from inside a detention center. “I have a child. I can't be here too long without him,” she said. With that, the judge said the woman had waived her right to relief, and continued processing her for removal from the country.

“Are you going to deport me with my son?” the woman asked. “I don't have anyone to keep him here.”

“You would need to talk to your deportation officer,” the judge replied, according to Dawson. “I'm only handling your case.”

Dawson pointed out that neither of these people—like the significant majority of those who are being held in ICE custody—had an attorney to defend them, making them five and a half times more likely to lose their case and be deported. Unlike criminal defendants, immigrants who cannot afford an attorney are not legally entitled to a public defender—and even those who can afford to hire representation are hard-pressed to find it in the remote areas where they are being detained. There is one immigration lawyer based in Lumpkin full-time; for more than a decade after the facility opened, there was none. Some lawyers represent clients there virtually, but presenting a compelling case via a computer screen can be difficult, especially with temperamental technology and glitchy internet connections. More than nine in 10 people detained there lose their immigration case and are deported.

ICE is supposed to track when it arrests people who have minor children, and to ensure that their wishes for where children end up are carried out in the case of a deportation. But immigrant advocates say they worry, given how quickly new officers are being trained, that the agency may not be keeping adequate records, as was the case with families who were separated at the southwestern border the first time Trump was president. (Tricia McLaughlin, an ICE spokesperson, said the agency was in full compliance with requirements.) In the absence of clarity, it's become common to underestimate the scale of what is happening. In August, for example, a public outcry followed the arrest in a New York City courthouse of a 6-year-old, who was initially reported to be the first child detained in the city during Trump's second term. Soon after, however, journalists found that in the two months prior to that incident, 48 children had been arrested in the jurisdiction that includes the city. Data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed that 32 of those children had already been deported. Their stories were simply missed.

Chance has long played an outsize role in immigration courts. There are no juries, and a person's likelihood of winning can depend more on the judge they are assigned than the facts of their case. Social media has only exacerbated this phenomenon. Marcelo Gomes da Silva's lawyer, Robin Nice, told me that as the community rallied around her client, the chief ICE prosecutor called her directly to discuss the situation—a first in her 13-year career—and his bond hearing was scheduled faster than she had seen in any previous case. Although the administration appears more intent on deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, even after it erroneously sent him to a Salvadoran megaprison and had to bring him back under court order, because of the public attention to his case, his family has been showered with donations. And Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, personally inquired about a mother and three children from Sackets Harbor, New York, whose detention had prompted a publicity campaign led by local teachers. Homan grew up nearby and said the case was unfortunate because it brought undue attention to the town where he would like to retire. The family was quickly released.

But most unauthorized immigrants are likely to be uncomfortable broadcasting their deportation case—especially when the administration has shown that no location, age, illness, or disability guarantees a humanitarian reprieve.

Months after I sat in the Virginia immigration court, I managed to track down the father whose story had stayed with me. His experience was full of the kinds of details that have led most Americans to believe that Trump has taken his deportation mandate too far. But he asked not to be named in my story, for fear that drawing attention to his family could further harm them.

The man's lawyer, Vishrut Shelat, explained that his client has lived in the United States since 2018 and has no criminal record. The man landed in ICE custody after being arrested in January when a neighbor called the police and accused him of breaking into a car and of having a domestic dispute. Both charges were dropped when he and his wife denied having a fight and proved that the car he was trying to get into was their own.

Despite this, he wasn't eligible for bail, because he was arrested days after Congress passed the Laken Riley Act. The bill is named after a young woman who was raped and murdered by a man who was previously released from criminal custody on bail. It makes people who have been accused, but not convicted, of relatively minor infractions such as theft ineligible for pretrial release. Judge Donoso Stevens had explained that under the new law, her hands were tied. Even after the police acknowledged that he hadn't attempted to steal anything, the accusation alone meant that he would have to spend months in jail.

Shelat told me that his client's landlord has already begun eviction proceedings against his wife, who can no longer pay the rent. She and their three children have been buying food with donations from relatives and their church, but they are not sure how long those will last. Without any hope of release, the man agreed to be returned to El Salvador, leaving his wife and children behind. He hopes to file a petition when he arrives to return to his family as soon as possible. His application will land in a pile of many from people whose stories we'll never hear.

The end of pandemics is within reach. Why aren't we acting like it?

For the first time in history, we have an opportunity to stop the next pandemic.

From the earliest thinking of the Greek physician and philosopher Claudius Galen to the 19th-century British “father of epidemiology” John Snow to the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, recurring, widespread, and uncontrollable illness has been beyond the grasp of the most cutting-edge science. For most of our history, humans have experienced plagues and pandemics as acts of unknowable forces.

No longer. In recent decades, scientific and medical advances have made it possible to detect, treat, and stop the pathogens most likely to sweep across continents and cause widespread death. The question now is not whether we can prevent the next pandemic, but whether we will.

• Why another pandemic within the next few decades is likelier than you might think — and why all hope is not lost, despite the US retreat from global health leadership

• Where the next pandemic will likely come from

• The three-part playbook to extinguish pandemic threats, and how the world can collaborate to implement it

• The most urgent, low-hanging steps we can take to blunt pandemic risk from infectious diseases right now

On our current trajectory, we will likely be faced with another pandemic in our lifetimes. By 2050, humanity has a nearly 50 percent chance of facing a pandemic as severe as Covid-19, which killed an estimated 25 million people around the world, and a one in seven chance of a catastrophic pandemic killing 100 million people, according to an analysis published by the World Bank and The Lancet. These odds depend on both what's called the “spark risk” of a new threat emerging, and the “spread risk” of that threat growing to pandemic scale. Both risks are increasing every year due to more contact between people and wild animals, the proliferation of labs handling high-risk pathogens, and increasing accessibility of biological weapons. So the 50-50 odds are optimistic. Nobody wants to relive the pain and chaos of the last pandemic, but biology doesn't care.

As the US withdraws from collaborative global leadership, and conflicts simmer and spread around the world, the post-World War II order is under threat. But people around the world still believe that countries should work together, including on global health, as long as international cooperation actually solves tangible problems.

The America First Global Health Strategy, released in September by the Trump administration, includes detection and containment of biological threats as top priorities. In June, the UK announced a billion-pound investment in a new biosecurity center “to protect the British public and the economy from future pandemics.” The African Union has launched a new African Epidemic Fund to support countries in preparing for and responding to outbreaks, and East Asian countries have made political and financial investments to prepare for biological threats from outbreaks and adversaries. Even as countries cut global health funding, stopping the next pandemic is a problem the world wants to solve.

Technological breakthroughs and lessons learned from the Covid pandemic have created an unprecedented opportunity to prevent, detect, and snuff out new threats at the source. With the right leadership and smart investments, we can take the top pandemic threats off the table in the next 10 years.

Here's how.

A couple hundred viruses are already circulating in humans, and hundreds of thousands more are circulating in animals. The risk of these viruses jumping from animals to humans, known as zoonotic transmission, is increasing as people move into areas that were previously inhabited only by animals. In the last 10 years, several of these so-called natural outbreaks, including Zika and bird flu, have had serious health and economic impacts.

For almost all of human history, pandemic threats emerged from nature. But now we have new, human-created risks to worry about. The number of labs handling the two highest-risk biological samples has quadrupled in the last two decades; these labs are now in nearly 150 countries. As more of these labs are built without the necessary safety protocols and oversight, the risk of an accidental spill also grows. And as technology (synthetic biology, automation, and AI) makes it easier for bad actors to turn viruses into weapons, the risk of a country, terrorist group, or even a lone actor deliberately starting a pandemic increases.

In 2024, the World Health Organization brought together scientists from around the world to prioritize a list of viral families — groups of viruses with similar characteristics — that have the potential to cause the next pandemic. Five groups stand out as the most dangerous.

The top two “viral most wanted,” as they are sometimes called, are almost certainly the influenza and coronavirus families — familiar names because they have caused most of history's pandemics and major epidemics. Both are capable of spreading rapidly, and future strains have the potential to be much deadlier than the versions we have seen previously.

The next three on the most wanted list are viruses that are already wreaking havoc around the world. The paramyxoviridae family includes measles (extremely contagious but less deadly) and Nipah (less contagious but often deadly). This family has a nasty combination of virus characteristics that — if they ever converged into one virus — could make for a pretty bad pandemic, though the chances of it happening naturally are low.

The Poxviruses, meanwhile, include smallpox, very deadly but eradicated, and mpox, which has led to two global emergency WHO declarations since 2022.

Last on the list are arboviruses, which are often carried by mosquitoes and ticks. Arboviruses like dengue and malaria (a parasitic infection) are spreading to new countries due to climate change and urbanization. Countries where these viruses have long circulated are seeing record outbreaks, and locally acquired cases are becoming routine in new places, including the US.

All of these top threats have the potential to naturally mutate in a way that poses a novel risk to humans, either by becoming more deadly, spreading more efficiently, or both. But they can also be manipulated by humans in ways that make them more dangerous.

We have three main lines of defense against pandemics: prevent the spark of a new threat, contain a threat before it spreads, and — if all else fails — rapidly roll out tests, treatments, and vaccines that can slow transmission or protect people who are infected.

The first, and most efficient, way to stop pandemics is to prevent new threats from emerging by lowering the risk that viruses will jump from animals to humans, preventing lab leaks, and deterring bad actors from developing biological weapons. Effective approaches exist to prevent these threats.

Deforestation, driven by agriculture and urbanization, creates more opportunities for natural virus spillover around the world. We know how to mitigate that risk: Brazil, for example, put a set of policies in place between 2005 and 2012, including financial incentives and regulatory changes, that rolled back deforestation in the Amazon by 70 percent while increasing crop production. Wildlife markets and trade are another high-risk opportunity for spillover. Similarly, low-cost but effective interventions could mitigate these risks, including bans on the trade of high-risk wildlife species.

These solutions face real economic and political headwinds, in part due to the dependence of many countries' economies on these practices. Solutions will not only require buy-in from those countries' political leadership, but will also require alternatives, including new approaches to meet the ever-increasing demand for food production.

To make a biological weapon, bad actors need to either use an existing virus sample, or purchase synthetic DNA or RNA to create something new. Sellers of these materials can put simple screening processes in place to make sure the materials purchased are used by legitimate researchers. To prevent lab leaks, governments can put in place clear rules to make sure high-risk research is conducted with the strongest safety standards. In most countries, including the United States, where many high-risk labs are located, existing guardrails are largely voluntary.

In cases where we cannot prevent pandemic threats from emerging, the second line of defense is to quickly detect and stop them from spreading. Early warning and disease surveillance systems that regularly collect data on illnesses can quickly identify when something goes awry. Evolving technologies — from artificial intelligence to wastewater surveillance — make this vision more achievable than ever.

Most countries already participate in the global influenza surveillance network, sharing data and samples for the annual flu season and quickly detecting new virus strains with outbreak potential. Countries could expand the influenza network or build out newer models, like the Biothreats Emergence, Analysis and Communications Network (BEACON), to detect a wider range of other emerging biothreats before they spread. Much like weather reports, these systems have the potential to move beyond describing current events to predicting the likely evolution of threats and informing prevention efforts.

Any effective surveillance system requires an easy, affordable, and accurate way to test for a virus. Rapid tests for COVID and seasonal flu now exist for use at home and in healthcare settings. Developing similar tests for the top pandemic threats would help to quickly identify and contain new threats.

The third line of defense, following prevention and surveillance, is a robust system to rapidly develop, manufacture, and deliver safe and effective treatments and vaccines.

Infectious disease experts have converged around the goal of getting safe and effective tests, treatments, and vaccines ready for distribution within 100 days of identifying a new pandemic threat. The process to develop a vaccine took about 300 days during Covid-19, a record at the time, but if it had been done in 100 days, more than 8 million additional lives might have been saved.

AI can accelerate every step of this process — from surveillance to early-stage vaccine and treatment development and faster manufacturing. The US Defense Department's Generative Unconstrained Intelligent Design Engineering (GUIDE) program is using advanced simulation and machine learning to cut the timeline for developing effective treatment candidates from 10 years to 100 days. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is using AI to identify the right targets for vaccines, with the goal of cutting the timeline for this critical step from months to days or even hours.

Once safe and effective vaccines are developed, billions of doses may be needed, and manufacturers must be ready to rapidly scale up production. Innovations in the approaches to making vaccines — called platform technologies — can speed up that timeline. For example, the most common method for making seasonal flu vaccines uses chicken eggs to grow the virus, a slow process that requires a lot of (sterile, pathogen-free) eggs. Newer approaches to vaccine manufacturing, sometimes called “plug and play” platforms, are more akin to a printer and an ink cartridge. The printer itself is developed in advance and tested for safety and efficacy; then scientists can quickly plug in the new ink cartridge, or information about a new pathogen, when an outbreak occurs. These “plug and play” vaccine platforms, including mRNA vaccine technology, can shorten the timeline for manufacturing billions of safe and effective vaccine doses from years to months.

In an emergency, we need an existing “warm base” of global manufacturing that can quickly be repurposed to make emergency tests, treatments, and vaccines. That requires making sure enough manufacturers are able to use existing vaccine platforms, and that we have enough diversity in vaccine platforms globally to be prepared for a range of needs. One of the best ways to ensure a warm base of manufacturing capacity around the world is to build and use a variety of plug-and-play platforms now, to make vaccines against existing threats like Ebola, HIV, and seasonal influenza. Repurposing an existing manufacturing plant is much easier than building a new one in an emergency.

What would it cost to prevent pandemic threats from emerging, quickly detect threats when they do emerge, and respond effectively when they spread? And who could make this happen?

In early 2021, the World Bank and WHO estimated that $31 billion would be needed annually to pay for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response globally. A review by the International Monetary Fund estimated that investments of $60 billion up front and $5 billion annually could ensure enough manufacturing capacity to vaccinate 70 percent of the world's population against a new virus within six months.

Conservatively, then, $30 billion annually for 10 years, with a larger down payment, would be sufficient to take the top pandemic threats off the table, with many second-order benefits. For comparison, Covid-19 cost the US economy about $14 trillion through the end of 2023. The global economic losses from an influenza pandemic could be double that. The bottom line on cost is that preparing for and preventing a pandemic is vastly less expensive than living through one. Given the odds of another pandemic in our lifetimes, the world should make this investment.

But this is a big goal with many components. So where is the most urgent place to start?

A catastrophic pandemic, killing as many or more people than Covid, would likely come from one of the top two threats — a coronavirus or an influenza virus. Most urgently, we need safe and effective vaccines and treatments against these two viral families. Researchers at CEPI estimated in 2018, before recent breakthroughs in technology, that the total cost of developing a vaccine, including the cost of failed vaccine candidates and regulatory approval, is about $300 to $500 million. Assuming some added complexity for developing broadly protective vaccines, and adding the cost of developing effective treatments and tests, an investment of $10 billion over 10 years would likely be sufficient to develop the tests, treatments, and vaccines needed to blunt those two top threats to humanity.

Numerous governments, institutions, and philanthropies are already investing in breakthrough solutions, but those efforts are ad hoc, uncoordinated, and lack a clear set of top priorities and a timeline. The next United Nations High-Level Meeting on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response will take place in September 2026; between now and then, one of the institutions leading the way — whether CEPI, the UK government, the African Union, or others — should bring together the current major investors in vaccines, treatments, and tests to align.

They should agree on: Who is driving investments against coronaviruses? Influenzas? Other viral most wanted families? What do scientists need to make faster progress toward breakthroughs? When will we see results, and how will we share our progress transparently with the public? They should tell the world what is needed to take these threats off the table so we never again face a devastating pandemic.

Five years out, we are still living in the shadow of Covid-19 and all the fear, frustration, anger, and loss it created. It's natural to want to ignore the threat of pandemics, to simply hope that we can avoid another “act of God” in our lifetimes. But we can stop this threat. Not with luck or divine intervention, but with acts of human ingenuity, commitment, and belief. Let's do this.

President Donald Trump on Sunday said that a dividend payment of ""at least"" $2,000 would be paid to most Americans from US tariff revenues.

In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: ""We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion.""

""A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.""

The Supreme Court is reviewing the legality of Trump's sweeping tariffs, which he has justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Lower courts previously determined that many of the levies were unlawful.

The president had floated the idea of a $1,000 to $2,000 ""distribution to the people"" in an interview with One America News Network in October, touting tariff revenues he predicted would bring in over a trillion dollars a year.

The Treasury Department said in its September statement that it has collected $195 billion from customs duties in the fiscal year 2025.

For consumers, the idea of a dividend payout may be particularly welcome amid mounting cost-of-living pressures and the ongoing government shutdown.

But any such scheme would likely need congressional approval, and Trump has previously signaled he would prefer to use tariff revenues to tackle the national debt.

Appearing on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday morning, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told host George Stephanopoulos that the administration's goal with tariffs was to ""rebalance trade"" rather than to take in revenue.

Trump's announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running political battle over affordability.

Trump had partially built his presidential campaign on the issue, repeatedly lambasting former President Joe Biden over inflation and promising to ""immediately bring prices down"" should he take office.

Democrats have recently turned to the same playbook.

Democratic candidates, including Zohran Mamdani, swept to victory in elections in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia this week after running campaigns focused on cost-of-living concerns.

Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect who Trump has branded a ""communist,"" had pledged to freeze rent, make childcare and buses free, and create city-owned grocery stores as part of his bid for office.

""Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up,"" Mamdani said in his victory speech.

A key phase of President Donald Trump's plan to overhaul student-loan repayment has concluded.

On November 6, the Department of Education wrapped up negotiations with stakeholders on Trump's changes to student-loan repayment and borrowing that he signed into law in his ""big beautiful"" spending legislation in July.

The negotiations, which had been going on since October, focused on two areas: replacing existing income-driven repayment plans and instituting new borrowing caps on graduate and professional student loans. The negotiating committee reached a consensus on the law's changes, and the department will begin drafting a rule and publishing it for public comment early next year. The changes are scheduled to take effect in July 2026.

Under the legislation, the Department of Education will eliminate the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. It also places new caps on graduate and professional borrowing: $20,500 a year for graduate students or $100,000 over a lifetime, and $50,000 for professional students or $200,000 over a lifetime.

In addition to borrowing caps, the department will eliminate existing income-driven repayment plans and replace them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years.

""The consensus language agreed upon by the negotiators today will help drive a sea change in higher education by holding universities accountable for outcomes and putting significant downward pressure on the cost of tuition,"" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. ""This will benefit borrowers who will no longer be pushed into insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off.""

Negotiators raised concerns with the Department of Education's proposed definition of a professional student. The department said that to be eligible for the higher student-loan cap available to professional students like those studying law or medicine, the borrower would have to be enrolled in one of 10 programs.

Some advocates raised concerns that the limits on who qualifies for the higher student loan cap could strain participation in healthcare professions. However, the department said that, despite the limited categories, there are over 2,000 doctoral programs that would fall within the new professional degree definition.

""At a time when the need for healthcare services is rapidly expanding, restricting access to financial support for future healthcare providers is a step in the wrong direction,"" Todd Pickard, president of the American Academy of Physician Associates, said in a statement. ""Without a sustainable pipeline of trained clinicians, patient access to care and health outcomes will continue to decline.""

Undersecretary Kent told negotiators that it's ""by far not the perfect proposal.""

""We have a really challenging job in front of us, but I think what we did in our proposal is to meet you all at least halfway,"" Kent said.

Meanwhile, the department said it will phase in changes to the repayment plans for existing borrowers. For example, borrowers who took out loans prior to July 1, 2026, will retain access to income-based repayment, while borrowers who take out loans after that date will be eligible to enroll in the new Repayment Assistance Plan.

Across KPMG's offices nationwide, employees say they prefer round tables.

So with that feedback and more in mind, the Big Four consulting firm designed and opened a new, 450,000-square-foot office at Two Manhattan West in Manhattan's Hudson Yards neighborhood.

The firm hopes the gleaming new headquarters will not only reassert its presence in New York City but also tempt its more than 5,000 employees in New York back to the office more often.

Few things have tested corporate America's resolve quite like the whiplash between the work-from-home movement and the subsequent return-to-office push.

Over the past few years, many companies have attempted to lure — or force — employees back to the workplace with everything from new perks to stringent mandates.

At KPMG, employees typically split their weeks between the office, client sites, and home. Last month, 81% of New York-based partners and employees worked in person about 2 days a week, the firm said.

Tim Walsh, who stepped into the role of KPMG's CEO and chair in July, told Business Insider that the new headquarters signifies the firm's commitment to strengthening its presence in the city.

""We've always been committed to New York,"" Walsh told me at the firm's new office when I visited. ""This is certainly a strong recommitment on behalf of KPMG in terms of how important this market is for our firm.""

""It's certainly brand elevating, in my opinion,"" he added.

I visited the office on a rainy morning in October.

Soon after I arrived, I met Vanessa Scaglione, KPMG's head of real estate services — one of hundreds involved in designing the new office — who took me on a tour of the space.

The 12 floors of the office are divided into four blocks of three, each themed after a different New York neighborhood — Upper Manhattan, Midtown, Downtown, and the Financial District. Throughout the office, decorative touches — from neighborhood murals to the perforated steel ceiling in the lobby, designed to evoke Park Avenue radiator covers — pay homage to an earlier era of New York, when the firm was first established as Marwick, Mitchell & Company in 1897.

The office, which officially opened on November 5, was more than five years in the making. It was designed in partnership with design firm HOK, along with several other vendors. KPMG did not disclose financial details about the total cost of the new office.

What surprised me most was how much the office design was shaped by employee feedback, which also guided the choice of location — one that keeps commuting times steady or shorter for two-thirds of the firm's staff.

A firm representative told Business Insider that the design was informed by feedback gathered from employees after they moved into earlier offices. These suggestions were used to identify what was working well and where adjustments might be needed.

In addition, they also had an ambassador program which drew employees from across departments to guide colleagues through the transition, the KPMG spokesperson said. The firm also distributed a newsletter, digital renditions, and built a lab, where they piloted various types of workspaces and technology to obtain feedback from staffers on what worked best.

For Walsh, the office is also the start of a new chapter for the firm — one where employees, clients, and technology work together more seamlessly.

""It's really a new era at KPMG, and this space is a perfect physical representation of that,"" he said. ""It's changing the way our people will work together and collaborate. It's bringing technology into everything that they do.""

The new office is replete with rooms for major meetings and board discussions, and smaller breakout rooms for employees to collaborate with each other and clients.

Navigation has been simplified by using room names that match New York City landmarks. Interactive maps appear throughout the building. There are a few enclosed offices that are intentionally located away from the perimeter of the floor so that staffers and clients can easily find their way, the spokesperson said.

The firm tracks attendance through badge swipes and time sheets.

One of the hallmarks of the new office is a space called ""Ignition,"" where staffers lead clients through customized sessions in design thinking, which the firm says is a more human-centered approach to problem-solving.

Projects that the firm has worked on through Ignition include helping large banks develop a system for employees to navigate international assignments, assisting large retailers with corporate storytelling, and helping clients through mergers and acquisition decisions.

""These are our existing, ongoing clients. They're experiencing new disruption in their industry. They really don't know what's next, and they might come to us to explore that next level,"" Caroline Berman, a manager at KPMG supporting Ignition, told me at the office the day I visited.

Clients spend anywhere from a minimum of 90 minutes to multiple days in KPMG's Ignition experiences, she said.

When a client has a change in leadership, or new board members join an organization, they may turn to KPMG for guidance on ""effective teaming,"" she said.

Participants begin in the Arrival Lounge at Ignition, then branch into different paths based on session size. They enter the immersive space, a dynamic area used to introduce or emphasize key moments in the sessions. From there, they move into the lab, which is equipped with modular furniture that's rearranged throughout the day for workshops and exercises, she said.

""We want them to leave here with tangible outcomes, like a 30-60-90 roadmap,"" or even ""actual shifts in mindset and behavior,"" Berman said.

Spaces for deep work and collaboration are an important part of the firm's effort to upskill its workforce on AI.

The firm has developed several internal AI tools like aIQ Chat, which gives employees secure access to large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and its Digital Gateway, an AI-powered platform the firm says helps it model and scenario plan in real time for changing legislation and regulations for its tax clients.

KPMG has also been running an internal AI transformation program to train employees on AI for the past two years, a spokesperson for the firm told Business Insider.

""In the US, we know virtually every KPMG employee is using AI —and not just occasionally. 90% of our people are actively engaging with our advanced AI tools, and our data shows that those who use them more frequently are seeing the greatest benefits, including higher quality output, reduced stress, and more time to focus on strategic work,"" the firm's spokesperson said.

Walsh said the firm is committed to providing employees access to AI tools, but did not explicitly say how it'll change the way the firm evaluates performance.

""It's a high-performing culture,"" he said. ""So I wouldn't say we're asking more from our employees, but what we are saying to everyone at KPMG is you need to adopt and use the tools that are being provided because it's critical to your success in the future.""

The office isn't just a place for work.

KPMG's new office features areas where employees can gather and socialize. Near the first-floor entrance, there's a coffee bar that transforms into a full bar in the evening. Scaglione said it captures the atmosphere of classic New York City bars — for her, it's reminiscent of the famous Old Town Tavern, which opened in 1854.

There's an employee lounge, known as The Manhattan, where employees can network. Within Ignition, there's a more residential-looking room, known as ""The Living Room,"" where employees finalize deals with clients.

The intention is to create an environment where employees feel comfortable, Walsh said.

""I think our employees are going to come and expect to be in tight quarters. That's the furthest thing from what we did here,"" he said. ""We provided so many spaces for people to come in and just feel good about being here.""

Elon Musk could soon be a trillion-dollar man.

On Thursday, 75% of Tesla shareholders voted to approve his proposed $1 trillion pay package as the company's CEO, contingent on a set of performance metrics he would need to meet over the next decade.

And based on the standing ovation and exuberant cheering Musk received at the shareholder meeting, Tesla superfans in attendance seemed to love it.

""Howdy, Elon,"" said one attendee during the Q&A portion of the meeting. ""Congrats on not having to show up to work for free anymore.""

The massive compensation package is in hopes that Musk could increase Tesla's market cap by more than sixfold and create a million robots. For comparison, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, is expected to receive about $49.9 million in pay in 2025.

Ian Keas, managing director of Gallagher's executive compensation consultancy team, told Business Insider that it's rare for a pay package to carry such high stakes.

""Moon shoot incentives have been, for some time, pretty rare,"" said Keas. ""You don't normally see these types of pay packages in US publicly traded companies.""

Musk's pay plan is contingent on Musk achieving several challenging goals. To earn the full $1 trillion, Musk must boost Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million vehicles a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots.

Jesse Fried, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider that the decision makes sense due to the ""huge upside to keeping Musk hyper-focused on Tesla.""

""It was approved by unaffiliated shareholders, who are the parties most affected by the arrangement,"" said Fried. ""I don't believe any other public company has ever voluntarily put CEO pay to a shareholder vote.""

Keas said that when dealing with an executive pay above market rate, there is no significant accountability issue as long as the pay is ""tightly linked"" to ""clear and rigorous"" performance goals with no gray areas.

""When there's an award that's been designed by a board of directors and approved by a shareholder vote, that kind of contract is binding,"" said Keas. ""If the future of the company is successful through proper incentives for a CEO that result in shareholder value appreciation over time, then I don't think shareholders have too much to worry about.""

The new compensation plan follows a Delaware judge's decision that voided Musk's $56 billion compensation deal from 2018, ruling that Tesla's board was unduly influenced by Musk when they agreed to his pay. Tesla relocated its incorporation to Texas and has continued to appeal the decision; it is unclear whether its success or failure would impact Musk's new pay package.

Even though Tesla's shares have recovered from the blows they received earlier in the year, their sales face an uncertain future after the end of the EV tax credit. Meanwhile, robotaxis have thus far remained with safety drivers while operating.

Some investors and industry watchdogs are alarmed by Musk's record-setting pay package.

Shua Sanchez, national campaign director at Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere, told Business Insider in a statement that he is concerned that nothing in Musk's performance metric incentivizes autonomous vehicle safety.

""This pay plan creates a dangerous financial incentive to rush partially-autonomous vehicles and robotaxis onto public roads before they're proven safe,"" said Sanchez.

Tejal Patel, Executive Director of the SOC Investment Group, which holds Tesla shares, told Business Insider that Musk's ""outsized influence"" over Tesla has spilled over in voting results.

Starting from September, Tesla ran ads across Facebook, Instagram, X, and Google that told shareholders they ""must retain and incentivize Elon"" and that ""transformative growth"" starts with ""aligning CEO pay with shareholder value.""

The board also aired an ad on Paramount+ urging shareholders to vote in alignment with the board's recommendations, concluding with ""the future of Tesla is in your hands.""

""From paid social media campaigns and TV advertisements to hiring a consultant to conduct proxy solicitations, Tesla took extraordinary measures to set up this vote in Musk's favor,"" said Patel.

Weeks ahead of the vote, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis both urged shareholders to reject the proposal. On Tuesday, Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, also said it had voted against the pay package over concerns that the company may become overly reliant on one individual, that being Musk. The fund is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional shareholder and the world's largest wealth fund.

Musk called the proxy firms ""corporate terrorists"" in a recent earnings call, and Tesla's chair warned shareholders in a letter in October that Musk could walk away from the company if his compensation wasn't approved.

Patel said that it would be hard to deduce how independent shareholders actually feel about the pay package without a full vote breakdown.

""In order to improve sales and stabilize Tesla's earnings, true innovation and growth at the company must be guided by strong governance, independent oversight, and transparent accountability,"" Patel added, ""Not by throwing money at the problem and concentrating more power in the hands of a single executive.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

High valuations for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the focus of the market this week, with fears of a potential AI bubble capping investor sentiment. But the view on Wall Street is still that several tech stocks offer strong fundamentals and are delivering rapid, AI-induced growth, justifying their sky-high valuations.

The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors find attractive AI stocks displaying  robust long-term growth outlooks.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN) recently impressed investors with its upbeat Q3 results. Accelerating growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit confirmed the Street's faith in Amazon's expansion into artificial intelligence.

In reaction to the solid Q3 print and the recently-announced deal with OpenAI, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley increased his price forecast for Amazon to $315 from $300 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock, with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $276.

Walmsley said that the Q3 performance, OpenAI deal and positive outlook for Amazon's Trainium chips made him more optimistic toward AWS's long-term growth. In fact, the 5-star analyst expects acceleration in AWS revenue growth from 20% in Q3 to 21% in Q4 2025 and 22% in the first quarter of 2026. He expects AWS revenue to rise by 23% to $157 billion in the full year 2026, followed by a 22% increase to $192 billion in 2027 — above the Street's expectations of $154 billion and $185 billion for 2026 and 2027, respectively.

""We believe investors continue to rotate into AMZN shares given a valuation well below its historic ranges and positive news likely to continue into the AWS ReInvent Conference in early December,"" said Walmsley.

The analyst's bullish investment thesis is also based on the cost-to-serve improvements in Amazon's retail business, driven by automation in fulfillment centers and an enhanced logistics network.

Walmsley ranks No. 103 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.

This second stock pick is Google- and YouTube owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with AI driving solid momentum in its cloud business.

Impressed by the Q3 performance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet to $340 from $300 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $316 with an ""outperform"" rating on GOOGL.

Anmuth highlighted that Q3 marked the first time that Alphabet's quarterly revenue crossed the $100 billion mark. The top-rated analyst noted Alphabet's robust performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth across every major business.

Interestingly, Anmuth believes that Q3 results and favorable insights on AI search formats could change investors' views toward Google's AI search transition. Alphabet noted AI-induced acceleration in query growth and paid clicks, while Anmuth noted that industry conversations indicate that paid clicks using Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM) features are driving higher conversion rates.

""Overall, the AI search transition has been viewed as the greatest risk to Google, but additional signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat will continue to flip the narrative,"" said Anmuth.

The analyst is also encouraged by the surge in Google Cloud's backlog to $155 billion. He contends that the figure doesn't include all the gains from the recently announced expansion of GOOGL's partnership with Anthropic, implying a further increase in the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter. Overall, Anmuth is confident about Alphabet's prospects and said it remains JPMorgan's Top 2 idea, behind only Amazon.

Anmuth ranks No. 113 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 22%. See Alphabet Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

The third tech giant this week is chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which delivered strong results in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. AMD attributed stronger earnings and revenue to its expanding compute business and fast-growing AI data center segment.

In reaction, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy increased his price target for AMD to $280 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. With a price target of $285, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on AMD stock.

Roy noted that AMD's Q3 top line was driven by strength across the company's data center, AI, server and PC businesses. The 5-star analyst highlighted management's optimism toward continued momentum in Q4 FY25, with revenue expected to grow 25% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. AMD expects Q4 revenue growth will be supported by strong performances in its data center, client and embedded businesses, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the gaming segment.

Interestingly, Roy believes that AMD's performance in the near-term is being fueled more by increasing demand for server central processing units and continued share gains in client CPUs rather than data center AI graphics processing units. The analyst expects AMD's data center AI GPU business to increase to a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion in FY25, versus a prior estimate of $5 billion.

""Looking ahead, we continue to believe that AMD is executing well as the company nears production shipments of the MI400/450 series GPUs and the Helios rack next year,"" Roy said.

The analyst is also optimistic on AMD's recently-announced deals with OpenAI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, saying they provide clarity on the longer-term growth outlook in its data center AI business. Roy awaits further insights from AMD about its technology roadmap and total addressable market (TAM)  at an upcoming Analyst Day event on November 11.

Roy ranks No. 20 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 34.4%. See AMD Statistics on TipRanks.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.

""I don't have notifications,"" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. ""If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.""

He added: ""The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.""

The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.

""When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,"" he said. ""When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.""

Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is ""disrespectful"" and ""wastes time.""

""If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,"" he said at the time.

He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.

Dimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.

Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.

Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the ""damage"" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.

""Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,"" he said in the recording.

""They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.""

He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. ""And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,"" he added.

Anastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.

She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.

""I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,"" Dedyukhina said.

That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.

The city of Lisbon in Portugal turns to tech next week, as it plays host to the annual Web Summit conference. The event, also known as the ""Davos for geeks,"" will feature some of the biggest names in technology at an interesting time for the sector. It attracted more than 70 ,000 attendees last year.

Main stage attractions include leaders from Meta, Lovable, Qualcomm and Microsoft to name just a few. CNBC's Arjun Kharpal will be on the ground, speaking to big players, including the CEOs of Lyft, Oura, DeepL and Cohere.

The event comes as the AI-fueled market rally faces increased scrutiny from investors, big market voices, politicians and regulators. Concerns of a bubble in the sector spooked global markets into a rollercoaster week, after famed short-seller Michael Burry placed a massive $1.1 billion bet against AI darlings Nvidia and Palantir.

But can this take the shine off AI at Web Summit in Portugal this week? If the program is anything to go by, not only is AI the dominant topic, but also the answer to almost every question. Headline panels are titled ""Smarter plays: How AI is changing the game,"" ""The age of AI,"" ""The Future of AI is visual,"" and the ""AI talent wars."" No mention of bubbles or over-inflated valuations.

The recent whiplash against major AI stocks from Silicon Valley to London to Tokyo will certainly cast a shadow on the event, but there is something else that's also causing a headache to tech honchos as they look to arrive in Lisbon next week. 

According to reports, there is a private jet logjam at Lisbon airport which has seen some planes forced to turn away and land at airports over 2 hours from the city. The Web Summit organizers reportedly told attendees, ""Please be advised there is currently a shortage of private jet slots during Web Summit at Lisbon airport and surrounding smaller airports.""

Monday: CoreWeave, MedioBanca

Tuesday: Vodafone, Porsche

Wednesday: Infineon, Cisco Systems

Thursday: Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, Alibaba, Walt Disney

Nuclear power is back, largely due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, including big tech's hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers across the country and the reshoring of manufacturing. But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation.

In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder.

There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success.

But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. Almost all of the 94 reactors currently operating in 28 states, generating about 20% of the nation's electricity, were built between 1967 and 1990. And though often unspoken, there's the prickly issue that's been grappled with ever since the first nuclear energy wave during the 1960s and '70s: how to store, manage and dispose of radioactive waste, the toxic byproduct of harnessing uranium to generate electricity — and portions of which remain hazardous for millennia.

Solutions, employing old and new technologies, are under development by a number of private and public companies and in collaboration with the Department of Energy, which is required by law to accept and store spent nuclear fuel.

The most viable solution for permanently storing nuclear waste was first proffered back in 1957 by the National Academy of Sciences. Its report recommended burying the detritus in deep underground repositories (as opposed to the long-since-abandoned notion of blasting it into low-Earth orbit). It wasn't until 1982, though, that Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, assigning the DOE responsibility for finding such a site.

Five years later, lawmakers designated Yucca Mountain, a 6,700-foot promontory about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, as the nation's sole geological repository. Thus began a contentious, years-long saga — involving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, legislators, lawyers, geologic experts, industry officials and local citizens — that delayed, defunded and ultimately mothballed the project in 2010.

Other nations have moved forward with the idea. Finland, for instance, is nearing completion of the world's first permanent underground disposal site for its five reactors' waste. Sweden has started construction on a similar project, and France, Canada and Switzerland are in the early stages of their subterranean disposal sites.

An American startup, Deep Isolation Nuclear, is combining the underground burial concept with oil-and-gas fracking techniques. The methodology, called deep borehole disposal, is achieved by drilling 18-inch vertical tunnels thousands of feet below ground, then turning horizontal. Corrosion-resistant canisters — each 16 feet long, 15 inches in diameter and weighing 6,000 pounds — containing nuclear waste are forced down into the horizontal sections, stacked side-by-side and stored, conceivably, for thousands of years.

Deep Isolation foresees co-locating its boreholes at active and decommissioned nuclear plants, according to CEO Rod Baltzer. ""Eighty percent look like they have good shale or granite formations nearby,"" he said, referring to a geologic prerequisite. ""That means we would not have to transport the waste"" and the risk of highway or railway crashes unleashing radioactive material.

The company has received grants from the DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy program, Baltzer said, and in July closed a reverse merger transaction, an alternative to an IPO for going public. Through that deal, he said, ""we raised money for a full-scale demonstration project [in Cameron, Texas]. It will probably be early 2027 by the time we get that fully implemented.""

An entirely different, old-is-new-again technology, pioneered in the mid-1940s during the Manhattan Project, is gathering steam. It involves reprocessing spent fuel to extract uranium and other elements to create new fuel to power small modular reactors. The process is being explored by several startups, including Curio, Shine Technologies and Oklo. France has been utilizing reprocessed nuclear fuel at its vast network of reactors since the 1970s.

Oklo has gained attention among investors drawn to its two-pronged approach to nuclear energy. The company — which went public via a SPAC in 2024, after early-stage funding from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Peter Thiel's venture capital firm and others — announced in September that it is earmarking $1.68 billion to build an advanced fuel reprocessing facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Concurrently, the company signed an agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority ""to explore how we can take used nuclear fuel sitting on its sites and convert it into fuel we can use in our reactors,"" said a company spokeswoman.

That refers to the TVA's three nuclear reactors — two in Tennessee, another in Alabama — as well as the other part of Oklo's business model, which focuses on constructing SMRs. In September, the company broke ground in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on its Aurora fast reactor, a type of SMR that will use reprocessed nuclear fuel. ""We're working on [reprocessing] the fuel right now, so that we can turn on the plant around late 2027 or early 2028,"" the Oklo spokeswoman said. The separate Oak Ridge facility, she said, is expected to begin producing fuel by the early 2030s.

Oklo exemplifies both the promise and the perplexity associated with the rebirth of nuclear power. On one hand is the attraction of repurposing nuclear waste and building dozens of SMRs to electrify AI data centers and factories. On the other hand, the company has no facilities in full operation, is awaiting final approval from the NRC for its Aurora reactor, and is producing no revenue. Oklo's stock has risen nearly 429% this year, with a current market valuation of more than $16.5 billion, but share prices have fluctuated over the past month.

""It's a high-risk name because it's pre-revenue, and I anticipate that the company will need to provide more details around its Aurora reactor plans, as well as the [fuel reprocessing] program on the [November 11] earnings report call,"" said Jed Dorsheimer, an energy industry analyst at William Blair in a late October interview. ""But we haven't changed our [outperform] rating on the name as of right now,"" he added.

In the meantime, more than 95,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel (about 10,000 tons is from weapons programs) sits temporarily stockpiled aboveground in special water-filled pools or dry casks at 79 sites in 39 states, while about 2,000 metric tons are being produced every year. That's a lot of tonnage, but requires perspective. The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade association, states that the entirety of spent fuel produced in the U.S. since the 1950s would cover a football field to a depth of about 12 yards.

But because the DOE, despite its mandate, still hasn't found a permanent disposal facility for nuclear waste, taxpayers pay utilities up to $800 million every year in damages. Since 1998, the federal government has paid out $11.1 billion, and the tab is projected to reach as much as $44.5 billion in the future.

The DOE's Department of Nuclear Energy has initiated several programs to address nuclear waste, including coordination with Deep Isolation and Oklo. The agency declined to comment on its efforts in this area, citing the federal government shutdown.

Opponents to nuclear power cite the well-documented accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania (1979), Chernobyl in Ukraine (1986) and Fukushima in Japan (2011) — all three which resulted in radiation leaks, and, at Chernobyl and Fukushima, related deaths — as reasons enough to halt building new reactors. Following Fukushima, Japan, Germany and some other nations shut down or suspended operations. Japan has since restarted its nuclear energy program, and its new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is expected to accelerate it.

There's also the viewpoint, related to climate change, that nuclear energy is a emissions-free power source — and unlike solar and wind runs 24/7/365 — that produces relatively manageable waste.

""If you walk up to recently discharged spent fuel and get really close to it, you'll probably get a lethal dose of radiation,"" said Allison Macfarlane, professor and director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, as well as the chair of the NRC from 2012–2014. ""But is it this huge, massive problem? No, it's solvable."" By comparison, she said, ""we are under much graver threat from fossil fuel emissions than we are from nuclear waste.""

As far as nuclear waste, ""we need to put [it] deep underground,"" Macfarlane said.

That was the recommendation of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, created by the Obama administration in 2010 after the Yucca Mountain project was defunded, on which she served. Macfarlane deems spent fuel reprocessing as far too expensive and a source of new waste streams, and dismisses deep borehole disposal as a ""non-starter.""

""You think you're going to be able to put waste packages down a hole and they're not going to get stuck on the way?"" she said.

Macfarlane said that the Trump administration's fast-tracking of new reactors is neither realistic nor achievable, but ""I certainly would not support shutting down the operating reactors. I'm not anti-nuclear, but I'm practical.""

She added that while nuclear may not face the current intermittent production challenges of renewables, it is one of the most expensive forms of electricity production, especially compared to utility-scale solar, wind and natural gas.

Nonetheless, the rush to build new reactors — and generate even more waste — marches on alongside the data center boom. Google and NextEra Energy are teaming up to reopen Iowa's Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant that closed five years ago. Microsoft and Constellation Energy plan to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor in 2028. And Meta has signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation and its Clinton, Illinois, nuclear facility.

Although no SMRs have been completed yet in the U.S., several projects are under development by companies including NuScale Power, Holtec International, Kairos Power and X-Energy, which has received backing from Amazon. The only SMR actually under construction is from Bill Gates' co-founded TerraPower, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, which aims to be operational by the end of 2030.

Those long timelines alone should be a deterrent, said Tim Judson, executive director of the Nuclear Information Resource Service, a nonprofit advocate for a nuclear-free world. ""It is fanciful to think that nuclear energy is going to be helpful in dealing with the increases in electricity demand from data centers,"" he said, ""because nuclear power plants take so long to build and the data centers are being built today.""

And then there's the waste issue, Judson said. ""I'm not sure that the tech industry has really thought through whether they want to be responsible for managing nuclear waste at their data center sites.""

But you can count Gates, the big tech billionaire who was backing nuclear even before the AI data center boom, as having not only thought about the waste problem, but dismissed it as major impediment. ""The waste problems should not be a reason to not do nuclear,"" Gates said in an interview with the German business publication Handelsblatt back in 2023. ""The amount of waste involved ... that's not a reason not to do nuclear. ... Say the U.S. was completely nuclear-powered — it's a few rooms worth of total waste. So it's not a gigantic thing,"" Gates said.

When Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. Six years later, not only have they tied the knot — they're also business partners.

""I downloaded Tinder because I was very bored in school, so I was just [swiping] through during class,"" said Zhuo. ""Both of us — we didn't expect that we'd get together,"" she said.

""Personality wise, we are quite different,"" she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party.

Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It.

The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities.

CakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents.

""My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine,"" said Zhuo. ""I was never very studious, but I really like being hands on. So I like to bake, I like to dance. I like to create all these little pretty things,"" she said. From the early days of the business, she often helped with designing cakes.

Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. With her parents contemplating retirement, Zhuo knew it was time for her to step in.

""I [felt] that it's a waste to just let it go. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down,"" she said.

In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. She eventually introduced two new brands — Eggyi.Co, which sells bento cakes, or mini, single-serving sized cakes targeted at Gen-Z, and Petissier which sells customised cakes for pets.

The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes.

Similar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up.

""I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing,"" said Chan. ""Since I was 16, I did my own little startups, selling whatever. [I sold] sneakers, I'd buy them, clean them up and sell them. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it,"" he said.

In 2022, he decided to join his wife in the family business full-time. He introduced a new strategy: rather than only selling directly to individual consumers (B2C), he suggested trying to sell to other businesses (B2B) to create a more consistent source of revenue.

In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town.

In June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake.

""It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... They posted a story of them in a hotel, and I thought: 'Hey, this looks really familiar. I know [which] hotel this is,'"" he said. ""So I just prepared a cake and then we just zoomed down to the hotel.""

Chan and his team quickly made a custom cake for the sisters and timed the delivery to coincide with the end of the Ha sisters' event. ""Of course, after the pop-up, you have to go back to [the hotel to] change, right? Yeah. So [that's when I] went there,"" he said.

By chance, his timing was perfect. Just as he arrived at the hotel entrance with the cake in hand, he ran into the sisters — and managed to hand-deliver the surprise. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views.

This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more.

Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal.

""We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities,"" said Chan.

Oops, something went wrong

Robert Kiyosaki anticipates a substantial increase in Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) value, setting a target of $250,000, despite cautioning about a potential “massive crash.”

In a post on X, Kiyosaki shared his investment goals for 2026, which include $27,000 for gold, $250,000 for Bitcoin, $100 for silver, and $60 for Ethereum.

His Ethereum forecast raised eyebrows, as the digital currency hasn't seen double-digit values in a long time, sparking speculation that Kiyosaki might have intended to say $6,000 or $60,000.

CRASH COMING: Why I am buying not selling.My target price for Gold is $27k. I got this price from friend Jim Rickards….and I own two goldmines.I began buying gold in 1971….the year Nixon took gold from the US Dollar.Nixon violated Greshams Law, which states ""When fake…

Kiyosaki, a gold investor since 1971 when Nixon eliminated the dollar's gold backing, sees Bitcoin as the digital equivalent of gold and Ethereum as the driving force of the new financial network. In the post, he argues these assets follow what he calls the laws of money, not political cycles.

Also Read: US Baby Boomers Face Impending Homelessness Crisis, Warns Robert Kiyosaki: ‘They Are Going To Be Wiped Out, Will Be Homeless'

The author criticizes the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve for breaching these laws by creating “fake dollars” to finance government expenditure.

Despite market crashes, Kiyosaki continues to amass gold, silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, stating that true wealth is accumulated during periods of fear, not during times of euphoria.

According to Kiyosaki, the impending downturn will not obliterate the market but will expose those who possess money that cannot be printed.

Why It Matters: Kiyosaki's predictions come at a time when cryptocurrencies are under intense scrutiny, with fluctuating prices and regulatory concerns. His views on Bitcoin and Ethereum underscore the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate investment asset.

However, his warnings about a “massive crash” reflect the inherent risks and volatility associated with these digital assets.

His investment strategy of accumulating wealth during fear periods could serve as a guide for investors navigating the unpredictable cryptocurrency market.

Michael Saylor is not done yet. The billionaire founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which he transformed into the world's largest Bitcoin treasury, just posted an update showing a $65.45 billion portfolio with the single caption: ""Best continue.""

As of Nov. 9, 2025, Strategy holds 641,205 BTC at an average cost basis of $74,064, representing an unrealized gain of 38% — $18 billion in profit right now. The chart Saylor shared shows 85 purchase events, with the latest occurring this week when 397 more BTC were added, according to BitcoinTreasuries data.

Each orange circle in the visualization reflects the continuous inflows of the cryptocurrency that were made even during multi-month corrections in 2022. This created a running cost basis line that now sits far below Bitcoin's current trading range of about $102,000.

₿est Continue pic.twitter.com/gDnOoBH7Ad

Thanks to Bitcoin's 700% growth since the FTX crash in November 2022, Strategy's market cap has risen to $69 billion basic and $77 billion diluted, while its enterprise value stands at $84 billion — indicating a premium of up to 1.28x mNAV.

How much Bitcoin did Saylor and Strategy buy this week?

As intended, Saylor's post hints at another round of Bitcoin accumulation that happened last week. If one would try to guess based on recent activity from Strategy, then a buy in the 300-500 BTC range is pretty possible.

Interestingly, despite concerns about over-leveraging, the firm's debt ratios remain stable after refinancing its 2028 notes, suggesting the Bitcoin strategy remains in play — buy more, borrow later and wait for BTC to do the dirty work.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin can still end the year with a bang, according to Bitmine (NYSE:BMNR) chair and Fundstrat investment chief Tom Lee.

“I think we can still get to $150,000-$200,000 for Bitcoin, and then something like $7,000 for Ethereum,” Lee told CNBC on Monday.

The analyst's continued bullishness comes despite Bitcoin's disappointing performance last month.

Investors entered the month with high hopes as it has historically been one of Bitcoin's strongest months, so much so that it earned the nickname ‘Uptober.' However, for the first time since 2018, the asset failed to close higher at the end of the month, finishing 4% lower instead.

One reason for Bitcoin's ‘Uptober' flop was market panic over U.S.-China trade tensions. On Oct. 10, President Donald Trump announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, sparking a record $19 billion liquidation event in the cryptocurrency market.

Lee said on Monday that the cryptocurrency market was still healing from the crash, but added that fundamentals pointed to a near-term recovery.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

“We're only a couple weeks from that, so I think the market is consolidating,” he said, referring to the Oct. 10 crash. “But if I look at fundamentals, like Ethereum stablecoin volumes have been exploding, application revenues at all-time highs. So right now, fundamentals are leading price in crypto. So I think eventually we consolidate, and then we rally into year-end.”

Beyond the cryptocurrency market, Lee waxed bullish on equities. He said the S&P 500 could surge as much as 2.5% this month and reach $7,500 by year's end despite concerns over U.S.-China relations and perceived hawkishness from the Federal Reserve.

Lee said inflation is falling faster than many expect. He also added that jobs were not strengthening due to artificial intelligence. The combination of these factors offered a strong case for more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, he said, despite remarks to the contrary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week.

Lee also cited continued bearish investor sentiment and gross underperformance of fund managers, despite a positive year for markets, as potential contrarian indicators. “I think there's a big performance chase into year-end,” he said.

Lee is not the only prominent market watcher to remain bullish as the year comes to a close.

Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick last month maintained his $200,000 year-end price prediction for Bitcoin.

Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) Chair Michael Saylor has also recently maintained that he expects Bitcoin to reach $150,000 this year.

Bitcoin was most recently trading just above $100,000.

Ethereum (ETH) is trading in the high $3,000s after dropping from above $4,300 in early October, with $4,000 now a key psychological resistance level.

Ethereum ETFs pulled in over $2.8B during one week in August, but recent outflows suggest weakening institutional demand as major players trimmed positions.

The Fusaka upgrade launches December 3 to boost data throughput and lower gas fees, though Layer 2 solutions are reducing main chain fee revenue.

Some investors get rich while others struggle because they never learned there are two completely different strategies to building wealth. Don't make the same mistake, learn about both here.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) is making another run at $4,000, and investors are split on whether it can hold this time. After a rollercoaster year (rallying above $4,700 in August, then sliding hard in October), ETH is currently hovering in the high $3,000s.

The drop below $4,000 has market watchers picking sides. Some see warning signs of a deeper correction. Others point to improving fundamentals that could fuel a comeback. The gaping question remains: Can ETH break back above $4,000 and actually hold it?

2025 has been messy for Ethereum. In early October, ETH rode BTC's wave past $4,300 as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high. That rally lasted about five minutes. Geopolitical tensions triggered a market-wide sell-off, and Ethereum dropped to the mid-$3,000s within days.

But the bounce was just as fast. Institutional buyers stepped in hard, pushing ETH back above $4,000 by mid-October. Then came the inevitable profit-taking. By late October, ETH had slipped back below $4,000 and was trading near $3,800 on Halloween.

Now investor confidence in Ethereum seems to be creeping back. Fresh ETF money is flowing in, network upgrades are landing, and the $4,000 level is back in focus as the psychological line Ethereum needs to cross.

Ethereum bulls think this dip is just a rest stop before the next leg up. Here's what's backing that confidence:

Institutional Money Still Flowing: Wall Street hasn't given up on ETH. The launch of Ethereum ETFs this year opened the gates to mainstream capital in a big way. Over the summer, Ethereum ETFs pulled in record inflows. More than $2.8 billion poured in during a single week in August, crushing Bitcoin fund flows at the time.

Network Upgrades Hitting: Ethereum keeps getting better under the hood. The ""Fusaka"" upgrade drops December 3 and should boost data throughput significantly. More capacity, lower gas fees. That's the goal. Right now, ETH's network activity is nearing a 2025 high, but fees haven't exploded like they did in past bull runs. If Ethereum can scale without pricing out users, that's a huge win.

Price Targets Still Ambitious: Plenty of analysts expect ETH to push past its previous all-time high of $4,865. CoinGape recently forecasted a $5,000 target, especially if Fusaka delivers. Five-figure predictions are still floating around from credible sources. The bull case is now a matter of “when, not if” ETH eventually powers back above $4K, and keeps climbing.

Despite the fresh bullish Ethereum price predictions, the bears aren't buying the optimism. Here's their counter-argument:

Weakening Institutional Enthusiasm: ETFs brought a wave of institutional money earlier this year, but that tide seems to be turning. Fund flows went negative in recent weeks. In late October, Ethereum spot ETFs saw heavy outflows. BlackRock and other major players trimmed their ETH positions as the market declined. When the smart money starts heading for the exits, that's worth paying attention to.

Macro Headwinds and Competition: High interest rates and recession fears are still hanging over risk assets like crypto. If the Federal Reserve stays hawkish, speculative investments like ETH could keep struggling. And when that happens, Ethereum could tank to $3,000 all over again.

Network Fees and Scaling Solutions Headaches: There's also the Layer 2 problem. Ethereum's push to scale through networks like Base and Arbitrum is great for users (lower fees, faster transactions). But it's also siphoning activity away from the main chain, which means less fee revenue getting burned. Standard Chartered just slashed its year-end ETH target to $4,000 (down from $10,000), partly because of this Layer 2 migration.

The $4,000 level is where the bulls and bears fight plays out. Bulls have institutional backing, network improvements, and ambitious price forecasts on their side. Bears see weakening fund flows, macro uncertainty, and structural challenges eating into Ethereum's value. Whichever narrative wins determines whether ETH reclaims $4,000 or keeps sliding. Right now, it's anyone's game, and it'll be a crucial tussle heading into the new year.

By CryptoNinjas Editorial Team

Ethereum and Solana continue to hold their positions as two of the strongest players in the crypto market. Both networks offer fast transactions, large communities, and powerful developer ecosystems. However, despite their strengths, a new generation of utility-focused tokens is emerging.

Digitap's fast-growing crypto presale, live financial app, and real-world banking features have positioned it far ahead of other emerging projects. Investors are rushing to buy top altcoins that offer practical use rather than speculation. 



Digitap is attracting attention faster than almost any other new token because it solves real financial problems. It is not just a blockchain project; it is a full banking alternative built for global users. The Digitap app is now live on both iOS and Android, enabling users to send, spend, convert, and store both cryptocurrencies and fiat in one place.

A major feature is the Visa-backed Digitap Card, which works online and in stores worldwide. Users can create unlimited virtual cards with no KYC, link them to Apple Pay or Google Pay, and enjoy privacy-first financial freedom. This gives Digitap real utility that traditional altcoins do not offer.

Digitap's AI Smart Routing system automatically finds the best exchange paths for international transfers. This keeps global fees around 1%, which is lower than those charged by traditional banks. For freelancers, travelers, remote workers, and global businesses, this feature alone is game-changing.

Its crypto presale has gained massive traction, raising over $1.6 million so far. With a price of $0.0297, set to rise to $0.0313 in the next round, early investors are getting a strong value entry before exchange listings.

Digitap also uses deflationary tokenomics. Each transaction supports buybacks and burns, reducing supply over time. With staking rewards that can reach up to 124% APR during presale, Digitap combines early-stage growth with strong long-term incentives.



Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications. Its smart contract capabilities have powered DeFi, NFTs, and major blockchain innovation for years. No other chain has matched its influence on Web3 development.

Even so, Ethereum is now in a more stable phase of growth. It attracts builders, institutions, and long-term holders, but its mature position limits the explosive upside that early-stage investors often look for. This is why some traders are exploring new utility tokens that have more room to grow.

Ethereum remains strong and reliable, but analysts believe it's price has stalled this month. But for investors searching for the best crypto to buy now for high-potential gains, emerging projects with fresh utility like Digitap offer a different kind of opportunity.

Solana continues to rank as one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. Its low fees and high-speed architecture make it a favourite for developers building consumer apps, games, and trading tools. The community is strong, and adoption remains high.

Yet Solana, like Ethereum, has matured. Its price actions reflects a network with stability rather than explosive early-stage potential. This is not a weakness but a natural progression for a major ecosystem with millions of users.

Because of this, investors who want fast growth or entry-level pricing often look toward newer altcoins to buy, especially those with real-world functionality. And Digitap, with its working app and rapid adoption, is becoming the top crypto to buy for these investors.

Ethereum and Solana continue to be strong pillars of the crypto space. They are reliable, established, and essential to Web3 development. But the next wave of growth is coming from practical financial tools, real-world utility, and early-stage entries.

Investors today want tokens that offer practical use rather than mere speculation. Digitap's focus on global payments, privacy-first banking, and instant card access gives it a competitive advantage in a world where digital finance is rapidly expanding. As the global payments market heads toward $250 trillion by 2027, tokens positioned in this sector stand to benefit the most.

Every bull run brings a new set of champions. From Bitcoin's early dominance to the rise of Ethereum, Solana, and meme tokens like Dogecoin, each cycle redefines what “winning” means in crypto. Bitcoin price has been at its peak for a long period, and now is the time for market corrections. As BTC rates stabilize, investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy now for the next bull run. The newer launches are ready to break through and disrupt the crypto landscape.

Recent market trends have observed that gaming and decentralised finance tokens are back into investor focus. These segments are supported by increasing blockchain adoption and institutional funding. Tapzi (TAPZI) is the next crypto to explode in the digital gaming landscape, and analysts call it the potential leader in this segment.

Here is the list of the five best altcoins to invest in and shape your crypto portfolio for the next bull run.

Tapzi (TAPZI) is the crypto that redefines the gaming concept on blockchains. Its skill-to-earn model is an innovation on the BNB chain that gives faster transactions and lower fees. The rewarding system of the platform is truly performance-based and not by chance. In the past, most gaming models were based on play-to-earn structures that relied on passive income and market hype. However, Tapzi (TAPZI), the new crypto coin in town, builds a transparent and skill-based structure that directly affects the rewarding system.



The platform's real-time wealth generation is what makes it different and stands out in the crowd. Tapzi (TAPZI) has planned staking rewards, developer partnerships, and multi-chain expansions this year. If the roadmap is successfully achieved, Tapzi (TAPZI) is sure to grow beyond hype.

Its presale numbers speak volumes. Tapzi (TAPZI) has already sold more than 98 million tokens in phase 1 and is reaching the 100M milestone soon. With every stage, the token price climbs steadily. TAPZI, priced at $0.0035 currently, is projected to list at $0.01, which gives investors nearly 186% profit in the short term. If the market continues to reflect bullish momentum in early 2026, the token price is expected to hit $0.08-$0.15. This high and sustainable growth opportunity is the key highlight of the crypto landscape.

Tapzi (TAPZI) has a vast audience base, including casual gamers and crypto enthusiasts. The unique gaming landscape attracts gamers, of course, but also interests streamers and creators who wish to monetize their digital skills. All one needs to do is join the Tapzi (TAPZI) presale, acquire tokens, and stake them to participate, play, and win.

Why it could outplay others: Tapzi's combination of fairness, gameplay depth, and real user engagement gives it real staying power and not just speculative value.

Presale Snapshot:

Verdict: Tapzi is arguably the best altcoin to buy now for investors looking for sustainable GameFi exposure and early-stage upside.

While Tapzi represents the next generation of gaming projects, Gala Games remains a veteran powerhouse. With multiple Web3 titles like Spider Tanks and TownStar, Gala has already proven that blockchain gaming can attract both developers and players.

GALA tokens are used to power in-game transactions, node rewards, and community governance. The ecosystem's continuous development, along with a strong focus on entertainment and ownership, makes it a solid long-term play.

Currently, GALA trades around $0.045, significantly below its all-time high, offering room for growth as the market shifts bullish again. If GameFi continues to attract mainstream attention, Gala's established infrastructure could benefit from the renewed momentum.

Why it matters: Gala's strength lies in its experience and partnerships, a solid option for conservative GameFi investors.

In the DeFi space, Aave has remained a consistent leader. Known for its lending and borrowing protocol, it allows users to earn interest on deposits or borrow assets without intermediaries. Aave's technology is secure, audited, and proven, with a total value locked (TVL) exceeding $8 billion across chains.

Aave has quietly evolved, introducing GHO stablecoin and cross-chain integrations. As of now, AAVE trades near $110, up from $65 earlier this year, signaling a slow but steady uptrend.

Why it's one of the best altcoins to buy now: Aave represents stability amid market volatility. It's a blue-chip DeFi token that benefits directly from growing on-chain liquidity and institutional interest.

While it might not be 20x overnight, its strength lies in long-term reliability, which is perfect for investors balancing Tapzi's high-growth GameFi exposure with lower-risk assets.

No bull market is complete without meme coins, and Pepe continues to dominate social media and trading circles alike. What started as a cultural joke turned into a top-100 crypto asset, largely fueled by community power.

PEPE's trading volume consistently ranks among the highest in its category, reflecting active participation and retail enthusiasm. Its price, currently around $0.0000011, has shown resilience despite volatility.

While meme tokens are risky, they thrive in speculative cycles, and Pepe's established reputation gives it a better survival chance than newer projects.

Why it still matters: As retail traders return, meme coins like Pepe often lead early rallies, offering short-term profit potential.

Born during Solana's recovery phase, Bonk has turned into a symbol of community revival. Distributed to Solana users as an airdrop, BONK gained popularity as the “people's meme coin.” Its integration across Solana dApps and games makes it more than just a joke. It's part of the chain's growing identity.

BONK is trading near $0.000022, with an active community and constant burn events helping to stabilize supply. Analysts expect it to perform well if Solana continues its upward trajectory in 2025.

Why investors like it: Bonk merges fun with function, showing how meme coins can fuel user engagement in major ecosystems.

Tapzi's ongoing presale is creating massive buzz across social media and investor groups. With each phase closing ahead of schedule, demand has been outpacing expectations. The team has also announced upcoming cross-chain integration, mobile game releases, and partnerships with indie studios, signaling that Tapzi is building real value, not just hype.

What sets Tapzi apart from other presales is its transparent roadmap and continuous updates. The developers release progress reports after every milestone, which has built confidence among early buyers.

If Tapzi maintains its growth rate and achieves a market cap of even $150 million post-launch, early $500 investments could easily grow 10x or more, according to early community projections.

The best portfolio for the next bull run combines multiple themes like innovation from GameFi, stability from DeFi, and viral energy from memes. Here's a simple approach investors are using:

This kind of balanced allocation captures upside while limiting downside risk, especially as Bitcoin consolidation tends to rotate liquidity into altcoins.

As crypto gears up for its next bull cycle, investors are again asking the same question: what is the best altcoin to buy now?

The answer depends on your goals, but one thing is clear: utility-driven projects like Tapzi are reshaping the market narrative. It's not just about holding tokens anymore; it's about participating, playing, and earning in ecosystems that value engagement over speculation.

With its ongoing presale success, strong roadmap, and real-world appeal, Tapzi stands out as a top crypto to buy now for 2025's biggest breakout.

Something went wrong

Decentralized finance (DeFi) industry suffered one of its toughest weeks in months as total value locked (TVL) across major networks fell sharply.

According to Sentora data, DeFi protocols on Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, BNB Smart Chain, and Base all recorded double-digit declines.

This reflected a broad pullback in user activity as market conditions shifted and security incidents intensified.

Additional data from DeFiLlama shows that Ethereum, the largest DeFi ecosystem, has seen its TVL drop by roughly 13% to approximately $74.2 billion. Despite the setback, Ethereum still controls over 62% of the sector.

Solana and Arbitrum experienced even sharper declines, each losing about 14% of their locked value. Their TVLs now stand at approximately $10 billion and $3 billion, respectively.

Solana, however, maintains its position as the second-largest DeFi chain, with more than 8% of the market share.

BNB Smart Chain and Base were not spared, shedding around 10% and 12% of their TVLs.

As these losses accumulated, total DeFi TVL slid from nearly $150 billion to $130 billion, signaling a marked slowdown in borrowing, lending, and staking activities across the ecosystem.

Meanwhile, security breaches exacerbated the TVL decline as a series of high-impact exploits rattled users and deepened an already weak market.

On November 3, Balancer—one of the industry's longest-running DeFi platforms—suffered one of the largest exploits of the year. Attackers drained more than $120 million from its V2 vaults.

In a detailed explanation on X, the team linked the breach to a rounding error in the upscale function for EXACT_OUT swaps inside the vault's batchSwap feature. The feature allows users to bundle multiple swaps in a single transaction to reduce gas costs.

""Attackers were able to exploit the incorrect rounding behavior in combination with the batchSwap functionality to manipulate pool balances and extract value. In many instances, the exploited funds remained within the Vault as internal balances before being withdrawn in subsequent transactions,"" it stated.

Meanwhile, a second major disruption occurred shortly after when Stream Finance announced that approximately $93 million in assets managed by an external fund manager had gone missing.

In response, the protocol halted all withdrawals and deposits. It also stated that pending deposits would not be processed, and began pulling what remained of its liquid assets.

The fallout spread quickly as Elixir, a DeFi liquidity provider, said the incident forced it to wind down its deUSD synthetic dollar stablecoin.

Together, these events intensified scrutiny of DeFi's underlying architecture.

The back-to-back failures underscored how sophisticated attackers can still exploit design flaws, governance gaps, and imperfect smart-contract logic. These incidents reinforced long-standing concerns about the sector's structural vulnerabilities.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Jared Esguerra: Redefining the Future of Blockchain and Finance","https://hauteliving.com/2025/11/inside-the-mind-of-jared-esguerra-a-decade-of-innovation-in-blockchain-and-finance/779925/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:11:11 GMT","

In an era defined by rapid technological evolution and financial reinvention, few figures have navigated the crossroads of blockchain and finance with as much foresight and precision as Jared Esguerra. Over the past decade, Esguerra has emerged as one of the most forward-thinking investors in fintech and crypto currency traders— a rare blend of visionary strategist, disciplined investor, and hands-on builder. His story isn't just one of financial success; it's a masterclass in how to anticipate disruption, harness emerging technologies, and shape the future of an entire industry.

Jared Esguerra's journey into the world of fintech began long before blockchain became a buzzword. Early in his career, he cut his teeth in traditional finance.

But it was this very exposure that made Esguerra question the system he was part of. He noticed how outdated infrastructure, slow transaction systems, and regulatory red tape limited innovation in banking and finance. He saw an opportunity — not just to optimize the system, but to reinvent it.

Then came the breakthrough moment: the discovery of blockchain technology. To many, Bitcoin was a speculative gamble; to Esguerra, it was the spark of a new financial paradigm. He saw past the hype and volatility to the underlying principle — the ability to transfer value without intermediaries, to record trust through code rather than centralized institutions. “What excited me wasn't just digital currency,” Esguerra has said in interviews. “It was the promise of a new kind of infrastructure — programmable money, programmable trust.”

As blockchain technology evolved, Esguerra positioned himself not as a mere investor, but as a bridge between two worlds: traditional finance and decentralized innovation. His unique strength lay in translating complex blockchain principles into financially sound, scalable opportunities.

Esguerra began working on blockchain projects, focusing on those that solved real problems — not just those chasing hype.

Among his early investments were blockchain-based lending platforms and digital payment infrastructures that aimed to simplify cross-border transactions. At the time, these ideas seemed niche. Today, they underpin billions of dollars in decentralized financial activity.

Esguerra's thesis was simple yet profound: finance and technology are no longer separate industries — they are converging into one ecosystem. This foresight allowed him to identify trends years before they hit mainstream awareness. From stablecoins to decentralized identity verification, Esguerra's portfolio reflects a consistent focus on the infrastructure layer of fintech — the systems that make financial innovation possible.

Over the past ten years, Esguerra's track record reads like a timeline of fintech's evolution. Early on, he championed digital payment platforms that reduced friction for emerging markets, empowering small businesses to transact globally with minimal fees. Later, he turned his attention to DeFi — the movement to recreate financial instruments like lending, borrowing, and trading using blockchain technology.

Where many investors saw DeFi as risky and experimental, Esguerra saw its inevitability. He understood that the financial system's central intermediaries — banks, brokers, clearinghouses — were ripe for disruption. “Every layer of finance that charges a fee for access or validation,” he once remarked, “is an opportunity for decentralized innovation.”

What sets Jared Esguerra apart isn't just his technical knowledge or investment acumen — it's his mindset. He's guided by a blend of patience, pragmatism, and long-term thinking that's increasingly rare in a fast-moving industry.

Esguerra often emphasizes strategic foresight — the ability to look several years ahead, anticipate market trends, and act before they become obvious. He's known for identifying “inflection points” — moments when technology shifts from experimentation to real-world adoption.

Equally important is his emphasis on discipline. In an industry prone to hype cycles, Esguerra is deliberate about when to enter and exit markets. He studies macroeconomic conditions, token velocity, governance models, and long-term adoption metrics. His decision-making process is both quantitative and intuitive — data-driven, yet deeply informed by experience and human insight.

Despite his success, Esguerra has never been blind to the challenges that come with innovation. The blockchain and fintech sectors are fraught with volatility, fraud risks, and evolving regulations. Rather than avoiding these complexities, Esguerra confronts them head-on.

He has worked closely with compliance experts to help shape balanced frameworks for decentralized finance. His goal is to ensure that innovation can thrive responsibly, without compromising consumer protection or financial stability.

As he looks toward the future, Jared Esguerra remains as curious and driven as ever. He sees the next decade as one defined by convergence — the merging of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics into a unified fintech ecosystem.

AI-driven risk assessment, blockchain-secured transactions, and decentralized digital identity are no longer theoretical concepts; they're becoming the new foundation of finance. Esguerra is already investing at this intersection — those using AI to analyze on-chain data, or creating blockchain frameworks.

But even as technology evolves, Esguerra's guiding principle stays constant: innovation must empower. For him, fintech isn't just about creating smarter systems — it's about creating fairer systems. The ultimate goal is a financial landscape that is borderless, inclusive, and transparent — one that gives every individual, regardless of geography, equal access to opportunity.

Inside the mind of Esguerra lies a blend of data-driven insight, creative foresight, and unshakable conviction in the power of technology to reshape finance. Over a decade of innovation, he has proven that true success in fintech comes not from chasing trends, but from anticipating transformations — and building the systems that make them possible.

As blockchain continues to mature and fintech continues to expand into every corner of the global economy, Jared Esguerra's influence will only grow. He is not just investing in companies; he's investing in the future of finance itself — one block, one vision, one innovation at a time.

Binance is set to list Janction's JCT token on its Alpha and Futures platforms starting November 10. This listing marks a key moment for Janction, a blockchain project closely tied to the Jasmy ecosystem. The JCT token, designed to power decentralized AI and cloud computing resources, is now gaining wider exposure through one of the largest crypto exchanges globally. The move aligns with Janction's push to bridge blockchain with AI and decentralized infrastructure.

The JCT token will be listed on Binance's Alpha and Futures platforms, with trading set to begin on November 10 at 10:00 UTC. Binance will also introduce the JCTUSDT perpetual contract at 10:30 UTC. The listing will offer traders up to 40x leverage, allowing users to trade with increased flexibility. This marks the first time Binance will feature Janction on its Alpha and Futures platforms.



To mark the occasion, Binance is offering an exclusive token airdrop for eligible users. Participants can claim their rewards using Binance Alpha Points on the app, available between November 10 and 11. This new opportunity opens up Janction to a much larger global audience, facilitating further growth for the JCT token.

Janction operates as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), focusing on the integration of AI-powered GPU pooling and cloud computing infrastructure. This model allows users to securely rent and share AI resources, advancing decentralized cloud services in the process. Through the JCT token, Janction aims to empower a more decentralized and efficient infrastructure system for AI and cloud computing.

The JCT token is part of Janction's broader strategy to integrate blockchain technology with cutting-edge technologies like AI. With this listing, the project's scope extends beyond its initial goals, aiming to bring decentralized infrastructure solutions to a global scale.

Janction is closely linked to the Jasmy ecosystem, a prominent Japanese blockchain initiative focused on IoT and data sovereignty. Jasmy's primary goal is to empower users to control, manage, and monetize their personal data. The ecosystem features components like the Personal Data Locker (PDL) for secure data storage and the Secure Knowledge Communicator (SKC) for identity management.

Jasmy's token, JASMY Coin, powers the ecosystem's operations, supporting payments, rewards, and governance. The ecosystem continues to expand with partnerships from brands like Panasonic, VAIO, and Transcosmos, integrating blockchain into sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and metaverse data security. Janction's close ties to Jasmy further solidify its position in the growing Web3 space.

Hara, the CEO of Janction, has announced the “50 Weeks IR” campaign, a year-long initiative aimed at keeping investors informed and maintaining transparency about the project's development.

This effort is designed to provide regular updates and engage the community as Janction grows. Hara acknowledged the challenges the project faced in its early stages but expressed optimism about the future now that Janction has secured a listing on Binance.

The campaign will focus on ensuring steady communication with investors while pushing forward with product milestones. Hara's announcement signals that Janction is committed to its long-term vision and the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), which will bring further developments in the future.

With its listing on Binance, Janction is gaining significant visibility, positioning itself as one of the first DePIN-AI hybrid tokens to reach a major exchange. This development showcases growing confidence in the potential of decentralized infrastructure and AI-powered technologies. As Janction continues to push forward with its goals, the project is likely to play a crucial role in the global blockchain ecosystem, particularly within Japan's emerging Web3 landscape.

Key Takeaways

ZEC surged to a $12 billion market cap, showing an 850% price increase since October 2025, an outlier during the broader crypto slump.

The rally is driven by renewed demand for digital privacy, Zcash's use of zk-SNARKs, and its positioning as “encrypted Bitcoin”.

High-profile endorsement from Arthur Hayes and “privacy coin hype” fueled the capital inflow, but experts warn of extreme speculative activity.

The privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC) has stormed back into the crypto spotlight. It recently achieved a market capitalization of $12 billion, successfully reclaiming a spot among the top 15 digital assets.

The ZEC token has been on a significant rally within the last 2 months. It peaked at $734 on November 7, extending a blistering ascent that has seen its value soar by roughly 850% since the start of October 2025.

This momentum was powerful enough to push Zcash past cycle-darling Hyperliquid. Furthermore, the token reached price levels not seen since early 2018. For context, while Zcash was hitting highs of over $734, major counterparts were flagging. Bitcoin and Ethereum were both down double-digit percentages, and the GMCI 30 index had slumped by 25%. ZEC's performance, therefore, stood out as a stark outlier.

However, the ZEC price has been going through a correction, decreasing over 25% in the last 24 hours.

ZEC Reached $12B in Market Cap and Is Now in A Correction – Source: CoinMarketCap

Supporters and analysts point to a confluence of ideological and technological factors driving this dramatic turnaround. At the heart of the narrative is a fundamental reevaluation of digital privacy.

Nansen Senior Research Analyst Jake Kennis noted, “Privacy is increasingly viewed as a necessity rather than a feature.” Amidst global debates about financial surveillance, this sentiment stimulates fresh demand for self-sovereign, private transactions.

Learn more: DASH, ZEC Surge: Privacy Coin Ignites Crypto?

Technologically, Zcash is benefiting from its core architecture. It utilizes zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) to create “shielded” transactions, validating transfers without revealing the sender, receiver, or amount. As a result, the sustained increase in Zcash's “shielded supply” is seen as a key indicator of actual usage and growing trust in its security features.

Furthermore, Zcash positions itself as an “encrypted Bitcoin.” This comparison stems from its robust tokenomics: it has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins and utilizes a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Coupled with an upcoming halving event that will further reduce new issuance, this positions ZEC strongly against its peers.

Besides, this positive price action has naturally attracted the attention of high-profile investors. Most notably, former BitMEX CEO and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes publicly confirmed his support.

Due to the rapid ascent in price, $ZEC is now the 2nd largest *LIQUID* holding in @MaelstromFund portfolio behind $BTC.

— Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) November 7, 2025



Hayes announced that due to its rapid ascent, ZEC had become the second-largest liquid holding in his family office's portfolio, trailing only BTC. Previously, he has also been bullish on Zcash's future. Specifically, Arthur Hayes suggested on X that Zcash's shielded transactions could power the next wave of “true DEXs,”even positing a price target of $1,000. Such endorsements invariably attract fresh capital.

-

The Irish Chamber Orchestra (ICO) presents the world premiere of Mani, a new percussion concerto by acclaimed Irish composer Ronan Guilfoyle, as the centrepiece of Three Worlds, a dazzling concert programme touring Dublin, Limerick, and Cork this November under the direction of Emily Davies.

This new work, commissioned by the Irish Chamber Orchestra, showcases percussionist Matthew Jacobson in an exhilarating exploration of rhythm, colour, and cultural fusion. Mani draws inspiration from South Indian rhythmic traditions, opening with a vibrant tapestry of interlocking pulses before unfolding into moments of lyricism and breathtaking virtuosity. Featuring ICO bassist Malachy Robinson on bass guitar, the piece culminates in a finale bursting with energy and groove.

Composer Ronan Guilfoyle, explaining Mani says “The percussion setup is a kind of hybrid drum set, because I wanted the feeling of groove that drums can give, as well as the colour of other percussion. I also chose bass guitar rather than double bass for its natural ‘hook-up' with drums. But the strings are far from bystanders, they interact constantly, providing colour, counterpoint and intrigue throughout. Having the brilliance of the ICO made it a joy to explore these possibilities.”

Balancing new and familiar worlds, the programme opens with Purcell's much loved Abdelazer Suite, theatrical music alive with Baroque elegance and vitality. The concert concludes with Dvořák's radiant Serenade for Strings, much loved for its warmth, melody and joyful spirit.

Three Worlds captures ICO's signature blend of bold programming and virtuosic performance, blending Baroque grace, contemporary brilliance, and Romantic beauty in one vibrant evening of music-making.

Italian banks support ECB's digital euro, seek gradual investment.

Italian banking institutions have expressed support for the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro project, while advocating for a more gradual investment in the technology, according to Reuters.

Marco Elio Rottigni, CEO of the ABI, stated at a press seminar in Florence that he supports the idea of CBDC as it “embodies the concept of digital sovereignty.”

“However, the costs of the project are very high considering the capital expenditures that banks must bear, and they could be spread over time,” he added. 

Rottigni advocated for a dual approach: the simultaneous implementation of CBDC and commercial banks' digital currencies, which can develop more rapidly.

The ABI's comments come amid criticism of the project by French and German representatives, who fear the digital euro could draw deposits away from financial institutions. 

The European CBDC plan aims to ensure the accessibility and relevance of central bank money in a digitizing economy, reduce reliance on non-European payment service providers, and respond to the growing popularity of stablecoins, according to the regulator. 

At a meeting in Florence on October 29-30, the ECB's Governing Council decided to move the digital euro project to the next stage following a two-year preparatory period.

If the relevant legislation is passed, the pilot phase will commence in 2027, with a full launch expected in 2029.

“The digital euro will allow people to enjoy the benefits of cash in the digital age. It will enhance the resilience of the European payment landscape, reduce costs for merchants, and create a platform for innovation, scaling, and competition for private companies,” noted ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone.

In September, nine European banks formed a consortium to issue a euro-pegged stablecoin in compliance with MiCA legislation.

If you personally believe in the future of cryptocurrency, that could make it a good fit for your financial portfolio, but you should typically follow similar investing guidelines. Since cryptocurrency has the chance to be particularly volatile, never invest more than you are prepared to lose. It's also a good idea not to over-allocate in a single cryptocurrency.

With crypto being a decentralized currency, meaning it's not controlled by a single entity like a government or bank, it can be more accessible and have faster transfer times with lower fees. This also means that cryptocurrencies are not insured by any government-backed programs, like the FDIC, while more traditional bank accounts are.

Investing in cryptocurrency isn't inherently good or bad, but it comes down to your risk tolerance and current financial goals.

Most crypto cards earn rewards in a similar way to traditional cash-back credit cards, you spend with the card and receive a percentage of that purchase in rewards. For some, this is a way to diversify their investments by adding crypto to their investment portfolio. There's also the chance that the crypto you earn could increase in value, but you have to keep in mind, the inverse is true as well.

Instead of opting for a credit card that earns crypto, consider using a regular cash-back card with a high return where you spend the most and then buying crypto directly. While this adds extra steps, it also gives you more control over the crypto you purchase and how it's stored.

Earning cryptocurrency rewards via credit card spending can be a good option for those who'd prefer to swipe without thinking about it or to make use of the additional benefits these cards offer.

While this will vary from case to case, if you're converting crypto to a fiat currency to make a purchase, this is subject to capital gains taxes. However, since credit cards require spending to earn crypto rewards, these are typically not taxable.

There are often a few different ways to spend your earned crypto rewards, with some cards allowing you to spend it directly or you can sell your crypto.

While it's less common, some crypto cards, like the Gemini Credit Card, have welcome bonuses for new cardholders to earn.

To determine to the top crypto cards, CNBC Select analyzed over major credit cards that are widely available in the U.S. and earn crypto rewards. 

We compared each card on a range of features, including rewards (e.g., cash back, points and miles), annual fees, welcome bonuses, introductory and standard APR and balance transfer fees and foreign transaction fees. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back).  We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.  

For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers.

ByDavid G.W. Birch,

Contributor.

Having just returned from Las Vegas, where stablecoin strategies for financial institutions was a key topic, I found myself discussing stablecoin strategy with a financial services organisation here in the UK. One of the management team asked about strategy. More specifically, they asked if I could point to an organisation that has a good strategy towards stablecoins. This made me wonder which organisations I should look at for strategic vision and to wonder which organisations really understand strategy. One obvious candidate is the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The CCP Central Committee is often seen as a prominent example of long-term strategists because of its structured planning, adaptability to changing environments, cohesive political strategies and consistent leadership. The “plenary sessions” of the Central Committee play a crucial role in determining the country's policy direction. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee (which has just happened, it was in October) reviewed and adopted recommendations for China's 15th Five-Year Plan. So, did they have anything to say about stablecoins?

Well, yes. In a push for digital finance that was a focus at a parallel session of the 2025 Tongzhou Global Development Forum, Zhu Xiaoneng, Party secretary of the School of Finance at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, said that China's capital markets are entering a new stage and commented further that ""Just as mobile payment has transformed people's lifestyles, digital assets and stablecoins will redefine the logic of capital market operations”. Interesting. Note that point about digital assets, because he also said that the idea that ""everything can be tokenized"" is becoming a reality and that

The tokenization of assets marks the starting point of digital investment, while stablecoins are the key to unlocking this new ecosystem… They inject vitality and liquidity into the digital financial world, serving as a bridge between innovation and trust.

Now that's what I call strategy. Stablecoins are not the end point, they are a key to open up a new ecosystem. But what does the ecosystem look like? What would it mean to use digital assets to redefine the logic of capital market operations? I am fond of referring people back to Edward de Bono's 1994 pamphlet on ‘The IBM Dollar” to see what this might mean: digital assets, traded 24/7 in global liquid markets, with exchanges of baskets of digital assets replacing money as the means of payments. If you think that sounds a little far-fetched, let me remind you what the then-Deputy Governor of Bank of England Mervyn King told an audience of central bankers back in 1999. He suggested that electronic transactions in real time hold out the possibility that one day it will be possible for final settlements to be carried out by the private sector without the need for clearing through the central bank(my emphasis) because there is no conceptual reason to prevent two individuals settling a transaction by a transfer of wealth from one electronic account to another in real time. Crucially, he also said that the assets themselves ""could be any financial assets for which market-clearing prices were available in real time"".

Similarly, a few years ago, Matt Harris at Bain Capital Ventures set out a similar vision of the future saying that ""our assets will be 100% invested at all times” with transactions settled through the transfer of baskets of assets (using the networks being put in place by Stripe, Google, PayPal and others for stablecoins) without no need to liquidate any assets into cash (or, indeed, stablecoins or tokenized deposits).

The implications of this redefining of capital markets are indeed significant and I do wonder if this is what Zhu Xiaoneng is alluding to do because, as Mervyn King further noted all those years ago, in such a digital asset ecosystem, central banks would no longer exist in their present form and nor would money. Indeed, as he rather memorably wrote, “The successors to Bill Gates would have put the successors to Alan Greenspan out of business”.

It's a cheap shot to complain about poor strategic thinking in financial institutions, not only about stablecoins but about things in general, because they face practical barriers to better strategic thinking, none of which will a surprise to you:

All three of these factors impact thinking about stablecoins in my view, which is again why I am curious about the perspective of Chinese institutions. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has labeled stablecoins as a threat to financial stability and the country has maintained a zero-tolerance policy towards private digital currencies since 2017. The former governor of the PBoC Zhou Xiaochuan recently reiterated concerns about the use of stablecoins for “fraud and instability” and also expressed some scepticism about the ability of stablecoins to impact payments, noting that in the Chinese case “there is little room to cut costs in the current system, particularly in retail payments”.

However, despite that negative view on private stablecoins, there is growing interest in yuan-backed stablecoins, particularly for international use. This is seen as a strategic move to facilitate cross-border payments and enhance the international role of the renminbi (RMB). The PBoC has been promoting the state-backed digital currency, the digital yuan, for some time but as I think it becoming more clear as the ecosystem evolves, there is a significant difference between a public stablecoin issued by a central bank, commercial banks or other private companies and a central bank digital currency. A CBDC has different goals and therefore different requirements.

If it is indeed the case the CCP can show us something about stablecoin strategy, then I am tempted to summarise their long-term view as being that stablecoins have a limited role but digital assets will form the basis of new kinds of financial markets. I have to say I rather agree with this view, despite not being a communist (in fact I was once a member of the Federation of Conservative Students).","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Wall Street's appetite for crypto is stronger than ever. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has broken inflow records. Fidelity and VanEck have followed suit with new spot products. Even the Nasdaq has hinted at expanding its digital asset trading infrastructure. Yet, for all this momentum, almost none of it actually happens onchain.



Institutions now treat crypto as a legitimate asset class, but not as a place to operate. The bulk of trading, settlement, and market-making still takes place on private servers and traditional rails.



The reason is simple: blockchains, in their current form, don't yet meet institutional performance standards. Until they can deliver predictable speed, reliable data access, and operational resilience on par with Wall Street's systems, the largest players will continue to trade off-chain, limiting transparency, liquidity, and the very innovation that made crypto compelling in the first place.





Institutions avoid trading onchain because most blockchains don't meet their standards. Institutions require both speed and reliability, and blockchains tend to struggle with the latter.



Many blockchains become congested under peak stress, causing transactions to fail unpredictably. Gas fees can change erratically as network activity fluctuates, introducing additional chaos. Institutions refuse to operate in such an unpredictable environment.



Institutions also need to ensure, beyond doubt, that trades will settle correctly, even when many things happen at once. Some blockchains such as Layer 2s or rollups rely on optimistic settlement techniques that work most of the time, but sometimes require transactions to be rolled back, reversing settled transactions.



Within these constraints, institutions need to ensure they are able to trade as quickly as possible. In traditional markets, institutions have paid millions to shorten the length of fiber optic cable between them and the Nasdaq, allowing them to settle trades a nano second ahead of competitors. Blockchain latency is still in the seconds or even minutes, which is not competitive at all.



It's important to note that modern institutions have access to crypto ETFs, enabling them to purchase crypto exposure through traditional markets using the optimized fiber optic cables they are familiar with. This means that to attract onchain institutional trading, a blockchain must surpass the speeds of traditional markets (why would institutions switch to a slower trading venue?).





Institutions won't simply create a Metamask wallet and start trading on Ethereum. They require custom blockchains built to meet the same performance, reliability, and accountability standards as traditional markets.



One key optimization is instruction-level parallelism with deterministic conflict resolution. In simple terms, this means a blockchain can process many trades at once (like multiple cashiers ringing up customers in parallel) while guaranteeing that everyone's receipt comes out correct and in the right order every time. It prevents the “traffic jams” that cause blockchains to slow down when activity spikes.



Blockchains designed for institutions should also eliminate I/O bottlenecks, making sure the system doesn't waste time waiting on storage or network delay. Institutions need to be able to perform many simultaneous operations without creating storage conflicts or network congestion.



To make integration more seamless, blockchains should support VM-agnostic, plug-in connectivity, allowing institutions to connect existing trading software without rewriting code or rebuilding entire systems.



Before committing to onchain trading, institutions require proof that blockchain systems perform in real-world conditions. Blockchains can assuage these concerns by publishing performance data measured on real hardware, using realistic workloads from payments, DeFi, and high-volume trading, for institutions to verify.



Together, these upgrades can raise blockchains' reliability up to Wall Street standards, and incentivize them to trade onchain. Once a firm realizes they can trade faster via blockchain rails (gaining a leg up on their competitors) without sacrificing reliability, institutions will flood onchain.



Keeping most activity off-chain concentrates liquidity on private systems and limits transparency into how prices form. This keeps the industry dependent on a handful of trading venues, and blunts one of crypto's biggest advantages: the ability for applications to connect and build on each other in the open.



The ceiling is even more obvious with tokenized real-world assets. Without reliable on-chain performance, these assets risk becoming static wrappers that rarely trade, rather than live instruments in active markets.



The good news is that change is already underway. Robinhood's decision to launch its own blockchain shows that institutions aren't just waiting for crypto to catch up — they're taking the initiative themselves. Once a few firms prove they can trade faster and more transparently onchain than off, the rest of the market will follow.



Long term, crypto won't simply be an asset that institutions invest in, it will be the technology they use to move global markets.

US financial markets have been on a rollercoaster in the week leading up to November 8, 2025, as a potent mix of falling consumer sentiment, tech stock pullbacks, and crypto market turbulence created a tense environment for investors. While traditional equities wobbled, energy stocks and alternative assets like bitcoin and gold managed to hold their ground, reflecting a market searching for safety amid growing uncertainty.

According to MT Newswires, the week saw a broad sell-off in major US stock indices. The iShares S&P 500 and Russell 2000 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) both finished lower, with technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary stocks leading losses. Invesco QQQ, a tech-heavy ETF, dropped 1.6% as the sector spearheaded the retreat. The pullback was exacerbated by a sharp drop in the Michigan consumer sentiment index, which highlighted that Americans are increasingly anxious about the economic outlook.



This anxiety was further confirmed by the University of Michigan survey, which, as reported by Cointelegraph, revealed that US consumer sentiment expectations had plunged to their lowest levels ever in early November 2025. November's reading was the second weakest since at least 1978, and much of the blame was pinned on the ongoing US government spending shutdown—the longest in American history. The shutdown's economic drag has become a central concern for both Wall Street and Main Street.

As investors digested this gloomy news, the market's appetite for risk evaporated. Popular growth sectors like technology and semiconductors, which had previously driven gains, were hit hard. Financials and health care also slumped, reflecting a broad-based retreat from assets tied to economic growth. The Nasdaq index, a bellwether for tech stocks, corrected down 4% over the week, erasing the gains it had made in the prior two weeks.

Yet, not all sectors suffered equally. The energy sector managed to post gains, even as oil prices softened. Consumer staples—those companies that sell everyday essentials—outperformed more cyclical, discretionary names, as investors sought shelter in defensive stocks. Meanwhile, safe-haven demand pushed gold and silver, along with their related ETFs, higher. This surge in precious metals is part of a wider global trend, as investors look for diversification and alternative assets when the future seems uncertain.

Perhaps most intriguing was the resilience of cryptocurrency assets. Bitcoin and funds tracking digital currencies bucked the negative trend, rallying as investors broadened their search for reliable returns. Crypto's rally, highlighted by rising bitcoin and ether-related funds, suggests that digital assets are increasingly viewed as hedges against instability, even as traditional markets falter.



However, not all cryptocurrencies shared in this optimism. Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, fell 11% over the week ending November 8, 2025, even after briefly touching $3,400. Cointelegraph noted that this drop coincided with a 4% correction in the Nasdaq, underscoring how tightly crypto and tech stocks have become linked in the minds of investors. Traders are now debating whether ETH can reclaim the $3,900 level, but the mood remains cautious.

Several factors have weighed on Ethereum's performance. First, the total value locked on the Ethereum network—a key metric of its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem—dropped by 24% over the previous 30 days, reaching $74 billion, the lowest since July 2025. This decline was exacerbated by a $120 million exploit on Balancer v2, one of Ethereum's leading DeFi platforms, on November 3. The incident rattled confidence and prompted many investors to pull funds from DeFi protocols.

Ethereum's decentralized applications (DApps) also faced headwinds, generating $80.7 million in revenue in October, an 18% decline from September. This decrease in onchain activity puts downward pressure on the native staking yield, a key incentive for ETH holders. As Cointelegraph explained, Ethereum's design includes a mechanism that burns ETH during periods of high demand for blockchain data processing, helping balance network activity and supply. Lower activity means less ETH is burned, potentially impacting price dynamics.

Adding to the malaise, US-listed Ethereum spot ETFs recorded $507 million in net outflows during November, with no notable ETH corporate reserve purchases. This lack of institutional demand has weighed heavily on trader sentiment, which is further reflected in derivatives markets. Ethereum futures traded at a 4% premium to spot markets during the week, indicating limited bullish appetite. Under normal conditions, this premium typically sits between 5% and 10% to account for the longer settlement period, so the subdued level points to a muted outlook for Ether's price.



Despite these challenges, there were glimmers of hope for Ethereum. In the first week of November, active addresses on the network climbed 5%, and transactions rose 2%. By contrast, rival blockchains like Tron and BNB Chain saw declines in onchain activity, suggesting that Ethereum may be regaining some ground in the competition for blockchain users.

Looking ahead, the Ethereum community is pinning its hopes on the upcoming Fusaka upgrade, planned for early December 2025. The update is expected to deliver several scalability and security enhancements to the network. While this could serve as a catalyst for renewed interest, the overall market mood remains cautious, with derivatives markets signaling weakness and investors wary of a slowing global economy.

The bigger picture is one of a market in transition. As MT Newswires observed, the week's moves highlight a shift in priorities as investors brace for volatility. Money is moving out of growth sectors like technology and into defensive sectors such as energy, consumer staples, and precious metals. Crypto's resilience, especially bitcoin's, hints at a growing appetite for alternative assets, even as Ethereum faces specific challenges tied to its ecosystem and investor sentiment.

For now, the sharp dip in consumer sentiment has spooked investors, sparking drops across health care, industrials, and financials. Semiconductors have led tech's pullback, while energy's steady performance and increased demand for safe havens suggest that investors remain cautiously optimistic—but are taking precautions as doubts creep in about how long market gains can last.

As the US government shutdown drags on and economic uncertainty persists, the coming weeks will test whether defensive plays and alternative assets can continue to provide shelter—or if further turbulence lies ahead for both Wall Street and the world of crypto.

These days, investors are investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies with 700x potential and huge growth potential. One of the most popular early-stage AI-based cryptocurrencies is Ozak AI. Ozak AI is promoting itself as this year's top cryptocurrency purchase. These five factors explain why Ozak AI has gained popularity among investors and is currently ranked among the best early-stage cryptocurrencies.

Ozak AI is now in its sixth growth presale, with a price of $0.012. Phase 1 at $0.001, Phase 2 at $0.002, Phase 3 at $0.003, Phase 4 at $0.005, Phase 5 at $0.010, and Phase 6 at $0.012 are the prior presale phases. The price of the upcoming presale phase is $0.014. The growth of the presale from phase 1 to the present phase is evident. The increase from phase 1 to phase 6 is 1,100%. Pre-sale funds have now increased to $4,257,000. 988 million tokens have been sold so far, and the current phase will quickly come to a final stage. The token, which attracted a lot of attention before to its launch, has a good chance of ranking highly in the cryptocurrency market.

There are a lot of AI cryptocurrency tokens available on the market that lack solid technology and are therefore ineffective. However, Ozak AI creates AI forecasting tools to examine real-time blockchain data and market patterns by fusing blockchain technology with artificial intelligence. While the Ozak Streaming Network (OSN) and Smart Contract Execution Layer offer market trends more quickly and affordably for contract executions, AI predictive models such as Transformers and TCNs are able to predict the financial markets with remarkable accuracy. Faster access to encrypted data is made possible by Ozak Data Vaults.

The token growth potential does not only depend on its technology and presale price. Ozak AI is building a strong partnership to build the ecosystem in a strong way. The Ozak AI advances an AI platform that partners with two trustworthy firms, such as Celo and Mira. The partnership with Celo makes the AI-powered payments and tools faster and cheaper and easily accessible. Partnering with Mira, as the Mira network makes AI verifiable and trustless, and together they provide fast, verified data streams.

Since the entire ecosystem is protected by the two leading security organizations, CertiK audit and Sherlock audits, Ozak AI takes security seriously. This is because many large investors consider the project's security system before funding early-stage ventures. The CertiK audit guarantees that all smart contracts have been examined using the top-tier CertiK framework. To find any possible weaknesses, Sherlock Audits conducted an audit on the advanced equipment. Users now have greater confidence that Ozak AI is based on a safe system due to these two audits.

By the end of 2026, analysts predict that the token will have reached its desired price of $1. The cryptocurrency will reach the milestone of $8.40 after hitting its target price, giving early investors a 700x return. If we invest a small $100 at the current presale phase at $0.012, we will receive 8,333 tokens. When the token hits its milestone of $8.40, the $100 investment will grow to $70,000 with a 700x return on investment; even if it hits $1, the $100 will still be worth $8,333.

Strategic alliances, powerful technology, organized presale expansion, and a cutting-edge security system combine to make the token one of the most attractive growth prospects for 2025. Due to its solid foundation and well-organized ecosystem, Ozak AI offers investors who are searching for 50x and 100x returns on their investment from another meme-based token a 700x growth potential.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Bitcoin Slides as AI Stock Hype Fades: Are Crypto Markets Next to Fall?","https://www.analyticsinsight.net/news/bitcoin-slides-as-ai-stock-hype-fades-are-crypto-markets-next-to-fall","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 11:00:03 GMT","

The cryptocurrency market appears to be under pressure as investor sentiment wavers, and, in this case, the pressure is emanating from the tech sector, rather than from regulatory or monetary policy shifts. 

Experts are warning that if AI-linked stock market euphoria wanes, Bitcoin and other digital assets may experience further downward pressure as a consequence.

As noted by Jeff Mei, Chief Operating Officer at BTSE, fears about over-inflated AI technology stocks are spilling into the crypto markets. ""If enthusiasm around AI stocks collapses,"" Mei said, ""the same dynamics will ripple into crypto."" The two markets are feeding off each other, and if one loses confidence, it could lead to further Bitcoin weakness as well.

According to a coindoo report, Augustine Fan, partner at SignalPlus, said that crypto has been drifting without a compelling driver to reignite bullish momentum. Investor caution persists as regulatory scrutiny and cybersecurity concerns remain elevated. “The market is waiting for something new to believe in,” Fan said. Subdued trading volumes and thin liquidity highlight a market in pause.

The cryptocurrency market has taken a rapid reversal from a euphoric time. The total market capitalization reached as high as $4.4 trillion in October but has now fallen about 20% due to liquidations totaling $19 billion. Bitcoin dropped below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the bear market of 2022, which fueled concerns for a lasting correction.

Breaking below its 200-day moving average, a key long-term support level that many traders are watching, has only compounded uncertainty in the crypto space. Traders who felt compelled to trust bitcoin's resiliency are now closely observing if bitcoin can overcome the 200-day average and regain that level, suggesting another set of technical breaks. The correlation between tech stocks and crypto valuations continues to foster volatility, and it shows how sensitive crypto markets are to greater external shocks.Also Read: Bitcoin Slides Below $100K as Fear Index Hits 21

This correction should reinforce the lesson that crypto has not disconnected from the global risk markets. While some long-term positions would think this is a ‘healthy reset' after rapid growth, the mood shift from taking risks to caution is evident. 

Bitcoin's path in the immediate to short-term may depend almost as much on how to read Silicon Valley and what they are doing than anything exactly taking place in Bitcoin itself. Markets are inherently sensitive to Price.

Cryptocurrency prices nudged higher after U.S. President Donald Trump said a direct tariff dividend of “at least” $2,000 will be paid out to most Americans.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said the U.S. is generating “trillions of dollars” in tariffs and said the funds would both reduce the country's $37 trillion national debt and finance the dividend.

“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” Trump wrote. The announcement helped cryptocurrency prices rise.

Bitcoin BTC$103,668.95 climbed 1.93% over the past 24 hours to trade above $103,000. Ether ETH$3,514.27 rose 4.75% to surpass $3,500, while solana SOL$161.52 gained 2.49% to top $160. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose more than 1.5%.

The modest rally comes amid a broader weekly slump that saw the CD20 index plunge nearly 15% before it started to recover. Bitcoin is still down 5.7% for the week, while ETH s down 7.5%.

Still, the reaction suggests traders may be pricing in the potential for higher consumer spending and crypto market inflows if and when these funds reach recipients.

While the news of the tariff dividend has generated excitement in the market, it is important to note that the payment is unlikely to happen immediately. 

The President alone cannot authorize or execute this payment, as federal spending decisions rest with the legislative branch and any plan to distribute funds collected from tariffs requires approval and appropriation by Congress, as Andy Constan, CEO and CIO of Damped Spring Advisors, pointed out X. 

To the dismay of the bulls, given the ongoing debates and legal challenges surrounding Trump's tariffs, the prospect of swift Congressional action appears uncertain.

Meanwhile, tax and budget experts have pointed out that the total amount of revenue generated from tariffs so far falls short of the funds needed to cover payments to the large number of eligible recipients.

""The President just proposed a $2,000 tariff “dividend” for each person, excluding high-income earners. If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion. If kids qualify, that grows. Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,"" Erica York, vice president of Federal Tax Policy, noted on X. 

She added that after accounting for the full budget impact of tariffs, the financial picture becomes less favorable. 

Every dollar raised through tariff revenue effectively offsets approximately 24 cents of income and payroll tax collections due to the broader economic effects on taxable income. After adjusting for this interaction, the net revenue generated by tariffs stands at around $90 billion—significantly less than the $300 billion proposed for the rebate program, York explained.

This gap means Trump could face challenges in funding the $2,000 dividend solely from tariff revenues.

Bitcoin BTC$103,668.95 has faced a challenging few weeks, retreating sharply from its record highs and weighing on the broader market, including ether ETH$3,514.27, XRP$2.3050, solana SOL$161.52 and others.

However, there's a compelling reason to expect the cryptocurrency to stay above the pivotal $100,000 level and rally this week, and it's tied to a positive shift in the U.S. financial system that signals potential for renewed investor risk-taking.

At the heart of the story is the spread between the SOFR and EFFR, which gauges dollar liquidity conditions in the U.S. banking sector. SOFR, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, is the overnight interest rate that banks pay to borrow cash using Treasuries as collateral. The Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) is the rate at which banks led reserves to each other overnight without collateral.

Usually, this spread hovers in a narrow range, but late last month it surged to the highest since 2019, signaling stress and liquidity tightening in the financial system. The result? the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, rose and bitcoin fell sharply, breaching the $100,000 level at one point.

But over the last couple of days, the SOFR-EFFR spread has sharply tanked to 0.05 from 0.35, erasing that spike. This reversal hints at easing financial conditions—the fear premium has faded, and liquidity is normalizing.

All else being equal, tightening of this spread signals looser financial conditions, favorable for risk assets like bitcoin. And guess what, BTC is on the rise as of writing, trading above $103,000, representing a 1.6% gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk data. ETH, XRP, SOL, BNB have gained 1.5% to 2.5% following BTC's lead.

Other key indicators also point to easing liquidity stress. For instance, banks' borrowing from the Federal Reserve's standing repo facility (SRF), a key liquidity management tool, has dropped back to zero after peaking at a record $50 billion earlier this month, according to data from ING. Banks had borrowed billions through the SRF as a response to temporary funding pressures.

Concurrently, the dollar index's rally has softened at resistance from the August high of 100.25, causing the upward momentum to stall. A renewed sell-off in the DXY could bode well for BTC, which is seen as a hedge against dollar debasement and a proxy for inflation protection.

All these factors combine to create a compelling case for bitcoin and the wider crypto market to rally in the coming week.

Keep an eye on flows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, as they will need to show strength following nearly $2.8 billion in outflows over the past four weeks. 

A breakout in the DXY above 100.25 could dent BTC's bullish prospects.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Wall Street is Bought in On Crypto's Upside Potential, But Not Its Tech","https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/11/04/wall-street-is-bought-in-on-crypto-s-upside-potential-but-not-its-tech","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:01:46 GMT","

Wall Street's appetite for crypto is stronger than ever. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has broken inflow records. Fidelity and VanEck have followed suit with new spot products. Even the Nasdaq has hinted at expanding its digital asset trading infrastructure. Yet, for all this momentum, almost none of it actually happens onchain.



Institutions now treat crypto as a legitimate asset class, but not as a place to operate. The bulk of trading, settlement, and market-making still takes place on private servers and traditional rails.



The reason is simple: blockchains, in their current form, don't yet meet institutional performance standards. Until they can deliver predictable speed, reliable data access, and operational resilience on par with Wall Street's systems, the largest players will continue to trade off-chain, limiting transparency, liquidity, and the very innovation that made crypto compelling in the first place.





Institutions avoid trading onchain because most blockchains don't meet their standards. Institutions require both speed and reliability, and blockchains tend to struggle with the latter.



Many blockchains become congested under peak stress, causing transactions to fail unpredictably. Gas fees can change erratically as network activity fluctuates, introducing additional chaos. Institutions refuse to operate in such an unpredictable environment.



Institutions also need to ensure, beyond doubt, that trades will settle correctly, even when many things happen at once. Some blockchains such as Layer 2s or rollups rely on optimistic settlement techniques that work most of the time, but sometimes require transactions to be rolled back, reversing settled transactions.



Within these constraints, institutions need to ensure they are able to trade as quickly as possible. In traditional markets, institutions have paid millions to shorten the length of fiber optic cable between them and the Nasdaq, allowing them to settle trades a nano second ahead of competitors. Blockchain latency is still in the seconds or even minutes, which is not competitive at all.



It's important to note that modern institutions have access to crypto ETFs, enabling them to purchase crypto exposure through traditional markets using the optimized fiber optic cables they are familiar with. This means that to attract onchain institutional trading, a blockchain must surpass the speeds of traditional markets (why would institutions switch to a slower trading venue?).





Institutions won't simply create a Metamask wallet and start trading on Ethereum. They require custom blockchains built to meet the same performance, reliability, and accountability standards as traditional markets.



One key optimization is instruction-level parallelism with deterministic conflict resolution. In simple terms, this means a blockchain can process many trades at once (like multiple cashiers ringing up customers in parallel) while guaranteeing that everyone's receipt comes out correct and in the right order every time. It prevents the “traffic jams” that cause blockchains to slow down when activity spikes.



Blockchains designed for institutions should also eliminate I/O bottlenecks, making sure the system doesn't waste time waiting on storage or network delay. Institutions need to be able to perform many simultaneous operations without creating storage conflicts or network congestion.



To make integration more seamless, blockchains should support VM-agnostic, plug-in connectivity, allowing institutions to connect existing trading software without rewriting code or rebuilding entire systems.



Before committing to onchain trading, institutions require proof that blockchain systems perform in real-world conditions. Blockchains can assuage these concerns by publishing performance data measured on real hardware, using realistic workloads from payments, DeFi, and high-volume trading, for institutions to verify.



Together, these upgrades can raise blockchains' reliability up to Wall Street standards, and incentivize them to trade onchain. Once a firm realizes they can trade faster via blockchain rails (gaining a leg up on their competitors) without sacrificing reliability, institutions will flood onchain.



Keeping most activity off-chain concentrates liquidity on private systems and limits transparency into how prices form. This keeps the industry dependent on a handful of trading venues, and blunts one of crypto's biggest advantages: the ability for applications to connect and build on each other in the open.



The ceiling is even more obvious with tokenized real-world assets. Without reliable on-chain performance, these assets risk becoming static wrappers that rarely trade, rather than live instruments in active markets.



The good news is that change is already underway. Robinhood's decision to launch its own blockchain shows that institutions aren't just waiting for crypto to catch up — they're taking the initiative themselves. Once a few firms prove they can trade faster and more transparently onchain than off, the rest of the market will follow.



Long term, crypto won't simply be an asset that institutions invest in, it will be the technology they use to move global markets.

Spanish authorities said they arrested a man accused of leading a 260 million-euro ($300 million) alleged international investment scam that promised returns on everything from cryptocurrency to gold and luxury yachts.

The suspect, identified as A.R. and known online as “CryptoSpain,” allegedly ran the Madeira Invest Club, which began operations in early 2023 and marketed itself as a private investment group, the Ministry of Interior said.

According to the ministry, the scheme attracted over 3,000 victims by offering guaranteed returns on contracts tied to digital art, luxury vehicles, whisky, real estate and cryptocurrencies.

Promised profits and buyback guarantees were part of the pitch, but authorities say no real economic activity of investment took place. Instead, the club operated as a Ponzi scheme, where earlier participants were paid with funds from new investors, according to the ministry.

As the operation expanded, the operation built a complex network of shell companies and bank accounts spanning at least 10 countries, including Portugal, the U.K., the U.S., Malaysia and Hong Kong.

The investigation, known as Operation PONEI, involved Europol and law enforcement agencies from the U.S., Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand among others.

Lu Li, a physicist who studies advanced materials, knows that people often want to hear how his research could lead to new technologies or practical breakthroughs. But sometimes, what he uncovers is so unusual that its value lies purely in revealing how strange the universe can be.

Working with an international team of scientists, Li has made one of those discoveries, recently described in Physical Review Letters.

""I would love to claim that there's a great application, but my work keeps pushing that dream further away,"" said Li, a professor of physics at the University of Michigan. ""But what we've found is still really bizarre and exciting.""

Quantum Oscillations: When Electrons Act Like Springs

Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, the research focuses on a puzzling effect called quantum oscillations. In metals, these oscillations occur when electrons behave like tiny springs, vibrating in response to magnetic fields. By changing the magnetic field's strength, scientists can alter how quickly these ""electron springs"" move.

In recent years, however, researchers have discovered the same quantum oscillations in insulators -- materials that should not conduct electricity or heat. That revelation has left scientists debating whether the effect originates only on the surface of these materials or deep within their interior (known as the bulk).

Searching for Answers Inside the Material

If the oscillations came from the surface, that would be particularly exciting for potential technologies. Materials called topological insulators, which conduct electricity on their surfaces while remaining insulating inside, are already being studied for new kinds of electronic, optical, and quantum devices.

To explore the mystery, Li and his collaborators turned to the National Magnetic Field Laboratory, home to the most powerful magnets in the world. Their experiments revealed that the oscillations were not just a surface effect. Instead, they came from the bulk of the material itself.

""I wish I knew what to do with that, but at this stage we have no idea,"" Li admitted. ""What we have right now is experimental evidence of a remarkable phenomenon, we've recorded it and, hopefully, at some point, we'll realize how to use it.""

A Global Collaboration and a Clear Result

The study involved more than a dozen scientists from six institutions in the United States and Japan, including research fellow Kuan-Wen Chen and graduate students Yuan Zhu, Guoxin Zheng, Dechen Zhang, Aaron Chan, and Kaila Jenkins from the University of Michigan.

""For years, scientists have pursued the answer to a fundamental question about the carrier origin in this exotic insulator: Is it from the bulk or the surface, intrinsic or extrinsic?"" said Chen. ""We are excited to provide clear evidence that it is bulk and intrinsic.""

A ""New Duality"" in Physics

Li describes the finding as part of what he calls a ""new duality."" The original, or ""old,"" duality in physics emerged more than a century ago when scientists realized that light and matter can act as both waves and particles. That discovery transformed physics and led to technologies such as solar cells and electron microscopes.

The new duality, Li says, involves materials that can behave as both conductors and insulators. His team explored this idea using a compound called ytterbium boride (YbB12) inside a magnetic field so powerful that it reached 35 Tesla -- about 35 times stronger than the field inside a hospital MRI machine.

""Effectively, we're showing that this naive picture where we envisioned a surface with good conduction that's feasible to use in electronics is completely wrong,"" Li explained. ""It's the whole compound that behaves like a metal even though it's an insulator.""

Unlocking the Mystery of a ""Crazy Metal""

Although this ""metal-like"" behavior only appears under extreme magnetic conditions, the finding raises new questions about how materials behave at the quantum level.

""Confirming that the oscillations are bulk and intrinsic is exciting,"" said Zhu. ""We don't yet know what kind of neutral particles are responsible for the observation. We hope our findings motivate further experiments and theoretical work.""

The project received additional support from the Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

In a new study, first author Palash Kumawat from the University of Bremen's Geosciences Department and his team investigated how microbes manage to survive in one of the planet's harshest underwater environments. They analyzed lipid biomarkers, specialized fat molecules that reveal biological activity, to uncover the organisms' survival strategies. The site's pH of 12 makes it one of the most alkaline environments ever documented, creating conditions that are exceptionally difficult for life to endure.

Because so few living cells exist there, detecting DNA is often impossible. Instead, the researchers used trace analysis techniques sensitive enough to identify even faint biochemical signals. ""But we were able to detect fats,"" says Kumawat, currently a PhD candidate in the Geosciences Department. ""With the help of these biomarkers we were able to obtain insights into the survival strategies of methane- and sulfate-metabolizing microbes in this extreme environment.""

Microbial Clues Hidden in Deep-Sea Chemistry

Microbial life in the deep ocean plays an important role in the global carbon cycle, processing carbon and other elements far below the surface. The communities identified by Kumawat's team draw their energy not from sunlight but from minerals in rocks and gases like carbon dioxide and hydrogen, producing methane in the process -- an important greenhouse gas. These biochemical reactions occur independently of the ocean above, showing that these microbes operate in a self-contained ecosystem.

The lipid molecules also help determine whether the microbes are alive or remnants from ancient communities. Intact biomolecules suggest active or recently living cells, while degraded ones indicate fossilized ""geomolecules"" from long ago. Kumawat explains that combining isotope data with lipid biomarkers shows evidence of both modern and ancient microbial populations inhabiting this hostile environment. ""This distinction helps us when working in areas with extremely low biomass and nutrient deficiency,"" he notes.

Discovering Life at the Limits

Co-author Dr. Florence Schubotz, an organic geochemist at MARUM -- Center for Marine Environmental Sciences at the University of Bremen, emphasizes how remarkable the discovery is. ""What is fascinating about these findings is that life under these extreme conditions, such as high pH and low organic carbon concentrations, is even possible,"" she says. ""Until now, the presence of methane-producing microorganisms in this system has been presumed, but could not be directly confirmed. Furthermore, it is simply exciting to obtain insights into such a microbial habitat because we suspect that primordial life could have originated at precisely such sites.""

Uncovering Hidden Volcanoes Beneath the Pacific

The team's samples came from sediment cores collected in 2022 during Expedition SO 292/2 aboard the Research Vessel Sonne. During this mission, scientists discovered previously unknown mud volcanoes in the Mariana forearc region and were able to collect samples directly from them.

The work forms part of the Cluster of Excellence ""The Ocean Floor -- Earth's Uncharted Interface."" Building on their findings, Kumawat and his colleagues now plan to cultivate these microorganisms in controlled incubators to learn more about how they obtain nutrients and persist in such inhospitable environments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Stanford discovers an extraordinary crystal that could transform quantum tech","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251108083912.htm","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 06:27:41 GMT","

Key Points:

Superconductivity and quantum computing have moved from theoretical physics into real-world innovation. The 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized breakthroughs in superconducting quantum circuits that could lead to ultra-powerful computers. Yet many of these technologies only function at cryogenic temperatures (near absolute zero), where most materials lose their defining properties. Finding materials that perform under such extreme cold has long been one of science's biggest hurdles.

A Crystal That Defies the Cold

In a new Science publication, engineers at Stanford University report a breakthrough with strontium titanate (STO), a material that not only maintains but enhances its optical and mechanical performance in freezing conditions. Instead of deteriorating, it becomes significantly more capable, outperforming other known materials by a wide margin. The researchers believe this discovery could open the door to a new class of light-based and mechanical cryogenic devices that propel quantum computing, space exploration, and other advanced technologies.

""Strontium titanate has electro-optic effects 40 times stronger than the most-used electro-optic material today. But it also works at cryogenic temperatures, which is beneficial for building quantum transducers and switches that are current bottlenecks in quantum technologies,"" explained the study's senior author Jelena Vuckovic, professor of electrical engineering at Stanford.

Pushing the Limits of Performance

STO's optical behavior is ""non-linear,"" meaning that when an electric field is applied, its optical and mechanical properties shift dramatically. This electro-optic effect allows scientists to adjust the frequency, intensity, phase, and direction of light in ways that other materials cannot. Such versatility could enable entirely new types of low-temperature devices.

STO is also piezoelectric, meaning it physically expands and contracts in response to electric fields. This makes it ideal for developing new electromechanical components that function efficiently in extreme cold. According to the researchers, these capabilities could be especially valuable for use in the vacuum of space or in the cryogenic fuel systems of rockets.

""At low temperature, not only is strontium titanate the most electrically tunable optical material we know of, but it's also the most piezoelectrically tunable material,"" said Christopher Anderson, co-first author and now a faculty member at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

An Overlooked Material Finds New Purpose

Strontium titanate is not a newly discovered substance. It has been studied for decades and is inexpensive and abundant. ""STO is not particularly special. It's not rare. It's not expensive,"" said co-first author Giovanni Scuri, a postdoctoral scholar in Vuckovic's lab. ""In fact, it has often been used as a diamond substitute in jewelry or as a substrate for growing other, more valuable materials. Despite being a 'textbook' material, it performs exceptionally well in a cryogenic context.""

The decision to test STO was guided by an understanding of what characteristics make materials highly tunable. ""We knew what ingredients we needed to make a highly tunable material. We found those ingredients already existed in nature, and we simply used them in a new recipe. STO was the obvious choice,"" Anderson said. ""When we tried it, surprisingly, it matched our expectations perfectly.""

Scuri added that the framework they developed could help identify or enhance other nonlinear materials for a variety of operating conditions.

Record-Breaking Performance at Near Absolute Zero

When tested at 5 Kelvin (-450°F), STO's performance stunned researchers. Its nonlinear optical response was 20 times greater than that of lithium niobate, the leading nonlinear optical material, and nearly triple that of barium titanate, the previous cryogenic benchmark.

To push its properties even further, the team replaced certain oxygen atoms in the crystal with heavier isotopes. This adjustment moved STO closer to a state called quantum criticality, producing even greater tunability.

""By adding just two neutrons to exactly 33 percent of the oxygen atoms in the material, the resulting tunability increased by a factor of four,"" Anderson said. ""We precisely tuned our recipe to get the best possible performance.""

Building the Future of Cryogenic Devices

According to the team, STO also offers practical advantages that could make it appealing to engineers. It can be synthesized, structurally modified, and fabricated at wafer scale using existing semiconductor equipment. These features make it well-suited for next-generation quantum devices, such as laser-based switches used to control and transmit quantum information.

The research was partially funded by Samsung Electronics and Google's quantum computing division, both of which are searching for materials to advance their quantum hardware. The team's next goal is to design fully functional cryogenic devices based on STO's unique properties.

""We found this material on the shelf. We used it and it was amazing. We understood why it was good. Then the cherry on the top -- we knew how to do better, added that special sauce, and we made the world's best material for these applications,"" Anderson said. ""It's a great story.""

Alongside Samsung and Google, the study received support from a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship through the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Energy's Q-NEXT program.

Contributors include Aaron Chan and Lu Li from the University of Michigan; Sungjun Eun, Alexander D. White, Geun Ho Ahn, Amir Safavi-Naeini, and Kasper Van Gasse from Stanford's E. L. Ginzton Laboratory; and Christine Jilly from the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities.

Phosphorus is one of six essential elements that make life on Earth possible. When it bonds with hydrogen, it forms phosphine (PH3), a highly toxic and explosive gas. This compound is found in the atmospheres of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and has long been viewed as a potential biosignature for anaerobic life. On Earth, phosphine arises naturally from decaying organic material in swamps, but on other planets, it is rare and intriguing.

A research team led by University of California San Diego Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics Adam Burgasser has now detected phosphine in the atmosphere of a cool, ancient brown dwarf known as Wolf 1130C. Their findings were recently published in Science.

The team made the discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the first instrument powerful enough to analyze these dim, low-temperature objects in detail. The surprising part, however, is not that phosphine was found -- but that it appears absent from other brown dwarfs and gas giant exoplanets where scientists expected it.

Probing the Chemistry of Ancient Stars

""Our astronomy program, called Arcana of the Ancients, focuses on old, metal-poor brown dwarfs as a means of testing our understanding of atmospheric chemistry,"" said Burgasser. ""Understanding the problem with phosphine was one of our first goals.""

Under normal conditions, phosphine naturally forms in the hydrogen-rich atmospheres of gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Because of that, researchers have long assumed it should also exist in similar environments around other stars, including brown dwarfs, which are sometimes called ""failed stars"" because they are too small to fuse hydrogen like true stars.

Yet phosphine has been elusive in previous JWST observations, hinting that something might be missing in our understanding of phosphorus chemistry. ""Prior to JWST, phosphine was expected to be abundant in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, following theoretical predictions based on the turbulent mixing we know exists in these sources,"" explained co-author Sam Beiler, a postdoctoral scholar at Trinity College Dublin who recently earned his doctorate from the University of Toledo.

Beiler, who has led earlier studies investigating this very absence, added, ""Every observation we've obtained with JWST has challenged the theoretical predictions -- that is until we observed Wolf 1130C.""

The Unusual System of Wolf 1130ABC

Wolf 1130C is part of a complex three-star system located 54 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. The brown dwarf orbits a close binary composed of a cool red star (Wolf 1130A) and a dense white dwarf (Wolf 1130B). Astronomers have long been interested in this system because Wolf 1130C contains far fewer ""metals"" (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) than the Sun, providing a valuable laboratory for studying primitive cosmic chemistry.

Unlike in previous brown dwarf observations, the JWST data revealed a strong infrared signal from phosphine in Wolf 1130C's atmosphere. To understand how much of the gas was present, the team turned to Assistant Professor Eileen Gonzales from San Francisco State University, who specializes in atmospheric modeling.

""To determine the abundances of molecules in Wolf 1130C, I used a modeling technique known as atmospheric retrievals,"" said Gonzales. ""This technique uses the JWST data to back out how much of each molecular gas species should be in the atmosphere. It's like reverse engineering a really delicious cookie when the chef wouldn't give up the recipe.""

Her analysis confirmed that phosphine was present in the predicted amount -- about 100 parts per billion.

Why This Brown Dwarf and Not Others?

The discovery raises a new question: why does this particular brown dwarf contain phosphine while others do not? One possibility involves the object's unusual chemical composition. ""It may be that in normal conditions phosphorus is bound up in another molecule such as phosphorus trioxide,"" explained Beiler. ""In the metal-depleted atmosphere of Wolf 1130C, there isn't enough oxygen to take up the phosphorus, allowing phosphine to form from the abundant hydrogen.""

The team plans to test this idea through upcoming JWST observations of other metal-poor brown dwarfs to see if the same pattern appears.

A Clue from a Dying Star

Another hypothesis is that phosphorus may have been produced locally within the Wolf 1130ABC system, specifically by its white dwarf, Wolf 1130B. ""A white dwarf is the leftover husk of a star that has finished fusing its hydrogen,"" said Burgasser. ""They are so dense that when they accrete material on their surface they can undergo runaway nuclear reactions, which we detect as novae.""

Although astronomers have not observed any nova events in this system in recent history, such outbursts often recur every few thousand years. Because Wolf 1130ABC has been known for only about a century, earlier eruptions could have gone unnoticed, leaving behind traces of phosphorus in the surrounding space. Previous research has suggested that many of the Milky Way's phosphorus atoms may have originated from these stellar explosions.

Unraveling the Origins of Phosphorus in the Cosmos

Understanding why Wolf 1130C contains clear evidence of phosphine could offer important insights into how phosphorus forms in the galaxy and how it behaves in planetary atmospheres. As Burgasser explained, ""Understanding phosphine chemistry in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs where we don't expect life is crucial if we hope to use this molecule in the search for life on terrestrial worlds beyond our solar system.""

This work was supported by NASA/STScI (NAS 5-03127 and AR-2232) and the Heising-Simons Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A simple DNA test could reveal the right antidepressant for you","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251109013242.htm","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 16:22:13 GMT","

Depression and anxiety are the most widespread mental health disorders in the world. Around 300 million people live with depression, and roughly 301 million have an anxiety disorder, affecting nearly 8 percent of the global population.

Yet for many, finding the right treatment can be a slow and frustrating process. When patients first seek help, the medications they're prescribed often fail to work. In fact, nearly half of all people treated for depression or anxiety experience little or no benefit from their initial prescription, forcing them to try multiple drugs over weeks or even months before finding relief.

A New Genetic Approach to Treatment

A research team from Germany, Sweden, and Denmark believes they may have found a solution. They've developed a genetic approach that could help doctors predict which antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication will actually work for a specific person.

The method uses what are known as polygenic risk scores (PRS), which analyze a person's DNA to assess how their genetic variations might influence their response to certain medications. With just one genetic test, scientists can now estimate which drugs are most likely to help an individual patient.

Although this technique has so far only been tested using genetic research databases rather than real patients, the results are promising.

Lead author Professor Fredrik Åhs from the Department of Psychology and Social Work at Mid Sweden University hopes to move the research into clinical trials soon.

""We believe this technology could be used to develop more targeted tests. The long-term goal is a test that doctors can use to choose the right medicine, and looking at our genes is one way of doing it,"" Åhs says. ""We're interested in looking into biomarkers as well. Hopefully, in the future, we'll have a cheap and effective test that enables us to alleviate people's suffering much faster.""

Building on Genetic Research from Aarhus University

The project began two years ago when Åhs reached out to Professor Doug Speed from the Center for Quantitative Genetics and Genomics at Aarhus University in Denmark. Åhs wanted to apply Speed's advanced polygenic risk score models to his research on mental health treatment.

Speed has spent years refining ways to analyze complex human genetic data, focusing especially on how genes influence psychological conditions.

""The last 10 years, we've been working towards using polygenic risk scores to predict disease. It's very challenging because many diseases are caused by thousands of variations across the genome,"" Speed explains. ""It turns out that these polygenic risk scores can predict our response to drugs, which is a bit surprising, but a significant step forward.""

He has already developed PRS models for several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and depression -- all of which were used in this new study.

What Are Polygenic Risk Scores?

Since the mapping of the human genome in the early 2000s, scientists have discovered thousands of small variations in DNA that can influence health. Humans have roughly 20,000 genes, and each comes in multiple versions (known as alleles). Some alleles are linked to a higher likelihood of developing specific diseases.

Researchers like Speed compile this information to create polygenic risk scores -- tools that combine the effects of many genetic variations to estimate a person's risk for certain conditions.

When developing a PRS for depression, for example, researchers analyze a person's genome to see how many depression-linked variants they carry. The more risk-associated variations present, the higher the individual's genetic risk score. Some variants, however, have a stronger influence than others.

Twin Data Reveals How Genes Affect Drug Response

Polygenic risk scores don't diagnose mental illnesses. Instead, they estimate the likelihood of developing one. But they may also help explain why some treatments work better for certain people.

To explore this, Åhs and his team applied polygenic risk scores to data from the Swedish Twin Registry, the largest of its kind in the world. This database allows researchers to compare the relative effects of genetics and environment on health and behavior.

Because twins share nearly identical DNA, patterns that appear consistently across twin pairs often point to genetic causes. Åhs identified 2,515 individuals from the registry who had been prescribed medications for depression or anxiety. By examining which drugs they used, whether they switched prescriptions, and how their treatment progressed, the researchers could infer which medications were most effective.

""We then looked at the polygenic risk scores of these individuals, and it became clear that if you had a higher risk score for depression or anxiety, drugs like benzodiazepine and histamines had a smaller effect,"" Åhs says. ""More research is needed, but hopefully, we'll be able to develop accurate tests in the future that can predict which kind of drugs will most likely have an effect on you.""

Important Limitations and Next Steps

Like most scientific research, the study has some limitations. Åhs explains that while the dataset was extensive, it wasn't perfect.

""The data on the patient's response and nonresponse to different drugs was based on which drugs were prescribed to them, not clinical notes. We can infer a lot from the prescription data, but we can't be sure if there was a slight bias,"" he says.

""In other words, we don't know exactly why they changed drugs. Was it because of side effects, lack of remission, or something else? We did compare our results with other studies that used clinical assessment, and they were consistent with ours.""

The researchers also had to restrict their analysis to a specific time window, meaning some earlier prescriptions may not have been included.

""This might have influenced the number of individuals who received only one drug in our study. Some of them could have received other drugs before that weren't registered in our data. That's one of the reasons why we want to do a clinical follow-up study,"" Åhs adds.

Toward Personalized Psychiatry

Although more research is needed, the findings suggest a future where choosing an antidepressant might no longer depend on trial and error. A simple genetic test could one day help doctors match patients with the most effective treatment from the start -- potentially saving time, reducing side effects, and improving lives for millions around the world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Microbes that breathe rust could help save Earth's oceans","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251109013252.htm","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:42:47 GMT","

An international research team led by microbiologists Marc Mussmann and Alexander Loy at the University of Vienna has uncovered a completely new type of microbial metabolism. The newly identified microorganisms, known as MISO bacteria, are able to ""breathe"" iron minerals by oxidizing toxic sulfide. The scientists discovered that the reaction between hydrogen sulfide -- a poisonous gas -- and solid iron minerals is not only a chemical process, but also a biological one. In this newly revealed pathway, adaptable microbes living in marine sediments and wetland soils remove toxic sulfide and use it as an energy source for growth. These bacteria may also play an important role in preventing the expansion of oxygen-depleted ""dead zones"" in aquatic ecosystems.

The findings were recently published in Nature.

How Microbes Power Earth's Element Cycles

The movement of key elements such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and iron through the environment occurs through what are known as biogeochemical cycles. These transformations take place through reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions that move elements between air, water, soil, rocks, and living things. Because these cycles regulate greenhouse gases, they have a direct influence on Earth's climate and temperature balance. Microorganisms drive nearly every step of these processes, using substances like sulfur and iron for respiration in much the same way humans rely on oxygen to metabolize food.

Sulfur and iron are particularly essential for microbial communities that live in oxygen-deprived habitats such as ocean floors, wetlands, and sediments. Sulfur can exist as a gas in the atmosphere, as sulfate dissolved in seawater, or locked within mineral deposits. Iron, on the other hand, shifts between different chemical forms depending on the availability of oxygen. When microbes process sulfur, they frequently change the form of iron at the same time, creating a tightly linked relationship between the two elements. This coupling affects nutrient cycling and influences the production or consumption of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Understanding these connections helps scientists predict how natural systems respond to environmental changes, including pollution and global warming.

Microbes That Use Iron to Eliminate Toxic Sulfide

In oxygen-poor settings such as marine sediments, wetlands, and underground aquifers, certain microbes produce hydrogen sulfide, a foul-smelling and highly toxic gas. Interactions between this sulfide and iron(III) oxide minerals -- essentially rust -- help keep sulfide levels under control. Until now, scientists thought this process happened only through chemical reactions that created elemental sulfur and iron monosulfide (FeS), the black mineral responsible for the dark color of low-oxygen beach sands.

""We show that this environmentally important redox reaction is not solely chemical,"" says Alexander Loy, research group leader at CeMESS, the Centre for Microbiology and Environmental Systems Science at the University of Vienna. ""Microorganisms can also harness it for growth.""

The team's discovery reveals a new form of microbial energy production called MISO. This process connects the reduction of iron(III) oxide with the oxidation of sulfide. Unlike a purely chemical reaction, MISO directly generates sulfate, skipping intermediate steps in the sulfur cycle. ""MISO bacteria remove toxic sulfide and may help prevent the expansion of so-called 'dead zones' in aquatic environments, while fixing carbon dioxide for growth -- similar to plants,"" adds Marc Mussmann, senior scientist at CeMESS.

A Fast, Widespread Process That Shapes the Planet

In laboratory experiments, the researchers found that the MISO reaction carried out by microbes happens faster than the same reaction when it occurs chemically. This indicates that microorganisms are likely the main force behind this transformation in natural environments. ""Diverse bacteria and archaea possess the genetic capacity for MISO,"" explains lead author Song-Can Chen, ""and they are found in a wide range of natural and human-made environments.""

According to the study, MISO activity in marine sediments could be responsible for as much as 7% of all global sulfide oxidation to sulfate. This process is fueled by the steady flow of reactive iron entering the oceans from rivers and melting glaciers. The research, supported by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) as part of the 'Microbiomes Drive Planetary Health' Cluster of Excellence, identifies a new biological mechanism linking the cycling of sulfur, iron, and carbon in oxygen-free environments.

""This discovery demonstrates the metabolic ingenuity of microorganisms and highlights their indispensable role in shaping Earth's global element cycles,"" concludes Alexander Loy.

Adobe Firefly feels like the best-kept secret in software right now. Adobe is aggressively talking up the app and its capabilities at events like Adobe MAX, but even with so much limelight, it doesn't get nearly the attention that competitors do. The Firefly app is a creative AI playground that lets you use generative models to create images, videos, and more, but it can do more, from batch editing photos to turning a single frame into a full video.

Firefly isn't just a text-prompt AI generation tool. It's powerful, combining dozens of models, including those from Adobe, Google, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, and Topaz, to create a one-stop shop for AI creation. Here's everything you need to know about using the app.

Adobe Firefly is a suite of generative AI tools built around creative workflows, be it vector graphics, photo and video editing, or even creative ideation. There are several Firefly features built into Adobe's Creative Cloud apps, from Photoshop to InDesign, but I'm focusing on the web-based Firefly application here. It combines all of Adobe's generative AI features in one spot, and it's integrated with other web-based tools, including Photoshop Web and Adobe Express.

I won't be able to cover everything Firefly is capable of, but its functionality broadly breaks down into four main categories:

Firefly is an AI tool, but as you can see from even a broad description of its functionality, it goes far beyond generating AI images. These tools are integrated with Adobe's web-based ecosystem, too, so you can take an AI-generated image out to Photoshop Web or combine multiple generated assets through Adobe Express.

The other thing Firefly does is combine dozens of AI models under one roof. There are constantly new AI models making headlines, from the recent craze around Google's Nano Banana to the early stages of AI video generation through models like Runway. Normally, you have to go to several websites and maintain several subscriptions to access all these models, but Firefly puts the vast majority of them under one roof.

There are four different Firefly plans, and I'll dig into them below, but it's better to think of Firefly along the lines of generative credits than any specific plan. Generative credits are the heart of Firefly. With each plan, you get a certain allocation of credits, and you can spend them to generate different types of content.

The credits situation is messy. Each model and feature in Firefly will consume different credit amounts, and the amount of credits a model consumes is subject to change. For instance, Google's Nano Banana costs 10 credits per generation and Imagen 4 costs 20 right now, but that's only for a limited time since these are newer models.

Further, some models will consume more credits depending on the output. For instance, Topaz Labs' popular Gigapixel upscaling model costs 10 credits up to 25 megapixels, but it costs 20 credits beyond 25 MP. Similarly, the Luma AI Ray2 video model costs 50 credits per second for a 720p output, but it costs 150 credits per second with a 4K output. Adobe tells me that these credit amounts are subject to change, which can be for the better. As time goes on and models require fewer computing resources, the cost can drop.

Beyond models and features, Adobe breaks down its generative AI features into two buckets: Standard and Premium features. If you have a paid Firefly subscription (or Creative Cloud Pro), you have unlimited access to Standard features, leaving your monthly credit allowance for Premium generation. With a free Firefly plan, you'll need to spend credits regardless of whether a feature is classified as Standard or Premium; however, Standard features usually only consume one credit per generation.

These credits aren't exclusive to Firefly, further complicating matters. Generative Fill in Photoshop is classified as a Standard feature, for instance, while Generative Extend in Premiere Pro is a Premium feature. Regardless of the application, they all pull from the same pool of generative credits. If you run out, you can either wait until your monthly allowance resets or you can sign up for an additional credit plan at the following rates:

With each of these additional credit plans, you'll get access to an additional 100 GB of cloud storage, as well, and they renew monthly just like a normal Adobe subscription.

Although the majority of features in Firefly use credits in some form, there are exceptions. Quick Actions largely don't use generative credits, and tools like Boards and the Firefly Video Editor don't inherently use credits, either. You'll only spend credits when using a feature that leverages generative AI.

There are several ways to access Adobe Firefly features, but Adobe also offers four plans specifically for Firefly. Here's how they break down:

The major difference is between the free Firefly plan and the three paid options. You should think of the free plan more as a trial. The number of credits you get varies, so you're free to poke around and try out different models, but Adobe doesn't give you a strict budget of credits to use. The three paid plans all have similar access to features, but the monthly credit budget varies.

You can also access Firefly with a Creative Cloud subscription. Creative Cloud Standard gives you 25 monthly credits, and it works similarly to Firefly Free; that is, you'll need to spend those credits on generative AI, regardless of whether you're using a Standard or Premium feature. Creative Cloud Pro, on the other hand, basically includes Firefly Pro, with 4,000 monthly credits and unlimited access to Standard generative AI features.

There isn't a desktop application for Adobe Firefly, but you can access the app in your browser at firefly.adobe.com. Log in or sign up for an account, and you'll be greeted with a text prompt and several boxes suggesting different actions you can take. There's also a menu on the left side to help you navigate.

Firefly is powerful, and I won't be able to cover everything you can do with it. Instead, I'll walk you through a simple workflow of generating an image using an AI model, and then using that image as the starting frame to generate a short, looping video.

At the top, select New. You can either create a new file or generate a new file. Creating a file allows you to, for example, upload a photo and use generative AI to edit it, while generating a file creates that image from scratch with an AI model. For this example, choose Image under the generate section.

In this new screen, you'll see a prompt field similar to a chatbot, along with a few general settings. At the top of the sidebar, you can select your model and aspect ratio, as well as upload a reference image. If you're trying to achieve something specific, you should upload a reference image. In the prompt field, you'll see how many credits a generation costs, as well as a prompt suggestion toggle. Select Generate after entering a prompt.

Now you have an image, but that's really just the starting point. If you don't like the result, select the three dots next to the image and choose Generate More to get some more options. If the image is close, but not perfect, you can hover over it, select Edit, and then choose Use As Reference Image to feed it back into the AI model. In this same menu, you can also choose Edit Image, which will allow you to tweak the generated image by chatting with the AI model.

Once you have an image you like, you can back out to the main Firefly screen by clicking the icon in the upper left corner. Adobe keeps a record of your generation history within Firefly, so you can recall your generated assets later. Now that we have a start frame, we're going to generate a video. Select New again, and choose Video.

You'll see similar settings in the left menu, including the model you want to use, the resolution and aspect ratio, and the frame rate and duration. A new addition is down in the prompt field where you can select a frame. Choose it, and then select Adobe Cloud Storage. You can choose the image you generated earlier from your generation history.

Enter the prompt you want, and choose Generate. For this example, I asked Veo 3.1 to add natural motion and loop it, and it did a surprisingly good job without any further guidance.

There's a lot more you can do in Firefly, but I want to call attention to Boards. It's an infinite-scrolling mood board you can generate images and videos in, as well as upload your own content. Boards get really interesting with presets. You can find them in the bottom toolbar, and Adobe gives you some preset options like turning an image into a cartoon or changing the perspective of a photo.

Adobe Firefly is billed as a tool with commercial applications, meaning you can leverage it for things like advertising by generating assets. However, the commercial viability of Firefly projects depends on the models you're using.

Adobe's own Firefly models are safe for commercial use. Adobe says that it trains its models on proprietary data, and you own the output. When I asked the company about commercial use, it said that the Firefly models are similar to Adobe's apps. They're tools, and whatever you make with those tools is safe for commercial use and royalty-free.

Firefly also includes partner models, which may not be safe for commercial use. It depends on the model and what you're using it for, ultimately. Nano Banana, for instance, is generally safe for commercial use, but if you use it to generate an image that violates copyright, that is not safe for commercial use. If you're worried, it's best to stick with the Firefly models.

Other generative AI features generally don't have issues with royalties or commercial use. For instance, using Topaz Gigapixel to upscale an image you created is safe, and using features like Generative Expand or Generative Fill are generally safe, as well, even when using partner models.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Hidden Math of Ocean Waves","https://www.wired.com/story/the-hidden-math-of-ocean-waves-crashes-into-view/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 07:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

The best perk of Alberto Maspero's job, he says, is the view from his window. Situated on a hill above the ancient port city of Trieste, Italy, his office at the International School for Advanced Studies overlooks a broad bay at the northern tip of the Adriatic Sea. “It's very inspiring,” the mathematician said. “For sure the most beautiful view I've ever had.”

Italians call Trieste la città della bora, after its famed “bora” wind, which blows erratically down off the Alps and over the city. When the bora is strong enough, it drives the waves into reverse. Instead of breaking against the docks, they stream away from the city, back toward the open sea.

But they never actually get there. Watching from his window on these gusty days, Maspero can see the retreating waves slowly disperse as they exit the port, eventually giving way to a calm, still surface.

The equations that mathematicians use to study the flow of water and other fluids—which Leonhard Euler first wrote down nearly 300 years ago—look simple enough. If you know the location and velocity of each droplet of water, and simplify the math by assuming there's no internal friction, or viscosity, then solving Euler's equations will allow you to predict how the water will evolve over any time period. The rich menagerie of phenomena we see in the world's oceans—tsunamis, whirlpools, riptides—are all solutions to Euler's equations.

But the equations are usually impossible to solve. Even one of the simplest and most common kinds of solutions—one that describes a steady train of gently rolling waves—is a mathematical nightmare to extract from Euler's equations. Until about 30 years ago, the bulk of what we knew about these waves came only from a mix of real-world observations and guesswork. For the most part, proofs seemed like a fantasy.

“Before starting math, I thought water waves were something very understood—not a problem at all,” said Paolo Ventura, a postdoctoral fellow at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne and Maspero's former graduate student. “But in reality, they are just strange.”

Alberto Maspero (right) and Massimiliano Berti in Trieste, Italy, where they study the mathematics of ocean waves. Their group has been leading a recent effort to prove major conjectures in the field.

One strange phenomenon that has perplexed mathematicians for decades is that, even when friction is minimal, that steady train of gently rolling waves still eventually falls apart and becomes irregular. Mathematicians hadn't expected to see such unstable behavior emerge from such a simple starting point. They wanted to prove it—to show that instabilities arise naturally from the Euler equations. But they couldn't figure out how to do it.

Now Maspero and Ventura, along with their Trieste colleague Massimiliano Berti and Livia Corsi of Roma Tre University, have finally presented such a proof, showing exactly when these instabilities occur and when they don't. The result is just the latest in a renaissance that's starting to transform our mathematical understanding of Earth's waves. Mathematicians have been using new computational tools to formulate conjectures about how waves behave. And they're now developing sophisticated pen-and-paper techniques to prove those conjectures.

“It's not one particular thing. It's a whole wave of new types of analysis in multiple directions,” said Walter Strauss, a mathematician at Brown University. “I'm very impressed.”

The ancient Greeks often compared the unsteady beat of waves against the shore to laughter. Considering how those waves have eluded human understanding, perhaps they were right: The ocean has been laughing at us all along.

Even at the height of the Enlightenment in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, when waves took up much of the scientific discourse, the ocean always seemed to have the last word. A number of scientists had measured the speed of sound waves, and Newton and his detractors were locked in a conflict over the wavelike nature of light. But the oldest waves known to humans remained a mathematical enigma.

It would take more than a century for this to start to change. In the early 1800s, Sir George Stokes became fascinated with ocean waves when, as a boy, he was swimming near his home in Sligo, Ireland, and an enormous wave almost dragged him out to sea. In 1847, he published a monumental treatise on the topic. He started with Euler's equations for a fluid with no viscosity and added the mathematical condition that its top surface be totally “free”—allowed to take any shape it pleased.

Ocean waves can form complicated patterns that are almost prohibitively difficult to study mathematically. “Square waves” like the ones shown above form when two different wave systems collide.

“They don't look bad,” Strauss said of the resulting equations. “But just take a look at a lake with a little wind on it. You get all these complicated forms, like whitecaps and rolling waves, some parallel to each other, some not.”

Each of these varied forms, when understood as a solution to Euler's equations, is mathematically distinct and terribly unwieldy. Make the tiniest change to the fluid's initial state, and it might evolve in a vastly different way—bumps and eddies can become rogue waves and tsunamis.

Before starting math, I thought water waves were something very understood—not a problem at all.

These free, moving surfaces were what Stokes wanted to study. But the challenge was immense. Describing the motion of water confined within a box, or flowing through a pipe, is hard enough. But then, at least, you know where the system's edges lie—no water can extend beyond those boundaries. If there's no restriction other than the force of gravity on how high the water can reach and what shape it can take, the math becomes far more difficult.

“If I go to the beach at seven in the morning, it's going to be very calm,” Corsi said. “But if you really look at the surface, how it moves, it's a mess.”

Still, Stokes was able to conjecture one solution: that it's possible for the surface of the water to form evenly spaced waves that travel in a single direction.

In the 1920s, mathematicians proved Stokes' conjecture. Furthermore, they found that if there are no external disturbances, these solutions to the Euler equations persist forever: Once they form, so-called Stokes waves will continue cruising gaily along the water's surface for all time, their form unchanged.

Paolo Ventura recently helped prove an important result about when a particular type of wave persists and when it doesn't in the face of perturbations.

But what if the wake of a passing boat crosses the waves' path? Will the waves absorb this disturbance and maintain their form, or will they be disrupted permanently, transforming into an entirely different pattern of waves?

For decades, mathematicians assumed that Stokes waves are stable, meaning that any small distortion will have a minimal effect. After all, the real world is full of such complications, yet the seas are rife with Stokes waves. If they fell apart at the tiniest poke, they'd never survive long enough to make it to shore.

Still, in 1967, the mathematician T. Brooke Benjamin decided to verify this basic assumption. He had his student Jim Feir perform a series of experiments in a wave tank—a narrow rectangular pool with an oscillating rudder at one end that could produce Stokes waves. But Feir couldn't get the waves to reach the other end of the pool. At first, he thought there was a problem with the experimental setup. But soon it became apparent that the waves were, surprisingly, unstable.

In 1995, mathematicians finally proved that such “Benjamin-Feir instabilities” are an inevitable consequence of the Euler equations. But the work left researchers wondering about the nature of these instabilities. Which kinds of disturbances can kill waves, and which can't? How rapidly do the instabilities balloon? Could a gust of wind at the center of the Pacific cause a train of waves to strike Malibu Beach weeks later, or would the formation break down before reaching the shore?

Maspero had never thought to wonder why the waves exiting Trieste's bay were dying. His inspiration ultimately came from a computer, not the scene outside his window.

At a 2019 workshop on the mathematics of waves, he and his collaborators met Bernard Deconinck, an applied mathematician at the University of Washington who, along with Katie Oliveras of Seattle University, had been mapping all the different instabilities that could destroy Stokes waves. A few years earlier, the pair had noticed an astonishing pattern, and they hadn't been able to stop thinking about it.

When a perfect train of Stokes waves encounters a disturbance that distorts the waves' shape, sometimes the effects of the disturbance grow to destroy the entire train, and sometimes they barely interfere. The outcome depends on the frequency of the disturbance—how much it oscillates compared to the length of the original wave. A kayak, which produces a wake that consists of short, frequent oscillations, will deliver a higher-frequency impact than a massive ocean liner, which produces longer and slower oscillations.

Livia Corsi is fascinated by the messy, unpredictable nature of the ocean and the mathematics that governs it.

In general, mathematicians expect waves to recover more easily from higher-frequency disruptions like the kayak's, because their impacts are limited to a smaller region of a passing wave at any given moment. The wake of the ocean liner, on the other hand, can affect the entire wave at once, permanently disrupting it. Benjamin-Feir instabilities are caused by low-frequency disruptions.

In 2011, Deconinck and Oliveras simulated different disturbances with higher and higher frequencies and watched what happened to the Stokes waves. As they expected, for disturbances above a certain frequency, the waves persevered.

But as the pair continued to dial up the frequency, they suddenly began to see destruction again. At first, Oliveras worried that there was a bug in the computer program. “Part of me was like, this can't be right,” she said. “But the more I dug, the more it persisted.”

In fact, as the frequency of the disturbance increased, an alternating pattern emerged. First there was an interval of frequencies where the waves became unstable. This was followed by an interval of stability, which was followed by yet another interval of instability, and so on.

Deconinck and Oliveras published their finding as a counterintuitive conjecture: that this archipelago of instabilities stretches off to infinity. They called all the unstable intervals “isole”—the Italian word for “islands.”

It was strange. The pair had no explanation for why instabilities would appear again, let alone infinitely many times. They at least wanted a proof that their startling observation was correct.

Bernard Deconinck and Katie Oliveras uncovered a strange pattern in computational studies of wave stability.

For years, no one could make any progress. Then, at the 2019 workshop, Deconinck approached Maspero and his team. He knew they had a lot of experience studying the math of wavelike phenomena in quantum physics. Perhaps they could figure out a way to prove that these striking patterns arise from the Euler equations.

The Italian group got to work immediately. They started with the lowest set of frequencies that seemed to cause waves to die. First, they applied techniques from physics to represent each of these low-frequency instabilities as arrays, or matrices, of 16 numbers. These numbers encoded how the instability would grow and distort the Stokes waves over time. The mathematicians realized that if one of the numbers in the matrix was always zero, the instability would not grow, and the waves would live on. If the number was positive, the instability would grow and eventually destroy the waves.

Part of me was like, this can't be right. But the more I dug, the more it persisted.

To show that this number was positive for the first batch of instabilities, the mathematicians had to compute a gigantic sum. It took 45 pages and nearly a year of work to solve it. Once they'd done so, they turned their attention to the infinitely many intervals of higher-frequency wave-killing disturbances—the isole.

First, they figured out a general formula—another complicated sum—that would give them the number they needed for each isola. Then they used a computer program to solve the formula for the first 21 isole. (After that, the calculations got too complicated for the computer to handle.) The numbers were all positive, as expected—and they also seemed to follow a simple pattern that implied they would be positive for all the other isole as well.

But a pattern isn't a proof, and Maspero and his colleagues weren't sure how to proceed. So they turned to a global community of computer experts for help.

Maspero had been scouring the mathematical literature for anything that could help him. The problem, he decided, was that he needed to somehow simplify the calculations he had to make. He found a book in which Doron Zeilberger, a mathematician at Rutgers University, outlined algorithmic approaches to performing difficult algebraic calculations on a computer. Unable to adapt them to his case, Maspero reached out to Zeilberger directly.

“We have recently encountered certain combinatorial problems that we cannot solve,” his email to Zeilberger began. “We wonder if you can help us.”

Zeilberger was intrigued. “The question was exactly my cup of tea,” he said. With some work, he was able to get his computer, which he calls Shalosh B. Ekhad (and which appears as a coauthor on all his papers), to compute sums for the first 2,000 isole, verifying that the outputs were all positive and that they conformed to the pattern the Italian team had identified. Then he called on his network of computer-algebra enthusiasts to help, offering to make a $100 donation to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences in the name of whoever could establish that the pattern persisted forever.

In February 2024, Zeilberger paid up. After a lengthy email exchange with two of his frequent collaborators, he came back with a complete proof that the sums would never equal zero.

Deconinck and Oliveras had been right: Their isole were real. The result means that mathematicians now finally know precisely which types of disturbances will kill a Stokes wave and which will not—something they have hoped to understand for two centuries.

“It's just like, holy crap, thank you,” Oliveras said.

It also leaves mathematicians with more work to do. Why do waves live and die in this alternating pattern? “OK, those isole were real,” she said. “Now we have to pay attention to them.”

The result is just the latest in a recent spate of papers that aim to illuminate the mathematics of water waves. Mathematicians are combining advances in computational and theoretical techniques to better understand solutions to the Euler equations, allowing them to prove more and more conjectures about how waves behave. Maspero and his colleagues hope that their methods can now be used to solve other problems in this area.

As for the bora-blown waves outside Maspero's office window, and their eventual decline into flat water—at the moment, he can't say for sure whether his team's math explains this precise phenomenon. “I don't know if there is a connection,” he said. “But I love to think it's the same instabilities.”

Did you hear? Elon Musk got his $1 trillion pay package. Of course you did, because coverage of that highly anticipated vote is everywhere, including here at TechCrunch. But what does this actually mean? 

Yes, this is about money, but it's more about power and control. You might recall that Musk repeatedly talked about the need to control Tesla and offered up a variety of scenarios, including one involving a robot army, to argue for it.

And the stakes were high; if he didn't get that control, he threatened to leave. Shareholders simply could not, did not want to imagine Tesla without Elon.

All of that money, power, and control increases for Musk if Tesla reaches milestones based on operations, adjusted profit, and market capitalization. Every tranche, if the goal is reached, will deliver 35.3 million shares to Musk. For instance, the first tranche milestone is a market capitalization of $2 trillion. Today, Tesla's market cap sits at about $1.5 trillion. 

Tesla is a weird animal in which its share price often has nothing to do with actual fundamentals. It's not unusual for Tesla's stock price to rise because of comments Musk made during an earnings call even if its quarterly figures weren't particularly good. I'm sure this is incredibly frustrating for other automakers. 

Which is why I am more interested in some of the product and adjusted profit goals tied to this package. Goals include 20 million Tesla vehicles delivered, 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, 1 million robots delivered, and 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation within 10 years. Scroll down to the bottom to participate in a survey regarding these goals. 

Musk used the shareholder meeting for more than just a victory lap, although that vibe was certainly present. He made a number of forecasts and promises, including that production of its Cybercab will begin in April and that the company might need to build a “gigantic” semiconductor fabrication plant. He also punted on the Roadster 2 again, which was first revealed as a prototype vehicle in 2017. A production version will now be shown on April 1, 2026 — yup, April Fools' Day. 

Reminder: That Master Plan 4, which was the centerpiece of Tesla's pitch to shareholders to approve the $1 trillion pay package, is still woefully short on details.

We're working on a few spicy items, but nothing that is ready quite yet. In the meantime, remember our emails are always open for tips.

Beta Technologies, the electric aviation startup, pushed ahead with its IPO despite the government shutdown thanks to some relaxed rules courtesy of the SEC. The company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange with an outsized raise of $1 billion.

And while the stock price didn't skyrocket in its first day of trading, it didn't fall either — which has happened to a few recent IPOs. 

The Vermont-based company priced shares in its IPO at $34, above its predicted range of $27 to $33. Beta Technologies sold 29.9 million shares to raise $1 billion at a valuation of $7.4 billion. It closed up at $36 and even held that ground the following day. Shares have since fallen to about $31. 

Of course, this is a long game and Beta Technologies is still working on commercializing its aviation products. Let's see where the company is at — and its share price — a year from now.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Archer Aviation raised $650 million through a stock offering for 81.25 million shares, funds that will support its $126 million acquisition of Hawthorne Airport, a strategically important airport in Los Angeles. Shareholders didn't respond favorably and shares fell more than 12.6% Friday. 

Fun fact: This airport, aside from having a fantastic restaurant, is in Elon Musk's backyard. The Tesla Design Studio and SpaceX are right next door, and the airport has been used for various product launches, including the Tesla Semi. 

Evotrex, a startup developing a hybrid RV travel trailer with an integrated gas engine, has come out of stealth with $16 million in seed money from Anker, as well as Chinese early-stage venture firms Unity Ventures, Kylinhall Partners, and Vision Plus Capital.

Indian two-wheeler giant TVS Motor sold its entire stake in ride-hailing company Rapido for ₹2.88 billion (about $32 million) to Accel and Prosus' investment unit, MIH Investments. 

Lucid Motors' majority owner — Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — boosted the cap of a loan agreement from $750 million to around $2 billion, which provides the company liquidity until 2027.

Rivian reported third-quarter earnings this week, and amid the financial results was a head scratcher. The company has spun off another company — this time it is an industrial AI and robotics venture called Mind Robotics. Remember, earlier this year Rivian spun off a micromobility company called Also. Mind Robotics has already raised a $115 million seed round, which was led by VC firm Eclipse. Jiten Behl, a partner at Eclipse who used to work at Rivian, is a major backer of Also.

Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor in the School of Law and (by courtesy) the School of Engineering at the University of South Carolina, has been a go-to expert and adviser to governments and safety organizations around automated driving for years — particularly around how it is communicated with the public. He released a paper last month that I would be remiss not to share here. It's called “Self-Driving” Means Self-Driving.

Ford executives are mulling over whether to kill off the F-150 Lightning truck. 

Lucid is in the midst of an executive shake-up as it continues its search for a permanent CEO. The EV maker's chief engineer Eric Bach is leaving the company after more than a decade and Jeri Ford, who was VP of Quality, is retiring. TechCrunch also learned James Hawkins, who was VP of Engineering, is also no longer with the company. Meanwhile, Senior Vice President of Powertrain, Emad Dlala, is being elevated to oversee all of “Engineering and Digital.”

Luminar continues to struggle. The company was recently hit with an eviction notice for one of its Orlando, Florida, offices.

Lyft had a positive third quarter that included a profit of $46.1 million. That's good news considering it reported a loss of $12.4 million in the same quarter last year. Lyft also saw ridership grow (15% year-over-year to 248.8 million) and revenue rise 11% to $1.69 billion compared with the same year-ago period. 

Rivian posted its third-quarter earnings and while the company is still operating at a loss, the revenue results appeased Wall Street. The company's revenue rose 78% year-over-year to $1.56 billion — and, hey, that's not nothin'. But it also had a hefty Q3 loss of $1.17 billion, a 6% rise from the loss of $1.1 billion it reported a year earlier.

Waymo plans to launch a robotaxi service in Detroit, Las Vegas, and San Diego. If it seems like Waymo is ramping up quickly, you would be correct. Don't forget, last month at TechCrunch Disrupt, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said that by the end of 2026, “you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week.” Waymo hasn't shared that weekly number since April, when it was more than 250,000 trips per week.

My SSN is out there several times over at this point, thanks to breaches at phone companies, insurance companies, CRAs, ISPs, and the rest. I stopped tracking breaches that included the kind of info you'd need to impersonate me, about six years ago. The list was long and it seemed to be a pointless exercise by then.I also have a mixed credit file with all major CRAs because of more than one person with the same name I have, one of whom lived in the same area.Even if I didn't have freezes everywhere, over the phone KBAs stopped working years ago even with my SSN.

if you attach documents 'inside' the mail (i.e. MIME encoded multipart) that is most definitely not secure.1) you do not know how that mail gets delivered, not necessarily via servers that support encryption
2) you do not know how that mail, or the attachment, gets stored on the local machine
3) you do now know if the mail, or attachment, is sent to someone else
4) you cannot revoke the access to the document once the Need To Known stopsIn our ISMS, sending Highly Sensitive data (ex: customer data) by attaching directly to a mail, is strictly not allowed by the IT charter. We explain it during an on-boarding meeting to all new staff members. And it's a fireable offense.

reply

High profile figures may appear distant, callous, or even fully radicalised by that onslaught.  While you shouldn't have to blindly accept poor behaviour from people just because of their fame, I think you should still try to have compassion for their situation.  If you think in terms of a bad person compared to bad behaviour we risk normalising a response to that behaviour that creates a feedback loop that exacerbates the problem.Part of me wonders if there is nothing to be done.  Perhaps the worst of people will still create enough poor feedback for someone famous enough.  Will the majority being more compassionate mitigate the problem, I'd like to think so.

An identity that is obviously constructed (like VTubers) at least signals to the audience that the real person behind the character would like to stay anonymous. I think the majority of fans would respect that wish.Whereas celebrities who make their real-life identity into a brand - even if that brand is an obvious fiction as well - signal the opposite to their audience.

I felt guilty reading it, as in many past companies ""Mark Zuckerberg"" (and Bill Gates, and Tim Apple, Elon Musk etc) was indeed often used as a placeholder for test accounts and test data, and it never crossed my mind that we were basically training ourself to also treat a ""Mark Zuckerberg"" on our service as an account that escaped the sandbox or some other attack on the service.

To defend a bit the choice for somewhat realistic names, there is a gestalt decomposition where you're looking through ""First name"" first names for hundreds of lines. Same for Lorum ipsums, designers' reaction are completely different when the page looks somewhat realistic and isn't just a blatant test.

American engineers will be replaced wholesale with overseas engineers that cost a fraction of American labor.You can hire talented React engineers for $50k that will work harder than their American counterparts.It's not just React.

So yeah it's not surprising that jobs are going offshore.

Jobs that have a high 0-1 component will still be in the US but jobs that are more 1-n may be offshored.

reply

reply

If anyone is worried about their job, it won't be AI that takes it - it will be outsourcing. The US offshores 300k jobs per year with a high percentage of them being IT (60-80% depending on source). It's really not that different to the offshoring of manufacturing decades ago. Why pay people onshore when you can pay someone in India half of that? Any job that doesn't require a physical presence or has legal pressures to keep it onshore will be at risk. It will likely get worse over time, just like manufacturing. I don't know what the future will look like if we continue outsourcing everything. It used to be that we outsource primary and secondary sector activies so that we could expand tertiary industries. What are we replacing the outsourced jobs with now?

Here is an article putting together data from GitHub about SW developers per country.https://data-player.com/highest-number-of-software-developer...When talking about outsourcing jobs from the U.S., you're obviously gonna exclude the U.S. China is also not a factor. Neither are Western European countries or countries like Japan and S Korea because of relatively high salaries. Russia is out due to long standing geopolitical issues.That basically leaves Brazil and Indonesia as the only alternatives to India in the top 10 and combined they don't even have half the number of SW developers as India.You need to then add Mexico, Vietnam, Turkey, Philippines and Poland to the above 3 to add up to the number of SW developers present in India.Thats why the outsourcing industry is concentrated in India. You can setup 1 office in India and have access to as many SW developers (Indians are also very willing to migrate domestically, so an office in a single city is sufficient to cater to the entire domestic developer market) as you would if you setup 8 offices in & different countries across 4 continents.

>70% is a pretty insane number that certainly speaks for itself.Also, when you start giving a lot of tech jobs to people from one specific country, than the github developer numbers will naturally reflect that.

Indians are more visible, but salary expections have gotten extremely out of whack in the US, and extended WFH during COVID proved to most boards that companies can continue to operate when entire teams are communicating async.If a large portion of interns and NCGs in the US are essentially expecting $45-70/hr salaries, it just isn't sustainable especially when factoring the growing skills deficit because universities failed CS students to a certain degree over the past 10 years by watering down programs in a short term bid to compete against bootcamps.If we are paying Bay Area salaries, we expect performance comensurate to that salary. Basically, all companies are now starting to adopt the Netflix model of hiring in the US.

Edit: can't reply but every single white collar job provides an employer healthcare plan that is equally as competitive as the public healthcare plans in Canada and the UK.And especially if you were being paid $50/hr as a new grad in 2014.Edit 2:> And I was in Michigan.All the more reason I would have pushed back severely. It's easier to find talent at scale in London or GTA - metros there have a population larger than the entire state of MI, and with a breadth of options beyond UMich Ann-Arbor.

One thing also contradicting the ""AI can do it"" argument, is that a business's playbook is to rather expand the work force in order to multiply the effect of technology. Yet they lay off in waves.There is no dissonance, just a disguise: Several big tech companies in the US cut their workforce, in the US, while expanding it in countries where talent is cheaper.Paradoxally, junior folks have it even worse. It has become very difficult to land a job without experience, again, in the US. It all makes sense, if you replace US based senior staff with Junior staff on different time zone, and having a different culture, you are left with nobody to mentor and supervise junior so staff.I still can't explain how ending up with more Junior staff, offshore, less senior staff and little to no Junior staff locally will pay off in the long term.I guess I will figure that out, but for now that's one piece of the puzzle I can only call an ""economic downturn"" outlook.

Doesn't it affect big tech companies? Only startups?I would guess the opposite, with big companies being much more savvy and influenced by fiscal incentives.

> Those expenditures may be approaching $1 trillion for 2025, while AI revenue—which would be used to pay for the use of AI infrastructure to run the software—will not exceed $30 billion this yearWhile it's clear that the author is summing up the spending from the big players, it's not clear to me that their math is right for revenue. Yes, OpenAI, Anthropic, Thinking Machines, SSI, etc. have pretty limited direct revenue (including zero!).But this comparison assumes no revenue growth for other top computing users. Some companies are certainly saving money on some tasks and increasing revenue, particularly in fields like customer support. See the confusing figure in section 5 of https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/econo... .That chart is by number of respondents and not weighted by revenue.

Capital expenditure has multiple years of useful life. Revenue is annual. You'd want to compare depreciation vs revenue.

OTOH, if it is only dreams of AI, manifested as AI spending, or CEOs laying people off thinking that AI will soon (even if not today) be capable of backfilling them, then this may well backfire, and will be ""reversed"" if demand is less than forecasted and/or job-replacing AGI doesn't materialize, and all we get is productivity tools, useful mostly for a narrow band of jobs.Incidentally, I think Karpathy might be right that there is pretty much only one job that seems it actually could be replaced by AI today, at least potentially, which is call center tech support, or customer support, staff, who are dealing with a narrow domain and just reading off a script.

And investment and experiments by definition include the risk of failing. In almost everything lies a survivorship bias and no one talks about the 100+ car makers that went into goldrush mode 100+ years ago. This is life. Netflix vs Blockbuster - already forgotten?Also the ""fail rate"" - so what part is failing and why? What's with the 5%? If we have a look at exponential functions this might be a really good deal, if the 5% can account for the losses. After all, benefits compound over time.I witnessed first hand in FAANG some quota hires and I believe that now that no one gets paid for contrived and artificial business advantages, we are back to a more merits based evaluation of workers.But AI should not be written off as fancy something with no impact. That's the wrong take. Whether it will be a springboard to new jobs that compensate for losses or replacements - I am not yet sure, but tent to be in the former group. ML engineers take care of ML - something new that takes care of something new.We will see.

AMZN for example overhired in various functions because it expected demand that never materialised. 
Admitting that is bad for the share price, but writing some woo about ""AI and agility"" will convince at least some investors to keep the faith.

The spending-revenue gap is real. Hyperscalers are projected to spend $300-550B on AI infrastructure in 2025[1] while generative AI revenue won't exceed $30-40B [2]. Amazon's capex jumped from $48B in 2023 to $84B in 2024 to a projected $100B+ in 2025[3], that's capital intensity doubling from historical norms of 11-16% to over 22% [4].But here's what the article misses: this isn't financial desperation. When Amazon's CEO announces 14,000 layoffs and explicitly states that AI will enable ""fewer people doing some jobs""[5], he's revealing the strategic logic — show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome. Companies aren't cutting jobs despite AI spending; they're cutting jobs because they know AI spending will pay off.To be clear, the article treats the spending-revenue gap as evidence of irrationality. But infrastructure buildouts always precede revenue: railroads looked insane before they transformed commerce, electricity grids consumed massive capital before delivering returns, the internet required enormous infrastructure investment before creating trillion-dollar companies.What's different now is companies are pulling the future forward. AI is already automating 25% of tasks and delivering 10-55% productivity gains[6, they're not waiting for AI to replace jobs organically. They're cutting headcount now to fund the infrastructure that will make those cuts permanent.More broadly, this is rational capital reallocation in a winner-take-all race. Companies that don't build AI infrastructure won't gradually decline, they'll lose competitive positioning entirely. That's why Meta is using off-balance-sheet financing for a $27B data center[7], why Oracle is borrowing $25B annually despite already carrying 450% debt-to-equity [8]. They're all-in because the alternative is obsolescence.The real story isn't ""spending causes cuts"" — it's that AI infrastructure commoditizes human expertise, the complement to compute infrastructure. Companies are trading labor costs for compute infrastructure because they've correctly identified compute as the new moat. The job cuts aren't the price of spending on AI; they're the business model shift that AI enables.The article is right that we're not seeing mass AI job replacement yet. But the job cuts are happening in anticipation of replacement, not as an unfortunate side effect of spending. That's not desperation — that's strategy.--

Over the last 20 years of tech, the giants have taken the smartest folks out there and put golden handcuffs on them. You could hire up all the smart folks and put them to work, or leave them out there and have them compete with you. With the launch of cloud providers and (expensive) dynamic scaling the problem only got worse. Think about hiring in the pandemic. Every one at home, with a stimulus check and nothing to do. Rather than a flurry of new software you got mass hiring.But now we are in a capital intensive hardware cycle. Where in order to compete you need to have lots of $$$$ as well as software know how. It does not matter that there are smart people out there, without hefty backing they wont get very far.I suspect that software is about to enter its ""punk"" era. We have software for small businesses that will help with accounting, HR, customer service, and cloud providers are starting to see some interesting competition. Much like the old punk poster showing you 3 chords and telling you to start a band it is entirely possible to find three friends and start a business that makes 1-10 mill a year with little effort and lower costs. The moment you stop thinking ""unicorn"" and start thinking ""sustainable"" the economics shift radically.

That's 400B that could have otherwise been invested in people.While i don't doubt that people will find a few solid business cases for LLMs, i am on team-bubble. I don't think this investment will add 400B worth of value and I very much doubt that this 400B is any good for future growth or long-term aspirations of AGI. Investing 400B into people and (tech) manufacturing would be a solid long-term bet with benefits.

Layoffs to cut expenditure to make up for the written-off expenditure.In the UK, if AI makes a well-established employee redundant, the employee is entitled to redundancy pay. And if the company fucks up and overspends on chasing a ridiculous Macguffin they can't just fire people without making them formally redundant.The damage that is going to be done in the USA if the AI bubble bursts is going to be generational.

I bought a Samsung watch once, had to reverse it to enable functionality that was advertised a year before but never delivered. It died because the watch decided to suck in water during a reboot while swimming, they quoted me almost the full price to repair it, even though it was clearly a software bug that caused another advertised feature (namely it's ipx rating) to fail.And while I also wouldn't give Xiaomi iot devices on the network full internet access, at least I can use those things normally.

I agree with you 100% about Samsung. They make nice hardware, but the software experience is among the worst in the industry. I don't know how they can be considered a premium product. I would never use one of their phones again. Straight up adware. I'm surprised they don't inject ads into the photos you take. They have ads everywhere else - even in the phone dialing app. Their TV's are still good as long as you don't connect them to the internet. Once they start putting LTE radios in them to download ads without wifi, I will be done with those too.

It's getting so you don't have a real choice. You can buy a fridge (or any appliance pretty much) that is basic and doesn't do the connected thing. But often you want the upscaled models because of real hardware features that are desirable. And these are always bundled with the “connectivity” options. It used to be you just ignored these bits. But they're getting more and more invasive.

Their smart TV stuff used to be marginally interesting. When Samsung TV Plus launched it was fantastic. They weren't yet sure of how to handle ads so even the ad space was still nice, and marginally useful.As they figured out the ad strategy, apps started disappearing and new ones appeared that couldn't be uninstalled.Then the OS updates started cratering performance. I have a Samsung smart TV from after 2020 that takes about 4 seconds to register a single remote control command in the smart TV GUI.

Unless you have root and can do anything the hardware is capable of, it's not your device. And you shouldn't let any sort of non-owned devices on your network.Why? Cause devices controlled by other orgs are a foothold situation. And we've had countless attacks of footholds being used as internal points of attack, DDoS, and other attacks.That also means that all your ""cloud devices"" should be able to  work 100% offline. If not, return them as defective.

In my market Samsung has driven away all the service techs. We managed to find one, and he said he only works on Samsung because it's a captive market now. He complained that Samsung micromanages field services to a degree that they're killing the service ecosystem for their appliances.We had him try to fix an issue with a dryer. On his way out he looked at the fridge and said “has the ice maker stopped working yet?” It actually had stopped working a year earlier. We didn't get it fixed then because Samsung didn't have anyone to send, and there were no third parties we could find (even unauthorized).We've been replacing all our appliances with other brands.Edit: PS - depending on the model of fridge, the ice maker infrastructure (typically near the filter) eventually start pooling water and might freeze in inconvenient places. Watch out for that. YMMV.

And it can't register anything placed in the flex drawer, freezer, or fridge doors. In order to actually take advantage of its fridge inventory system, you still have to manually enter in or correct every single item you place into your fridge.It's inconvenient for looking up recipes, since fridges are not placed for visibility from your countertop. It can be used for music but the speakers aren't worth the extra money. Videos and movies? The screen's the wrong aspect ratio for anything but big screen TikTok. And again, fridges are not positioned to gather around.And that last bit is the crux of the issue. I've talked to our Samsung reps and they keep talking about fridges like they're gathering points. Like people congregate around their fridges. That was the guiding principle behind this fridge, and it's so disconnected from reality that the appliance itself can't help but be irredeemably pointless.

And while investors would prefer full price fridges with full price ads, the ad economy only makes sense once you have decent reach, so it makes sense to lower the cost of acquisition of the device, take the hit as a customer acquisition cost and then sell the larger reach to advertisers.This is the model for every ad-supported device and service to date, I'm not sure they're going to reinvent those economics for a fridge.

The thing that makes corporations give better warranty support is not more money. Giving them more money does not incentivize them to suddenly give better service or make higher quality goods. The thing is consumer protection laws. In the EU, consumer goods have a minimum two-year warranty period. This incentivizes higher quality manufacturing.

This is not. An appliance—which should never be connected to the Internet in the first place—that costs 4 digits in USD should never show you ads in any way. You obviously don't ""loathe"" ads if you're even capable of reasoning about that kind of behavior. Stop trying to shove ads 24/7 in every millimeter of available space.On the upside, it will be very easy to find more reliable and cheaper fridges than that.

The problem is that even if you can amass such an IOT botnet, you still need people on the ground to conduct such burglaries, and that scales poorly. Even if you tried to operate on a SaaS model, you're going to find that your clients (ie. drug users who want their next fix) are fickle and are very eager to snitch on you to the police, making it very likely that your botnet gets dismantled. On the other hand running a DDoS or ""residential proxy"" botnet comes with none of these hassles.

Whether it's possible to just not care about that and sneak stuff in regardless (e.g. using autocomplete and so on, maybe vibe coding a prototype and then making it your own to some degree), or whether it's possible to use it as any other tool in development, that's another story.Edit: to clarify my personal stance, I'm largely in the ""code is code"" camp - either it meets some standard, or it doesn't.

Whether it's possible to just not care about that and sneak stuff in regardless (e.g. using autocomplete and so on, maybe vibe coding a prototype and then making it your own to some degree), or whether it's possible to use it as any other tool in development, that's another story.Edit: to clarify my personal stance, I'm largely in the ""code is code"" camp - either it meets some standard, or it doesn't. It's a bit like with art - whether you prefer something with soul or mindless slop, unfortunately for some the reckoning is that the purse holders often really do not care.

These issues are no different for normal submissions.You are responsible for taking ownership and having sorted out copyright. You may accidentally through prior knowledge write something identical to pre-existing code with pre-existing copyright. Or steal it straight off StackOverflow. Same for an LLM - at least Github Copilot has a feature to detect literal duplicates.You are responsible for ensuring the code you submit makes sense and is maintainable, and the reviewer will question this. Many submit hand-written, unmaintainable garbage. This is not an LLM specific issue.Ethics is another thing, but I don't agree with any proposed issues. Learning from the works of others is an extremely human thing, and I don't see a problem being created by the fact that the experience was contained in an intermediate box.The real problem is that there are a lot of extremely lazy individuals thinking that they are now developers because they can make ChatGPT/Claude write them a PR, and throw a tantrum over how it's discriminating against them to disallow the work on the basis that they don't understand it.That is: The problem is people, as it always has been. Not LLMs.

Now, is there hard evidence that AI use does lead to this in all cases? Not that I'm aware of. Just as there's no easy way to prove the difference between ""I don't think this is impacting me, but it is"" and ""it really isn't"".It comes down to two unevidenced assertions - ""this will reduce attentiveness"" vs ""no it won't"". But I don't feel great about a project like this just going straight for ""no it won't"" as though that's something they feel with high confidence.From where does that confidence come?

    No, I'm afraid that computer science has suffered from the popularity of the Internet. It has attracted an increasing —not to say: overwhelming!— number of students with very little scientific inclination and in research it has only strengthened the prevailing (and somewhat vulgar) obsession with speed and capacity.

    Yes, I share your concern: how to program well —though a teachable topic— is hardly taught. The situation is similar to that in mathematics, where the explicit curriculum is confined to mathematical results; how to do mathematics is something the student must absorb by osmosis, so to speak. One reason for preferring symbol-manipulating, calculating arguments is that their design is much better teachable than the design of verbal/pictorial arguments. Large-scale introduction of courses on such calculational methodology, however, would encounter unsurmountable political problems.

Maybe we shouldn't write programs in this style (i.e. imperative). Maybe we shouldn't even use an imperative language (I know, that's a stretch, many languages have incorporated functional aspects and we can utilize them instead of trying to avoid the language entirely).---Dijkstra ends EWB 32 with:""Smoothly we have arrived at the third component of our tool, viz. the language: also the language should be a reliable one. In other words it should assist the programmer as much as possible in the most difficult aspect of his task, viz. to convince himself —and those others who are really interested— that the program he has written down defines indeed the process he wanted to define.""As my very last remark I should like to stress that the tool as a whole should have still another quality. It is a much more subtle one; whether we appreciate it or not depends much more on our personal taste and education and I shall not even try to define it. The tool should be charming, it should be elegant, it should be worthy of our love. This is no joke, I am terribly serious about this. In this respect the programmer does not differ from any other craftsman: unless he loves his tools it is highly improbable that he will ever create something of superior quality.""At the same time these considerations tell us the greatest virtues a program can show: Elegance and Beauty.""---Functional languages... help us achieve these aims.

Generally I think this does answer the question about why functional languages don't dominate more than they do - although you could make an argument that JavaScript is a functional language, and it certainly is enjoying a lot of dominance these days. JS environments aren't known for being particularly efficient, though. To me, efficient use of resources is elegant, and a language needs to be able to do that.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

At least one of the big AI brains at the Chinese chatbot leader DeepSeek has announced that he's worried—like many U.S. AI luminaries before him—that AI will hurt the world. But in China, unlike the U.S., the state can and does regulate tech with a heavy hand, and in that context such a sentiment comes across as slightly more substantive than when, say, OpenAI's Sam Altman hypes up his future investment by saying things like, “A.I. will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies.”For context, at the start of this year, DeepSeek, the little-known AI wing of a hedge fund based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province exploded onto the scene, having suddenly come into possession of the holy grail of the tech world: its own cutting-edge large language model, DeepSeek-R1. Following its breakout success, the DeepSeek team has been pretty tight-lipped for most of the year, but DeepSeek senior researcher Chen Deli has finally broken the company's silence on whether or not what they are doing is good or bad for society. According to Chen: quite possibly bad!“I'm extremely positive about the technology but I view the impact it could have on society negatively,” Chen said onstage in Wuzhen at the government-organized World Internet Conference. Back in January, Chen was in a better mood, tweeting that he was “beyond words right now,” and that the astronomical benchmark ranking of his company's low-cost model “feels like a dream.” That was January. Then in February, Deepseek's Founder Liang Wenfeng met with President Xi Jinping at a televised symposium. After that, as Reuters notes, no one from the company has addressed the public, until Chen's depressing appearance at the World Internet Conference.According to Chen, AI will threaten jobs in the next decade as it becomes good enough to get people replaced, but AI firms have a job to do when it comes to staving off disaster for humanity. “Society could face a massive challenge,” Chen said, “so at the time tech companies need to take the role of ‘defender'.”Realistically, U.S. companies are probably not the companies Chen has in mind as “defender.” His company has close ties to other Chinese companies, many of which have scrambled to integrate DeepSeek AI products into their own ever since the R1 model was released earlier this year, apparently part of the increasingly DeepSeek-centric plan for “algorithmic sovereignty”—cutting-edge achievements in AI without foreign involvement, basically. A little over a month ago, DeepSeek released what it called an “experimental” version of its LLM, a version notable not so much for its efficiency gains or new capabilities, as for its creation of an alternative to Nvidia's CUDA API, and its support for Chinese GPUs.A little over a week ago, Xi said at the 2025 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that there should be a global body that governs AI, and that such an international governmental organization would be in the interest of making AI a “public good for the international community.” 

Now a representative from DeepSeek itself is making statements about AI being a potential hazard for society that the tech world must find a unified approach to mitigating. Yes, when an AI billionaire from the U.S. says this sort of thing, it's probably just hype. Chen's statement, on the other hand, sounds less like tech business swagger and more like the literal party line.

If you weren't alive, or weren't news-cognizant, back in 2007 when the slow motion debt crisis all around us started to give way to The Great Recession, what was eerie was that it felt like you were always hearing about refinancing debt. You couldn't turn on a TV, or click a page on MySpace, without someone offering to refinance your debt. This was because there was a huge—and for most people, hidden—market for things called mortgage-backed securities. This piece at the Onion captured the moment well.You could get a cheap mortgage weirdly easily because of mortgage backed securities. This involved repackaging people's mortgages—as in mortgages on their homes—as lucrative, tradable assets, and these assets were being purchased on behalf of entities like investment banks and retirement funds. Lehman Brothers, for instance, was a staid, boring financial institution that was heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities.Mortgage-backed securities were everywhere in the economy, and the entities that owned them were the pillars of economic stability. When, slowly but surely, people defaulted on their mortgages in higher and higher numbers, the mortgage-backed securities that had been thought of as valuable were suddenly thought of as doodoo. In 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, and the world was plunged into chaos. In this way, over $10 trillion in wealth vanished in the U.S. during 2008 alone. That crisis has come and gone. We're in a different world, where things don't work the same way. We have different problems.Today, all U.S. economic growth is driven by investment in AI. Entire U.S. towns are banking on the idea that data centers being built in their communities will sustain their economies forever, or at least until some other type of business exists to create a different kind of boom. The real estate biz, which caused the 2008 crisis, is also being propped up by the data center business. AI is inescapable. It's the defining fact of this economic moment. But in surveys, people who don't work in AI largely doubt it's good for the world. With that in mind, Ian Frish at the New York Times' DealBook newsletter wrote something a little unsettling yesterday. It seems that a company called QTS Data Centers, “the biggest player in the artificial intelligence infrastructure market,” is entirely owned by the investment company Blackstone. And Blackstone, it seems, is seeking to refinance $3.46 billion in QTS's debt. DealBook apparently got a peek at an offer sheet showing that Blackstone is about to put this debt up for sale. It's the largest of the “commercial-mortgage-backed securities” deals in AI in 2025. The largest so far anyway. Things are not the same now, like I said. We have different problems. If OpenAI fizzles and never figures out how to make revenue, and the investors all lose their hats, I'm sure other AI investors like, say, Elon Musk and the Saudis will pick up the slack and find a way to drive revenue from AI and keep that crazy amount of AI debt valuable. I'm sure the contagion won't spread too far, and there will be some other perfectly healthy area of the economy, with a wholesome, substantive, real driver of value at its center. Because, hey, there has to be.

AI is good for a lot of things—namely cheating on stuff and pretending like you're more productive than you actually are. Recently, this affliction has spread to a number of professions where you would have thought the work ethic is slightly better than it apparently is.

Case in point: lawyers. Lawyers apparently love chatbots like ChatGPT because they can help them power through the drudgery of writing legal briefs. Unfortunately, as most of us know, chatbots are also prone to making stuff up and, more and more, this is leading to legal blunders with serious implications for everybody involved.

The New York Times has a new story out on this unfortunate trend, noting that, more and more, punishments are being doled out to lawyers who are caught sloppily using AI (these punishments can involve a fine or some other minor inconvenience). Apparently, due to the stance of the American Bar Association, it's okay for lawyers to use AI in the course of their legal work. They're just supposed to make sure that the text that the chatbot spits out is, you know, correct, and not full of fabricated legal cases—which is something that seems to keep happening. Indeed, the Times notes:

…according to court filings and interviews with lawyers and scholars, the legal profession in recent months has increasingly become a hotbed for A.I. blunders. Some of those stem from people's use of chatbots in lieu of hiring a lawyer. Chatbots, for all their pitfalls, can help those representing themselves “speak in a language that judges will understand,” said Jesse Schaefer, a North Carolina-based lawyer…But an increasing number of cases originate among legal professionals, and courts are starting to map out punishments of small fines and other discipline.

Now, some lawyers are apparently calling out other lawyers for their blunders, and are trying to creating a tracking system that can compile information on cases involving AI misuse. The Times notes the work of Damien Charlotin, a French attorney who started an online database to track legal blunders involving AI. Scrolling through Charlotin's website, it's definitely sorta terrifying since there are currently 11 pages worth of cases involving this numbskullery (the researchers say they've identified 509 cases so far).

The newspaper notes that there is a “growing network of lawyers who track down A.I. abuses committed by their peers” and post them online, in an apparent effort to shame the behavior and alert people to the fact that it's happening. However, it's not clear that it's having the impact it needs to, so far. “These cases are damaging the reputation of the bar,” Stephen Gillers, an ethics professor at New York University School of Law, told the newspaper. “Lawyers everywhere should be ashamed of what members of their profession are doing.”

Smart displays solve the annoying problem of constantly pulling out your phone to check the weather, see who's at the door, or follow a recipe while your hands are covered in flour. The Echo Show 8 brings all those conveniences to your kitchen counter or bedside table with an 8-inch HD touchscreen that responds to voice commands and touch.

Amazon just dropped the price from $149 to $99, which makes this the cheapest entry point into having a central hub that manages your smart home, handles video calls, and streams your favorite shows. The built-in smart home hub means you can control compatible lights, locks, and cameras without buying separate equipment. This latest version adds spatial audio that fills the room with sound, and turns your smart display into something you'll want to use for music.

See at Amazon

This 8-inch HD display provides a resolution of 1280 x 800 which should be clear enough for watching cooking videos, checking security cameras, or having video calls with family members. The display hits a sweet spot in size: big enough that I can see details from across the room, and compact enough to fit on a nightstand or kitchen counter without taking up too much space. Spatial audio technology creates a more expansive soundstage that makes music and videos feel more immersive than typical smart display speakers. The audio processing processes the content and adjusts the sound output to make it feel as though the audio is emanating from other directions, adding depth to movies and music that carries across instead of feeling confined to a single point source.

The 13 MP camera represents a significant upgrade compared to previous models and competing smart displays. Higher megapixel counts translate to sharper video quality during calls with friends and family, so they can actually see your facial expressions clearly instead of looking at a pixelated mess. The camera tracks movement with auto-framing, allowing you to pace during a call without walking out of frame. Noise-reduction technology reduces the background noise from dishwashers, air conditioners, and traffic, and cleans up what the other person will hear instead of your voice competing with ambient noise.

The smart home hub, which is built-in, supports Zigbee, Matter, and Thread protocols and eliminates the need to buy separate hubs for different ecosystems in your smart home. You can pair compatible smart bulbs, door locks, thermostats, and sensors directly to the Echo Show 8, then control everything from the touchscreen or via voice commands. When the device detects movement, motion-activated routines are triggered-for instance, turning on lights when you enter the kitchen at night or adjusting the thermostat upon entering a room.

Video calling becomes effortless with the new Top Connections widget, which lets you initiate calls with a single tap rather than digging into menus. You can also make calls hands-free by simply asking Alexa to call specific contacts, which is fantastic while you are cooking, getting ready for work, or managing kids. The display shows your calendar at a glance from across the room, then shows more detailed information as you walk closer, thanks to on-screen adaptive content technology that automatically adjusts based on your distance from the screen.

At $99, you are getting a smart display for $50 less than regular price while offering features that competitive devices charge significantly more to provide.

I feel no compunction telling you the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite gaming headset wasn't made for most of the people reading this review. How premium is it? It costs $600.

It comes with a special GameHub that will hook up to three consoles or PCs at once to let you seamlessly swap between all your devices. It also costs $600. It has some of the best premium audio I've heard from a gaming headset all year. It will ask you to fork over $600 for the privilege. The Arctis Nova Elite chock-full of small amenities, which combines with all the other features to make the gaming headset so simple to operate. All, for $600. It's easily the most expensive headset I've used, which makes it that much more annoying when I admit I enjoyed it as much as I did.

SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite

There are few gaming headsets as feature rich or as expensive as the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. 

Pros

Cons

The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite isn't doing anything we haven't seen before, even when its price tag is one of the highest we've seen. The $400 Logitech G Astro A50 X used a large base for video passthrough to hook up all your devices to one place. The more recent $180 Astro A20 X does something similar to the Arctis Nova Elite, though with only two instead of three outputs for different consoles on a miniature station.  SteelSeries' ultra-premium device isn't the first to use a miniature OLED screen to display your headset settings, either. The $400 Razer Kraken V4 Pro's base station lacks the extra console and PC outputs, but its metal frame feels more premium when it's sitting on your desk than SteelSeries' plastic.

SteelSeries was adamant this is the first “Hi-Res” gaming headset, mostly due to it receiving certification from the Japan Audio Society. But there are other companies promising their gaming headsets can offer players the audiophile experience. Gizmodo Senior Writer James Pero recently reviewed the $360 VZR Model One MK II hi-fi headest. My ears are still begging me to return to the brilliant tones of the Sony Inzone H9 II, which used the same audio drivers as the class-leading Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones. So, no, this is not the first gaming headset with any variety of audiophile-level sound.

Instead, the Arctis Nova Elite is the first gaming headset I've used that has everything (and like an everything bagel, that certainly won't please everyone). It's sporting some quality active noise cancellation (ANC), though not the best in its class. Its audio capabilities are certainly top tier (though I may still prefer the Sony Inzone H9 II for pure gaming audio bliss). The headset makes connecting to every one of my devices seamless, and it supports four separate streams of simultaneous audio (though it will require downloading the Arctis app to your phone and the GG app to your computer to adjust equalization options for each device individually). The Arctis Nova Elite is built for the dedicated gamer, the one who has one spot in their home where they play. In that very specific case, this is one of the best headsets I've used.

There's no getting around it. The Arctis Nova Elite alone costs more than a PlayStation 5 console even after price hikes. I've used enough SteelSeries headsets to know its typical design ethos. In effect, the Arctis Nova Elite is an upgraded version of the Nova Pro Wireless, with metallic frames and a metallic volume wheel. This gaming headset looks especially good with its cream and gold colorway. I just don't know if anything about the it desgin reads that it's worth so much money.

The sound is where things matter, and that's what the Arctis Nova Elite has got going for it. The twin carbon fiber drivers offer a clean audio presence at its baseline. It's capable of lossless 24-bit, 96kHz wireless audio, though consoles like the Xbox Series X and PS5 are limited to 48k/16-bit. It may take a few hours of listening, but eventually I came to recognize the Arctis Nova Elite's true potential once I put it through its paces in various titles of various styles.

If you're so used to shoving your AirPods in your ears every morning commute, hearing quality audio from a dedicated hi-fi headset can honestly leave you in tears. You'll start to identify subtleties placed by careful hands in the songs you've heard a million times before. There's a reason some people become obsessed with audio quality. Once you reach the top of the mountain, it's that much more difficult to crawl back down and live among the rocks and weeds.

Once I connected the Arctis Nova Elite to my phone, I wasn't forced to disconnect from PC or consoles. It makes living your life inside the headset easier. I couldn't stand it for too long, though. While the memory foam cups are plush with a pillow-like softness surrounding my ears, the headset wants to hug my head tighter than others to get that perfect seal. There was a growing pressure between my eyes as I used it, forcing me to take intermittent breaks.

The Arctis Nova Elite could easily be my one and only gaming headset. That being said, I don't really know many people who bother with more than one. SteelSeries suggested it could be your audio buddy even when you're not near your couch or desk. The gaming headset comes with a soft felt-lined pouch that snaps shut with a satisfying magnetic clasp. If you want something more protective like a hard case, you'll have to buy it separately. The thing is, the best headphones are designed so you don't look look like an alien when wearing them. You won't look classy with your head shoved between these cans like you do with your AirPods Max. These are designed to wear for hours and hours. I couldn't stand them for that long. Maybe somebody with a thinner cranium would enjoy them for longer.

If you don't go into the app to adjust the EQ profile to fit the game, you'll end up with a much worse experience overall. SteelSeries has a ludicrous number of game-specific profiles for some of the most popular games around and even more you would not expect the company to bother with (there's a preset for Doki Doki Literature Club!, for goodness' sake). So if you load up into your Cyberpunk 2077 save, and enter without the preset bass profile, it won't have anywhere near the levels you want to make your machine gun fire truly pop. This requires you to manually change their settings from game to game if you want the best experience.

Inevitably, you'll come across a game that's too new for it to have an EQ profile. I've been playing The Outer Worlds 2, which has a soundtrack that's equal parts mystery and nostalgia. It doesn't sound bad by any margin with the “flat” preset in the Arctis app. I just know deep in my soul the game could sound better with a few knobs twisted. If you scroll through all the preset EQ options, you can find one or two that will sound better to your ears. For instance, I played Gears of War: Reloaded with the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 preset and it sounded much better than with the stock standard profile.

At least, the GameHub lets you swap and adjust the volume mixing between the first and second USB inputs. Swapping between Bluetooth and the 2.4GHz connection doesn't require much input. Still, if you want to take a call in the headphones, you'll need to hit the Bluetooth button on the right earpad.

SteelSeries' “flat” profile is fine for most listening experiences, including music or when talking on video calls. When I got on with some of my coworkers, they told me I sounded extremely clear, nearly—but not quite—podcast levels of clarity. That's impressive considering the telescoping mic wasn't even wearing a pop filter. The mic offers 16-bit 32kHz recordings, and listening to myself back I can confirm it's of good quality. There's an additional mute button the left earcup if you need to avoid any back chatter when gaming with friends or even chatting with workmates. Again, it could be my everything headset when at home I could stand wearing it for too long.

There's a lot of positive qualities to this design. I could walk 30 feet away from the GameHub with a wall in between me and my desktop, and still hear my game as clear as if I was standing next to it. Only when I put multiple walls between me and the device did the sound start to waver.

The ANC is good enough I would repeatedly miss what my colleagues were saying even if they were talking right next to me. With the ANC on, I couldn't hear the blast of the loud fans from the Acer Predator Triton 14 gaming laptop I recently reviewed. Still, I could occasionally hear ambient noise, like the distant pop of a fire truck siren or a loud bang on a conversation my boss was having on the other side of the room. The Arctis Nova Elite is more than enough for your gaming den when you want to hole up like a happy otter and ignore the rushing river waters around you. It just won't offer anything close to the sensory deprivation chamber sensation of some high-end ANC wireless headphones like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen).

If there's one thing missing from the Arctis Nova Elite, it's a battery life equal to its $600 price tag. SteelSeries promises you can get 60 hours of active listening, but that's only when you make use of two separate batteries. The GameHub comes with a small compartment that accepts one of two cells that come in the box. The magnetized cap on the right-hand earcup comes off to reveal the battery. It's not technically hot-swappable, as removing the battery will turn off the sound. Swapping in a fresh battery will immediately turn the headset on and return you back to your various connections. By comparison, a $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless can go for 250 hours before you need to plug it in.

I keep bringing up other headsets that cost less just to explain where we are with the current landscape of gaming cans. Nothing I've tried has even came close to SteelSeries' price point. There are other gaming headsets that promise hi-fi audio or let you connect all your consoles. The Arctis Nova Elite is the only pair that I know of that provides both in one package. I can't think of any other headset I would want more if I have all my gaming devices in one spot.

I also know I personally couldn't drop $600 on any headset. Even if I did opt for the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite, I would have to consider if I could accept Bluetooth more often than the 2.4GHz connection. Even though I own a PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2, and get to test a rotating cast of PCs, I spend more time gaming on a handheld than anything else. There's certainly a few folks out there who are glued to their gaming chairs and want a headset for every single device they own. I can't think of anything better than the Arctis Nova Elite.

This standalone 25 MHz GPU outputs at 320 x 240 pixels with 4-bit color, performing 3D rasterization, transformations, and lighting.

The ‘tiniest GPU' has gotten a big update. Amateur FPGA designer and retro PC enthusiast Pongsagon Vichit has just gone public with the TinyGPU v2.0. This GPU is described as a standalone processor that is capable of rasterization, plus transformation & lighting (hello GeForce 256). 0Vichit, AKA @MattDIYgraphics on X, also says that this GPU has been submitted to the upcoming Tiny Tapeout shuttle, where it will be hewn from ~200,000 transistors across the max permissible 4x4 tile project size. In contrast, the market-leading Nvidia RTX 5090 has 92.2 billion transistors, but naturally, it comes with exponential amounts of performance as a result of its heftier transistor budget.

In the video above you can see the tech enthusiast load up various 3D models from the flash built into the Tiny GPU v 2.0 design, and manipulate them in real time using a vintage Super Nintendo controller. The gamepad is being used to both transform the model and rotate the light source. While this is a significant upgrade from the same designer's Tiniest GPU, from nearly a year earlier, its specs aren't going to set the world alight.

 




In terms of performance, the v2.0 at 25 MHz only manages frame rates between 7.5 and 15 fps. Moreover, this is for rather low-polygon 3D models, at render resolutions of 320 x 240 pixels (or below) and using 4-bit color (max 16 simultaneous colors). The Tiny Tapeout silicon won't run any faster than this Basys3 FPGA-hosted demo, the designer says. So, the TinyGPU v2.0 definitely isn't going to be added to our best GPUs for gaming roundup.

While graphics of such resolution and color depth might belong firmly in the early 1980s home computer era, there are some much more advanced processes going on here. Namely, Vichit explains that the TinyGPU v2.0 performs interactive 3D vector-to-raster conversion, and it uses GPU transformation & lighting technology that first hit consumer-land with Nvidia's milestone GeForce 256 in October 1999.

Other tech niceties of the TinyGPU v2.0 include its “4-bit double buffer, 8-bit depth buffer store on QSPI RAM, max 1K triangles, backface culling, 1 dynamic directional light, [and] flat shading.”

The TinyGPU v2.0 has been submitted to Tiny Tapeout for the next production run. Its max permissible 16 tiles design will cost Vichit roughly $1,500. You can read more about it, dive into Verilog source files, and poke through other resources via the top-linked GitHub repository.

Back in April 2024 we covered the news of a different Tiny GPU, which was designed “from scratch with no prior experience,” by Adam Majmudar. It was made ready for its silicon debut via Tiny Tapeout 7 (TT7).

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

However, Vichit also took part in TT7 with what was dubbed the Tiniest GPU. It was interesting to compare this enthusiast's original and newest Tiny GPU projects, but they are quite different beasts, with the first model extremely lean, with its support for a maximum of two polygons (much less than the 1,000 of v2). Its simplicity meant the Tiniest GPU, at 50 MHz, could real-time render 640 x 480 pixel imagery with 6-bit color depth at up to 60fps. On screen render output was manipulated using keyboard cursor controls.

SAN ANTONIO — In the course of caring for individuals with psoriasis, clinicians should have patients complete the validated Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) every 6 months, as recommended by the National Psoriasis Foundation, advised Shikha Singla, MD. 

“That's because a delay of more than 6 months leads to worse outcomes and disabilities in our patients,” said Singla, associate professor of medicine (rheumatology) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, during a presentation at the Society of Dermatology Physician Associates (SDPA) Fall Dermatology Conference. “This is the most commonly used screening tool” for PsA, she noted

PEST consists of the following five questions that patients can answer in the office before seeing the clinician: 

Each “yes” response equals one point, and a total score of three or higher indicates a potential risk for PsA, warranting consideration for referral to a rheumatologist, Singla said. The PEST is also available in the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) mobile app. 

Other validated tools to consider include the 15-question Psoriatic Arthritis Screening and Evaluation questionnaire and the 13-question Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Screening (ToPAS) questionnaire, according to Singla.

Drawing from a 2025 review on PsA screening and management published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Singla discussed the mnemonic PSA, in which P stands for joint pain; S stands for stiffness after a period of inactivity lasting more than 30 minutes and/or swelling or a sausage digit; and A stands for axial or spinal involvement (back pain associated with stiffness after inactivity that improves with movement). The presence of any two of the three features (P, S, or A) suggests that the patient may have PsA. “Most patients with degenerative disk disease will say that their pain worsens with movement,” and this is “completely the opposite,” Singla noted. 

In a 2019 published review on PsA for dermatologists, authors Alice Gottlieb, MD, and Joseph F. Merola, MD, propose the following questions to ask patients during office visits: 

A “yes” response to any of the questions supports the possible presence of inflammatory arthritis.

“When I see patients with degenerative arthritis, they say none of the medications help,” Singla said. “But psoriatic arthritis patients do say that meloxicam or any other NSAID helps.” 

In the realm of differential diagnoses, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common consideration. “But you usually don't see dactylitis in RA patients; you don't see a lot of enthesitis,” she said. Other differential diagnoses include fibromyalgia, gout, and osteoarthritis, but the swelling in osteoarthritis “is more bony,” she said.

“Sometimes we see two or three diseases together,” Singla noted. “Treatment for these diseases is based on a treat-to-target approach. There are different disease outcomes.” 

Singla concluded her presentation by referencing a 2020 published article by Spanish investigators that proposed a clinical control algorithm for PsA to be used in dermatology consultations.

Singla reported no relevant financial relationships.

San Diego Wave midfielder Kenza Dali likes to swim in the ocean on Thursdays.

One day after training in July, the 34-year-old France international waded out into the Pacific, as she normally does, but this time was different. A rip current carried her away, and not even Dali's elite athlete-level strength could steady her. Before panic took hold, Dali remembered something her Wave teammate, defender Quincy McMahon, had told her once: when a rip current strikes, angle your body parallel to the shore and let go.

So she did. And eventually, her feet grazed the sand.

Dali was grieving when the Wave called late last year, feeling herself pulled away from the sport she loved and unsure if she wanted to continue playing. She was living in Birmingham, England, and playing for local Women's Super League club Aston Villa at the time, and her home was filled with nothing but memories of the person she'd lost. (Dali was not comfortable naming the person, out of her desire for privacy.)

Wave head coach Jonas Eidevall was familiar with Dali from their time as rivals in the WSL: she was first with Everton and then Villa when he was Arsenal manager from 2021 to 2024. Dale had been planning to sign with a different NWSL team, one closer to France than Southern California is, but the more she thought about it, the more the distance between home to that particular shore appealed to her.

“It was really like my last bit of, like, it's all or nothing, clearing my head and having a different environment,” Dali told The Athletic from the club's training ground in August.

Such has been the way of the Wave this season in many ways: riding the crests and the troughs, figuring out when to surrender to the rip currents.

They entered what was their fourth season in the NWSL desperate to bounce back from a 10th-place finish in the 14-team league the year prior, a position which might have been understandable for what was still a fairly new club had it not been for the impact they made their first two seasons. As an expansion side in 2022, San Diego made history by reaching the playoffs before falling to the Portland Thorns in the semifinals (They play Portland again later on Sunday in this season's quarterfinals).

Back then, the roster glistened with U.S. women's national team stars Alex Morgan (who won the Golden Boot that year with 15 goals), center back Naomi Girma (who was named both Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year) and midfielder Jaedyn Shaw, who signed with the club when she was 17 years old. All three would later depart the Wave in a span of six months around the start of 2025.

Former England national team player and Manchester United manager Casey Stoney led the team at the time. Her staunch defensive philosophy was compelling the first two seasons; in 2023, the Wave finished top of the table and secured the NWSL Shield, given to the club with the most wins in the regular season, and made the semis again.

But the trough came in 2024.

Despite beating league champions Gotham FC to win the NWSL Challenge Cup to kick off the season, the inspiration that once drove the team's style of soccer puttered out, and suddenly, they were face-to-face with a seven-game winless streak. In June, Stoney was fired, a move that was still widely considered abrupt despite the team's form at the time. A perplexing duo of interim managers replaced her: Paul Buckle, once an interim assistant coach for the Wave in 2022, and former USMNT forward Landon Donovan, for whom the Wave marked his foray into managing a women's side.

“Things were s**t,” Kailen Sheridan, the Canadian goalkeeper who is one of three players on the current roster who have been with the club since its inception, said of that season. Speaking to The Athletic one August afternoon after training, the 30-year-old 2021 Olympic gold medalist was candid about the highs and lows of the Wave's short history.

The high turnover in personnel wasn't limited to the coaching staff. Morgan announced her retirement and pregnancy with her second child on Sept. 5, and played her final game three days later. She became a minority investor in the club in May this year.

In October, the Wave came under new ownership as the Levine Leichtman family completed their purchase from Ron Burkle for a then-record valuation of $120 million. By then, the club had already found and hired a new sporting director/general manager in Cami Ashton, who had last been with fellow NWSL team Kansas City Current in a similar role. Having previously played in the league, Ashton was charged with reconstructing the club's culture amid the turbulence and laying the groundwork for sustainability.

There was much to be done on the culture front.

Also last October, five former Wave employees filed a lawsuit against the club over multiple allegations of discrimination, retaliation, wrongful termination and sexual harassment. The claims in their case followed allegations first raised by one of the named complainants, Brittany Alvarado, against Jill Ellis, the Wave club president who would then step down in December. Alvarado accused Ellis of creating a hostile work environment, and Ellis later filed a defamation lawsuit against her.

“Nothing is ever constantly up,” Sheridan said. “There was a lot of internal reflection and player reflection and challenging the ownership, challenging the club itself to (ask), ‘What do you want to be? Do you want to just be here, be present, or do you want to be a competitive winning team?'”

Ashton was central to those reflections, drawing from her own experience as a professional player to inform her approach to the club's rebuild.

The club hired former Germany international striker Anja Mittag as an individual development coach to ensure the growth of the younger players and acclimate others who are new to the NWSL.

On Mondays now, the Wave train with a boys' team. Ashton also facilitated a renovation of the training facility, which they lease from the San Diego Surf, a youth club. They hired a full-time chef, improving the catered food they once relied on, and added dedicated rooms for meetings and hanging out. Hot tubs are coming soon.

Before pivoting to NWSL front offices, Ashton worked in wrestling's WWE as a talent manager, where she was exposed to the scale of a mature professional sporting environment. Knowing that neither the Wave nor the NWSL could just catapult themselves to that level, Ashton approached the club's new roster with a bifocal vision that aimed to deliver immediate impact while building toward the future.

Enter the trio known as the French connection: Dali, fullback Perle Morroni and winger Delphine Cascarino. They became a quartet in this summer's transfer window when the Wave signed Laurina Fazer.

All four have represented France at senior level; Dali and Fazer competed in the 2023 World Cup, Cascarino featured on the roster for the European Championship this summer. No NWSL team has had as many French players on the roster at once, and their familiarity with each other has proven lethal. Cascarino leads the league in assists with six, and she, Dali, and Morroni have collectively made 24 goal contributions to the Wave's 38-goal tally in the regular season. Fazer arrived on July 29 and has played just over 500 minutes.

The first half of the season for the Wave was, by many metrics, an outperformance of expectation.

After an early dip in the fourth week, they began a steady climb up the table, reaching as high as second place for the ninth and 10th weeks. Their 10th match, against the North Carolina Courage, brought a 5-2 win — and a new club record for most goals in a game. By then, 13 different players had scored a combined 21 times for the club this season. The cautious optimism was justified, but as Sheridan and other Wave veterans know, an NWSL season is long, and a team's run can change on a dime.

After the summer break, San Diego began to unravel. Once a possession-oriented team, they began coughing up balls. They struggled to convert chances in front of goal and deny opponents' scoring opportunities. Of their final 14 regular-season games, they won only three, all against teams near the bottom of the table. Eventually they finished sixth, two points clear of the ninth-placed Courage. Had it not been for their strong start and the insulation of those points won early on, they might not have reached the postseason.

It's possible Sheridan anticipated that dip in August when she described the next step in this team's development as one that synthesized the strengths of prior Wave rosters.

“We had some talented players, but we had more workhorses, and that was what created that success. Nobody was going to outwork this team,” she said. “Now we have talent on top of that, so we need to hold to the standard of that work ethic of the people who were here before and really ingrain that into a group who have more talent.

“This team has more talent, but that (prior) group was just gonna run through a brick wall. So if we can put those two together, it'll be unstoppable.”

Work ethic takes time to develop, and the Wave are one of the younger teams in the league with an average age of 26. The experience on the team is diverse: Sheridan with her eight years in the NWSL, Dali with her 16 years across the French and English leagues, as well as forward Melanie Barcenas, 18, who's been with the club since she was 14 years old.

“Despite having the nerves and having maybe a little bit of pressure, because I do have high expectations for myself, I feel like definitely the past years have set me up for success this season,” Barcenas, who is currently out with a foot injury, told The Athletic in August. “I'm finding myself off the field, talking more… I think just from being in the environment the past year has definitely helped, and having people that can make me feel confident in myself.”

It also takes time for intergenerational dynamics to gel. Dali can still recall moments from her career when she was the young renegade, figuring herself out with each game, and the importance of growing through that. She sees a lot of herself in her Wave teammate Gia Corley, a 23-year-old midfielder signed in January from German club Hoffenheim and eligible to represent either Germany or the United States.

“She's so talented, but it's risky,” Dali said of Corley. “She plays with fire, but it's her quality, and she's young. You can't take that. So I'm like, ‘Do your thing'.”

Corley will often apologize to Dali when she loses the ball, but has said part of the reason she gambles in possession is because she trusts the French veteran to clean up after her.

“I played crazy in PSG (Paris Saint-Germain) because I had (two-time Olympic silver medalist with Sweden) Caroline Seger behind me: ‘I can lose the ball anywhere on the pitch and she's gonna cover me', and this is how I expressed myself.” Now it's her job to do the same for Corley and other young players at the Wave, while also trusting them in turn.

Though their record didn't improve significantly in the final weeks of the regular season, the Wave started to look more like themselves.

It helped that 20-year-old Brazilian forward Dudinha, whom the club signed in July, arrived from São Paulo FC and was activated. She's played 10 games, seven of which she's started, and already has five goals — equal to Dali and Cascarino as the team's leading scorers this season.

The Wave's highs and lows this year make it difficult to know which version of the team will show up at Providence Park in Portland later today. But they are rebuilding momentum — a very different kind of trajectory from their origin story as an NWSL team, but one that could take them just as far in the long run.

Harry Kane and England are likely to have to deal with extreme heat in North America next summer (Carl Recine/Getty Images)

England are working to develop a “heat-proof game model” to win next summer's World Cup, hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

Anthony Barry, a member of Thomas Tuchel's coaching staff, believes the conditions in North America next June and July will make it so difficult for good football that it will instead be a “tournament of moments”. And the decisive factors in it will be the “connection” between the players and a “bring-it-on” mentality towards the challenges of what promises to be a unique competition.

England play their last two World Cup qualifiers over the next eight days, against Serbia and Albania, but have already secured their place at the finals and preparations are underway for the tournament. The coaching team have been strategising on how to win in a summer-time competition, with specific focus on what Chelsea did en route to lifting the Club World Cup in the U.S. this July.

Tuchel spent time at that tournament and said in August it was “unbelievably hot” in the States at times and “very hostile conditions to train and play”. He and his staff are determined to learn from Chelsea's successful campaign.

“If we look at the Club World Cup, and we try to use that as a reference point — not only about the heat but about tournaments out there — it showed… European teams can go out there and win. And most importantly, an English team can go out there and win,” Barry says. “But one thing's for sure, in that heat, in that environment, a team will win it.”

For all the focus on developing a physically-intense style in recent months, England's coaches know they will need a way of playing next summer that can work in intense heat and humidity. They have analysts studying the Club World Cup, so they can establish what works in such conditions. “There are many teams working on that on our behalf,” Barry says. “It will be our job to build a heat-proof game model that can be successful out there.”

But the temperatures will not be the only challenge.

At the previous World Cup in 2022, hosted by tiny Qatar, all of England's games were in Doha or just outside that city. Their longest journey was roughly one hour by coach. But England could be flying around an entire continent in their pursuit of glory next summer and will have to play eight games, rather than the seven it took Argentina three years ago, to win it.

“Even if you build the top heat-proof model out in America,” Barry said, “the environment out there does not facilitate world-class football.

“It's going to be a tournament of moments. You're not going to see the best team playing the best football. It simply doesn't allow that. The team that wins the World Cup will be one of moments. And it will be won by a team, because you're going to have to suffer, you're going to have to overcome obstacles. You're going to have to do it together.”

Clarifying the mentality it's felt will be required to succeed next summer, Barry says: “‘It's hot? Bring it on'. ‘We've got late flights? Bring it on'. ‘We play eight games, not seven? Bring it on'. ‘There's a storm, we can't train? Bring it on'. ‘We've got a flight with a time difference? Bring it on'. Bring it on. Bring it on. The team that wins the World Cup will be a team that's ready to suffer and overcome obstacles together.”

Barry joined Tuchel's staff last year, having previously worked with the German at Chelsea and Bayern Munich. He has also held three jobs at international level, with the Republic of Ireland, Belgium and Portugal. He worked under Roberto Martinez with Belgium at that 2022 World Cup and again with Portugal at Euro 2024. He knows what it takes to win in tournament football.

“The number one characteristic of successful international teams is connection: to each other, to the game model, to the mission, all of those things,” Barry says. “Connection is the driver of all successful teams, more so in international football than club football.

“In international football, you will never create a team on the field that can play the way the Barcelona of old or the recent Manchester City did, it's simply impossible. But if you can create something, a brotherhood, a connection, an energy between each other, then that is the petrol in the car in international football.”

That is what Tuchel, Barry and the other England coaches have been working on in recent months.

If this year's March and June get-togethers were learning exercises — including for the staff after Tuchel began work in January — the next two and the one starting today (Sunday) are all about creating an atmosphere the players and the English public can all buy into. “The theme across these three camps in September, October and November has been very clear: show the identity of Team England to the world — the players, staff, media, fans,” Barry says. “By the end of this block of games, they should understand this is the identity of the team.”

Barry and Tuchel both want to “dominate every aspect of the game” and “conquer every metre of the pitch”. But the Englishman is also very aware of how fast football is changing. “If you look at the last two years compared to the six or seven years preceding that, the Premier League has changed so much,” he says. “It's our job not only to stay ahead of the trends but to beat them and to create our own ones. It's a constant, daily process to have this problem-solution finding mentality.”

But this search for ideas and solutions will only work if it can be simply communicated to the players. So the challenge for the staff is to use their limited contact time with the squad — there is only one more camp after this one, next March, before they gather next May and June for the final build-up to the World Cup — to coach the players in the style they want to play at the tournament.

“To make the complex clear (for the players),” is how Barry sums that job up. “We have 50 days (with the players). We have to play a complex game that gives us a tactical advantage. We have to make it so clear in 50 days. To take it from idea to information to knowledge to execution. This is the skill set that Thomas and I have, to go through the process from start to finish. That's how we spend most of our days. Trying to build the methodology that allows us to be productive in the 50 days.”

The hope is England will play a brand of football next summer the squad are sufficiently comfortable with that individuals are able to play their natural game. “The England jersey should be harder than ever to get, but light to wear,” Barry says. “To make it light to wear, we have to give them a style that allows them to move and run and be stuck less in thinking, more in doing. The shirt should feel like a cape, not body armour.”

When England got together in September, the staff were clear on the elements of the game they wanted to focus on to be successful.

Barry points to the central section of the pitch, on either side of the halfway line, to make his point.

“In the middle area — those 24 metres (26 yards) — we really feel the game has become stuck, particularly in the Premier League,” he says. “Everybody is so good now. They have so much information. They know how to set up, in mid-blocks, deep blocks. The game can really get stuck there. We are really trying to focus on trying to accelerate the game across that 24 metres.”

This is the work Barry and the coaches will do with the players this coming week, again in March, and then across the Atlantic next summer.

Everything they have done has been geared towards that goal, towards, as Barry puts it, “putting a second star” on the England shirt to go with the one marking the team's triumph at the 1966 World Cup. That has been the target after Tuchel and Barry both spoke to Football Association technical director John McDermott last year, after leaving Bayern, about potentially taking the England challenge on.

“Pretty quickly, we had the feeling it was something we could do, not only with this level of player but character of player,” Barry says. “We thought there were some real lads in the squad that you could build something solid with, a foundation, a character that we really fell in love with and respected.

“With the character we thought was in the squad, with the mission so clear to try to win the World Cup, and the affection Thomas and I both have for this country, the football, the fans, it all seemed to fit.”

In a finale that perfectly encapsulated his bittersweet tenure with Club León, James Rodríguez signed off from Liga MX with a touch of brilliance. In his last match for La Fiera against Puebla, the Colombian superstar delivered a “masterclass” assist, reminding fans of the world-class talent that is now officially on the market.

At the 20-minute mark, Rodríguez seized a rebound and threaded a masterful through pass into the gap for his teammate Iván Moreno, who converted the chance for an equalizing goal. It was a final flash of the vision and precision that León had hoped would lead them to glory.

In his 35 games for Leon, James had the most impact on the team, averaging a 41.15 Impact Rating—topping his teammates Cadiz (29.79) and Steven (29.26) who left the club in October. Even on a per-minute basis, the Colombian was the most impactful player, averaging 0.55 IR per minute.

Despite the on-field magic, the departure of the 34-year-old playmaker is not a surprise. It has been confirmed that Club León's management decided not to renew Rodríguez's contract, which is set to expire in December 2025.

The primary driver behind the decision appears to be financial. Reports indicate Rodríguez's hefty $5 million annual salary was a major factor in the club's decision, especially after a disappointing season. León finished 17th in the Apertura 2025, failing to make the playoffs.

Rodríguez's one-year spell with the club was fraught with unmet expectations. He was originally drawn to the team by the opportunity to play in the FIFA Club World Cup, but León was ultimately disqualified, removing a key incentive for the star. As the team's performance faltered, Rodríguez's own prominence faded, contributing only three goals in 12 matches this season. The separation is reportedly mutual, with both the player and the club agreeing it is the best solution.

What's Next for James Rodríguez?

As a free agent in December, Rodríguez is now in a pivotal race against time. His primary focus is finding a new club that will keep him fit and in top form as he prepares to captain Colombia in the 2026 World Cup, just over six months away.

So where will he land?

As he leaves León with one final, memorable assist, James Rodríguez's future is uncertain but full of high-stakes options. His next choice will not just be for a new contract, but for a chance to build momentum and lead his nation on football's biggest stage one last time.

...

Assistant head coach Anthony Barry says building a “brotherhood” could help England to World Cup glory.

Barry is the trusted deputy of boss Thomas Tuchel, charged with helping the German end 60 years of hurt in North America next summer.

And the 39-year-old, who has also worked with Belgium and Portugal, believes the key to success is building an unbreakable spirit rather than trying to recreate successful club teams.

 

“The mission was clear, try to win the second star. Try to win the World Cup for England,” he said to a small group of reporters at St George's Park.

“But beneath that, what are we trying to build. We're trying to build Team England.

“International football is about connection. Connection to each other, the mission and the game model. Because for me, overall, if you create a brotherhood that can connect to the nation, then you have a chance.

“Who you are and what you represent is far more important than what you do.

“In international football, you will never create a team on the field that can play the way the Barcelona of old or the recent Man City, it's simply impossible.

“But if you can create something, a brotherhood, a connection, an energy between each other, then that is the petrol in the car in international football.

“We have to build something here that they want to be a part of, this brotherhood, this Team England that they all want to be a part of to come here and play.”

That desire to build the spirit has been highlighted by Tuchel's eye-catching selections, where he has repeatedly left high-profile players out of the group.

Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden were notable absentees for the first two international camps of the season, but were named in the German's most recent squad for the final World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania next week.

Tuchel is spoiled for choice in attacking areas, with the likes of Foden, Bellingham, Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers and Eberechi Eze all battling for potentially one spot.

Past England managers have fixated on shoehorning all of their best players into a disjointed XI, but Barry does not believe that will bring success next summer.

“What is the best XI?” he said. “Does that mean it's the most skilful players or the biggest profile?

“I'm not sure what it is. If you build a band, then you put 11 lead singers on the stage and throw them one mic will they produce top music? I'm pretty sure it won't happen.

“You need drummers, you need guitars, you need backing singers. What we try to build here is a team is because a team wins titles.

“It's not always about just putting what everyone perceives to be the best 11 players on the pitch together.

“Like I said with squad construction, it's about chemistry balance, who makes who look better, who brings out the best version of other people. I think in a team, everybody has a part to play.

“The England jersey should be harder than ever to get but light to wear. To make it light to wear, we have to give them a style that allows them to move and run and stuck less in thinking and more in doing.

“The shirt should feel like a cape and not body armour.”","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

EPL

Pep Guardiola will coach his 1,000th career match when City hosts Liverpool. Michael Steele / Getty Images

This weekend delivers a highly anticipated matchup between Manchester City and Liverpool, two Premier League teams looking to gain ground on first-place Arsenal. In recent history, a rivalry has started brewing between the two squads, who have accounted for nine of the last EPL 12 titles — including each of the last eight.

Sunday will also be a milestone for Man City's Pep Guardiola. The legendary manager will coach his 1,000th match after previous stints — and 715 wins — with Barcelona B, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Guardiola has been at City since 2016, a decade-long stretch that has brought six EPL championships.

Despite their standing near the top of the league table, these clubs enter the weekend under differing circumstances. Man City (6-1-3, 19 points) has won four of its last five in Premier League play, while Liverpool (6-0-4, 18 points) has lost four of its previous five.

Before last weekend's victory, it had been well over a month since Liverpool had won a league match. A four-game skid finally ended after a 2-0 result against Aston Villa. Mohamed Salah scored his 250th goal in a Liverpool uniform, good for third in club history.

The Reds are also coming off a 1-0 Champions League triumph against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Despite a season-low 40 percent possession, Liverpool recorded 13 shots and forced Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to make eight saves. Perhaps the club found a strategy it can build off of moving forward.

The defending Premier League champions now travel to Etihad Stadium for a tough test against City and the sensational Erling Haaland.

“Playing City away is one of the most difficult challenges you have throughout a season,” Liverpool manager Arne Slot said.

Man City's last EPL match ended in a 3-1 win over AFC Bournemouth on Nov. 2, thanks to two goals from Haaland. He added another goal in City's 4-1 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Although Haaland already has more career goals than Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi by their age-25 seasons, the striker dismissed any comparisons to those all-time greats. “Not at all, far off,” Haaland said. “No one can get close to them.”

Haaland is the Premier League's leading scorer (13) by a healthy margin, more than double that of second place (six) heading into the weekend.

As Manchester City face Liverpool FC tonight, Pep Guardiola commands his 1,000th match as manager, a monumental milestone. From his early days at FC Barcelona to his spell at Bayern Munich, to his historic achievements at Manchester City, Guardiola has not only collected trophies but reshaped the fabrics of the modern football we all know and love. Tonight, we'll explore the cultural impact he's left, and the defining moments of his legacy that established him as a managerial giant.

Pep's first managerial stint, beginning in June of 2007, where he learnt the experience and Spanish style of football from a managerial perspective, winning the fourth tier of Spanish football, earning a promotion to Segunda Division B. President of Barcelona Joan Laporta announced almost a year later that Guardiola would be appointed the manager of the senior Barcelona squad going into the 2008-2009 season.

Guardiola's appointment marked a turning point, as he made bold decisions to exclude Ronaldinho and Deco from his plans due to their injury history. He strengthened the squad with key acquisitions, such as Dani Alves and Gerard Piqué, and promoted Sergio Busquets from the youth team. Notable later signings included Javier Mascherano, David Villa, Cesc Fabregas, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who contributed to the team's success to varying extents.

Under Guardiola, Barcelona experienced unprecedented dominance, winning a continental treble in 2008-09 and achieving the historic sextuple in 2009. His leadership brought three La Liga titles, two Spanish Cups, three Super Cups, two Champions League titles, two UEFA Super Cups, and two Club World Cup titles over four seasons, setting new records for the club and for managers globally.

Some impressive achievements for Guardiola include becoming the youngest Champions League manager at 37, being the first manager to win El Clásico four times in a row, and winning La Liga with 99 points, which was the most at the time. His reception of the World's Best Club Coach title in both 2008 and 2010, along with an impressive set of statistics and his 14 total titles in 4 seasons, made him the most successful manager in Barcelona history.

In January 2013, Bayern Munich announced that Guardiola would take over as manager after the 2012-13 season, replacing Jupp Heynckes. Some key acquisitions under his management included Thiago Alcantara, his most notable signing, who brought him from his former club, Barcelona. Even though he was on the squad, Guardiola transformed Robert Lewandowski into arguably the greatest player for the club ever. Other integral signings included Arturo Vidal, Xabi Alonso, Joshua Kimmich, and Mario Gotze.

His stint at Barcelona significantly overshadowed his silverware success at the Bavarians, but he still won many titles, including 3 consecutive Bundesliga titles, 2 DFB Pokal titles, the FIFA Club World Cup, and the UEFA Super Cup. He was unfortunately knocked out in the semifinals of the Champions League in all 3 seasons, before being replaced by Carlo Ancelotti for the 2016-17 season.

His achievement list includes a 7-0 win against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, tying their largest win in the competition, his record of 82 wins, 11 draws, and 9 losses, beginning the 15-16 season with 10 straight wins, and winning the Bundesliga with 7 matches to spare. Unfortunately, his tenure also includes his first stretch ever of losing 4 games in a row and him breaking Bayern's 53-match undefeated streak against Augsburg, and having titles such as the German Super Cup and Champions League not won by Guardiola in his tenure at the German Giants.

After being signed to a 3 year contract in February 2016, Guardiola signed key players such as Ilkay Gundogan and Leroy Sane, who became mainstays in the team for years to come and controversially Claudio Bravo, replacing City legend Joe Hart, who never played for The Sky Blues again. His 16-17 season was his first without a trophy in his managerial career, but his first season in England was sure to be an adjustment. His season included his 100th match as a manager in a European Competition, with 61 wins and 23 draws marking him with the best record in his first century of games. 

Ahead of his 17-18 season, many changes to the squad were made, as the defense required improvement due to aging wingbacks such as Zabaleta and Gael Clichy, combined with inconsistent center-backs and goalkeeping. Signings included wingbacks Benjamin Mendy and Kyle Walker, along with Ederson, to hopefully overshadow Claudio Bravo's struggles. Along with signing Bernardo Silva and John Stones, this would bolster an already promising team. City won the EFL Cup, marking Guardiola's first title with the club, along with winning the Premier League as centurions, the first team to claim three digits in England's top division, encouraging him to sign a new contract with City until 2021.

Ahead of the 2018-19 season, Guardiola's only key signing was Riyad Mahrez from Leicester City, and defeating Chelsea in the FA Community Shield. In 2019, Manchester City won the EFL Cup (Carabao Cup), FA Cup, and the Premier League with 98 points, just edging out Liverpool with 97 points to become the first English team to win a domestic treble, while Tottenham knocked out City on away goals in the Champions League semifinal. 

Rodri and Joao Cancelo were signed ahead of the 19-20 season, increasing City's team value to exceed €1 billion, the first team to ever reach this mark. He defeated Aston Villa in the EFL Cup final, marking his third straight title in the competition, but had a largely disappointing season (by his standards) after being knocked out by Lyon in the Champions League, coming second in the Premier League to Liverpool, and Pep became the first Premier League manager to receive a yellow card. 

The next 4 years of Pep Guardiola's career were historic, with teams marked by legacy signings from the past and young players coming through. Some notable signings in this period included the British record-breaking transfer of Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for £100 million, along with players including Nathan Ake, Ruben Dias, Julian Alvarez, Jeremy Doku, Josko Gvardiol, Mateo Kovacic, and Erling Haaland. His success over the last 4 seasons earned him a contract with the club until 2023.

His defense greatly improved in the 2020-21 season, beginning their campaign by conceding 1 goal in 12 matches. His 500th match as a manager was a win against Sheffield United, the halfway mark in his monumental career. After defeating Swansea in the 2021 FA Cup, he broke the record for the longest win streak in the Premier League with 15 wins in all competitions. After beating Tottenham in the EFL Cup, Guardiola won his 4th straight title. Importantly, City reached their first Champions League final, losing to Chelsea 1-0. This season marked the first of the 4 peat, winning the Premier League with 3 games to go.

Between 2021-23, Guardiola overtook Les McDowall as the manager with the most wins for Manchester City, won the FA Cup over rivals Manchester United, and led them to beat Inter Milan in the Champions League final, completing their first continental treble in 2023. He also signed a new contract in this period, managing City until June 2025.

In 2024, he became the first manager to win the UEFA Super Cup with 3 different clubs, and won the Club World Cup, becoming the first manager to win the competition 4 times, and became the first club to win 5 titles in a calendar year. Keep in mind, in all of these 4 seasons, he won the Premier League, becoming the first English club to do so. They didn't win a domestic double this season, as local rivals Manchester United defeated the juggernauts 2-1, denying their chance at a domestic double.

Last season, City started off super strong, being undefeated in their first 9 matches, before taking a turn away against Tottenham, where they won 1 of their next 13 games across all competitions, including a stretch in the Premier League losing 4 straight games. Guardiola then signed a contract to keep him at the Etihad until 2027, despite his recent stretch of matches. They were eliminated by Real Madrid in the playoffs of the Champions League, not making the Round of 16 for the first time since 2013. This, combined with a loss to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup, marked the beginning of a decline for Guardiola.

Guardiola signed many players this season to strengthen their squad, with Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma being among the top signings. Manchester City are placed at 3rd ahead of their match against Liverpool tonight, winning 4 of their last 5 games. Haaland is their top goalscorer with 13, with many players scoring one each with Maxime Esteve from Burnley scoring 2 own goals being the club's second top goal scorer this season. Now we will take a moment to dive into the stats, trophies and players within history that marked Pep Guardiola as a managerial giant.

Here, we will take a look at some of the most integral players that Guardiola managed, and how they affected the trajectories of their teams.

Lionel Messi evolved from a dazzling winger into one of football's most complete and devastating central forwards. Guardiola's decision to deploy Messi as a false nine in 2009 unlocked his full potential, providing him with the freedom to roam, dictate play, and exploit defensive gaps. Messi became the heartbeat of Guardiola's Barcelona, leading them to the 2009 treble and dominating world football with an unprecedented mix of creativity, precision, and goal-scoring. Pep's structure gave Messi the tactical platform to express himself fully – turning individual brilliance into collective perfection. Their partnership didn't just define an era; it reshaped the modern understanding of positional play and attacking intelligence.

When Pep Guardiola arrived at Bayern Munich, Philipp Lahm was already regarded as one of the best full-backs of his generation. Yet under Pep, he became something more – a tactical pioneer. He famously converted Lahm into an inverted full-back and central midfielder, a move that revolutionized how defenders could influence games. Lahm's intelligence, technical skill, and composure made him the ideal embodiment of Guardiola's vision for controlled possession and fluid movement. His adaptability allowed Bayern to dominate games through numerical superiority in midfield, and he became Guardiola's on-field extension – reading the game, adjusting tempo, and maintaining structure. Lahm's transformation under Pep left a tactical legacy, affecting play, and is still studied and imitated today.

At Manchester City, Guardiola elevated Kevin De Bruyne from an elite playmaker to arguably the best midfielder in world football by refining his positioning and emphasizing his understanding of space. He turned De Bruyne into the perfect conduit between structure and chaos, with the freedom to drift between half-spaces, orchestrate counter-movements, and deliver passes with surgical precision. In Guardiola's system, De Bruyne became both the architect and the executioner, leading City's creative output and dictating rhythm in their record-breaking seasons. His ability to blend Guardiola's tactical discipline with spontaneous brilliance has been central to City's sustained dominance, making him the most emblematic player of Pep's Premier League reign.

Pep Guardiola's managerial philosophy is the combination of a rich footballing education shaped by mentors and teammates who defined their eras. Playing under Johan Cruyff at Barcelona, he absorbed the essence of Total Football, a style defined by positional play, spatial control, and the belief that beauty and effectiveness could coexist. Cruyff's “Dream Team” laid the tactical and ideological foundation for everything Guardiola would later build.

From Louis van Gaal, he learned structure, preparation, and the importance of discipline within creative systems. His experiences facing managers like José Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson honed his adaptability and competitive edge, forcing constant evolution. Teammates such as Xavi and Andrés Iniesta shaped his understanding of rhythm and control. Guardiola's style has remained a synthesis of these influences – blending Cruyffian ideals with his own relentless innovation into a system that has transformed modern football.

Sunday's reports claim that FIFA are considering a change in rules to the seeding process for the 2026 World Cup, which could come to help Italy if they end up qualifying via the play-offs. 

The Azzurri have two more matches of the World Cup qualifying group stage to go. 

As things stand, Gennaro Gattuso's side sit second in Group I, three points behind Norway with two matches to go. As Norway have a +16 advantage over Italy on goal difference, the Azzurri are effectively left needing Norway to drop points against Estonia next week if they are to finish top of the group and qualify directly for the World Cup. 

If Italy finish second in the group, they will have to go through another play-off campaign, which has tripped the national team up on the last two World Cup cycles. 

Currently, teams who qualify for the World Cup through the play-off system are automatically placed into pot 4 when it comes to the draw for the group stage at the final tournament. 

That means that if Italy were to qualify via the play-offs, they would be among the lowest-ranked teams in the tournament, and would be drawn into a group with teams from pots 1, 2 and 3. 

Pots 1, 2 and 3, however, are decided by the current world ranking. 

According to reports from Football Meets Data and Calcio e Finanza, FIFA are currently considering a change in rule so that all four pots are determined by world rankings. 

If that were the case, Italy would almost certainly be in pot 1, rather than pot 4, which means that they would avoid having to face any of the other top seeds at the World Cup group stage assuming that they qualify.

it's Spain or France to loose. Argentina, Brazil,Italy,Portugal, England, Netherlands,Belgium still steps behind . Germany, Croatia & Uruguay are good on paper but watch out for Mexico. This team can play

It was Sullivan's second goal in as many games for the U.S. Simon Holmes / USSF / Getty Images

Manchester City prospect Cavan Sullivan finished a cheeky Panenka penalty to lift the U.S. under-17 national team to a 2-1 win over Tajikistan in Group I play at the FIFA U-17 World Cup.

Sullivan signed with his hometown Philadelphia Union last year in a deal that stipulates that he moves to Manchester City when he turns 18. The 16-year-old chipped his 61st-minute penalty down the middle of the goal to give the U.S. a lead that held on for the final result.

It was Sullivan's second goal in as many games for the U.S., and with six points through two games, the U.S. has secured a spot in the knockout round. Sullivan also assisted on the Americans' opening goal, a 30th-minute finish tucked away by Charlotte FC homegrown Nimfasha Berchimas. The Union homegrown midfielder came off the bench in the U.S.'s 1-0 win over Burkina Faso and put away a rebound from close range to give the U.S. a victory in its group opener.

Sullivan became the youngest player ever in MLS history last season at 14 years and 293 days old, surpassing Freddy Adu's record when he came off the bench on July 17, 2024. He became the second-youngest player to start an MLS game this summer at 15 years and 280 days, behind only Adu.

He totaled 214 minutes this season across 11 appearances for the Philadelphia Union, which won the Supporters' Shield as the top finisher in the MLS regular season. He also played eight minutes in a playoff game against the Chicago Fire earlier this month. He has no goals or assists in MLS play, but has scored 10 goals with nine assists in 2,107 minutes for the Union II reserve team in MLS Next Pro.

Sullivan cannot join Manchester City until he turns 18 years old in September 2027.

The U.S. will close the group stage against the Czech Republic on Nov. 11 at 9:45 a.m. ET. The Czech Republic has three points after beating Tajikistan but falling to Burkina Faso.

As part of the lifestyle collection for the 2026 World Cup in North America, Adidas will release a special Argentina ""American Football"" jersey. We can exclusively reveal the first official image of this unique crossover item.

The new Adidas Argentina 2026 World Cup ""American Football"" jersey brilliantly blends the silhouette of an American football jersey with a design that will evoke pure nostalgia for Albiceleste fans: the 2006 World Cup home kit.

The most direct callback is the centered Adidas logo and AFA crest, which are placed just below the V-neck collar.

The jersey features Argentina's traditional sky blue and white vertical stripes. As a true American football shirt, it has an oversized cut and large, roomy shoulder panels. These panels are white and feature subtle tonal pinstripes.

A large number '19' is placed on the front, a staple of American football. The font itself is a retro multi-line style, also inspired by Adidas's designs from the 2006 home kit. The classic three stripes in black on the sleeve cuffs complete the retro look.

The Adidas Argentina 2026 World Cup American Football jersey is a lifestyle-only item and is expected to be released soon, alongside the main 2026 World Cup collections.

What do you think of this American football crossover? A great way to celebrate the 2006 kit design? Let us know in the comments below.","{'href': 'https://www.footyheadlines.com', 'title': 'Footy Headlines'}","soccer"

UCLA's season has been a disaster.

The Bruins' big-time NIL signing, quarterback Nico Iamaleava, has struggled, throwing two picks in a 56-6 loss to Indiana to slump to 3-5  since his controversial transfer.

Capable of holding almost 90,000 fans, the Rose Bowl is the 20th largest stadium in the world, but UCLA is averaging just 35,253 spectators this season.

The iconic arena opened in 1923, hosted the 1994 World Cup Final and has been home to the Bruins since 1982.

But it is 26 miles from the college's campus -- a long journey to see a struggling team.

There is an alternative nearby in SoFi Stadium -- the world's most expensive sports arena thanks to a huge $5.5 billion price tag.

SoFi -- home of the Rams and Chargers -- is around half the distance away from campus.

UCLA bosses have reportedly looked into a move despite having a lease at the Rose Bowl which extends to 2044.

The City of Pasadena and the Rose Bowl Operating Co. have filed a lawsuit to try and force the university to honor its contract.

Per the Los Angeles Times, it is alleged in the complaint that UCLA is “unequivocally expressing its intent to abandon the Rose Bowl Stadium and relocate its home football games to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.""

It adds that the situation is “a profound betrayal of trust.”

Taxpayers have invested over $150 million into the Rose Bowl.

“This lawsuit arises in an era when money too often eclipses meaning and the pursuit of profit threatens to erase the very traditions that breathe life into institutions,” adds the filing. “Some commitments are too fundamental to be traded away.”

UCLA denies that it has breached its contract.

In a letter to Pasadena's attorney reported by The Stadium Business, UCLA outside counsel David Schrader wrote that “preliminary discussions” over a relocation did not constitute a contractual breach.

The Rose Bowl has a storied history, hosting college sports for 103 years.

In August 2019, Sports Illustrated named it the Greatest Stadium in College Football History.

""The history and beauty surrounding the Rose Bowl is the reason why this stadium tops the list,"" declared the author Bobby Sullivan.

The Rose Bowl Game is known as 'The Granddaddy of Them All' as the oldest of college's postseason bowls.

It has been the venue for five Super Bowls despite never serving as a full-time home for an NFL team.

Pasadena has also enshrined itself in soccer folklore.

The Rose Bowl has hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, where over 94,000 fans watched Brazil beat Italy 3-2 on penalties.

It also held the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final -- a USA victory over China, also on penalties -- and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match as France overcame Brazil 2-0.

No other venue has completed the hat-trick of prestigious events.

Ranking the top 10......

Quarterbacks of all-time - Can anyone better Tom Brady?

Wide receivers of all-time - Does Randy Moss or Jerry Rice come out on top?

Running backs of all-time - Stacking Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith and more

Tight ends of all-time - How does Travis Kelce compare?

SoFi Stadium has been chosen as a venue for the 2026 edition, however, as the famous old ground fights to stay relevant.

USA boss Mauricio Pochettino sat down with talkSPORT ahead of December's draw in Washington.

He revealed his expectations for the tournament and generously promised to let President Donald Trump lift the trophy if he pulls off a stunning victory.

The Rose Bowl has celebrated many firsts. It is sad to think that the Bruins may one day run onto the hallowed turf for the last time.

Published: November 09, 2025 at 10:07AM EST

PARIS (AP) — Winger Florian Thauvin replaced injured forward Randal Kolo Muani in the France squad on Sunday for upcoming World Cup qualifiers.

Kolo Muani hurt his lower jaw playing for Tottenham against Manchester United on Saturday and was replaced at halftime. France coach Didier Deschamps replaced him after consulting national team doctor Franck Le Gall.

France hosts Ukraine in Paris next Thursday on the 10th anniversary of the November 2015 terror attacks and then is away to Azerbaijan three days later. Les Bleus will qualify for next year's World Cup by beating Ukraine.

Kolo Muani has scored nine goals in 31 games for France while Thauvin, who has been in good form for Lens this season, has two goals in 12 matches.

Real Madrid endured a miserable afternoon against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday as they offered little attacking threat on their way to settling for a frustrating 0-0 draw. The high-powered attacking corps of Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham were kept quiet in a frustrating contest for manager Xabi Alonso as Los Blancos failed to bounce back from their midweek defeat to Liverpool.

Madrid offered little in the way of attacking threat in the first half., but there were a few chances. Arda Guler, who looked much improved after a dull performance at Anfield, stung the goalkeeper's palms early while Raul Asencio failed to convert from a diving header. Rayo, meanwhile, weren't afraid to hit on the break, and drew a duo of signature stops out of Thibaut Courtois as the half wore on. 

Mbappe had a good effort on the hour mark, but skewed wide, while Bellingham went close after, but saw his poke denied by a late sliding challenge. The home side, in fact, looked more likely to score after the break as they peppered the Madrid goal and created opportunities on the break. At the other end, Mbappe lost his positional disclipline and Bellingham tried to do too much through the middle.

There will, admittedly, be games like this for Madrid - especially away from home - but with the title race poised to be as tight as ever, it could be costly. 

GOAL rates Real Madrid's players from Vallecas...

Thibaut Courtois (7/10):

Made a few important saves, as per usual. Didn't put a foot wrong. 

Federico Valverde (7/10):

Motored up and down the right. His side was mostly quiet and he had little to do. 

Raul Asencio (6/10):

Had a good chance denied. Kept things tidy otherwise. 

Dean Huijsen (6/10):

A pretty poor first half. Got himself booked and looked a little unsteady. Hooked at the break. 

Alvaro Carreras (7/10):

Another mightily composed showing at left back. Tried to smash one into the top corner and put it comically wide. 

Eduardo Camavinga (6/10):

Snapped into tackles, circulated the ball effectively. 

Jude Bellingham (7/10):

Full of creativity in the middle, and was a couple of tidy blocks away from a goal. 

Arda Guler (6/10):

Much more lively in the first half after a tepid midweek showing. Put one narrowly wide in the second. Saw his influence wane as the game wore on. 

Brahim Diaz (6/10):

Lively on the wing, but could have released the ball more effectively. Replaced after 70 minutes. 

Kylian Mbappe (5/10):

Rather shut down in the middle, and started to lose his positional discipline. A rare off day. 

Vinicius Jr (6/10):

Relatively quiet, and saw his wing crowded by the impatient Mbappe. 

Eder Militao (5/10):

His side of the pitch looked very vulnerable in the second half.

Dani Ceballos (5/10):

Brought on for a little more midfield control, which he didn't really offer.

Rodrygo (5/10):

Chucked on late, and didn't provide much. 

Trent Alexander-Arnold (N/A):

No time to make an impact.

Xabi Alonso (5/10):

Went for an attacking setup against an opponent that figured to dig in a bit. Questionable to bring Ceballos on when needing a goal. His side didn't deserve more than a draw.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Galatasary club president Dursun Ozbek has dropped a massive hint that the Turkish giants will make a sensational move for Argentina maestro Lionel Messi. Gala have dominated Turkish football in recent seasons, winning three consecutive titles and notably tallying a record-breaking 102 points back in 2023-24. And now Ozbek believes he can convince Messi to swap Inter Miami for the Turkish capital.

Galatasaray have a proven track record in recent seasons of signing high-profile players, which has driven forward their dominance of Turkish football. Forward Mauro Icardi joined on loan before making a permanent move, famously becoming the league's top scorer during the 2023-24 campaign. The club made a record-shattering £65 million ($85.5m) permanent signing of Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen earlier this year. Other major acquisitions included the free transfers Wilfried Zaha and Belgian playmaker Dries Mertens, alongside other key players like Lucas Torreira.

But signing Messi would be a massive undertaking, the diminutive genius has transformed Inter Miami since his arrival in 2023, leading the club to its first trophy, the Leagues Cup. He was also instrumental in their 2024 Supporters' Shield win and in setting the league's record for most regular-season points. Messi's brilliance has elevated the entire team and significantly boosted the MLS's global profile. He continues to deliver decisive performances, as seen in the recent MLS Cup playoffs.

But Messi's elite profile in the MLS is no deterrent to Gala president Ozbek, who was asked by Turkish reporters about rumours linking them with the little magician. ""Did you say Messi? Galatasaray's most successful point is the transfers it has made,"" Ozbek is quoted as saying by Fanatik. We didn't make too many transfers, but we made the transfers we needed, we kept the team. We kept the backbone of the team that became champion three years in a row, especially the whole team. I believe we built a successful team with transfers. We raised the bar very high. We made the highest transfer in the history of Turkish football. Galatasaray's economic level is suitable for these transfers.""

He added: ""We have raised the level of success to a high level, so you can easily ask the Messi question. While doing all this, we have achieved a good financial situation and we are not doing anything that will disrupt this. All the work we do, all of it has to stay within our financial capacity. That's why we have built a good team and hopefully we have goals in Europe. We will do whatever it takes to reach these goals.""

There are a few stumbling blocks for Ozbek to overcome in his pursuit of Messi. The talismanic Argentina superstar has just signed a new deal to keep him in Miami until 2028, when he'll be 41 and he has recently spoken of how much he's enjoying life on the Florida coast. 

Messi recently said: ""We were so happy living in Barcelona, the family and the kids, we had everything and we all grew up there. Imagine, I came when I was 13 years old... I built my entire life there. Here in Miami it was different because it was a family decision. Since arriving in Miami, the experience has been wonderful... Living in this amazing city first, then the affection of the people! Everything.""

There is a glimmer of hope for Galatasaray however, as Messi will not play in domestic competition between December and March during the MLS close-season. The Argentina star, who is hoping to lead his side out as they defend their crown at next year's World Cup in USA, Canada and Mexico earns an eye-watering £15 million ($19.7m), but Gala have shown they're happy to spend big to tempt big-name stars in recent seasons.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Real Madrid cult hero Ivan Zamorano has taken aim at Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal over his behaviour before and after the recent El Clasico, claiming the youngster lacks the requisite character to represent Los Blancos and pointed at the behaviour of another Barca legend as a shining example of how he should behave.

There was a confrontation between Yamal and Los Blancos players during the recent El Clasico which came after controversial pre-match comments made by the Spanish wonderkid. During a Kings League Twitch stream, the Barcelona winger accused Madrid of ""stealing and complaining"" about officiating, which angered Madrid's squad. After Madrid won the match 2-0, several players confronted Yamal, who reportedly taunted them as they exited the field. On social media, Madrid star Jude Bellingham posted an image of himself celebrating and a message that read, ""Talk is cheap. HALA MADRID SIEMPRE!!!"". In a separate Instagram post that went viral, Yamal told Madrid players, ""SEE YOU AT THE DOOR OF THE TUNNEL"". Spain international Dani Carvajal also confronted Yamal during the incident, although La Roja's coach later downplayed the event.

As one of the most prolific strikers in his era, Zamorano cemented his legendary status at Real Madrid with his sheer determination and knack for scoring. ""Ivan the Terrible"" famously led the team to the 1994–95 La Liga title, finishing as the league's top scorer with 28 goals and landed the prestigious Pichichi Trophy - an award handed out by top sports journalists in Spain.

Zamorano said: ""I wouldn't sign Lamine (for Real Madrid). He's a crack, but he does not have the essence of what a Real Madrid player is. I would sign Pedri, he is a phenomenon and he does it without talking. He is humble, he speaks just enough and that is the essence. Lamine Yamal has neither the soul nor essence of Madrid. Barcelona, good; not here. It's another story, another completely different club. Real Madrid is a team of class and culture. The players must represent that.""

He added: ""I never heard Messi say that we stole, and he was the best in the world. A 17-year-old boy who is given these lights for what he talks about… I think what we have to do is show it on the pitch and the other later on. Barcelona have to try to get Lamine Yamal on track. He will only be a great player like that. Players who leave a legacy are made of another lineage.""

Yamal's agent, Jorge Mendes waded into the argument, telling Mundo Deportivo: ""I don't understand all the noise around Lamine Yamal. We've all been 18 and young once. What we must do is support him and help him as much as possible because he's a great asset to the club. Lamine is the player everyone in the world is talking about - there's a consensus that he's the great footballer of both the present and the future. 

He added: ""Having everyone watching you also comes with great responsibility and pressure. He's handling it very well, and the best way to keep helping him is to let him focus exclusively on his work. Lamine knows perfectly well what he has to do both on and off the pitch, and that's exactly what he's doing—staying calm, working hard, and not talking too much. He's a very intelligent and disciplined boy. He's dealing with a minor physical issue together with the club, trying to manage it in the best possible way while continuing to play. The key thing is that he recovers properly and keeps contributing to the team. He's very smart and learns something new every day. Speaking little and focusing on work is essential.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Lionel Messi scored twice and added an assist, while Tadeo Allende bagged a brace as Inter Miami thumped Nashville 4-0 to reach the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Herons were dominant throughout, leaning on their star man to cruise past their opponents, with Jordi Alba also providing an assist as Miami sealed their first-ever playoff series win.

Miami only needed one moment early on. Messi provided it. The ball fell to the Argentine, 40 yards from goal, and he did the rest. Messi left three defenders in the dust before finishing back across the goalkeeper to give the Herons a 1-0 lead early. They got a second shortly before halftime. Young striker Mateo Silvetti latched onto a Jordi Alba through ball, before cutting back to Messi - who finished into an open net.

Nashville showed a bit more attacking intent to open the second half, but left themselves open on the break. One mistake cost them. They briefly fell asleep and allowed Messi and Alba to combine. The left back found a wide-open Allende for an easy finish from close range. And then the rout started. Miami's fourth was simply sublime. Messi received the ball at midfield, evaded his man, and released an inch-perfect through ball to Allende. The striker added his second of the day with a delightful chip to make it four. 



It was otherwise a formality for the Herons, who were rather stout against a tepid Nashville attack. FC Cincinnati are next, who will surely offer more of a test in a single elimination fixture in two weeks. For now, though, they seem to be hitting their stride. 

GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Chase Stadium...

Rocco Rios Novo (7/10):

Barely had a save to make, but was solid when called upon. 

Ian Fray (7/10):

A solid shift at right back. Did his defensive job well, and put in a few good crosses, too. Finding form at the right time.

Maxi Falcon (4/10):

A comedy of errors at the back. Missed tackles, gave the ball away, and did pretty much everything wrong - but got away with it.

Noah Allen (7/10):

The more solid of the two center backs, and handled Sam Surridge well. 

Jordi Alba (8/10):

Played a glorious pass in the lead up to Miami's second. Assisted the third. A typical, lovely attacking performance. 

Sergio Busquets (6/10):

A bit erratic at the base of midfield. Gave the ball away a few times, but also made some key interventions - and connected with Messi well. 

Rodrigo De Paul (7/10):

A solid two way showing. Played a crucial pass in the lead up to the third goal.  

Baltasar Rodriguez (6/10):

Not at his best, but still put in a shift. Will likely start going forward, though. 

Tadeo Allende (8/10):

Bagged a brace, and offered plenty of off-ball work. One of his best games of the year. 

Lionel Messi (9/10):

Scored an obligatory silly goal. Added a second, as well as a ridiculous assist. Dominant throughout. 

Mateo Silvetti (8/10):

Showed great composure to assist Messi's second. Deserved a goal of his own.

Telasco Segovia (7/10):

Offered a bit more attacking intent - which helped open the game up when Miami were under pressure. 

Yannick Bright (7/10):

Broke up play effectively at the base of midfield. 

Tomas Aviles (N/A):

No time to make an impact. 

Javier Mascherano (7/10):

Went for more or less the same system, save for replacing Luis Suarez with Mateo Silvetti. Not tactical genius, but his side won convincingly. A good night. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Man Utd handed positive update on Benjamin Sesko after £71m signing undergoes initial tests on knee injury","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/man-utd-positive-benjamin-sesko-initial-tests-knee-injury/blta53852d923667f49","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:14:29 GMT","

Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been handed a positive injury update on new signing Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenia international hobbled off during their thrilling 2-2 draw with Tottenham. Amorim had expressed concerns for his striker after the match, but initial investigations have offered hope Sesko won't be sidelined for an extended spell.

It was an afternoon of high drama in north London after United secured a vital point against Spurs. The visitors took the lead courtesy of Bryan Mbeumo's header in the 32nd minute, but the hosts staged a late comeback with goals from substitute Mathys Tel in the 84th minute and Richarlison in the first minute of stoppage time, which put them in front and, seemingly, on course to earn the hosts all three points. But the match ended in chaos, as United defender Matthijs de Ligt headed home an equaliser from a corner in the 96th minute, salvaging a draw for his side.

The closing stages saw Sesko pick up an injury. He entered the match in the 58th minute but was forced off late with a knee problem, casting a shadow over United's hard-fought draw. His performance featured a couple of missed chances and came before he was taken off following a robust challenge from Micky van de Ven. The forward has scored two goals in 12 appearances and has struggled for form and confidence.

The United boss was asked after the match if he thought the injury was serious, he said: ""I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know. I'm concerned with the injury because it's in the knee. We need Ben to be a better team. We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with him.""

But in the hours after the match there was an update coming from Sesko's native Slovenia, where local media reports say the initial tests show that the injury was not serious and shouldn't rule him out for a lengthy spell. There was the additional detail from Sportklub, which says the full extent of the injury will only be revealed after an MRI scan, which will take place in the coming days. 

Speaking after the match, Amorim offered a mixed review of his team's performance also revealed his plan for the players who aren't heading off on international duty. 

Amorim said: ""In the end, I think if you see the game you feel that the three points were there to take home, but then with everything that happened - Harry (Maguire) has to come out, Casemiro has to come out, (so does) Ben. We suffered two goals again in a short period of time, but managed to score again, so it's a point. When you cannot win, you don't lose and once again we managed to do that. If you look to the game and if you feel the environment, we have so much to grow as a team, because today was our day to win this game.

""I think it's more we need to look at ourselves. We were not pressing with the same intensity, because we felt comfortable. We need to understand that but to feel also that if we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game. Sometimes it's like that: you have a first half better than the second.""

He added: ""It's a little bit frustrating but also a little bit pride of the response of the players after the second goal of Tottenham. Then to look at the team. I understand that this is just the tip of the iceberg. So we are just in the beginning of becoming a very strong team.

Arsenal and Chelsea managers Renee Slegers and Sonia Bompastor called for the introduction of VAR in women's football after a nail-biting Women's Super League clash between the two London rivals on Saturday. The reigning champions took the lead through Alyssa Thompson's first half strike, while the Gunners staged a comeback in the second half as Alessia Russo scored a late equaliser.

Arsenal kept their fading title hopes alive as they came back from behind to hold reigning champions Chelsea to a 1-1 draw. The Blues dominated proceedings in the first half and took the lead through summer signing Thompson, who scored her maiden WSL goal. In the second half, the Gunners bounced back in style, putting the ball into the back of the net three times, but only one of those goals stood.

Gunners boss Slegers and Chelsea's Bompastor were furious with some of the refereeing calls as both head coaches called for the introduction of VAR in the WSL. With the result at Emirates Stadium, the Blues have now equalled the longest unbeaten streak in WSL history, having gone 33 league matches without a loss. In the current season, they have won six out of their first eight games and are at the top of the WSL table, two points clear of Manchester City.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Arsenal boss Slegers said: ""At the moment, if you ask me I think in a game like this, we need just decisions. We need justice. That's where I think VAR and technology can come in. There's more and more at stake in the WSL, at the top but also in the relegation battle and everything in between. There's more and more at stake. I think we have to look at how we grow the game in all aspects.""

Bompastor, omeanwhile, said: ""I think bringing the technology into the women's game would be probably the best call we can make. This fixture is probably one of the most beautiful games in the world. Everyone wants to be involved in this game for many reasons. Two good teams. The atmosphere at the Emirates was great. So it's really, really good publicity for the WSL. We should balance that with the refereeing.""

Arsenal's Stina Blackstenius saw her goal cancelled in the 53rd minute when she converted a brilliant long-range shot. The Gunners stars were ecstatic as they started celebrating the equaliser, only to realise later that referee Melissa Burgin had given a free-kick against Blackstenius for handling the ball earlier. 

Replays later showed that Blackstenius might not have handled the ball and rather moved her arm backwards while controlling with her midriff. Slegers was understandably furious as she added: ""I had no idea [the goal had been disallowed]. The goal is scored, no one is calling for it, I turn around, the players are celebrating, the stadium goes crazy, it's a fantastic moment, we celebrate shortly then connect with the tech staff on what do we do from here, what's the plan going forward. Then all of a sudden I turn around and see somebody saying the goal is disallowed so I was very surprised.""

After the high-intensity contest in north London, the two WSL giants will now prepare to face their European opponents in the Women's Champions League in midweek. The Blues face St Polten on Tuesday, while the Gunners take on Bayern Munich a day later. Next Sunday, in WSL, Chelsea are will take on Liverpool away from home and the Gunners will lock horns against arch-rivals Tottenham in the north London derby.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Former USMNT star Michael Bradley earned his first coaching title as New York Red Bulls II captured the 2025 MLS NEXT Pro Cup. His side erased a two-goal deficit to beat Colorado Rapids 2 on penalties after a 3-3 draw. A record crowd of 9,095 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J., watched the Eastern Conference champs claim the league's fourth title.

Despite creating early chances through forward Roald Mitchell, Red Bulls II found themselves trailing when Colorado's Golden Boot contender Billo Diop connected with Stevie Flores' low cross in the 34th minute. The visitors doubled their advantage before halftime when James Cameron converted from Alex Harris' long throw. 


The hosts mounted their comeback after the break, with Rafael Mosquera scoring in the 65th minute from Nate Worth's assist before Mitchell equalized just two minutes later. Colorado's Antony Garcia restored their lead in the 78th minute, but Mosquera converted a penalty after Worth was fouled to force the first extra time in Cup history, eventually leading to Red Bulls goalkeeper Austin Causey's heroics in the 3-1 shootout victory.


The dynamic offensive duo of Mosquera and Mitchell proved decisive in the championship campaign, with each player finishing the playoffs with six goal contributions. Mosquera, a Playmaker of the Year finalist, delivered when it mattered most with his brace in the final, while Mitchell's equalizer helped spark the remarkable comeback.


Causey's performance in goal during the penalty shootout highlighted the team's composure under pressure, with the goalkeeper saving one of Colorado's attempts to help secure the trophy.


The dramatic final represents a significant milestone for MLS NEXT Pro, which continues to establish itself as a critical development pathway for young talent across North American soccer. The record attendance demonstrates growing fan interest in the developmental league, while the high-scoring, back-and-forth nature of the match showcased the quality of play. 


As the fourth unique champion in four seasons, Red Bulls II's victory also highlights the competitive balance within the league, with two Eastern Conference teams and two Western Conference teams now having claimed the title since the competition's inception.


The title triumph positions several Red Bulls II standouts for potential first-team opportunities heading into 2026, with Mosquera and Mitchell likely to receive increased attention from the MLS squad after their playoff performances. For Colorado Rapids 2, despite the disappointment, players like Diop and Garcia demonstrated qualities that could earn them consideration at the next level.

The win is also a massive one for Bradley, who is widely considered one of the brightest American coaching prospects. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

After a career-best season, Carlos Alcaraz began his Nitto ATP Finals campaign in fitting fashion — with a long-awaited opening victory.

The top seed on Sunday powered past Alex de Minaur 7-6(5), 6-2 to ignite his quest for a maiden crown at the prestigious season finale. Alcaraz, who had fallen to Alexander Zverev (2023) and Casper Ruud (2024) in his two previous opening matches in Turin, looked determined to rewrite the script, even if he did have to overcome a nail-biting first-set test in the process.

First Match Under Wraps! 👌@carlosalcaraz kick-starts his 2025 #NittoATPFinals campaign with a straight sets win over De Minaur pic.twitter.com/6qqfQMniGY

“This tournament is one of the best tournaments we have on Tour, without a doubt,” Alcaraz said. “We're playing against the best players in the world, which shows how difficult and important it is. I've been struggling in the past few years to come to the end of the year with motivation. This year is a little bit different, which I'm proud about [as] I'm doing the right things to give myself a shot to try and win this tournament.”

Alcaraz impressed the crowd inside Inalpi Arena early with his shotmaking en route to a 4-1, 40/0 lead in just 25 minutes. Yet that advantage quickly slipped away as De Minaur clawed back, forcing Alcaraz into a tense tie-break. The top seed settled in, however, twice rallying from a mini-break down and reeling off four straight points from 3/5 to eventually clinch the set.

Even though Alcaraz's 21 winners were coupled with 19 unforced errors in the opener, he maintained his bold aggression throughout the second set. The big-hitting Spaniard earned another healthy lead, but this time he contained his unforced errors and raced through the finish to improve to 5-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with De Minaur.

“It was a really difficult match,” said Alcaraz. “On this surface, Alex makes the most of the speed of the ball, he's super fast and really difficult on return. I'm just really happy to get through this really difficult challenge, and happy with how I'm playing [going into] the next matches.”

With his one-hour, 40-minute victory, Alcaraz also strengthened his push to claim ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours for the first time since 2022. He now needs 250 more points in Turin to secure the honour over rival Jannik Sinner, with each round-robin win worth 200 points.

Alcaraz will next seek a win on Tuesday, when he faces either Taylor Fritz or Lorenzo Musetti in the Jimmy Connors Group. He owns a Tour-leading 68 wins and eight trophies in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

The Cincinnati Open, the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha and the Nordea Open in Bastad were named Tournaments of the Year in their respective categories for the 2025 ATP Awards based on the results of player surveys.

The Cincinnati event was named the ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year for the first time after completing a $260 million transformation at the Lindner Family Tennis Center. Doha received an upgrade of its own, becoming an ATP 500 event this season and leading the voting at that level, while the seaside Bastad event was named the ATP 250 Tournament of the Year for the 13th time.





The Cincinnati Open lived up to the considerable hype after doubling its footprint to more than 40 acres, turning its grounds into an unforgettable campus that blends elite tennis with the atmosphere of an amusement park. The $260 million investment was made collectively with the City of Mason, Warren County and the State of Ohio.

In its 126th year, the event welcomed more players than ever — 96 in the singles main draw and 32 in doubles — as it expanded to 12 days, while also creating one of the most fan-friendly environments on Tour.

“We are incredibly honored to be named ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year for the first time in our history,” said tournament director Bob Moran. “This recognition is a reflection of the vision and commitment of Ben and Kelly Navarro, who set out to create a best-in-class experience not just for fans, but for the players who make this sport so special. This award is a true team achievement, and we're grateful to the ATP and the players for recognizing that effort.”

Carlos Alcaraz captured this year's Cincinnati men's singles title, while Rajeev Ram and Nikola Mektic claimed the doubles crown at the August event.

The Qatar ExxonMobil Open, a six-time honouree in the ATP 250 category, raised its exceptional standards in tournament organisation, player services and hospitality to mark its elevation to the ATP 500 level with Tournament of the Year honours.

The February tournament's upgrade further strengthened its global standing — attracting an elite player field that included Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic — and enhanced its impact within the region and beyond.

“We are truly honoured to receive this award for best tournament in the ATP 500 category,” said tournament director Karim Alami. “This recognition reflects the passion, dedication and teamwork that define our event. From our incredible players and loyal fans to our committed sponsors and staff, everyone contributed to creating a world-class experience both on and off the court. 

“This award inspires us to continue raising the bar and delivering an unforgettable tournament for years to come.”

Andrey Rublev won the Doha men's singles title and the event's coveted “Golden Falcon” trophy, beating Jack Draper in a three-set final. Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool won an all-British doubles final against Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski.

The Nordea Open, voted ATP 250 Tournament of the Year for 11 consecutive years from 2002-12, has now won the award in two of the past three seasons. The Swedish event, one of the most scenic on the ATP Tour calendar, also topped the voting in 2023, when it celebrated its 75th anniversary.

""This is great news and we are of course happy and thankful. Our ambition is always to give the best services and hospitality to all our guests; players, partners and spectators,” said CEO & Managing Director Christer Hult. “This is confirmation that the team is doing a great job and it inspires us to continue developing the tournament even more. A big thanks to the players, our organisation and the ATP support team.""

Sixth-seeded Italian Luciano Darderi won this year's Bastad singles title in July, while doubles top seeds Guido Andreozzi and Sander Arends won the doubles final in a Match Tie-break.

In addition to the Tournament of the Year Awards, seven more tournaments were recognised for their performance in player surveys as Standards of Excellence winners. The honourees by category were:

ATP Masters 1000: Shanghai

ATP 500: Dubai, Barcelona

ATP 250: Kitzbuhel, Almaty, Stockholm

This year, the ATP is unveiling changes to the ATP Awards, designed to enhance the prestige and excitement of the season's most celebrated honours. 

For the first time, members of the exclusive ATP No. 1 Club – the 29 current and former players to have reached World No. 1 – will decide the winners of Breakthrough of the Year and the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award. 

The new Breakthrough of the Year category goes to the player who made the biggest breakthrough on the ATP Tour this season, with consideration given to milestone wins, significant jumps in the PIF ATP Rankings and first ATP Tour titles. Whilst there are no age restrictions, the Award is aimed at Next Gen and young players.

The good news for Felix Auger-Aliassime Saturday night was that he learned he qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals. The more difficult news was that his first opponent will be defending champion Jannik Sinner.

“It's one way to start a tournament, for sure. It's different in all the other tournaments,” Auger-Aliassime said. “You know that coming into this event that every match is going to be tough. I start the tournament with the toughest challenge, which is interesting in a way because I think winning a match like this one would kind of give you confidence that you can go very far in this tournament. If it doesn't go your way, it doesn't.

“But I'm going to get ready to be a little bit better than I was in Paris. I'm looking forward obviously to matching up with him, and also the atmosphere. It's probably going to be really good.”

The Canadian carries momentum into the Monday-evening clash following his run to the Rolex Paris Masters final. In the championship match at the season's final ATP Masters 1000 event, he fell to Sinner in a competitive straight-sets defeat.

Shortly thereafter, Auger-Aliassime withdrew from Metz and returned home to recover, leaving open the possibility of Lorenzo Musetti capturing the Athens title to leapfrog him in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. That does not mean he was glued to the television watching matches, though.

“Actually, I didn't. I didn't. I was like, 'This is going to be a bit stressful to watch',” Auger-Aliassime said with a smile. “I was trying to stay away from all that stress. I was obviously following the scores, the results, but just focusing on what was under my control, trying to get ready and stay relaxed.”

Importantly, Auger-Aliassime feels better than he did at the end of Paris and is ready to begin his charge in Turin.

“I feel good. Look, it's the end of the season. I've been dealing with some things. But I feel ready. I feel good,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I think it was not even the right decision for me, it was the only decision because for me it was tough to think to play Wednesday already in any other tournament. It was also jeopardising potentially this tournament... Now I think I feel good and I feel ready to start.”

From jet-lagged and sore to flawless in Riyadh, Elena Rybakina won five straight matches -- including a straight-sets final over Aryna Sabalenka -- by trusting her swing and her serve.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- She entered the tournament at less than her best and decided to go all in on a first-strike, attack-mode strategy.

And then, as she progressed through the WTA Finals field, Elena Rybakina -- despite a sore right shoulder -- started to feel better and better about her game. She faced World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday night's final and didn't change a thing.

“I feel like she just decided that she's just going to step in and go for her shots without, thinking and without doubting any decisions,” Sabalenka said. “And I think she was a bit more brave today than me.”

Rybakina was a 6-3 7-6 (0) winner and, because of her undefeated 5-0 record, collected $5,235,000 in prize money.

It was the 11th straight match-win for the 26-year-old from Kazakhstan, a win streak that started after a loss to Sabalenka in Wuhan, China.

Rybakina has now gone 8-6 against No. 1 players, a remarkable record. She's the first player to defeat both Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek at multiple WTA events, after previously achieving the feat on the way to winning tournament title at Indian Wells in 2023.

The serve, as usual, was the critical piece. After hitting 15 aces against Jessica Pegula in the semifinals, she added 13 more against Sabalenka -- and saved all five break points. She also won nearly 77 percent of her first-serve points.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

“Some moments,” Rybakina said, “when I needed it the most, the serve worked -- even though she was really playing well and pushing me in the tough situations.”

Sabalenka has a reputation for power, but Rybakina produced far faster groundstrokes from both sides. She constantly had Sabalenka under pressure, hitting off-balance shots -- and talking to herself.

Even before that ultimate tiebreak, Rybakina asserted herself. Down 4-5 in the second set, she saved two set points

“The most difficult [thing] was that she was just like, going for her shots, and she was making those lines after lines after lines,” Sabalenka said. “I was just trying to wait for opportunity.”

A chance that never, truly came.

Afterward, Rybakina sat down with wtatennis.com. Here's what she had to say:

You arrived here jet-lagged, tired from playing so many matches and, by your own admission, had low expectations How did those low expectations help you win the tournament?

Rybakina: Yeah, I guess I was not putting too much pressure on myself. It's a lot of challenges when you come from tournament to tournament, even if it's not a long travel. You need to get used to the new conditions, new balls, learning how to control them. We did only two days of practice, and I went right into my first match. It was not easy. But the advantage I had was the serve, that's what we were focusing on because we knew in the longer rallies I wouldn't be feeling so confident because we just arrived. I was trying to go for early shots. I was really aggressive, I would say, the whole tournament. The best players, they will give you some chances but not that much. I was taking everything as soon as possible.

You lost the first set of your group match to Swiatek -- and then won 12 of 13 games. How do you turn it on like that?

Rybakina: She played really well to start. Sometimes it takes time for everybody to get used to each other. For example, Iga plays with more spin on the ball, and she has unbelievable footwork and energy on the court. Sometimes I'm a little too slow to start the match, not serving as good when the match goes longer. It's really little details, but I managed to find a way and put things together. 

No one was better than Sabalenka in tiebreaks this year, and yet, you didn't give her one point in the second-set breaker. That's never, ever happened in her career. How do you explain that?

Rybakina: [Exhales sharply.] Oh, OK. I remember when the tiebreak started that once this year I played against her in the third set [in Berlin], and I was up and had so many match points because it was a tiebreak. It was such a match and this time, I was just going point by point. Until the moment of the match point, I didn't want to think about it. And then I realized that I won -- because I was so focused. Looking back, first few points were really important.

You won Wimbledon three years ago … How can this big a springboard to more success at the Grand Slam level next year?

Rybakina: Well, I hope so. All that happened this week, I can bring to the next season. It gives me so much more motivation to work even more because we did good progress in the little blocks between the tournaments. Physically, even when I wasn't at my best, we did a good job. I've experienced winning a Slam, losing in a final to Aryna [2023 Australian Open] … each match like this brings so much experience and this time it went my way, everything worked. I'll try to carry every positive thing from this tournament into my next big matches.

You're flying back to Dubai on Sunday … Any vacation plans?

Rybakina: I'm going to spend a couple of days in Europe, different cities. Mostly for the health, some tests. I've been having some [illness] issues that went away and are coming back. And then I'll see my family. Since I live in Dubai, there are good places to train. So I think I'm going to stay there, in one place. Looking forward to a rest.

After recording his first Top 10 finish in 2022, ending that year at No. 6, Auger-Aliassime struggled over the next two years, finishing both 2023 and 2024 at No. 29 (and dipping as low as No. 36 last year).But he's made a big resurgence this year, posting 48 wins and reaching the quarterfinals or better 13 times, which includes three ATP titles in Adelaide, Montpellier and Brussels, two more finals in Dubai (an ATP 500) and Paris (a Masters 1000) and another five semifinals, including his second career Grand Slam semifinal at the US Open.And his late push to Turin was noteworthy—he's won 22 of his last 27 matches, reaching the quarterfinals or better at his last six tournaments in a row between Cincinnati and Paris.He withdrew from Metz this week with a left knee injury, leaving his ATP Finals fate up to Musetti in Athens, but things worked out in the end.Now back up to No. 8 on the ATP rankings, the Canadian is guaranteed to finish in the Top 10 for the second time in his career.

Rybakina achieved another special feat on Saturday, too.In a year where Sabalenka dominated the rankings from start to finish—she was ranked No. 1 every single week of the 2025 season—Rybakina was the only player who managed to beat her twice, defeating her in the quarterfinals of Cincinnati and now in the final of the WTA Finals in Riyadh.And she very nearly got Sabalenka three times, holding quadruple match point up 6-2 in the third set tie-break of their quarterfinal thriller in Berlin, on grass, before Sabalenka fought back to sneak the breaker out, 8-6.Sabalenka's other 10 losses in 2025 came to different players—Madison Keys (Australian Open), Ekaterina Alexandrova (Doha), Clara Tauson (Dubai), Mirra Andreeva (Indian Wells), Jelena Ostapenko (Stuttgart), Zheng Qinwen (Rome), Coco Gauff (Roland Garros), Marketa Vondrousova (Berlin), Amanda Anisimova (Wimbledon) and Jessica Pegula (Wuhan).

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Championship leader Lando Norris has extended his lead after taking victory in the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, while the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri crashed out of the event.

Lando Norris has taken victory in an action-packed Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, the McLaren driver holding off Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli amid changing conditions in an event that saw the other papaya car of Oscar Piastri crash out early on.

While the Sprint got off to a relatively calm start – with Norris leading smoothly away from pole – the picture changed within a few laps when Piastri hit the barriers after getting on the damp kerbs at Turn 3, with Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto subsequently going off at the same corner moments later.

The Sprint was subsequently red-flagged as the damage was cleared, but Norris again held the lead when the event resumed shortly afterwards. That position looked in doubt during the final laps, however, as the Briton struggled with his rear soft tyres and found himself under increasing pressure from Antonelli.

With the event ending under double yellow flags following a heavy crash for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, Norris ultimately held off Antonelli to take the win, the championship leader doing so with a margin of just 0.845s.

George Russell added to a solid outing for Mercedes in third, while Red Bull's Max Verstappen took some valuable points in fourth should he hope to keep his title bid alive. Charles Leclerc was fifth for Ferrari after a late pass on Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, with the other Scuderia car of Lewis Hamilton and Alpine's Pierre Gasly following in seventh and eighth places.

With one only hour of practice taking place on Friday, a busy Sprint Qualifying session later in the day had seen Norris claim pole position for the 100-kilometre dash, a format that awards points to the top eight finishers from a maximum of eight for P1 down to one for P8.

Sprint results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES GRANDE PRÊMIO DE SÃO PAULO 2025

The Briton's closest challenger was Antonelli, whose own effort was just 0.097s adrift of Norris' pace-setting time of 1m 09.243s. Behind them were the other respective McLaren and Mercedes cars of Piastri and Russell in third and fourth.

It was a tricker session for title contender Verstappen, who shook his head in disappointment after crossing the line in sixth, while both Ferraris also appeared to be struggling for pace as Leclerc and Hamilton claimed eighth and 11th places.

Despite a potentially mixed weather forecast for Saturday, showers that had fallen earlier on had faded as the drivers started to assemble at Interlagos for the Sprint, though parts of the track still appeared damp.

It was confirmed in the build-up to the event that both Yuki Tsunoda and Carlos Sainz – who had qualified in 18th and 20th respectively – would start from the pit lane due to modifications being made to their cars under parc ferme conditions, that being a set-up and front wing/nose assembly change for Tsunoda and a set-up change for Sainz.

While questions remained in the build-up over whether slick or intermediate tyres would be the preference owing to the damp patches on track – and with a 30% chance of rain during the Sprint – it was confirmed when the tyre blankets were removed that the majority of the field had bolted on the medium compound, while Antonelli, Russell, Verstappen, Leclerc, Isack Hadjar and Alex Albon were the exceptions on the soft tyres.

As the lights went out for the 24-lap event, Norris made an excellent start to surge ahead in the lead, while Antonelli faced pressure from Piastri but managed to hold onto second. Behind them, Verstappen was quick to pick off Alonso for fifth and Hamilton had also made moves, climbing up to eighth place to run behind team mate Leclerc.

Lance Stroll had lost out to drop down two positions to ninth, and further back there was contact between Ollie Bearman and Liam Lawson at Turn 4, an incident that sent the former into a spin to drop him down to P18.

Following an investigation by the stewards post-Sprint, Bearman was later handed a five-second time penalty and one penalty point for driving in a manner deemed potentially dangerous between Turns 3 and 4, while Lawson also received the same punishment for causing a collision at Turn 4.

Within four laps, Norris had stretched out a gap of nearly one and a half seconds from Antonelli, with each of the top five running in relatively clear air. The margins were much finer behind, however, as Alonso was chased by Leclerc and Hamilton.

That calm quickly unravelled with a dramatic sequence of events on Lap 6, as Piastri took too much kerb and crashed into the barriers at Turn 3. With water seemingly being dragged onto the track, Hulkenberg and Colapinto then both went off at the same corner, resulting in the Safety Car being deployed.

While Hulkenberg was able to get his Kick Sauber going again and return to the pits with a broken nosecone, Piastri and Colapinto were both out of the running – and with those cars needing to be recovered and the barriers requiring repairs, a red flag was thrown to bring the Sprint to a halt.

The remaining cars made their way back to the fast lane of the pit lane during the stoppage, before a restart time was confirmed a short while later. Kick Sauber had fixed Hulkenberg's car in time to rejoin the Sprint, meaning that he was released onto the track to get himself to the back of the queue in the pit lane.

Ahead of a rolling start, the Safety Car led the pack out – all having changed tyres during the break – and Norris again executed a good start when the action resumed with 15 laps remaining. Behind him Russell looked to challenge Antonelli, but it was the latter who held position through Turn 1.

Alonso was also looking racy, the Aston Martin driver attempting a move on fourth-placed Verstappen before having to back off and settle for fifth. While Verstappen then started to pull away, Alonso again found himself under pressure from Leclerc behind.

As the halfway mark of the Sprint passed, Norris was leading Antonelli by 1.2s, with Russell, Verstappen, Alonso, Leclerc, Hamilton and Stroll completing the points-paying positions, though Stroll had the Alpine of Gasly hot on his tail.

Alonso – still being chased by Leclerc – was told to lift and coast by his race engineer, while further back Gasly was still looking to get ahead of Stroll for eighth. The Frenchman was still keeping an eye on what was happening ahead, reporting: “That Ferrari needs to get past Alonso.”

At the front, Norris appeared to be struggling with his rear tyres on the drying track, the Briton having switched to the soft compound during the stoppage. Could second-placed Antonelli eat further into the McLaren's 1.1s lead?

By Lap 20, Antonelli had closed to just 0.4s behind Norris. Behind them, Leclerc finally found a way past Alonso to move up into fifth, leaving the Aston Martin to face pressure from the other Ferrari of Hamilton.

As the final lap arrived, all eyes were on Antonelli as the Italian continued his pursuit of Norris. But with a hefty crash into the barriers for home favourite Bortoleto – after which the Brazilian fortunately reported that he was okay – meaning that the Sprint ended under double yellow flags, it was Norris who took victory as the chequered flag fell, allowing him to extend his championship lead over Piastri to nine points.

Antonelli crossed the line just 0.845s behind, while the other Mercedes of Russel followed in third. Verstappen claimed fourth place, with Leclerc, Alonso, Hamilton and Gasly taking the remaining points on offer.

Stroll and Hadjar just missed out in ninth and 10th respectively, while Haas' Esteban Ocon and Bearman were 11th and 12th, the latter holding enough of a margin from the car behind to maintain his place despite his aforementioned five-second time penalty.

While Lawson had originally followed in 13th, his five-second time penalty later dropped him to 16th, promoting Tsunoda, Sainz and Hulkenberg up by one position each with Albon completing the classification in 17th. Bortoleto, Piastri and Colapinto, meanwhile, were the three retirees from the event after their respective crashes.

""It was tough,"" said Norris. ""It makes the win more rewarding when you have a race like this, especially with Kimi here – he was certainly not making my life easy. It's one of those ones where you have to push because you know the guy behind is going to try and push that little bit more. It was sketchy – I had a couple of little lifts, but even with the wind it was tricky. With the degradation on the tyres, it was difficult so definitely not an easy race but probably the race you expect here in Brazil. It's always a difficult one.""

Following the Sprint, the drivers will next return to action during Qualifying for the Grand Prix later on Saturday, with the session set to begin at 1500 local time. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Max Verstappen was knocked out in the first part of Qualifying due to a lack of performance for the first time in his F1 career – every other occasion has been the result of a penalty.

In a Qualifying session full of talking points, Max Verstappen's early exit in Q1 was one of the biggest shocks around Interlagos, with the Red Bull driver labelling it another sign of a “tough weekend” as he prepares to line up 16th.

The Dutchman, who had been over 100 points adrift of the championship lead at one stage, had experienced a resurgence in recent rounds and arrived in Sao Paulo just 36 points behind Lando Norris.

However, a lacklustre Sprint saw him go from sixth to fourth position, where he was unable to find a way past the Mercedes of George Russell. He reported issues with the car bouncing excessively, giving the team plenty to do in the few hours before Qualifying began.

In Q1, Verstappen confirmed that the ride was smoother but the changes meant that the car was now sliding around a lot more, giving him no grip around the circuit. He was unable to get on top of the problem before the clock ticked down, leaving him frustrated and down in P16.

“It's not what you want to see,” he said after the session. “The whole weekend has already been quite tough but this is a bit unexpected, I would say, after changing quite a bit on the car.

“It was just not responding. I had no grip out there so I had to really massively underdrive it basically. It just didn't work.”

In one of the highlights of last season, Verstappen drove from P17 to victory in Sao Paulo amid heavy rainfall, but an equally dramatic downpour would seemingly have to occur for him to have any chance of replicating the feat in Sunday's Grand Prix.

Asked whether he and the team were tempted to change the power unit ahead of the race, he answered: “Not necessarily, but we'll look at all of that tonight.”

The result was one of Red Bull's exceedingly rare double Q1 exits as Yuki Tsunoda found himself the last of the runners in 19th place, with Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto unable to take part in the session following his heavy Sprint crash.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Title contender Max Verstappen was dealt a blow in his hopes of closing the gap to Lando Norris as he was knocked out in Q1 at Interlagos.

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies admitted that the changes made to Max Verstappen's car between an underwhelming Sprint performance and Qualifying in Sao Paulo “went in the opposite direction” and contributed to his early Q1 exit.

The Dutchman has succeeded in gradually narrowing the deficit to the McLaren pair in the drivers' standings across recent rounds. With a gap of 36 points at the beginning of the weekend, there was undoubtedly potential for him to hunt down his fifth championship with another strong showing.

However, his ambitions were dealt a heavy blow in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix with Red Bull's post-Sprint adjustments seemingly leading to an uncontrollable lack of grip.

He reported over the radio in Q1 that he had “no grip – zero”, which was a concern that several drivers had expressed throughout the day due to the tricky weather conditions.

However, Verstappen's experience with the slippery surface was reflected dramatically in his performance as he wound up in P16, with his team mate Yuki Tsunoda also knocked out in P19.

“Today has not been a positive day for the Team, but one we will try and learn from,” Mekies summarised afterwards. “The Sprint was tough and we did not have the pace to fight for the win.

“We were not happy with where we were after the Sprint, so we decided to make a number of changes. It is part of the risk taking we felt was necessary to see if we could get more out of the car.

“It didn't work and if anything, it went in the opposite direction and clearly, we lost a lot of competitiveness. It is painful and difficult to accept but it is what happens when you take risks sometimes and the best we can do is to learn from it and see where we can improve the car from here.”

While teams like McLaren and Mercedes have managed the unique challenges of the old-school track well, Red Bull have not been able to find momentum, leaving Verstappen with an uphill fight to return to the points.

He famously did so in a similar situation last season in Brazil, recovering from P17 to P1 in a rain-soaked race, but the lack of a downpour in the weather forecast could make a similar recovery even harder.

Mekies added: “It's fair to say we are missing the right window for the car for this circuit, in these conditions. That is where the effort will go and we will look at the options to see how we can improve the situation. All the team is fully focused to get both cars into a more competitive place for the race tomorrow.”

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris managed the precarious track conditions in Interlagos to secure another win.

Grey skies and a damp circuit were not enough to dissuade Lando Norris from storming to victory in the Sao Paulo Sprint, narrowly beating the Mercedes duo of Kimi Antonelli and George Russell.

After a strong start for Norris, his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri learned just how tricky the mixed conditions were – he drove onto the wet kerb at Turn 3, which sent him into a spin that ended in the barriers.

Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto replicated his error and the Sprint was halted to recover the stricken cars, with race control confirming that there would be a rolling start controlled by Norris.

He sped away from Antonelli at the restart, with the Italian coming under pressure from the second Mercedes of George Russell. While the order remained the same to the chequered flag, Norris struggled with his soft tyres for the final laps, bringing Antonelli threateningly close behind him – he ultimately finished just eight-tenths behind the Sprint winner.

As they crossed the line, home hero Gabriel Bortoleto suffered a massive crash that saw him slam into the inside wall before flying across the circuit to hit another barrier. He thankfully confirmed that he was uninjured.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams on race day at Interlagos.

Lando Norris is enjoying a commanding weekend so far in Sao Paulo, having won the Sprint from pole and taken P1 on the grid for the Grand Prix itself, while his title rivals Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen are starting from fourth and 16th respectively.

Happily for the chasing pack though, a race at the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace is never decided on grid position. Even if it doesn't rain – and there's a decent chance it will – it's going to come down to making good strategy choices… with some interesting variables in play.

The 2024 Sao Paulo Grand Prix was very wet, even by Interlagos standards. Verstappen won, with a double Alpine podium behind him, all running an inter>inter strategy.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Oscar Piastri's championship ambitions were thrown off course in Brazil as he found the barrier during the Sprint.

Oscar Piastri dramatically spun into the barrier during the Sprint in Sao Paulo, putting a dent in his hopes of picking up maximum points in a remarkably tight championship battle.

Conditions around Interlagos were treacherous from the formation lap onwards, with parts of the track appearing damp and slippery, making it tricky to find a racing line that was both dry and effective.

This came to a head on Lap 7, when Piastri drifted onto the kerb at Turn 3. The slick surface sent up a spray of water, forcing him into a spin that ended with his McLaren crashing into the wall and out of the Sprint.

There were eerily similar incidents for Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto, both of whom dropped a wheel onto the kerb before finding the barrier. The amount of debris resulted in the red flag being waved, temporarily halting the session.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

McLaren's Lando Norris controlled the opening lap of the Sprint in Sao Paulo to retain his lead.

Polesitter Lando Norris got the perfect launch on the opening lap of the Sprint around Interlagos, managing a damp track to charge away from Kimi Antonelli and Oscar Piastri.

While earlier rainfall wasn't as dramatic as anticipated, the track surface was still slick in parts at the beginning of the Sprint, presenting a unique challenge for the drivers.

Norris executed a strong start while Antonelli had a slower reaction, putting him under pressure from the second McLaren of Piastri. The Mercedes was able to defend well despite weaving on the damp circuit, ultimately keeping the Australian in third position.

Further behind, there was contact between Liam Lawson and the Haas of Ollie Bearman, with the latter sent into a spin that forced him down the order.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris once again came out on top in a highly competitive Qualifying hour at Interlagos.

Lando Norris demonstrated why he is at the top of the standings as he bounced back from an error to take pole position in Sao Paulo on his final attempt, denying Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc in a tense session.

The McLaren driver had previously locked up at the beginning of Q3, leaving him in P10 with a few minutes of the session remaining. With competition remarkably tight, the battle for pole was wide open and he had a sole opportunity to take it.

Shrugging off his earlier mistake, he set a time of 1m 09.511s, which was slower than his lap in Sprint Qualifying but nevertheless more than enough to displace his competitors, with Antonelli finishing 0.174s adrift of Norris' effort.

Hit go on the video player above to watch Norris' pole lap.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from the Sprint and Qualifying at the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Norris led off the line at the start of the Sprint, and despite some late pressure, came home with the win. But for the second Sprint in a row, Piastri failed to finish. He was running third in the early stages when he got up on the kerb, which was still carrying some water. That caused a spin, the Australian hitting the barriers and heading for an early shower.

Norris picked up where he left off in Qualifying, topping the first two segments. A lock-up on his first run in Q3 left him P10 with it all to do, but he did not disappoint on his second run, grabbing pole by a healthy margin. Piastri could not match his team mate when it mattered, winding up fourth.

Lando Norris, Sprint: 1st, Qualifying: 1st, 1:09.511

“It's been good fun today despite the tricky conditions. The track is slippery and inconsistent – but it's still a pleasure to drive at Interlagos and a great start to the weekend by winning the Sprint. We've been on very good form today, and the team are giving me a great car, so thank you to everyone at McLaren. I put myself under a bit of pressure in Q3 by locking-up at the first corner, which made things a little bit more stressful than I would have liked, but I stayed calm and put it together when it mattered.

“As for tomorrow, we don't know what the weather is going to do, but we do know the competition is very quick. Big challenge ahead, but one we'll prepare for overnight and just focus on delivering the best possible performance.""

Oscar Piastri, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 4th, 1:09.886

""Not quite the day I was looking for. There were very tricky conditions in both the Sprint and Quali and we didn't know how the grip was going to be. Unfortunately, I've paid the price for that. The car's been quick all weekend, so hopefully we can take advantage of it tomorrow and finish at the top.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A positive day overall, even if we do have one regret. Lando continued his excellent weekend, first winning a very complicated Sprint given the track conditions and then taking Pole position in a Qualifying session where the wind made conditions tricky. The regret is linked to Oscar missing points in the Sprint, after demonstrating strong pace, but he has already put that behind him in Qualifying and will be pushing hard in the race.

“Tomorrow, it will be important to execute everything perfectly: strategy, pit stops, tyre management and all the changes in weather conditions that may occur. Today, we saw once again that there is a very tight competition and let's not forget that on this track everything can happen: last year's race winner started from 17th position on the grid. So, we will have to pay attention to every detail and stay focused at all times to exploit the potential we have at our disposal.”

Antonelli and Russell duelled off the line, with the youngster getting ahead. They went side by side again at the rolling restart, keeping their fights clean and fair much to the relief of the team. But from there Antonelli had the edge, and he gradually closed in on Norris ahead. But with the track still damp, it was too hard to leave the dry racing line and challenge the McLaren man for the lead. Second and third was still a strong enough result to lift Mercedes into second in the championship.

Like Norris, Antonelli was able to continue his form from the Sprint in Qualifying, as he grabbed P2 on the grid for his best Grand Prix start. But Russell was struggling with his tyres, so much so he opted to bolt on some mediums for his final flying run in Q3 – to no avail.

George Russell, Sprint: 3rd, Qualifying: 6th, 1:09.942

""First of all, a huge congratulations to Kimi. He did a massive job out there and I'm really proud of him and the team. On my side, P6 is not where I wanted to be today. I struggled a lot to put the Soft tyres in the right window and couldn't find the necessary grip to put a good lap together. With only one hour of practice yesterday and the changing weather conditions overnight, making both Soft and Medium tyres perform proved challenging.

""Whilst starting from the third row is far from ideal, we are ahead of one Ferrari and both Red Bulls. That is very important in our fight for P2 in the Constructors' Championship. We were able to add good points collectively as a team in this morning's Sprint and will be looking to do the same in tomorrow's Grand Prix.""

Kimi Antonelli, Sprint: 2nd, Qualifying: 2nd, 1:09.685

""I am really happy to be starting on the front row for tomorrow's race. Qualifying was not easy with a lot of unexpected wind gusts, but we managed to put everything together from Q1 to Q3. We were able to put the tyres in the right window, and we did a solid job as a team, putting a good lap together at the end when it mattered.

""Throughout the weekend, I've been more and more comfortable with the car, and I've been enjoying racing on this track. The crowd is amazing here and it gives a lot of energy to perform at your best. The Sprint was exciting; I was pushing hard at the end using the Medium tyre to put Lando (Norris) under pressure. I got close but didn't have enough speed to attempt an overtake. Nevertheless, that is a good sign for tomorrow's race. I'm excited to be starting at the front, can hopefully fight the cars around us, and look to add some good points in our battle for P2 in the Constructors' Championship.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""That was a solid day in the office for us as a team. Kimi has performed strongly all weekend, despite this being his first time racing around here, and he maximised the result in both this morning's Sprint and this afternoon's qualifying. He was matching Lando (Norris) right up until the last corner on his final effort in Q3. There was, just like yesterday, a chance of him taking pole potentially but P2 is a good position to be starting from tomorrow.

""For George, he has been struggling with a lack of grip and that showed itself particularly on the Soft compound tyre. We will see what we can do with the tools we have at our disposal to help him with that tomorrow. Starting P6, he will be looking to move forward and gain positions. Our pace in the Sprint offers hope that he can do that and that Kimi can be in the fight right at the front. The conditions are once again likely to change tomorrow though so we won't take anything for granted.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""The day got off to a good start with the Sprint race. We decided to go on the Soft tyre for the start line benefit, especially considering the slightly damp track. This decision worked out quite nicely with the subsequent red flag, allowing us to fit the Medium tyre and manage the rest of the race well from there. Putting both cars onto the Sprint race podium was a nice achievement this morning but our focus quickly shifted to preparing for qualifying.

""With good pace on both single lap and long run, we headed into that session with confidence. Kimi had a solid hour from start to finish, and P2 is another very strong result. George struggled a bit with the Soft tyre on the other hand. We will have a look at the data overnight to understand the issue and solve the lack of comfort George has felt all weekend.

""The starting grid should make tomorrow's race interesting. George's good pace this morning should help him progress to the front tomorrow. Kimi showed today that he can match Lando's (Norris) pace and fight at the front. We're studying all strategies available to put the field under some pressure tomorrow.""

Hamilton had a great getaway on the initial Sprint start, climbing from P11 to eighth. That put him into the points and on the tail of his team mate. Those two followed Alonso closely throughout, but Leclerc only managed to finally find a way through with a few laps left. That did not give Hamilton enough time to mount an attack of his own, but they could at least take heart from having better pace than they showed on Friday.

That pace deserted Hamilton in Qualifying, though, as he became another driver to struggle with rear grip. He exited in Q2 on merit, but Leclerc at least made it to the top 10 shootout. Once there, the Monegasque driver finally found some pace, grabbing P3 on the grid somewhat against the run of form.

Charles Leclerc, Sprint: 5th, Qualifying: 3rd, 1:09.805

""The Sprint this morning was quite good, but we were lacking some straight line speed which cost us a bit of lap time and had me stuck behind Fernando (Alonso) for quite a while.
As for qualifying, I'm happy to have put it all together. We changed the car a bit after the Sprint this morning which gave us some more performance. It was very tight today, and I put in good laps in Q2 and Q3, so I'm satisfied to be starting the race from third place tomorrow because none of us expected this given what a challenging weekend we've had so far and the team did a really good job today. If we manage to stay ahead after the start we have a chance to bring home a good result for the team.

""Big congratulations to our team in WEC who secured the Constructors' title for the first time in 53 years today, and to Antonio (Giovinazzi) and his team mates in car #51, for winning the Drivers' title. They all did an amazing job and the whole team in Bahrain deserves to celebrate this achievement.""

Lewis Hamilton, Sprint: 7th, Qualifying: 13th, 1:10.100

""Congratulations to our WEC colleagues for securing both championships in the final endurance race — a well-deserved result for everyone involved. Today also started on a positive note here in Brazil. In the Sprint I was able to make up a good number of places, which got me back into the points. We made some changes to the car afterwards that helped on the straights and in the high-speed corners, but unfortunately we couldn't get the rear tyres into the right window in Q2 and that cost us. Still, a lot can happen on this track, as we've already seen today, so we'll give it everything and try to put up a strong fight tomorrow.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""The lap times are getting closer and closer: between first and sixteenth there's just one tenth difference. This means it only takes the smallest of mistakes or a bit of traffic on a quick lap to find yourself already out in Q1 or Q2.

""We did a much better job today than yesterday. It's a matter of putting everything together and doing everything perfectly. We were expecting rain, but it didn't come and so, for qualifying we went with a lower downforce set-up. The WEC title in Bahrain is a fantastic achievement that makes everyone in Maranello proud. It's a clear reminder that we are one company and one team, united by the same passion and commitment wherever we race. Let's hope it also brings us some positive energy here in Brazil.""

Tsunoda started the Sprint from the pit lane, the team opting to test out a different downforce set-up with a view to gaining data to use on Verstappen's car in the mixed conditions. That left all eyes on the Dutchman, who had a great initial start to pick off Alonso and run fifth. He had to fight harder at the rolling restart to stay ahead of the Spaniard, but from there came home fourth after inheriting a place when Piastri crashed. As such he lost some ground to Norris in the championship, but it could have been worse.

And indeed it was worse, much worse in Qualifying. Neither Red Bull made it out of Q1, with Verstappen complaining about sliding as he admitted he had to “under-drive” the car just to avoid an accident. Whatever way Red Bull went on set-up after the Sprint did not work, and now they have it all to do tomorrow.

Max Verstappen, Sprint: 4th, Qualifying: 16th, 1:10.401

""The Sprint today was a mixed bag, I had a good start and made up one position but that was about as good as it got. We then had the red flag and my race was pretty much over, I just couldn't keep up with the cars in front of me and the wet patches on the track didn't help. The Sprint felt similar to how the car felt during Sprint Quali yesterday so considering that, we definitely maximised as much as was possible with the P4 result. Between the Sprint and Quali today we made quite a few changes to the car to try and improve performance, but the grip and traction were not there and I was sliding around a lot which resulted in me really having to under drive. I am struggling to understand why the performance has been quite so bad today, we have a lot to analyse but firstly we need to understand the issues that we have been facing all weekend. The whole weekend has been pretty tough which is definitely unexpected but let's see what tomorrow has in store.""

Yuki Tsunoda, Sprint: 13th, Qualifying: 19th, 1:10.711

""Today was a frustrating one. We had tried a different approach going into the Sprint to gain some important data for the Team before Qualifying. Starting from the pitlane made it difficult to make up many positions, but the data we took into Qualifying was valuable. Between the Sprint and Quali, we'd made changes to get ourselves in a better position. From my side of the garage it made a difference, I felt we made a step forward together. For Quali I felt better in the car, it solved some of the limitations that I was feeling in the Sprint but we then encountered another issue as a result of the changes. The lack of grip was a problem, especially in these conditions, where in sector one we just couldn't get the tyres going. It's frustrating to not have maximised on the positives changes we'd made. I'll start from the back, so I'll try my best tomorrow to overtake and move up the pack.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“Today has not been a positive day for the Team, but one we will try and learn from. The Sprint was tough and we did not have the pace to fight for the win. We managed to stay not too far off the leaders though and brought home some points with Max in P4. We were not happy with where we were after the Sprint, so we decided to make a number of changes. It is part of the risk taking we felt was necessary to see if we could get more out of the car. It didn't work and if anything, it went in the opposite direction and clearly, we lost a lot of competitiveness. It is painful and difficult to accept but it is what happens when you take risks sometimes and the best we can do is to learn from it and see where we can improve the car from here. It's fair to say we are missing the right window for the car for this circuit, in these conditions. That is where the effort will go and we will look at the options to see how we can improve the situation. All the Team is fully focussed to get both cars into a more competitive place for the race tomorrow.”

Hadjar did not get off the line well in the Sprint, which ended any chance he had of picking up points out there. Lawson had a more eventful time of it, called to the stewards after an early coming together with Bearman. They opted to add five seconds to his race time for causing a collision, which dropped him a few places down the order.

But both drivers did much better in Qualifying, as they made Q3 with ease. Hadjar was the best midfield runner in fifth, with Lawson a couple of places further back.

Isack Hadjar, Sprint: 10th, Qualifying: 5th, 1:09.931

""After a tricky Sprint race this morning, I'm glad that we put it all together during a hectic Qualifying session. There were very difficult conditions out there and despite having a fast a car, for most of the time I was just fighting with it. It wasn't easy at all to keeping the car on track today, so this P5 comes with a bit of a surprise and it's a great result for us as a team. Tomorrow we'll start in a very interesting position and it's definitely a big opportunity to score important points for the Constructors' Championship, so we'll give our all to achieve the best possible result.”

Liam Lawson, Sprint: 16th, Qualifying: 7th, 1:09.962

""To have both cars in Q3 is a great result for the team. The pace was very strong in Qualifying, which is great given the tough Sprint race. We'll be analysing the small details after losing lap time during Q3, which cost us a few positions, but it's certainly a decent place to be starting from tomorrow. As always, the target is to score points, so we'll be giving it our all on track.”

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of vehicle Performance

“The weather conditions we found today were certainly better than expected; the track was still damp for the start of the Sprint this morning, but everybody elected to start on the dry tyres. The Sprint race was difficult for us, Isack had a poor start on the Soft tyres and lost several positions in the first few corners. After the red flag, we decided to put him on the Mediums, which looked a little bit more competitive, but it wasn't good enough for points, despite several cars ahead being taken out in incidents. Liam had a decent start, but out of Turn 3 was pushed onto the grass. With wet and dirty tyres, he struggled in the following corner and made contact with another car, heavily damaging his floor and bodywork. From there it was tough to recover.

""Following the overnight analysis, simulator running and the driver's feedback from the Sprint, we made several setup changes for Qualifying, including a downforce level change on Isack. Both drivers did a brilliant job to secure the 5th and 7th positions on the grid and the team managed the progression through session on this very tight field very well – there were 13 cars in less than half a second in Q2!
We have a long race ahead tomorrow, but we're starting from a good position. The target is clear: score points with both cars.”

Both Haas drivers tangled with Lawson in the Sprint. First, Bearman was tagged into a spin at the start when fighting with the Kiwi racer. He was handed a five-second time penalty for the incident. Ocon found himself alongside Lawson later on when jostling for position. Either way, Haas did not have the pace to recover from their lowly qualifying slots in the dash.

But Bearman more than atoned for that moment in Qualifying. He was right at the top of the pecking order for much of Q2, and looked in the mix for the front rows. Alas, he could not fully nail his lap in Q3, but does have a very decent starting slot – as he did in Mexico. Ocon is still struggling over one lap by comparison, exiting in Q1.

Esteban Ocon, Sprint: 11th, Qualifying: 17th, 1:10.438

“We're working as hard as we can as a team to find answers. The car was very difficult to drive, lacking balance, so it was a disappointing session. It's not from a lack of trying though, so I'm sure we'll find out the answer to this and get to where we should be. The Sprint was a race of survival. It was one of those where if you stay on track and finish the race, you usually gain some positions, but it was hard out there.”

Oliver Bearman, Sprint: 12th, Qualifying: 8th, 1:09.977

“I had a great feeling from Lap 1, but I was surprised by our competitiveness. We were P3 in Q1 and P2 in Q2, so we were very strong. In Q3, I thought my first lap was good but I didn't improve compared to what I had achieved in Q2, so it's a bit strange that it panned out like that, and the track wasn't evolving, but otherwise it was a really good qualifying for us. I'm excited for tomorrow – we showed great race pace in the Sprint, and starting in a good position for tomorrow is nice, I'm really looking forward to the race.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“Overall, it was a satisfying day. In the Sprint, we showed that in free air we had good pace. It was clear after that we needed to qualify well, and if we did, we should be able to have a good race on Sunday. Q1 is always the most difficult one because everyone is so close together, you can be P6 or P18, and there's not much in it. Ollie did an amazing job, so much so that we cancelled our final run in Q1 and saved one new set of tyres for the rest of qualifying. Esteban had the tyres, but his performance wasn't there, so we really need to understand that - we need both cars to be able to fight in the Constructors' battle.

“In Q2, what can I say, Ollie's lap was sensational, and he essentially only needed that one lap to get into Q3. Then in the final stage of qualifying, I don't think we quite got our tyre preparation right, but I think from what everyone saw out there today, it's so sensitive, and I think the team has done a great job. The opportunity is there tomorrow as we start from a decent position and have good pace, I'm looking forward to it.”

Colapinto was the third car to get onto the kerb at Turn 2, pick up some water and spin off into retirement. The Argentine hit the barriers the hardest of the three cars, but was cleared by the Medical Centre. As for Gasly, he continued his strong form here, fighting hard and overtaking Stroll to grab the last point on offer. It was his first score since Silverstone.

The Frenchman impressed in Qualifying, too, making it all the way to Q3. He qualified ninth for the Grand Prix, as he chases more points. Colapinto exited in Q1, but was at least able to compete after his team did a good job to rebuild his car after his Sprint crash.

Pierre Gasly, Sprint: 8th, Qualifying: 9th, 1:10.002

“It's been a really good day with our first point since Spa in the Sprint Race this morning and then our first Q3 appearance since Silverstone in Qualifying in the afternoon. It's really pleasing to see we had the potential to be in the mix today which we will aim to take forwards to tomorrow for the main race. In the Sprint, I felt like I had a car which I could race with. I knew the point was close and I had to fight hard throughout and then go for it on Lance [Stroll] into Turn 1. It is just a point but it is a morale boost for everyone at the team. It's been difficult for us recently and we have some ideas on why we are competitive here but we really need to keep digging for some more answers. In Qualifying, we were only a few hundredths of a second to finishing in the top five. My last run definitely was not my strongest but, even so, we are starting inside the top ten and will aim to consolidate that tomorrow with the aim of another points scoring finish.”

Franco Colapinto, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 18th, 1:10.632

“First of all, a massive thank you to the team for repairing the car and getting me out in time for Qualifying. It was a great effort and I'm super grateful to them. We were running quite well in the Sprint in tricky conditions, but one of the cars ahead kicked up some water, which caught out a few cars and created a snowball effect. As soon as I touched the paint, I lost the car, which was a pity as we were having some nice battles and looked reasonably competitive. The car felt quite different to the one we had earlier in the weekend and generally I didn't feel as comfortable, and the performance wasn't there like we've seen at different stages of the weekend. Also well done to Pierre, who has been super strong this weekend. Getting a point in the Sprint and making Q3, it's a nice reward to the team for their hard work. Clearly there's pace in the car here, we just need to understand why we couldn't get the same feeling.”

Steve Nielsen, Managing Director

“Looking at how today unfolded, yes, we can be pleased with the result and how much more competitive we look here than in previous races. However, the other thing that really pleases me the most is how the team reacted to get Franco's car back out on track so quickly for Qualifying. A lot of their hard work goes unnoticed, and they kicked into gear immediately and basically did a full rebuild in the short gap between sessions, which not all teams managed to achieve. Kudos to them after what has been a long and tiring season, I know Franco was very grateful and went around thanking every team member. We know points have been hard to come by this season, so for Pierre to get a point in the Sprint and make it into Q3 is testament to how he's driving at the moment. With all the changes, Franco didn't feel as comfortable in the car, so we've got a bit of work to do overnight to see what improvements we can make.”

Kick Sauber's Sprint did not go to plan. First Hulkenberg spun out into the barriers at Turn 2 after getting on the kerb, narrowly missing hitting Piastri's McLaren. The German did limp back to the pits and the team did a great job to change his front and rear wing and get him back out after the red flag, but he had dropped to the back of the field. As for Bortoleto, he pulled off the racing line late on to try an overtake, lost immediate control and slammed into the barrier before bouncing across the track into the other barrier.

It was a big crash, and it was great to see the Brazilian walk away from it. But unfortunately, the team could not repair his car in time for Qualifying, and he was unable to compete over one lap on home soil. Hulkenberg flew the flag for the team and did well, making Q3 for the first time this season.

Nico Hulkenberg, Sprint: 15th, Qualifying: 10th, 1:10.039

“It's great to have made it to Q3 - for the first time this year - so that's definitely something to be pleased about. That said, it wasn't the easiest session. The wind made the car quite unpredictable and difficult to handle, and the balance was tricky throughout, which made it hard to really string the laps together. Still, we dug deep and got ourselves into the top ten, which is a solid result given the conditions. Earlier in the day, the Sprint had a disappointing outcome, but big credit to the team - they did a great job getting the car fixed and ready again in such a short amount of time. We've been working hard to improve the package, and it's encouraging to see progress. Tomorrow looks like it'll be a dry race, which could be a challenge, but we'll give it everything. There are some fast cars behind, so we'll need to be smart, stay clean, and try to capitalise on any opportunities. The target is always points, and we'll fight hard to bring some home.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, Sprint: DNF, Qualifying: 20th, No time set in Q1

""I was lucky and blessed to get away unharmed from my incident today; it was a huge crash, but I'm here standing on my own feet, and that shows not only how well these cars are built nowadays, but also the progress we have made through the years in terms of safety. I would like to thank our mechanics, who did everything they could to get me back on track for Qualifying. They worked super hard to rebuild my car from zero, and we almost made it in time. Obviously, I can't avoid being a bit disappointed not to have made it to quali at my first home Grand Prix – that's a shame, because I really feel like our car was competitive enough to build something this weekend, as shown by Nico making it into Q3. But there's still a race to do tomorrow. I just want to sit in the car, drive, give my best, and enjoy my time out there.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the incredible effort from the entire crew in the garage today. Following Nico's incident in the sprint race, they repaired his car during the red flag and then had to remove the gearbox to address another issue immediately afterward. On Gabi's side of the garage, the team gave it absolutely everything, building up a new chassis, engine, and gearbox in a very short window after his crash in the sprint. We are all extremely relieved that he was uninjured, a testament to pioneering work carried out by the FIA and teams on safety. Ultimately, everything needed to go perfectly for the car to be ready for qualifying and one small issue meant it didn't happen today, which was a shame for Gabi and the entire team after such an incredible effort.

“Looking at the positives, Nico had a smooth qualifying session and deservedly reached his first Q3 of the season, finishing P10. Considering the challenges we faced today, it is a very encouraging result, and I leave the circuit feeling proud of the team and optimistic about the race.""

Alonso was feisty off the line but could not quite hold Verstappen at bay. He nearly got the Dutchman at the restart, though, the duo going side by side before Alonso yielded. He then held up the Ferrari pair for lap after lap and looked set for a fantastic fifth before Leclerc finally snuck through, after the Spaniard was ordered to lift and coast. As for Stroll, he had a poor start and dropped to eighth – losing out to Gasly towards the end of the race, as he narrowly missed out on a point.

Qualifying did not go as well for the team as Sprint Qualifying had, with neither driver able to make it out of Q2. Alonso is at least in touching distance of the points in P11, but there is work to do for the team if they want to score more points tomorrow.

Fernando Alonso, Sprint: 6th, Qualifying: 11th, 1:10.001

""It was a bit of a mixed day for us. The Sprint went well this morning and we scored some good points. We were a little unlucky with the red flag when everyone changed to Mediums. Without that, I think we could have done even better. In Qualifying, it was more difficult because the Soft tyres didn't give me the confidence to really push. We are P11 though so we are in the fight for points tomorrow if we execute a clean race. Let's see what we can do.""

Lance Stroll, Sprint: 9th, Qualifying: 14th, 1:10.161

""We qualified in P14 today: Q1 was feeling okay, I managed to get a clean lap in at the end and the car balance was feeling good. In Q2 I struggled with grip and just wasn't feeling the level of grip that I had in Q1. We will have to look into it and understand why so we can fight back tomorrow. It's another day and hopefully some opportunities come up ahead of us so we can make up some positions.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""The short Interlagos layout always creates tight grids and close racing. Yesterday we executed the sessions well and scored three important points in the damp Sprint today. This afternoon's Qualifying session was exceptionally close with the entire grid covered by a second in Q1. Lance and Fernando progressed to Q2, but it was a tricky session, especially with the gusty conditions, and we were just a few hundredths shy of making Q3. The target tomorrow is to progress and compete for points. We will work hard tonight and take any opportunities in the race.""

The Sprint did not go to plan for Williams. Sainz was always in data collecting mode, after opting for a pit lane start having qualified P20. Hopefully he did manage to collect some information for the team, as they did not have much else to show for their efforts. Albon was running well on the cusp of the top 10, but unluckily picked up some debris from Bortoleto's spinning Kick Sauber, which dropped him to the back of the field.

The Grove-based team did not have a particularly strong Qualifying, either, Sainz continuing to struggle as he managed 15th on the grid. Albon was a few places higher in P12, but many of their rivals have cars starting in the top 10.

Alex Albon, Sprint: 17th, Qualifying: 12th, 1:10.053

""Overall, the Sprint wasn't great for us. We were not quite able to get points, so I didn't want to take unnecessary risks. Unfortunately, with the incident at the end, I picked up some damage from debris, and we had to work quickly to turn the car around before qualifying. We had to switch from our new floor back to an older one, which I think cost us some performance. I'm really glad Gabi [Bortoleto] is okay though; that was a big crash. Qualifying was then quite tricky. We made some good changes and I think we did make a step forward with the car, but you can't really see it. We still don't have the balance we're looking for, and that's causing us to hurt the tyres. We saw the same thing in the Sprint, so we need to look at that and understand our race pace better because it's so tight in the midfield right now.""

Carlos Sainz, Sprint: 14th, Qualifying: 15th, 1:10.472

""It's been tough to find performance in the car this weekend. We struggle in these types of longer corners and, even though we've been playing around a lot with setup, I haven't managed to find something I'm happy with and I've not been comfortable in the car. Tomorrow the pecking order is quite out of sync, so we'll see what we can do with strategy to try to get into the points. I'm always more optimistic for Sunday, so we'll keep fighting until the end.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""The long and short of it is we're not competitive enough here. We've seen that across two days and two qualifying sessions. It's a very close field but we're not at the sharp end of it. We've tried quite a few different setup directions between the two cars, but I don't think we found the sweet spot yet. Irrespective, this is a race that can throw up surprises, so we need to keep our noses clean on the opening laps and take every opportunity that comes towards us.""

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“The best track conditions that we saw at the end of yesterday were completely reset by the rain that fell overnight and this morning. So compared to yesterday, track evolution wasn't progressive.

""As a result, lap times today were slower not only than yesterday but also than the equivalent sessions last year. A contributory factor today was also the gusting wind, which was a real challenge in terms of car balance.

""In qualifying though, we finally got to see the performance gap between medium and soft, which was estimated at around two to three tenths of a second, in line with our simulations. That gap wasn't clear yesterday, also because of the reduced number of laps run on the softest tyre.

""Once more we head into a weekend where there's not going to be a lot of time difference between a one-stop and a two-stop strategy. If going for a one-stopper, the best choice would seem to be soft and medium: even though the difference is quite marginal due to the wear rates. The low track temperatures make it trickier to bring the hard tyre into the correct temperature window, and this compound is also more affected by a lack of grip from the surface here.

""Starting on the soft tyre, a reasonably early pit stop for the medium: roughly between laps 24 and 30. The rear wear rate seen on the C4 today is enough to have an impact on traction, so this requires careful management. It wouldn't have been a surprise to see drivers struggle with this in the sprint race this morning, had it not been for the red flag stoppage that allowed a switch to the medium.

""The two-stopper options tomorrow also include the softest compounds, starting with the C4 to gain an initial advantage, before moving to the C3 for the middle stint, and then leaving the choice between soft and medium open for the run to the flag.”

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris extended his strong performance in Sao Paulo as he pipped Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc to pole position.

Lando Norris surged to pole position in a remarkably close Qualifying hour in Sao Paulo, beating Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc in a thrilling session.

After taking victory in the earlier Sprint, the McLaren driver was in the best position to return to the top spot once again, but Haas rookie Ollie Bearman didn't make things easy for him as he put in multiple rapid lap times.

On the first runs in Q3, Norris locked up and found himself six-tenths adrift of his team mate Oscar Piastri, who led Charles Leclerc and Bearman at the top of the timesheets. But at the final opportunity, Norris leapt back up to P1, with Kimi Antonelli improving to P2 with the last lap of Qualifying.

Elsewhere, title contender Max Verstappen was unexpectedly knocked out in Q1 after struggling with a lack of grip. Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton also failed to progress to the top 10 and will start the Grand Prix from 13th on the grid.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Following a difficult Q1 exit in Saturday's Qualifying session, Max Verstappen is set to start the Sao Paulo Grand Prix from the pit lane.

Max Verstappen will start Sunday's Sao Paulo Grand Prix from the pit lane after Red Bull made sweeping changes to his car off the back of a disappointing Qualifying display.

Verstappen dramatically dropped out in the Q1 phase at Interlagos as his and Red Bull's Sprint weekend struggles worsened – the Dutchman complaining that he had “no grip” and had to “massively under-drive”.

With a long race ahead from P16 on the grid, Red Bull have elected to fit a new Honda power unit to Verstappen's RB21, as well as making various set-up changes under Parc Ferme conditions, triggering a move to the pit lane for lights out.

On Sunday morning, the FIA confirmed that a new Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), Turbocharger (TC), Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), Energy Store (ES) and Control Electronics (CE) have been fitted to Verstappen's car – exceeding his season allocations for all elements.

Haas' Esteban Ocon is another driver to have taken on a fresh ICE, similarly going beyond his allocation, while Verstappen also has a new Exhaust System (EX), but without exceeding the limit on that front.

“All the above listed PU elements were changed during Parc Ferme without the approval of the FIA Technical Delegate,” read a pre-race note from F1's governing body.

“Also changes have been made to the set-up of the suspension of car number 01 (Verstappen) without the approval of the FIA technical delegate.

“Therefore car numbers 01 and 31 (Ocon) should now be required to start the race from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 a) of the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations.”

Verstappen now faces an even bigger task in Sunday's race as he looks to remain in title contention, a year on from his remarkable recovery from P17 to victory in torrential rain.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris, Kimi Antonelli and George Russell report back on the Sprint from Sao Paulo.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes), 3. George Russell (Mercedes)

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by James Hinchcliffe)

Q: Lando, you said yesterday after qualifying, “If I could cruise to a victory, that would be beautiful.” It didn't really look like a cruise but just talk to us about how difficult it was to judge the grip in those first few laps.

Lando NORRIS: It was tough. Yeah, it was tough. I mean, it makes the win a little bit more rewarding when you have a race like this. Especially with Kimi here, he was certainly not making my life easy.

But it's one of those ones where you have to push because you know the guy behind is going to try and push a little bit more. But it was sketchy. I had a couple little lifts. Even with the wind, it was tricky. With the degradation on the tyres, it was difficult. So, yeah, definitely not an easy race, but probably the race you expect here in Brazil – always a difficult one.

Q: With the red flag and the tyre change, you were saying that the Softs maybe weren't actually the tyre to be on at the end. Whose decision was that to make the switch during the red?

LN: Who said that? I didn't say that.

Q: You didn't? Oh no. Sorry. Nobody said that. How were the tyres at the end?

LN: Yeah, I mean, it was a struggle. Of course, the Softs at the beginning, I expected them to be better. But the Mercedes were quick and Kimi kept me under pressure the whole race. So I just expected us to be a little bit better and we weren't. I don't know how much is down to the tyres or just that they did a good job and they were quick today. So, we've got some homework to do before quali.

Q: Fair enough. But Mercedes was very quick today. Second, Kimi Antonelli, congratulations. Just how much fun was that out there battling first with George on that restart and then pushing Lando for the win late?

Kimi ANTONELLI: Yeah, it was a very fun race. You know, it was very tricky conditions, especially at the beginning. But we tried to keep the pressure on Lando and, yeah, just came up short. But, you know, tyre deg was quite big and the wind was picking up during the race, so it was a struggle, but it was a fun race.

Q: It was a great result yesterday in qualifying. You said afterwards that if it wasn't for a little mistake, maybe in Turn 10, you could have fought for pole. After this result, knowing what you learned yesterday, how confident are you going into that GP qualifying?

KA: Oh definitely, you know, the confidence is high. But, you know, the field is so tight. At the end, yesterday was really hard to put the lap together and I believe everyone did a few little mistakes.

So we'll see today what we can do, but hopefully we can achieve the same result or even better.

Q: Alright. George, P3. I know it's only Sprint points, but you guys are locked in such a tight battle with Ferrari. With them struggling, both of you guys up here, how critical is it to capitalise on these opportunities for the Constructors'?

George RUSSELL: Yeah, I mean, it was a good race for us both. Kimi did a great job and obviously put Lando under a bit of pressure. And, yeah, P2, P3 was a really good result, but we need to try and do the same again this afternoon. Qualifying is so tight, and it's very difficult to overtake at the moment. So that's going to be key.

Q: Was there a bit of relief that it ended up being dry and not wet so you guys could learn a little bit more for the Grand Prix tomorrow?

GR: No, I mean, it's so different when you're doing the qualifying laps versus the consecutives. There's a lot of tyre degradation there. So at the end it was a bit difficult, and I think Lando was struggling. But no, we feel good. The temperatures are cool and we know that's how we like it. So let's see what we can do later.

Q: Alright. Lando, you said a little bit of homework to do before qualifying this afternoon. But are you confident that you and Oscar can both be fighting for pole?

LN: I'm confident we can do that. I think our quali pace was good, but the wind changed a lot today. The conditions are quite different. So today's different to yesterday. Tomorrow's going to be another day. But they're going to put us under pressure I'm sure. So, yeah, like they said, small gaps and you've got to do some perfect laps.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Lando, perfect start to the weekend for you, and you've extended your lead in the World Championship. Talk us through it. How hard was it to navigate those tricky conditions?

LN: Certainly a lot trickier than I would have liked. I mean, for both reasons. One, because the conditions were tough. The first lap going up the hill, knowing how much to lift, a couple of little moments, and then obviously Turn 1 braking always being pretty difficult and just not wanting to ever take too much of a risk. But, at the second point, just not being quite quick enough. In the second part of the race on the Softs, Kimi was quick. It was always like 1.2s down to 1. I made a bit of a mistake into Turn 4 on one of the laps. So, yeah, just didn't plan for it being quite as difficult as it was today, but we held on. Difficult for many reasons, but that's part of it.

Q: Lando, you held on. Yes, you did. Just talk us through the decision to swap to the soft.

LN: Will said, ""Do you want a soft?"" and I said, ""Yeah."" That was the decision.

Q: But were you concerned at all about the longevity of the tyre?

LN: Difficult because, obviously, we were already eight laps in by that point. So a third of the race was done. The others obviously started on the Soft in slightly wetter conditions, so their expectation was to get to the end of the race. Others, only what, four or five people on the Soft, they were expecting to get to the end of the race. So we thought it would be OK. But even in the first part when Kimi was on the Soft and we were on the Medium, I wasn't pulling away that much. The gap was pretty similar to what it was in the second part. So I think we just weren't quite quick enough, or as quick as what we would have liked. But, yeah, many things change – a bit cooler, the wind changed 180 degrees. So just understanding if the car was maybe not quite in the perfect position.

Q: Alright. Well, Lando, very well done to you. Thank you for that. Kimi, can we just talk through the decision to swap to the Medium tyre, first of all?

KA: Well, it was a bit like Lando. Bono said if I wanted to keep the tyre or not, and I said no, I'm going to switch to the Medium. The decision to go to the Soft at the start of the race was mainly because it was still quite wet. And, you know, despite the surface temp going up during the lap, with the wet part, they will cool down. So we were expecting the Soft to hold on until the end. We were also trying to have a little advantage in the first few laps. But then obviously with the red flag, we decided to go on the Medium because yesterday, to be honest, the Medium felt really good. So we decided to go on the Medium also because the track was basically fully dry and also to be able to give it a big push.

Q: How much did you fancy your chances of getting past Lando in those closing laps?

KA: Well, I tried. Obviously, when he did the mistake in four, I was very close. But it's always a bit hard to follow and especially with the wind changing, traction out of T10 and going down to T11 was very tricky. I couldn't really stay as close as I wanted there, but still, it was a fun race, and now we're focused on qualifying.

Q: The car looks very good here. Are you looking at a pole position car? Do you think you can win this race tomorrow?

KA: I mean, that's a bold statement. Of course, I want to win. That's the goal. The field is just very tight, and we saw yesterday in qualifying that we had a real shot to pole. So I think anything is possible. If we can improve the car even further, I think in quali we can have a good chance to be in top three, and then we can put on a fight in the race.

Q: Alright. Well done. Good luck with that. George, just coming to you, a very solid start to the weekend for Mercedes. How pleased are you with the pace of the car, first of all?

GR: Yeah, it was definitely a strong race. I think we obviously had a good qualifying yesterday, and we seemed to be sort of second best after the McLarens. I think the Medium tyre was the better of the two today. Kimi and I probably struggled a little bit at the beginning, but then it was good after the red flag. So, pretty pleased with that.

Q: If the Medium tyre was the better tyre, why did you start on the soft originally?

GR: Well, originally because it was a little bit damper. Obviously, it could potentially be a race tyre tomorrow as well, with the Medium, and we've only got one new Medium. So you're potentially thinking ahead to tomorrow as well, like, what's your back-up Medium tyre. But we had to swap at the red flag because we only had one Soft tyre, whereas the guys who were on the Medium had a new Soft tyre because they didn't start on the Soft. So it was easier for us to decide to go onto the Medium than it probably was for those starting on the Medium.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Jon Noble – The Race). To Lando and Kimi, and maybe George if he's got anything extra to say. On lap six, Lando, it appears you may have kind of started a sequence of events when you ran wide across the kerb at Turn 3 and pulled some water. How did that corner pan out for you during the race? Was it the first time you'd gone there, and was it a mistake to run across Turn 3? And Kimi, how did you view things from there? I think you said on the team radio that you felt Lando pulled the water back onto the kerb and track.

LN: Yeah, I mean, it's a kerb you always use in quali. We use it a lot. Obviously, when it's wet conditions like this, you kinda want to stay off all the kerbs. So I ran a little bit wide, and I saw the water come onto the track. But, yeah, that was it.
GR: A little bit like Mario Kart when you throw the banana out. Smartest guy on the grid, this guy!

KA: I think I saw Lando going wide and water came up and actually had a lot of water going into my visor. But I was just trying to stay away from kerbs during the whole race because it was very tricky, especially at the beginning. So especially when I saw him lifting water, I tried to take a bit more care just to avoid any spin or moments, because obviously, especially in the beginning the last sector and Sector 1, it was the wettest. And, yeah, it was really crucial to make it tidy in order to make it through as well.

Q: (Jake Boxall-Legge – Autosport) A question for all three, if possible. Obviously it rained overnight, then dried a little bit. Can you tell us a bit about the grip you experienced on the formation lap? And Lando, on that formation lap, you seemed to go quite quickly — you were in a bit of a hurry. Could you just explain that approach as well?

LN: I mean, I did a bit of both. I went quickly in parts because you want to try and get the temperature in. Also you don't want the people behind to get the temperature in. So I tried going pretty slow at the end of the lap, but Kimi went even slower. And he still gave himself some opportunities. In a race like this, it's all about trying to get as much tyre temp as you can, especially because I knew they were on the Softs. My only opportunity to probably stay ahead was to try and do the best job I could to get tyre temperature in. So I didn't think I went that quickly. I just went the speed I thought was correct.

KA: Yeah, I don't think he went that quick to be fair. I even had to pull the clutch at some point because he was stopped, and I wanted him to go away. It's a short track, and especially with the conditions today — it was still damp, especially in the beginning — you try to get as much temperature as possible. So when you stop on the grid, you're more or less in the right window for the start. It's always tricky because the guy in P1 in most cases in these conditions has a bit of a disadvantage, because the others can just take a gap and push a bit more. So, yeah, it's not easy, but you always try to get as much temperature as possible.

Q: (Maria Clara Castro – Car Magazine Brazil). Question to Kimi. Not bad at all for a first time racing here. Which parts of the track did you struggle with, and which parts do you feel good already?

KA: Well, today in the Sprint I was struggling a bit at the end of sector two, out of 10, 11, especially when I was close to Lando, just struggling to stay close. Overall, I felt good in Sector 1. In the Senna ‘S' I was able to be strong on braking. Also first part of Sector 2 I felt in a good place. Obviously today with the wind changing, all the corners are different, so it was all about trying to adapt the best way possible.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris, Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc report back after finishing in the top three in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

1. Lando NORRIS (McLaren), 2. Kimi ANTONELLI (Mercedes) , 3.  Charles LECLERC (Ferrari)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Romain Grosjean)

Q: Lando, congratulations. What a day for you. Not an easy day with the conditions, but congrats on that pole. How did it feel?

Lando NORRIS: Thank you. Again, tough out there with the conditions. Just slippery, inconsistent, but good fun. It's always a pleasure around this track, you know. I felt good. I was under a bit of pressure because I locked up on my first lap, so a little bit more stressful than what I would have liked but I stayed calm and put it all together when it mattered. So, very happy.

Q: It's an amazing track, as you know, and an amazing day for you. Just impressed by the momentum you're building right now in terms of speed and race craft.

LN: Yeah, thanks. Yes, I mean, we've been on very good form. The team are good at giving me a great car, of course. So, I've always got to thank the team, but I didn't make it easy for them or for myself then. I'm still having to push, Q3, run one, just locking up in Turn 1, it puts unnecessary pressure on myself, and the others are doing a good job. But I think when I'm in a good rhythm, when I can stay calm, when I can just put it all together, then I'll be on top.

Q: Kimi, talking of pressure on Lando, you're the man this weekend. Yesterday in Sprint Qualifying, this morning in the race, congrats on a good qualifying. What can you do to try to get one more spot?

Kimi ANTONELLI: Yeah, to be fair, I'm a bit annoyed I'm again behind him. I mean, we're so close this morning in the Sprint as well but it was a very tricky session with the wind. Very tricky to put a lap together but still managed in the last run to put a decent lap, and yeah, happy with that. Starting P2 tomorrow. Of course, they're very fast, so it's going to be important to get a good start and try to set a good pace.

Q: Charles, congrats on almost not making it out of Q1 to being third on the grid. How did you do that?

Charles LECLERC: I mean, very good laps in Q2 and in Q3. Everything is so close that it goes from being a disaster of a weekend to a really good weekend in a matter of a few hundredths. So, yeah, I'm happy I could put everything together in Q2 and Q3. That was crucial for us because it was very on the limit. And then P3, I'm satisfied with that. It's been a difficult weekend for us.

Q: Lando, last one for you. What's the game plan tomorrow? What have you learned from this morning that you can put into the race?

LN: I learned that they're pretty quick. And I learned that Kimi pushes all the way to the very end. So, in some ways looking forward to it, some ways I'm not. I think it's going to be a big challenge tomorrow. We have to see what the weather's going to do again, but so far this weekend's been clean. So, I'm hoping they don't ruin it.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Lando, what a final lap of Q3. The pressure was on, and you delivered.

LN: Yeah, thanks. It was for sure more stressful than I would have liked, especially because we've been very quick all weekend. Just didn't need that. I don't really know how it happened. I looked at the data after, quickly, between the two runs, and I braked earlier with less pressure, and still somehow locked up. So yeah, a bit weird. Maybe a bit of wind or something. But yeah, that certainly put a little bit more pressure on my final lap, and I saw the others improving — but not a lot. It was just difficult again, just with the track conditions, the wind, everything — hard to get a nice feeling out there. So again, I didn't know if I was up or down on my delta, so I was a bit stressed. But when I went over the line and saw the lap, I was pretty happy. And when I saw no one running quicker, even happier.

Q: How close to the perfect lap was that second run?

LN: You never know around here. My Turn 1 wasn't amazing. I think Kimi was purple in Sector 1 by a thousandth, so maybe a thousandth more there. There were little bits, but it's so difficult with the wind. Every lap, it changes — three kilometres per hour, four kilometres per hour, you don't really notice it probably when you're standing there, but it can easily make you go a tenth quicker in a corner or half a tenth here and there, and that can be a lot at the end of the day. That can be positions, it can be pole and not pole, those kinds of things. So, difficult. And sometimes you do the same thing — you repeat, like my Turn 1 — but you just make a mistake for no apparent reason, no obvious reason why, in the car. So yeah, difficult as it was for everyone today, but definitely not a perfect lap — but good enough.

Q: Lando, it's been a good day for you. You've won the Sprint. You were fastest in every segment of qualifying. How confident are you feeling in this car now?

LN: It depends. I mean, confident in what? I think in our race pace tomorrow — not the most I've had. I was certainly more confident in Mexico. I think after this morning, with the Mercedes pace and Kimi's pace, it certainly lowered my confidence level altogether. But we're still quick. We've still got that little advantage in qualifying, and I really hope that we can continue that into the race tomorrow. But the weather is going to change again — I think it's meant to be even colder, which might suit them even more. And the wind is meant to change also. So it's difficult. Every track is so different. The feeling I have on one track is different to the next and those kinds of things. But I just feel like I'm doing a good job. I'm driving well. Before, earlier in the season, I would just have weaknesses, and I feel like I've, let's say, I've maybe still got some here and there, but I've lessened them, they're not like one tenth now — it's two hundredths. So when I can put together the good parts and have those not-so-bad parts, things go very well.

Q: Pirelli have brought harder dry compounds to this race this year. Do you think it'll be a complicated strategic race tomorrow if it's dry?

LN: We'll have to wait and see. That's what tonight's for, honestly. I don't look too much into strategy until Saturday night. So, we'll see. I think everyone has the same in common. The Soft certainly doesn't feel like, you know, a Medium-to-Soft step. The Soft certainly doesn't handle like what the Medium did last year. So it's interesting. There are still some differences, and again, conditions can change everything. So we'll just do, as always, our work tonight and prepare the best way possible.

Q: Lando, very well done. Thank you for that. Kimi, many congratulations. Another day, another front-row start for you here at Interlagos. Just how good was the session and that final lap of Q3?

KA: Yeah, it was a very tricky session. To be honest the wind was not the best today — it was a bit more of a pain in the ass around the lap, to be fair. But still, the last lap in Q3 was quite decent. I locked up a little bit the rear in the last corner, but despite that little mistake, I don't think it would have been — Lando would have still been fastest. So yeah, just not the perfect lap, but still good for P2 and we have a good opportunity tomorrow.

Q: Can we talk about tomorrow? You put pressure on Lando at the end of the Sprint today. Just how confident are you going into the 71 laps tomorrow?

KA: Yeah, definitely. The pace this morning was really strong. It was also quite cold and tomorrow should be kind of the same. So maybe that can help us a little bit more. But, you know, running in dirty air is never easy. Hopefully, we can have a strong pace and put pressure on them and hopefully we can fight for the win.

Q: You say running in dirty air is not easy. So is it all about the start tomorrow?

KA: Well, we've seen many races so far this season that the start and track position can play a massive role for the rest of the race. Of course, Lando has been starting very strong recently, so we need something exceptional. But on my side, I just try to do a normal start, not try to do too much, and then at least hold position. Then we'll see from there.

Q: Very well done. Good luck with that and thank you, Kimi. And Charles, let's come to you now. It feels like Ferrari have done a bit of a turnaround this weekend. Just how much better was the car in qualifying today compared to Sprint Qualifying yesterday?

CL: I don't want to over-exaggerate the turnaround that we've had, because we're only speaking about a tenth and a half maybe. But the thing is that this weekend, a tenth and a half means out of Q1 or inside Q3. I think where we did a really good job is by executing everything perfectly from Q1 to Q3, because we knew that we were… I mean, it's been a very difficult weekend since FP1, and we knew that we would struggle to get to Q2 and then Q3. But we did everything perfect. So I'm very happy about that. We changed the car a little bit from this morning, and that helped us to do a step forward as well. So yeah, altogether, to start P3 — I think we should be really satisfied with that because I don't think anybody of us expected that after such a difficult beginning of the weekend.

Q: Charles, this is your third consecutive top-three start. Do you feel like you're getting some consistency with this car now?

CL: I felt it in Austin and Mexico. Maybe this weekend a little bit less. This weekend has been a very, very challenging weekend, and I think that hides a little bit the struggles that we've had this weekend. But in race pace, we seem to be pretty strong. We were stuck behind Fernando, but I think the pace was pretty good on the one lap I had in clear air. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

Q: Well, you've never finished on the podium here at Interlagos. Do you think this is your best opportunity yet?

CL: I've had years where the car felt a little bit better than this year. But we're starting in a good position, so yeah, if we manage to stay P3 or P2 or P1 after the start, then that will help us.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Fred Ferret – l'Equipe) Question to Lando and Kimi. How much did you change the car between the Sprint race and qualifying?

KA: So much. We went also to Monza — no, I'm joking. To be honest, we didn't change it, if I have to be fair, because tomorrow the way the wind is going to change again — it's going to go back to what it was on Friday. So, yeah, to be fair, we didn't change anything.
LN: They didn't need to, because they were quicker. We changed a good amount, I would say. I don't know what is a lot and what is not nowadays, you know, but like, we never change that much — you're talking a little bit of ride height, a little bit of roll bars or something. So you're talking always quite small, but let's say probably more than I think we've changed in the past between a Friday-Saturday Sprint weekend.

Q: (Ticiano Figueiredo – Diário do Rio Claro) Two questions. First one to Kimi — we spoke in Miami during the remembrance of Ayrton's passing. Now we are speaking again here in Brazil. How do you feel about what has happened here — the Brazilian crowd, along with Gabriel's supporters, is cheering with every lap you turn. Does this moment carry something special for your career? And how are you managing the emotional side of racing in Ayrton's homeland? Then to Charles and Lando — you're right here, and you see someone who, just like you both years ago, was seen as the future of Formula 1. Today, you both are great leaders. You're not the future, you're the present. What advice would you both give to him? Lando, what advice can you give him on the first corner?

KA: To stay behind, probably!

Q: Let's just start with Kimi and the Brazilian crowd.

KA: Yeah, I mean, racing in Brazil has been incredible so far. The support has been incredible from the Brazilian fans and definitely that gave me a little bit of extra energy every time I go on track. It's been amazing. Also this track, to be honest, it's really special, really fun to drive, and yeah, I'm happy with it. Now we're looking forward to tomorrow's race because it would be good to finish the weekend on a high and bring home good points.

Q: Okay. And Lando and Charles — advice?

LN: None. Yeah, sometimes it's good to not take risks, and sometimes it's just good to play it safe, bank some good points, and defend to everyone else behind you. Yeah. I've always got told you have to be nice to people older than you, so Kimi — be nice.

KA: OK.

LN: And what else? I don't know. I guess everyone is unique in the way they think, but you've got to find your own way. It's the same as me for the last few years. A lot of people tell you: you've got to be like this, you have to do that, you need to think like this, that's wrong, this is right. No one's right when it comes to those things. It's always good to listen to people, to take advice, but at the end of the day you've only got to listen really to the people around you that you trust and who trust you. And yeah, find your own way of doing things and not think, “This guy did it three years ago or 20 years ago, that's how I've got to do it,” because it's not how it works.

CL: Yeah, I mean, nothing to add. I agree 100% with Lando. I think everybody has their weaknesses, their strengths, and you've got to work around them. Be honest with yourself. But if anything today, I think it's Kimi who has to give me advice, because he will be starting in front of me tomorrow. So, not much to add.

Q: (Jake Boxall-Legge – Autosport) This one's to Kimi, please. Kimi, this is a little bit more of a boring question. George did his final lap on the Medium tyre there — was this something that you were reasonably tempted to try? Was there something about the Mercedes package overall that was not perhaps blending with the Soft so well, or were you absolutely fine on that run? Thank you.

KA: No, we definitely thought about putting the Medium in qualifying because even yesterday, the Medium felt basically the same as the Soft. The jump from Medium to Soft was very little. Also today in the Sprint, the Medium felt better than the Soft — even in the first few laps, the grip just felt better, the tyre felt more robust, especially throughout the whole lap. So definitely, we had a thought about it because we thought that there was not much of a gap. But I thought as well that because I felt good on the Soft, I thought it would be better to keep it for tomorrow. Obviously, we have the new tyres, so that's good — especially for the start. So I think that was the right choice in the end.

Q: (Maria Clara Castro – Car Magazine Brazil) Question to Kimi. We're all talking about how important tomorrow's race is, especially for Lando, regarding Drivers' Championship-wise.
But in terms of Constructors' — I mean, apart from McLaren, of course — but with the Ferrari and Mercedes fight, it's an amazing opportunity for Mercedes. We could see today how much you were looking for a great result in qualifying — especially with Toto's reaction. Yeah, he was like “what?!” after your lap. And, I mean, we've got Charles right in the front, Lewis back. Could you please expand more on how much you're looking forward, regarding the meaning of this race — especially having in mind that Las Vegas is a race where it's expected Mercedes could have good performance. So maybe it's an opportunity for you guys to have good results in two rounds straight?

KA: Well, the funny thing is that in all the tracks where we were meant to be good this year, we were not so good. And in the tracks where we weren't expected to be good, we were good. So it's unexpected. You see, there's some weekends where the VCARB or the Haas, they're extremely quick, so you never know. But of course in Vegas, with the cold temperature, definitely it should help the car. We saw also this year that usually with cold temperature the car behaves better than with hot temperature. So hopefully, we can have the same pace in Vegas. Definitely as a team, we'll try to do everything that they did last year in order to have a better opportunity to achieve the same performance somehow. Tomorrow, yeah, definitely it's a massive opportunity. I think it's going to be important to try and finish ahead of the Ferrari, to outscore them, because obviously the fight is very tight. And also, on Red Bull we can score big, big points. So definitely that's the goal. That's why tomorrow is going to be important to set a good pace, to try and put pressure — but at the same time, to try and achieve the best result possible that is possible in the moment. So definitely a massive opportunity, and that's why as a team we'll try to do our best in order to do so

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lewis Hamilton's connection with Brazil extends far beyond the racetrack. From idolising Ayrton Senna to earning honorary citizenship, his relationship with the country and its fans is both personal and enduring.

As the 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix beckons, the paddock makes its annual pilgrimage to Interlagos – the undulating and unpredictable amphitheatre of passion that has shaped Formula 1 legends ever since it first arrived on the calendar. For many drivers it's another stop on a globe-trotting schedule, but for Lewis Hamilton Brazil is far more than that.

It's a place woven into the fabric of his story – a country that gave him his first hero, some of his defining moments, and, eventually, a second home. The relationship has grown and deepened over time, with the seven-time World Champion also an honorary Brazilian citizen. Here's why Hamilton's love affair with Brazil – and Brazil's with him – is one of F1's great modern romances...

Before the titles and records, and before Lewis Hamilton had even stepped into the cockpit of an F1 car, there was Ayrton Senna. Hamilton has said countless times that the Brazilian icon has always been his guiding star – even from childhood.

What initially drew Hamilton to Senna wasn't just his success, but his spirit. Speaking to Motorsport Magazine about his enduring admiration, Hamilton reflected that Senna was “such a fighter…never one to drive half-heartedly. He was always chasing perfection – a warrior, and that's what I loved about him.”

To the young Briton, Senna wasn't simply a racing idol; he embodied the very ideals Hamilton aspired to, including courage, authenticity, and an almost spiritual pursuit of excellence. It's little wonder, then, that Hamilton grew up emulating his hero whenever possible – adopting the famous yellow and green helmet, the bold racing style, even the sense of moral purpose behind the wheel.

So, when he finally arrived in Brazil as a fully-fledged F1 driver, an invisible thread already tied him to the place. Through Senna's legacy, he'd long fallen in love with the country.

For Hamilton, Brazil's magic has always been about more than motorsport. “The thing I love the most in Brazil is people, energy,” he told Elle Men Brasil in 2024. “When I finally came here, I felt the energy. It's a very diverse country, which I love. I feel at home.”

Every November, when he returns to Sao Paulo, that welcome home feels as genuine as ever, with grandstands alive with colour, flags waving, and an affection that entirely transcends borders. And the love runs both ways. For Brazilian fans, Hamilton represents the values they hold dear; flair, determination, and a refusal to give anything less than everything – something they experienced in abundance from Senna.

Because of this, the fans see in Hamilton a modern echo of Senna's fearlessness – a racer who drives with both soul and precision. That authenticity has earned him both admiration and adoration from thousands of motorsport fans in the country.

Over the years, Hamilton has immersed himself in the country's culture, embracing its music, its people, and its joy. He counts several Brazilian sporting icons among his friends – including football star Neymar Jr and multi-world champion surfer Gabriel Medina – and he often speaks with affection about the friendships he's built there.

Every great sporting relationship needs a stage, and for Hamilton and Brazil that is Interlagos. Few circuits in the sport carry as much emotion as this tight and twisting ribbon as this track on the outskirts of Sao Paulo.

There have been plenty of highlights, including his 2021 drive over an eventful Sprint weekend. It was a performance that has gone down in history as one of his greatest ever weekends of driving.

Hamilton set the fastest time in Qualifying on Friday, only to be disqualified for a technical infringement. Undeterred, he started the Sprint from P20 and surged to fifth in just 24 laps of racing – a charge that left the grandstands in total awe. A further grid penalty dropped him to 10th for Sunday's Grand Prix, but yet again he carved through the field, sweeping past title rival Max Verstappen to win in commanding fashion.

After crossing the line, Hamilton emulated his childhood hero by lifting the Brazilian flag high from the cockpit just as Senna had done after his first home victory in 1991. “I was so proud to hold that flag,” he recalled later. “Growing up I'd always loved Ayrton; I'd watch him when he carried a flag. When I saw a marshal holding one, I had to stop and grab it.”

It was, he said, a way to thank the nation that had inspired him since boyhood, a gesture of love and gratitude: “I was hoping I could lift up the nation in some way, even though I wasn't from Brazil – except now, I am Brazilian.”

Hamilton's special bond with Brazil became immortalised in 2022, when he was made an honorary citizen. In a ceremony at the Chamber of Deputies in Brasilia, it's an honour usually reserved for statesmen, artists and national icons. In a way, this was simply a formal acknowledgement of a connection decades in the making for Hamilton, as he declared it to be “the greatest honour for me to be here receiving and accepting this citizenship. I really do feel like now I'm one of you, finally.”

Unsurprisingly, he dedicated the honour to the man that started it all for him – Ayrton Senna. “I really want to dedicate this to Ayrton, his family, his friends and his fans,” he said, acknowledging the inspiration that has shaped his life and career.

“Through his eyes, I was able to see just how passionate Brazilians were, and how deep it goes, the love and passion you have for your country, and how beautiful it is. I'm so excited to spend some more time here.”

It was official confirmation of what fans at Interlagos had already decided years earlier: Lewis Hamilton belongs here.

The connection between Hamilton and Brazil is not strictly about what happens on track and the mutual admiration. It's increasingly about the wider message and legacy of the relationship.

In his citizenship speech, Hamilton said he felt inspired by the resilience in Brazil and by the many people “fighting for the same thing”, whilst stressing a commitment to “push for change and diversity” in the country.

That's a reflection of his growing role as a global voice for diversity, equality and positive change. His alignment with Senna's legacy, his embracing of the Brazilian fan base, and his public commentary all deepen that bond tenfold.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Oscar Piastri crashed out of the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix after six laps, with the McLaren driver subsequently losing ground to team mate Lando Norris in the championship standings.

Oscar Piastri has given his take on the crash that put him out of the Sprint at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the Australian labelling the incident a “silly mistake”.

After making a clean start from P3 on the grid, Piastri was still in third place on Lap 6 when he appeared to take too much kerb – with parts of the track remaining damp following rainfall earlier in the day – which sent him into the barriers at Turn 3.

This was followed by two further crashes at the same corner for Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and the Alpine of Franco Colapinto just moments later. And while Hulkenberg was able to continue on back to the pits, Colapinto joined Piastri in finding himself out of the race.

The red flags were thrown after the incidents while Piastri's McLaren team mate Lando Norris went on to take victory when the action resumed, meaning that the Briton has extended his championship lead over Piastri to nine points.

Sharing his reflections on what happened, Piastri explained: “I just dipped a wheel on the white line of the kerb and around I went.

“A silly mistake really, an unfortunate mistake, so that's it.”

Speaking separately to Sky Sports F1, the 24-year-old added that his focus ahead of Qualifying later on Saturday would be to “try to put this behind [me]”.

""There's a lot more points on offer tomorrow, so the better job I can do in Qualifying to get a good starting spot, the better it will be,” he explained.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris beat Kimi Antonelli to claim his first Sprint pole of the season at Interlagos, edging out a 0.097s advantage over the Mercedes driver.

Lando Norris continued his remarkable run of form to take pole position for the Sprint in Sao Paulo, beating Kimi Antonelli and his McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri to the honour.

The Briton was dominant on his journey to the top spot, finishing P1 in the sole practice session as well as in Sprint Qualifying, ending the day with a time of 1m 09.243s.

None of his competitors were able to improve upon his lap, with Antonelli being the closest challenger as Mercedes looked strong on the mandated soft tyres in SQ3.

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Leclerc out and Piastri up to P2 after dramatic restart

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Bortoleto crashes out of his home race on Lap 1

Lando Norris pipped Kimi Antonelli to the top spot in Qualifying for both the Sprint and Grand Prix in Sao Paulo.

Lando Norris put together an impressive lap to edge out Kimi Antonelli and Charles Leclerc for pole position in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

The McLaren driver still has the greatest challenge of the 71-lap race to tackle, but the weekend has been a success story for him so far, having taken pole and victory for the Sprint, followed by the top spot in Qualifying.

Norris bounced back from a lock-up in Q3 that initially relegated him to P10, charging ahead on his final attempt to clock a time of 1m 09.511s and leave Antonelli 0.174s adrift.

Jack said he spoke with Meg ""the other day"" in the heartfelt words he shared Saturday (Nov. 8).

	Meg White missed the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, which honored the the White Stripes — her iconic duo with Jack White — at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles Saturday night (Nov. 8). But the bookends of Jack's speech were all about Meg, who'd edited most of it.

	“I spoke with Meg the other day,” he said at the podium, sharing, “She wanted me to tell you she's very grateful to all the folks who supported her through all the years. It really means a lot to her tonight.”

	“She checked it for me,” he added of the speech he was about to give on behalf of the pair. “A lot of punctuation corrections, too.”


	Though White's emotion was palpable throughout the speech, it was most felt in the poem he brought to the room, one that he said he was going to send to Meg ahead of time but hadn't.


	Instead, he noted, “I thought I'd read it to you all tonight.”




	“One time, a girl climbed a tree, and in that tree was a boy — her brother, she thought. And the tree looked so glorious and beautiful, but it was just an oak tree. And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float, one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. And the boy looked at this giant peppermint on wheels and felt pride. Pride that it was produced in the Motor City just like in the big factories, but it was just in their garage.


	He looked at the girl, his sister, he thought, and like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let's put on a show.' And they paraded this float through the Cass Corridor, standing atop the Peppermint, pulled by white horses or maybe it was a red Econoline van. And many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. 


	And some of those people cheered and some laughed and some even threw stones. And with their bare hands, the two started to clap and sing and make up songs. And some people kept watching and swaying and moving, and then one person even smiled. And the boy and the girl looked at each other, and they also smiled.


	And they felt, they both felt the sin of pride, but they kept on smiling, smiling from a new freedom, knowing that they had shared and made another person feel something. And they thought the person smiling at them was a stranger, someone they didn't even know. But it wasn't just a stranger, it was God.”


	Jack and Meg released six studio albums, including the Grammy-winning Icky Thump, together as the White Stripes before parting ways in 2011. Meg now stays out of the spotlight.

	











	Following Jack's speech, Olivia Rodrigo and Feist performed a sweet duet of the band's “We're Going to Be Friends” (2002) and 21 Pilots took on “Seven Nation Army” (2003), in tribute to the honorees.


	Rodrigo's been vocal about the White Stripes being her favorite band: “I was so obsessed with Jack White's guitar, and I made my mom take me to guitar lessons so I could learn how to play all of his songs,” she said in a 2021 interview. “Fell in Love With a Girl” was one of the first songs she learned to play. Rodrigo first met her hero in 2022.


	The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony honored the White Stripes as well as Bad Company, Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, OutKast and Soundgarden in the performer category; Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon for musical influence; Thom Bell, Nicky Hopkins and Carol Kaye for musical excellence, and Lenny Waronker with the Ahmet Ertegun Award.

Soundgarden were officially inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday (Nov. 8), with actor-comedian Jim Carrey leading the tribute in a heartfelt, deeply personal speech that recalled his first experience seeing the grunge pioneers perform live.

	The comedian told the audience at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles that he met the band in 1996 while hosting Saturday Night Live, where he personally requested Soundgarden as the musical guest.

	“By then, the lineup was Chris [Cornell], Kim Thayil, Matt Cameron on drums, and Ben Shepherd on base. They launched into the dark, epic beauty of ‘Pretty Noose,'” Carrey explained.

	











	“I stood right in front of them, letting the waves of electricity wash over me, like an audio baptism. They pushed me under and when I came up I was free.”


	Carrey revealed that after the show, the band gifted him one of his most prized possessions: a Fender Telecaster signed by all four members, including late frontman Chris Cornell.




	Cornell's eldest daughter Lily took the stage following a video tribute to her father, delivering a touching speech and acknowledging her mother and Cornell's former wife, Susan Silver, who once managed Soundgarden.


	The surviving members of Soundgarden — Matt Cameron, Kim Thayil, Ben Shepherd, and founding bassist Hiro Yamamoto — were present for the induction. Yamamoto, who reunited with the band for the occasion, referenced his family's internment during World War II: “That affected my life greatly,” he said. “And it really echoes strongly today. Let's not add another story like this to our history.”


	Kim Thayil reflected on Cornell's creative leadership, stating, “If one of us ever hesitated in sharing an idea, Chris would be the first to say, ‘Let's just try it out and see.' I miss him. I love him, and I love all my [Soundgarden] brothers.”


	The performance portion of the night featured Taylor Momsen (of The Pretty Reckless) fronting Soundgarden for “Rusty Cage” and Brandi Carlile joining them for “Black Hole Sun.” The ceremony concluded with Chris Cornell's younger daughter, Toni, performing “Fell on Black Days” alongside Nancy Wilson.


	The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees also included OutKast, Bad Company, Cyndi Lauper, The White Stripes, Chubby Checker, and Joe Cocker. The event streamed live on Disney+ and will be available on-demand.

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Updated: Exceeding expectations, 20th Century Studios/Disney's Predator: Badlands slayed it this weekend with an $80M global opening. Of that, $40M is from the international box office, making for an even split with domestic. The film also pushed The Walt Disney Studios across the $4B worldwide mark for 2025 ($4.07B), the fourth consecutive year the studio has crossed that threshold.


	The Dan Trachtenberg-directed latest Predator installment hunted down the strongest worldwide debut in the franchise's nearly 40-year history, at current rates, surpassing 2018's Predator ($73.5M).

	Overseas, this is the 2nd biggest opening of the franchise, only behind Predator ($48.9M). When excluding China from that total, Badlands claims the No. 1 offshore start in the series.




			Watch on Deadline		







	This is the first theatrical Predator film released since Disney's acquisition of Fox, and its performance is great news for the industry at large given the recent funk and challenging global landscape, as it jumpstarts the rolling business that's expected throughout the rest of the year.


	The $40M overseas bow is just slightly ahead of where we had it coming into the weekend. Badlands overperformed pretty much everywhere and had great momentum in markets like Korea where it held No. 1 from Wed-Sun. Strong word of mouth and critical reactions helped drive business. 


	Overall internationally, where the Trachtenberg, Ben Rosenblatt and John Davis production opened across all markets, the film had top starts everywhere; either No. 1 (including UK, Spain, Australia, China, Korea and Mexico) or No. 1 non-local (ie France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Brazil). In the UK, Netherlands, Korea, Taiwan, India, Brazil and several smaller markets it had the best launch ever for a Predator title. And in China, Predator: Badlands is the first studio movie to open at No. 1 since Jurassic World Rebirth way back in July.


	In China, Maoyan consistently increased its final box office projection over the past few days, now landing at $14M. While Predator: Badlands has runway ahead in other markets, China finally gets Demon Slayer this coming Friday – that movie having already done about $13M in pre-sales there.

	











	The Top 5 Predator: Badlands markets at launch are: China ($7.4M), UK ($3.2M), Mexico ($2.3M), France ($1.8M) and Japan ($1.7M).


	In Imax, the Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi/Elle Fanning-starrer delivered a $10.8M global debut.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


	The BBC is planning to apologize after being accused of selectively editing Donald Trump‘s January 6 speech to make it appear as if the president was encouraging the 2021 Capitol riot.


	On Monday, chair Samir Shah will write to UK Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee to admit that a 2024 BBC Panorama film should not have altered Trump's speech in the way it did. The change was attacked as “dishonest” by the White House.


	Shah is expected to tell lawmakers that the BBC has reviewed the Trump edit again in light of audience complaints in recent days, Deadline understands. Shah is expected to acknowledge that Panorama could have been clearer that Trump's speech was changed, but he will say there was no intention to mislead viewers.

					Olivia Rodrigo Slams Donald Trump's DHS: ""Don't Ever Use My Songs To Promote Your Racist, Hateful Propaganda""		
			








The Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph first reported on Shah's planned apology, which comes after a week of headlines about the Trump edit and the BBC's reporting on Gaza and transgender rights.


	The concerns originated in an excoriating leaked memo attacking BBC News output. Obtained by The Daily Telegraph, the document was penned by Michael Prescott, who was an external adviser to the BBC board's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee until June.


Lisa Nandy, the UK culture secretary, became the latest voice of disapproval. Appearing on BBC show Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Nandy said the edit was “incredibly serious.” 


	Nandy said she had held “too many” conversations with BBC leaders over the past year regarding editorial standards. The Labour minister said she was confident Shah and BBC director general Tim Davie were gripping the Trump matter, but she questioned why issues keep occurring.  


	“What tends to happen at the BBC is that decisions about editorial standards, editorial guidelines, the sort of language that is used in reporting, is entirely inconsistent,” she said. “It doesn't always meet the highest standards. It's not always well thought through, and often it's left to individual journalists or news readers to make decisions.”

	











	The Trump edit, which was made in October Films-produced Trump: A Second Chance?, prompted fury in the White House, though the president himself has yet to publicly remark on the issue.


	Karoline Leavitt, Trump's press secretary, told the Telegraph newspaper: “This purposefully dishonest, selectively edited clip by the BBC is further evidence that they are total, 100% fake news that should no longer be worth the time on the television screens of the great people of the United Kingdom.”


	Shah's apology will be the first time a senior BBC figure speaks out on the issue, though Deadline revealed that BBC News CEO Deborah Turness emailed staff admitting it had been a “difficult” week.


	The incident is awkward for Shah, Davie, and Turness because they sit on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, where Prescott originally raised his concerns months ago. They did not consider the matter serious enough to correct the Panorama documentary, meaning three of the corporation's most senior figures are complicit in the inaction.


	In the Panorama documentary, Trump appears to say: “We're gonna walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.”


	He actually said: “We're gonna walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're gonna walk down, we're gonna walk down any one you want but I think right here, we're gonna walk down to the Capitol and we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen.”


	Some 54 minutes later, when Trump was talking about the U.S. election being “corrupt,” he said: “Something's wrong here, something's really wrong, can't have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.”


	Nick Robinson, the seasoned presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today show, referenced the story live on-air on Saturday, telling listeners: “It's clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organisation … Both things are happening at the same time.”

BBC being leaned on yet again by a weak government sucking up to the far right. For all the talk about the Beeb being woke, Tim Davie boasted of his right wing credentials by cancelling satire shows for being too left wing, pulling all shows critical of Israel's conduct of the Gaza ‘war' and openly stating he was trying to appeal to Reform, who get more unchallenged air time than all the other parties combined.

lying liar who lies and lies…

great – now the world's leading public service broadcaster is bending the knee to the wannabe fascist dictator.

Uh, he did in fact encourage the Jan 6 attack on the capitol so not sure what the issue is

“Peacefully and patriotically” mean anything to you?

“Fight like hell” 

Remember?

Oh, no mention of nearly 300 plainclothed FBI agents being part of the crowd or a Capitol Police Officer laying pipe bombs near the RNC building? Wow, how curious.

Wait till you find out who have been the bad guys for the last ten years.

You know Trump was still president on Jan 6, right? Who ordered the FBI to send agents? Trump appointed FBI director Chris Ray?

nice try

We know already.

	After wrapping Season 13 of the Canadian mockumentary in August, Mike Smith is stepping back from Trailer Park Boys amid a sexual assault lawsuit against him.


	The group behind the Netflix comedy noted that they take “such matters seriously” and that Smith has “stepped away” from his role as Trailer Park Boys Inc.'s managing director after he was charged early last month over an alleged incident that happened in 2017.


	“We are aware of the allegation concerning Mike Smith dating back to 2017 and take such matters seriously,” said Trailer Park Boys Inc. in a statement to multiple outlets. “We recognize how difficult an allegation of this nature is for all involved.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	They added, “Out of respect for the legal process, we will not comment further on the case. At this time, Mike has stepped away from his role at Trailer Park Boys Incorporated and Gary Howsam has assumed managing director responsibilities.”


	Filed in Nova Scotia provincial court, Smith was charged on Oct. 2 for an alleged assault that took place on Dec. 30, 2017 in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, according to CBC News.


	Created by Mike Clattenburg, Smith has starred on Trailer Park Boys as Bubbles since the show premiered in 2001, alongside Rob Wells' Ricky and John Paul Tremblay as Julian. After initially ending a seven-season run in 2007, Netflix revived the show in 2014.


	In August, Deadline exclusively reported that Season 13 had wrapped in Nova Scotia, following a nearly eight-year gap since Season 12 premiered.

Political Editor


	James Austin Johnson's Donald Trump returned to the Saturday Night Live cold open, this time in a spoof of the moment this week when a man collapsed in the Oval Office during a press conference on lowering the cost of weight-loss drugs. Watch it above.


	In the skit, Trump ignores the man and even walks over his legs as Dr. Mehmet Oz and others try to assist him. Earlier this week, a Getty Images photo went viral showing the president, at the Resolute Desk, stone faced and not paying any attention to the collapsed man being treated on the floor next to him.


	The opener was just a way in to this week's off-year elections, as Democrats trounced GOP candidates in what was seen as a rebuke of Trump, what with prices continuing to rise. Some pundits predicted that there would be a White House course correction, given the president's focus on foreign affairs and trade deals, as well as renovating the White House and the Kennedy Center. But later in the week, Trump said that he didn't “want to hear about the affordability.”

	In the opener, Johnson's Trump said: “I promised grocery prices would plummet, and they did. They plummeted straight up. And people are now saying, ‘But sir, how will I afford my Thanksgiving turkey for my family? Well, the good news is your family is not coming because all the planes are gone. We call that problem solving problem. Killing two birds with another bird. Now you got a bunch of crazy birds.”

	











	Johnson's Trump added: “That's kind of our thing. Can't afford food. Have some cheap Ozempic. Now you are not hungry and you get to take one, weird, painful poop a week.”


	Because of the ongoing shutdown, the administration has announced that it would not fully pay for food and nutrition benefits with emergency funds. Late this week came another disruption: flights being canceled at airports as air traffic controllers go without pay during the government blackout.

	“The government is still shut down, all thanks to the Democrats and some Republicans and all Republicans, and me,” Trump said. “People say, ‘Just cave, Don. Give the Democrats what they want and end this.' But I think we're going to drag it out. We're going to keep the government shut down. And while we're at it, we're looking at perhaps stealing Christmas. We'll be doing Grinch. I like the Grinch. He's a great guy. You know, our wives are friends. We play golf sometimes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Luigi Mangione a ‘model prisoner' in notorious Brooklyn lockup: source","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/08/society/luigi-mangione-well-liked-as-model-prisoner/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

After a sketchy, unverified image showing accused assassin Luigi Mangione happily hanging with a group of inmates at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn was released — sources tell Page Six that Mangione is indeed a “model prisoner” who's mentoring other inmates.

“Yes, he's a model prisoner,” said a source familiar with the infamous facility. “That's the word from the prison, and people [who] float in and out of the MDC . . . is that, you know, he's well-liked.”

The source elaborated of the University of Pennsylvania alum, 27, who's accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in cold blood in Midtown, has “been very helpful. Helpful to other new arrivals to get acclimated. He's in general population, and he's just been very helpful [to prisoners] to stay out of trouble. He follows all the rules.”

The legal source said he knows of another inmate who “got in trouble the other day because his shirt wasn't tucked in properly for [their] prison uniform, so the rules are sometimes pretty strict. Luigi is a very big rule follower.”

Mangione had help learning the jailhouse ropes from prison consultant Craig Rothfeld, whose clients have included fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere.

The MDC has hosted a cavalcade of famous criminals, often as they await trial, including Diddy, crypto dude Sam Bankman-Fried, R. Kelly, Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, pharma bro Martin Shkreli and Donald Trump friend turned foe Michael Cohen.

Weinstein's lawyer, appeals ace Arthur Aidala, tells Page Six that Mangione will face worse conditions after his federal trial — when he's transferred to Rikers Island to await separate New York state charges. 

“I don't want to say [the MDC] is like the Taj Mahal, but it's a hell of a lot nicer than Rikers,” Aidala said.

Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal and state charges for allegedly gunning down the health care exec outside his insurance company's annual investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He was then arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day manhunt by authorities. 

He's due back in federal court on Dec. 5, and trial date has yet been set.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Gordon Ramsay Understandably Flabbergasted Over the Price of His Wife's Birthday Meal","https://entertainmentnow.com/food-tv/gordon-ramsay-wife-birthday-dinner-price/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:07:48 GMT","

Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay revealed he was shocked by the price of his wife's seafood birthday meal, which came in at over $200. 

Ramsay, known for his reality food TV shows Hell's Kitchen and MasterChef, told the LAD Bible that he was left stunned by the price of his wife's birthday plate. The couple, who have been married since 1996 and share four children, celebrated Tana Ramsay's birthday with a dinner in the south of France.

“We sat in a hotel in Cannes, and she had a lobster because she loves lobsters. It's a treat, it's her birthday,” Ramsay explained. 

The chef told the outlet that the restaurant charged €220 for a lobster, which converts to roughly $254.

“And I'm not a penny-pincher and I'm not tight, OK,” Ramsay said. “I never question the bill. But €220, what the [expletive] is going on?”

Ramsay isn't exactly a stranger to pricey meals. According to Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, dining experience for restaurant-goers at his Hell's Kitchen location in Southern California can cost between $150 and $200 per person, depending on the restaurant's menu and what meal they order. 

The chef said his wife struggled to finish the dish, so he stepped in. Ramsay told LAD Bible he didn't want the seafood to go to waste, so he “grabbed it and ate it.”

“If my mum heard that I'd paid €220 for a lobster main course in the south of France she would kick my [expletive],” he continued. “She doesn't even spend that a month on her shopping.”

Ramsay also celebrated his wife's birthday in an Instagram post on August 23.

“Happy birthday to this incredible woman @tanaramsay wife mother professional and best friend love you ❤️,” he wrote in the caption.

Ramsay once ate a meal on one of his competition shows that the contestant said would cost $225.

In season 21 of Hell's Kitchen, contestant Vlad Briantsev, who earned the nickname “Truffle Boy,” presented Ramsay with his “signature dish” topped with truffle, an already expensive addition to a meal. 

The meal consisted of a bone-in Australian wagyu with lobster mushrooms and a parsnip puree topped with white truffle. 

“What an expensive dish,” Ramsay told Briantsev. “How much would you charge for this dish?

“$225, easy,” Briantsev said. Ramsay tried the dish, telling the contestant that the steak was cooked beautifully and the seasoning was “on point.”

“Honestly, I would pay 230 bucks for that,” Ramsay said after indulging in the dish.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Joey Lawrence Splits Head Open in Freak Accident","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/joey-lawrence-talks-about-injury-accident/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 15:57:59 GMT","

Joey Lawrence is on the mend after a scary household accident left him with a painful head injury. The “Blossom” alum, 49, appeared with visible cuts and bruises on his face during the Friday, November 7 episode of his “Brotherly Love Podcast,” where the former “Dancing With The Stars” contestant opened up about what happened.

“So, here's the story. I was with my youngest daughter, Dilly, and I was pushing her. She loves to be pushed like on a roller coaster,” Joey told his brothers and cohosts, Andy and Matthew Lawrence. “She jumped into these Amazon boxes, and she's like, ‘Box ride!' So I push her through the hallways, through the house. And I've done this, by the way, a hundred times with her.”

The actor said what started as a fun game quickly turned frightening after one wrong move led to a serious fall.

The actor explained that their playful game took an unexpected turn when the box suddenly came to a stop on a marble floor threshold. 

“Downstairs, we can go all the way from the front door to the back door, and there's this one threshold between the dining room and the kitchen area where it goes from hardwood into the marble floor. I'd been over it in the boxes a hundred times,” he said.

“I was like, ‘All right, this is the last one.' So I was low and I was pushing her. We weren't going dangerously fast, but we had a good speed because she loved it,” Joey recalled. “For some reason, we hit this little threshold, and the box completely stopped. This little box did not move. In that matter of seconds, she was gonna fly out.”

Acting on instinct, Joey lunged forward to catch his daughter before she could fall.

“I lunge to get her, and praise God, I caught her with both of my hands, and I got her back in the box,” he said. “And my momentum when I got her back in the box, I had to jump to get her. I basically flung myself over and realized when my hands are back here and she was in the box, that nothing was between me and the floor.”

The actor said he immediately realized he was hurt. “All I could see, literally, not to be too graphic, is a wall of red. I couldn't see anything, but I knew something really bad [had happened],” he explained. “My head, no joke, was split about three and a half inches. They called it, like, a skin splinter.”

Joey said the hospital staff treated him with a mix of glue and stitches because of the extent of the injury. “The skin was so delicate and so wide that they weren't able to pull it,” he shared. “So they had to flap it, pull it over and glue, and I had four stitches on each side.”

Despite the painful recovery, the actor said he feels grateful that his daughter was unharmed. “Praise God, I caught her,” he repeated on the podcast.

Joey shares Dilly, 2, with his wife, Samantha Cope. The couple married in May 2022, briefly filed for divorce in August 2024, and later reconciled. 

Joey is also the father of daughters Charleston, 19, and Liberty, 15, with ex-wife Chandie Yawn-Nelson.

The star told listeners that while his injuries are healing, he's just thankful the accident ended the way it did, with his daughter safe in his arms.

There have been multiple reports about season 15 of Bravo's “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” Now, ahead of any official announcement, Teresa Giudice has made it clear that she wants to reconcile with her brother, Joe Gorga, and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Recently, her ex, Joe Giudice, weighed in. 

Giudice interviewed with US Weekly in November 2025. Regarding his ex-wife patching things up with her brother, he said, “I know they met Saturday night.” 

The former “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star continued, “I mean, at the end of the day, it's still her brother.” He added, “It's her only brother. Besides that, the cousins don't speak… which isn't right.”

Giudice then told the outlet, “At the end of the day, you know what? I mean, get over it, because it's like, what are you gonna do?”

The Giudices announced their separation in 2019, after both had been released from jail. It was finalized the following year. He currently resides in the Bahamas and has been open about his desire to return to the United States. 

The former “Housewives” husband appeared on Gia Giudice's “Casual Chaos” podcast in August 2025, providing a career update. He said, “I am working on construction. I'm getting a lot of things in the works with construction. And I'm just waiting on a couple of big things to come through, and hopefully they come through so I can get back into the real estate [business].”

Giudice continued, “I would love to get back into the real estate game out here because that's what I love doing. And I mean, the real estate out here is very good. I could definitely see myself getting back into it out here, for sure. And even if I'm allowed back over there (Stateside), I'll definitely be here working with real estate… You know what I mean?”

Prior to Giudice giving his thoughts on his ex-wife reconciling with Gorga, she revealed why she decided it was time to bury the hatchet. While talking to Page Six, she said, “Not because I'm worried about getting back on the cast because it is what it is.”

She continued, “If it happens, it happens; if it doesn't, it doesn't. My whole thing is I want to be a good example for my children.” Giudice also spoke about finding peace. Regarding the future of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey,” many fans are hoping for an announcement at BravoCon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","RHOBH Newbie Natalie Swanston Fuller: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhobh-season-15-natalie-swanston-fuller/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 14:46:18 GMT","

Natalie Swanston Fuller is the newest addition to “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” joining the season 15 cast as a “friend.” Here's what you need to know about the British-born entrepreneur.

Natalie was born in the United Kingdom and has built a reputation for refined taste and luxury branding. Bravo describes her as “an entrepreneur, creative consultant and mother of three, known for her international, intuitive and thoughtful approach to curating enriched modern living.” She co-founded Blackmore Hair, a high-end wellness-focused haircare company centered on simplicity and self-care.

Her brand philosophy mirrors her lifestyle — calm, curated, and quietly lavish. From design projects to wellness partnerships, Natalie's professional world revolves around beauty and elevated living.

From 2008 until 2025, Natalie was married to Simon Fuller, the entertainment powerhouse who created “Pop Idol,” “American Idol,” and managed the Spice Girls. Their wedding — a three-day celebration in Napa Valley costing more than $2.5 million — drew A-list guests including Victoria Beckham, Annie Lennox, and Claudia Schiffer.

The couple raised three children — Grace, 14, and 9-year-old twins — while splitting their time between homes in London, Beverly Hills, and the South of France. Their marriage appeared picture-perfect until early 2025, when Natalie filed for divorce citing “irreconcilable differences.”

The Daily Mail reported that the divorce could involve Simon Fuller's estimated $560 million fortune. Sources told the outlet that Simon had “been living on his own for some time” and that Natalie's decision to officially file took “their separation to the next level.”

Court filings reportedly show that Natalie requested spousal support but asked that Simon not receive any in return. The high-stakes split has drawn attention not only for the potential financial implications but also for Natalie's poised reemergence into Beverly Hills society.

Bravo insiders say Natalie brings “old Hollywood glamour meets global elegance” to the show. With her refined accent, sleek fashion sense, and connections across London and Los Angeles, she's expected to stand out among the franchise's American socialites.

Natalie's calm demeanor and upscale aesthetic could make her either the show's peacekeeper or its quiet disruptor. Either way, her polished presence is set to add a new layer of intrigue to the dynamic — especially as she navigates life post-divorce.

After nearly two decades in one of entertainment's most powerful marriages, Natalie is focused on independence and reinvention. She's expanding her business ventures, raising her children, and leaning into her new life as a single, successful woman.

Her Bravo bio sums it up best: “Natalie continues to shape a life and career that embodies strength, elegance and success on her own terms.” Translation? She's rich, centered, and ready for whatever Beverly Hills throws her way.

“The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” season 15 premieres Thursday, December 4, at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo, with next-day streaming on Peacock.

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Arista

Reviewed:

November 9, 2025

It's a fine line on Horses between listening and believing. Even before the decades made Patti Smith's debut album into rock'n'roll scripture, its eight-word opening salvo imbued its body and blood and grace and guts with a holy truth. “Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine,” sung-spoke slowly like smoke. Our story accordingly begins at church, on Bertolt Brecht's birthday, Lou Reed in the pews, full moon.

Patti stepped to the lectern at the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church on February 10, 1971, and dedicated her reading to crime. From the moment she opened her mouth, her brash South Jersey accent and out-of-step real talk demolished the fourth wall between performer and audience. The date marked Smith's first gig with guitarist Lenny Kaye, a music critic she befriended after he wrote about the early-'60s phenomenon of regional street-corner vocal groups (“The Best of Acapella,” Jazz and Pop, 1969), the doo-wop of her own youth.

She recruited Kaye for St. Mark's by asking, “Could you play a car crash with an electric guitar?” Having produced Nuggets—the 1972 garage-rock compilation of willfully unprofessional '60s bands already dubbed “punk rock”—Kaye was game. The East Village church was not typically host to electric guitars. Smith had attended past readings at the Project alongside Beat scribe Gregory Corso as he heckled dull poets (“No blood! Get a transfusion!”) and she promised herself if she ever had a chance to read her own poetry, she would never be boring.

That night, she sang “Mack the Knife” and performed her poems—including “Oath,” the origin of her “Jesus died…” line—before a crowd that included Andy Warhol, Bobby Neuwirth, Robert Mapplethorpe, Sam Shepherd, and Anne Waldman. Afterward, her soon-to-be friend Sandy Pearlman suggested she front a rock'n'roll band, “but I just laughed,” Smith wrote in her 2019 memoir, Year of the Monkey, “and told him I already had a good job working in a bookstore.” Immediately, she was flooded with asks. A businessman offered a lucrative record deal hoping to make her into the Downtown Cher. Her response: “I ain't never gonna do this shit. I ain't never gonna do a record unless they let me do exactly what I want.”

She had fled rural South Jersey in 1967, ditching her family home across from a square-dance barn and her non-union factory job to “get on that train […] and go to New York City,” as she would chronicle on her first single, and “be somebody” and “never return, no, never return/To burn out in this piss factory/And I will travel light, oh/Watch me now.” New York was all eyes.

All these Patti Smith genesis myths have become as seismic as her music. The fable of her young bohemian existence—CBGB, Chelsea Hotel, Mapplethorpe, Cowboy Mouth—precedes her. It can be summarized by saying she believed in herself—a sickly child and the oldest of four to a waitress mother and factory-worker father who moved 11 times before her fifth birthday. As a young Jehovah's Witness knocking doors on Saturday mornings, she got buckets of urine dumped on her and eventually dismissed organized religion when an elder told her there was no room for art in God's kingdom. She communed with poems, fairytales, Dylan, Coltrane, and imagined a way out. “I grew up in a tougher part of Jersey than Bruce Springsteen,” she told Rolling Stone in 1976. Teen girls like her weren't meant to escape. When she became pregnant and gave up a child for adoption at 20, “It developed me as a person, made me start to value life,” she said, “that I'm not down in South Jersey on welfare with a 9-year-old. ‘Cause every other girl in South Jersey who got in trouble at that time is down there.” Smith's freedom was tangible. She left home with nothing in pursuit of everything, sharpening herself against the rock of experience and exalting the innocence of dreams.

Smith considered rock'n'roll the people's art form. Having watched rock's then-20-year history evolve in her lifetime—citing Little Richard and the Marvelettes as big parts of her childhood, cutting her hair like Keith Richards, learning to walk (she claimed) from Don't Look Back—she feared that the music's rawer roots were at risk of being lost in the '70s to an increasingly corporate, commodified, arena-scaled industry. So Smith rose to the occasion. Alchemizing her poetry's imagistic visions and Beat pulse with a sense of duty, she led a rock band. Their spring 1975 residency at CBGB attracted a seven-album deal with the new Arista label and complete creative control, which Smith used to speak straight to misfits. As Smith put blood into poetry, she stripped rock for parts: rhythm, attitude, intensity, delight. Her bandmates—Kaye, pianist Richard Sohl, guitarist Ivan Kral, drummer Jay Dee Daugherty—were with her. Part of the group's project was to “always attempt something beyond what we can do” musically. Emitting the electricity of a woman excavating the reservoirs of her soul, Horses dares you, too, to go deeper.

To say Smith simply combined rock and poetry is like saying a tidal wave is made of salt and water. On Horses, her conviction that rock can change you sounds charged with missionary zeal; her free-jazz principle keeps the transformations alive. As Smith's contralto delivers status-quo-skewering tales of sex, death, religion, money, Rimbaud, UFOs, nightmares, and dreams, her words crystallize the idea that we create and destroy our own reality, or at least we try. They expand and contract, sprawl and puncture, seduce you in and freak you out. They make you question what a rock song can do and how a person can be.

Anchored by her propulsive strength, lead by her rushing momentum, the band's minimalist rock is gasoline to the engine of Smith's rave-ups, ebbing and flowing between avant-garde reveries and pop elements like the episodic free-time of the Velvet Underground's “Heroin.” The “place called space” echo of Sun Ra on “Land” seems not incidental to Horses' constant improvisational energy. Smith rhapsodizes to reel the songs in, then catapults them to the cosmos. The whole atmosphere of Horses is anointed with the spirit of creation.

The preeminent New York art rock figure, John Cale, seemed like a natural fit as producer when the band entered Electric Lady Studios in September 1975. In Smith's telling, their working relationship was like A Season in Hell. She wanted a spartan technical engineer to capture the band's sound and presence live in the room, fast, spontaneous, without overdubs, but ended up with a “total maniac artist.” “He's a fighter and I'm a fighter so we're fightin',” Smith said. “Sometimes fightin' produces a champ.” Promoting the record, she said she chose him because his records sounded good, but also quipped that the pairing was somewhat arbitrary: “I looked at the cover of [1974's] Fear and I said, ‘Now there's a set of cheekbones.'”

Never failing to name her influences—in fact, stating her desire to pay back the debts she owed to them by making something great—Smith seized her heroes as deities, enthusiastically referencing her rock, soul, and jazz inspirations in song, letting the fervor of fandom stoke Horses' fire. Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and Mick Jagger were her holy trinity—or maybe it's John Coltrane, Maria Callas, Arthur Rimbaud? And what of Jo March, Jim Morrison, Albert Ayler? In any case, “Elegie,” Horses' mournful closing ballad, was for Hendrix, recorded at his studio on the fifth anniversary of his death. Smith quotes Hendrix's lyrics on “Elegie”—“It's sad, it's much too bad, that our friends can't be with us today”—but his spirit lingers through Horses, especially in Smith's wild vocal improvisations, as if using her throat to mimic his metaphysical feedback-laden solos.

She also learned from fellow Chelsea Hotel denizen William Burroughs's high-speed cut-up collage technique, evidenced in how she juxtaposed forms in her songwriting. “Gloria” opens with the poem, “Oath,” which she wrote in 1968, then flips to the simple, cathartic '60s garage-rock staple penned by a young Van Morrison for his band Them—making it a bricolage of teen dreaming, a poem written without guile or fear, a full-throttle folk song that was a starting line for unknown legions of rock fantasies. As if instilling confidence by osmosis, Horses' first eight words voice the unassailable fact that mistakes are a symptom of life.

Other times, Horses seems to hero-worship the sky. The nine-minute odyssey “Birdland” shares a name with the famed, by-then shuttered Manhattan jazz club, itself named for Charlie Parker. Smith's lyrics were improvised in the studio, drawing from a book by Peter Reich (son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich) who dreamed his dead father was coming to rescue him from earth in a UFO: “It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars cause when he looked up they started to slip,” Smith sings in a wide-eyed rush as if each word were a celestial object pulling her “up up up” until a dream becomes a frenzied fight song; “Birdland” itself embodies the “What the hell was that?” energy of a sky-streaking flying object that only some people saw.

The DNA of Smith's singing threads Shangri-Las tough talk and Stones menace into the swagger of a South Jersey girl cuttin' the edges off her letters, punctuatin' em. She chewed syllables, pulled them from the back of her throat, and made them up on the spot. She sings like a shadowboxer choreographed by her genius phrasings. At one point on “Break It Up,” the recording seems to capture the sound of Smith beating her chest in sync with her heart. Considering Smith's sing-song declamations and crude vibrato, I recall a 1971 piece she wrote for Rolling Stone, outlining her adoration for the balladeering “sweet outlaw” and “trapeze artist” Lotte Lenya, best known for performing theater songs by her husband, Kurt Weill. “It was hard for me to face up to being a girl,” Smith concluded. “But Lotte Lenya showed me how high and low down you can shoot being a woman.” Smith stages this breadth whether chanting “Go Rimbaud! Go Johnny go!” or elocuting “The sky will split/And the planets will shift,” or punching out “ding-dong, ding-dong” or snarling each hard-boiled vowel of “People say beware/But I don't care/The words are just rules and regulations to me.”

Smith struggled to accept the mores of her gender even in childhood, wanting to embrace both the feminine and the masculine within herself. On “Gloria” she lingers at a party—“I just get bored,” she sneers—then her eye catches a “sweet young thing” leaning against a parking meter, bellowing that she's gonna—ah, ah—make her mine. The sparkling “Kimberly” is addressed to Patti's little sister, 10 years her junior; in South Jersey, the child was often left in Smith's care, including, as the song narrates, during a barn fire she watched while cradling Kimberly. “I feel just like some misplaced Joan of Arc/And the cause is you looking at me,” she proclaims in cool syncopation. It might be the first rock song with a lyric about rocking a baby; the tender way she sings “as long as you're safe, Kimberly” undercuts rock cliches with maternal care.

The austere reggae of “Redondo Beach” is like a three-minute film treatment, a story of overcast beachgoers grieving a girl, the narrator's beloved, lost to “sweet suicide”: “You'll never return into my arms cause you were gone, gone,” she despairs, though the tune's overall effect is bewilderingly playful. In live shows, Smith would reportedly introduce the song saying it was about “a beach where women love other women.” She rejected Horses' queerness as autobiography, but the songs still created new paradigms, inventing roles in the schema of rock for women seducing women, women mourning women, women protecting women, women intoning “Ohh, she looks so good, oooh she looks so fine” and “20,000 girls/Called their names out to me,” aware that in its way it was radical.

“Free Money” was the first song Smith and Kaye penned together, and Smith wrote the lyric “Scoop the pearls from the sea, cash them in and buy you all the things you need” with another woman in mind: her mother. Smith had watched her parents struggle all her life. The song's blazing dream of winning some fantastical lotto and making something from nothing feels rooted intuitively in a working-class consciousness. The steadiness and structure of “Free Money” mirror the relief she longs to deliver; its ecstatic build becomes the voyage she's desperate to share. As a kid, Smith's own aesthetic inspiration was free, from trashed issues of Vogue, stolen poetry volumes, and public art museums. That Blondie eventually echoed “Free Money”'s message—dreaming is free—underscores its eloquent distillation of punk's essence.

The apotheosis of Smith's ambition, “Land,” is an epic nine-minute triptych and semi-apocalyptic hero's journey, a cut-up of angels and ancient wisdom and a band called Twistelletes. The first act weaves three Smith vocal takes into an unnerving inner monologue about “Johnny,” a boy who is viciously assaulted, depicting the stampede of brutal reality as “horses, horses, horses.” Next a hairpin turn takes us suddenly to a dance hall. Smith quotes from the live-wire abandon of Chris Kenner's 1962 classic “Land of a Thousand Dances,” a parade of teen dance crazes: “Do you know how to Pony like Bony Moronie?” she hollers. “Then you mashed potato!” “Do the alligator!” “Do the Watusi!” “Land” is ultimately an action painting of jaunty keys and single hammered chords and pure corporality, circling the fact that “life is filled with holes,” “full of pain,” Smith sings, but it's worth living. (A Creem reporter, Tony Glover, was present for the Horses sessions, and after watching Smith spend seven possessed hours mixing “Land,” her fingers at the controls, he wrote, “I had trouble sleeping for several days.”)

Plenty of “Land” begets communion over comprehension per se. But when the middle section cracks open and pours down its incantatory “Sea of Possibilities”—“There is a sea up there,” the words refracting, “a sea of possibilities”—it dares you to find yourself in its chaos. Inspiration is a renewable energy source all around, it seems to say, just waiting to be grasped. The “Sea of Possibilities” became a fever-dream prophecy for the future of music, a rallying cry to incite people's participation in rock or simply their own lives. It humanizes the process of art-making, which is what punk still is, a gauntlet thrown down, saying, “Here, you try.” As much as Smith reveres heroes, she doesn't bow to them; “Land” invites you to become your own. On the B-side of the “Gloria” single was a cover of the Who's “My Generation,” where Smith can be heard shouting, in the end, to the kids who powered youth culture and now stood in her audience: “We created it! Let's take it over!” She reflected on the ripple effects of this sonic anarchy when Elvis died in 1977, her sorrow concurrent with the heyday of punk: “The King is dead. The People will rule.”

And they did. Horses signaled a nonnegotiable sea change, catalyzing a new cultural order. At CBGB, neither Ramones nor Television had released records yet, nor had London's Sex Pistols or the Clash (Joe Strummer was still a 101er), not to mention the women of the Slits or the Raincoats for whom Smith was a revelation. If the point of punk is to embolden people who music might otherwise leave behind—if the future of rock belonged to women, as another famous Patti devotee, Kurt Cobain, would assert years later—then Horses was a moment of ignition, with keys freely distributed. Beyond its initial impact, Horses inspired practically every subsequent era of rock and helped shepherd in the alternative canon. Michael Stipe, Courtney Love, and Thurston Moore were but three of the most vocal musicians to credit Smith with setting them on the course of their lives (when Moore explained riot grrrl to Smith in 1995, she said, “That's heartening to know. I hope there's lots of them”). Even the Smiths met at a '70s Patti Smith show.

Critics instantly recognized Horses as a landmark, a fount of passion yet unheard that anticipated where rock was going. It ranked number two in the 1975 Pazz & Jop critics poll (after The Basement Tapes, ahead of Born to Run) and was widely described as an important generational event, as the band banged out “Gloria” on Saturday Night Live and crashed the upper half of the pop charts. In Creem, Lester Bangs' review said Smith's dynamism “joins the ranks of people like Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, or the Dylan of ‘Sad Eyed Lady' and Royal Albert Hall,” but he also heard a unique profundity. “You'll love it when she makes mistakes (in this era of slick, pre-digested ‘rock' as muzak), when her voice goes ragged (but right), like the perfect act of leaping for something precious. Who needs the other kind of perfection?”

Fifty years ago, Smith saw herself in a continuum. To be a link between ghosts and the unborn, she said, was “one of the beautiful parts of human existence.” She accepted the responsibility of helping make sense of the '60s, as if striking a deal with the universe, shattering boundaries that confined identities, sounds, and imaginations. “Everything that keeps us apart is really old news, man,” Smith said in 1975. “People don't know it yet, but future generations will figure it out.” Horses put virtuosic ideas into the frame of a real person, down-to-earth and in-flight, searching for a new cosmology you could reach out and touch and know the world is yours.

	Rosalía has already made Spotify history with Lux, her newest album. Rolling Stone can confirm that the “Berghain” musician broke the record for the most streams in the first 24 hours by a female Spanish-language artist on Spotify. 


	With more than 42.1 million streams on the platform on the first day, the singer broke the record previously held by Karol G's Mañana Será Bonito (Bichota Season) in 2023.


Lux marks Rosalía's first LP since 2022's Motomami. The singer taps into opera and classical music and sings in 14 different languages on the record. Lux also became the first LP on Spotify to feature live translations with MusixMatch, so listeners could understand the multilingual lyrics as they listened to the album on the platform.

	In an interview for The New York Times' Popcast, Rosalía revealed that she turned to both Google Translate and a professional translator to help with phonetics and overall pronunciation, but even so, songs took several takes to get right. “It's a lot of trying to understand how other languages work,” she said.

	The album's 15 tracks include collaborations with Carminho on “Memória,” Björk and Yves Tumor on “Berghain,” Yahritza from Yahritza y Su Esencia on “La Perla.” Rosalía worked with Daníel Bjarnason, who is the conductor for the London Symphony Orchestra, to executive produce the project.


	A Rolling Stone review of the album gave it a five-star review, and lauded it as a record that “sounds like absolutely nothing else in music right now… It's an album no other pop star could have made.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump couldn't be bothered to help a man who had fainted in the Oval Office, instead using the break in his press conference to grumble about New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and other Democratic election winners. 


	“I think my plan is pretty normal: stand here and stare like a sociopath,” Trump (James Austin Johnson) said while others tended to the man, leading to a viral photograph. “Didn't even pretend like I was going to help, like when someone drops something and you do the fake bend.”


	Stepping over the man, who ended up being okay, the president called the medical event a “great capper to an awesome week—except for election.”


	“The Democrats won. The lamestream media called the elections a rebuke of Trump. Joke's on them: they're Stephen Miller's policies,” he said.

	“I can't believe they elected Mamdani. We like to say ‘Mamdani!' You know, I'm torn because I like a winner, but I'm not crazy about a Muslim. Maybe he'll convert, right? We'll put him in line behind ‘Ursha' Vance,” he said. “And I hope I'm pronouncing that wrong.”

	











	Trump then spun two difficult issues facing his administration: consumer dissatisfaction with the cost of goods and the ongoing government shutdown, which is the longest in history.


	“I promised grocery prices would plummet, and they did: they plummeted straight up! But people are saying, ‘Sir, how will I afford my Thanksgiving turkey for my family?' Well, the good news is your family isn't coming because all the planes are gone,” he said, as his administration plans to cut ten percent of flights as the shutdown drags on. “We call that problem solving problem: killing two birds with another bird.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update wouldn't let Andrew Cuomo forget about his failed bid for mayor of New York. 


	The former New York governor, who lost to Zohran Mamdani in the June Democratic primary and again in the general election on Tuesday, had been endorsed by scandal-plagued incumbent mayor Eric Adams and Donald Trump.


	“That's like bringing a girl home and saying, ‘Not to brag, but I have Hepatitis B and C,” co-anchor Colin Jost joked.


Michael Che then trashed Cuomo for going around town in the final days before the election in a white Ford Bronco, even with its obvious connotations to O.J. Simpson.


	“At least O.J. was ahead in the race for awhile,” Che joked.

	Later, Jost mentioned how Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was groped during a public appearance this week. Sheinbaum is pressing charges.


	“So no, he's not taking the loss well,” Jost joked a photo flashed on screen of Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid allegations of sexual harassment from eleven women.

	











	Another hot topic during the segment was the medical emergency during an Oval Office press conference this week—more specifically, how Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy each reacted to it.


	When a pharmaceutical executive fainted, Kennedy quickly left the room.

	“How suspicious is that? Such a weird move,” Jost commented. “Don't worry, though; the man who collapsed is is okay. You can tell because if there's something dead on the ground, RFK eats it.”

	











	And as for Trump, who basically just stood there, Jost compared him to the meme of a cartoon dog in a fire-filled room saying, “This is fine.”

	Hip-hop legends Salt-N-Pepa added one more monumental honor to their mantle with their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as the recipients of this year's Musical Influence Award. Both Cheryl “Salt” James and Sandra “Pepa” Denton were on hand to accept on Saturday, Nov. 8, as was the duo's formerly estranged DJ Spinderella (Deidra Roper), who became the first female DJ inducted into the Rock Hall.


	“This is for every woman who picked up a mic when they told her her she couldn't,” said James while accepting the honor. While both Denton and Roper gave individual speeches thanking their friends, family, genre, and audience, James used her time at the podium to tell the crowd that the group is fighting for the rights to their master recordings. “As we celebrate this moment, fans can't even stream our music. It's been taken down from all streaming platforms because the industry still doesn't want to play fair. Salt-N-Pepa have never been afraid of a fight. This is the Influence Award. We have to keep using our influence until the industry honors creativity the way the audience does — with love, respect and fairness — and that includes streaming platforms too.”

	











	Presenting Salt-N-Pepa with their Musical Influence Award was Missy Elliott (who became the first female rapper to be nominated and inducted into the Rock Hall in 2023). “The reason that you even know Missy Elliott's name is because of Salt, Pepa, and Spinderella,” Elliott said in her impassioned speech, embodying an electric preacher. “When you see your favorite rapper, understand that if they're on top, there's a foundation that they're standing on. These three women are the bricklayers to the foundation that holds hip-hop together. They gave us their shoulders to stand on.” Elliott wore a bejeweled letterman inspired by the trio's iconic look.

	Before the speeches, Salt-N-Pepa took the stage to perform a medley of their hits, kicking it off with the iconic lines of “My Mic Sounds Nice” into “Shoop.” Then they performed their 1991 smash “Let's Talk About Sex” in front of massive digital banners toting the phrase as well as a line of male dancers humping the floor, capturing the boldness of the hit.

	DJ Spinderella got a moment of solo-shine to scratch before En Vogue strutted on stage to perform their 1993 collaboration, “Whatta Man.” Pepa modernized her verse by swapping in “Barack” for “Arnold” (i.e. Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the line “A body like Arnold with a Denzel [Washington] face.”


	For the grand finale, their original producer Hurby “Luv Bug” Azor joined the trio in commanding the crowd to dance to “Push It” (to which Cyndi Lauper, in the audience, gladly obliged).


	“We are rock and roll,” Salt told reporters prior to their induction. “It's all one thing. It's more about what you accomplished and not so much about the genre, which i love. We got to the point where this is what we worked for and deserve. Rock and roll, hip-hop, whatever.”


	“Thank you for keeping us so relevant and alive for 40 years,” Pepa added. “This is a big moment that solidified and defined all the hard work we've pushed through from the Eighties until now.”


	Salt-N-Pepa were one most of the most influential and successful hip-hop acts of the late-Eighties and early-Nineties. They became the first female rap act to earn gold and platinum status when their debut, Hot, Cool, & Vicious sold over a million copies, fueled by the success of “Push It.” 


	They scored additional hits with “Expression” and “Let's Talk About Sex” before finally cracking the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1993 with back-to-back singles, “Shoop” and “Whatta Man” (which peaked at Numbers Four and Three, respectively). Both songs appeared on Salt-N-Pepa's multi-platinum album, Very Necessary, which also featured their Grammy-winning track, “None of Your Business.”

	Salt-N-Pepa have received plenty of accolades and honors, including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammys in 2021 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022. In a recent interview with Billboard, James said the Rock Hall was basically “the last big one” for the group, adding they were “very, very excited.” 

	











	She continued: “It's kind of like what you want in your career; you want longevity, you want recognition, and the fact that everybody's representing Salt-N-Pepa's contribution to music is perfection to me at this point in my life. A lot of people are saying ‘long overdue.' I say it's right on time.”

Elton John performed an emotional rendition of the Beach Boys' “God Only Knows” as part of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's tribute to Brian Wilson, who died in June.


	Before he started the song, John stepped onstage and shared a few memories with Wilson over the years, recounting the first time they met in Los Angeles. “We were scared shitless because he was my idol. He was the one that influenced me more than anybody else when it came to writing songs on the piano. It was an evening we would never forget,” he said. “Meeting someone who was a true genius doesn't happen very often.” 


	He noted how he and Wilson became friends who sat in on each other's records through the years. “We loved each other,” he says. “I can't think of anyone else I'd rather pay tribute than Brian Wilson and his family with this incredible song.”


	John took to social media after Wilson's death to remember the man he said had the “biggest influence of my songwriting ever.” 

	











	“Brian Wilson was always so kind to me from the day I met him,” John explained in caption to a photo of the pair in a room flush with studio equipment. “He sang ‘Someone Saved My Life Tonight' at a tribute concert in 2003, and it was an extraordinary moment for me. played on his solo records, he sang on my album, The Union, and even performed for my AIDS Foundation.”

The artists launched into a high-powered medley that included “Dance to the Music,” “Everyday People,” “Thank You,” and “I Want To Take You Higher,” all while images of the soul legend blared in the background in bright, vibrant colors. Stone and Wilson were also included in the telecast's In Memoriam, which also honored Ozzy Osborne, Roy Ayers, and Marianne Faithfull, among others.

Frank Leboeuf reacts to Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden returning to the England squad. (0:53)

England's assistant head coach Anthony Barry has likened Thomas Tuchel to a ""UFO"" with the ""stardust"" to bring World Cup glory.

Barry is a loyal disciple of the German after first working under him at Chelsea, following him to Bayern Munich before jumping at the chance of being part of Tuchel's backroom staff with England -- where the mission is to win next summer's World Cup.

Barry, aged 39, who began coaching Accrington under-16s in his mid-20s, has quickly earned a reputation as a precocious elite-level coach and says working with Tuchel has enlightened him.

""I often say it was a meeting of minds and a meeting of personalities,"" the Liverpudlian said. ""To say I fell in love with him wouldn't be an understatement.

""He swept into Chelsea, he floated in, he didn't walk. I've never seen anything like him in terms of personality and also in methodology, in a way of working.

""He was something for me that was almost like a UFO.

""He was not like anything I'd seen before. I have to say it was as much down to his methodology and his way of working, but it's down to him. There's something about Thomas for me ... There's stardust there.

""I can't exactly say what it is but it's something special. It's the X-factor that we all look for. I'm not sure you can learn it, I think it's God-given. And to this day he still has it.""

Barry describes his friend as someone with ""zero ego"" and says they often exchange late-night messages.

""He's quite sporadic, they can come at any time. His mind never switches off,"" Barry revealed.

""For both of us, there's always another clip, there's always another training session, there's always another game. Enough is never enough.

""He is constantly on, he is obsessed with building teams and building players.

""That's why we're so aligned. The messages can come at any hour but I have to be honest, I can answer at any hour as well.""

Barry also said building a ""brotherhood"" could help England to World Cup glory.

That desire to build the spirit has been highlighted by Tuchel's eye-catching selections, where he has repeatedly left high-profile players out of the group.

Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden were notable absentees for the first two international camps of the season, but were named in the German's most recent squad for the final World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania next week.

- England's Tuchel: Bellingham's 'edge' can inspire World Cup glory
- Tuchel hints at England stay beyond World Cup: 'It is a lot of fun'

Barry, who also stressed the need to search for a best England XI instead of striving to include players with the biggest profile, said added that he believes the key to success is building an unbreakable spirit rather than trying to recreate successful club teams.

""The mission was clear, try to win the second star. Try to win the World Cup for England,"" he said.

""But beneath that, what are we trying to build. We're trying to build 'Team England.'

""International football is about connection. Connection to each other, the mission and the game model. Because for me, overall, if you create a brotherhood that can connect to the nation, then you have a chance.

""Who you are and what you represent is far more important than what you do.

""In international football, you will never create a team on the field that can play the way the Barcelona of old or the recent Man City, it's simply impossible.

""But if you can create something, a brotherhood, a connection, an energy between each other, then that is the petrol in the car in international football.

""We have to build something here that they want to be a part of, this brotherhood, this Team England that they all want to be a part of to come here and play.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Stay in a hotel in Japan where you can see a UFO","https://soranews24.com/2025/11/09/stay-in-a-hotel-where-you-can-see-a-ufo/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 13:00:46 GMT","



Alien spacecraft looks even better when lit up at night. 



With hotel prices skyrocketing around Japan, we're always on the lookout for bargain stays, and our latest find comes with something rather extraordinary — a view of a UFO.

Located in Makuharihongo, Chiba Prefecture, less than an hour out from Tokyo Station and Narita Airport, this hotel is just a 10-minute train ride from Makuhari Messe, the large convention centre where events like Tokyo Auto Salon and Tokyo Game Show are held.

▼ Called Famy Inn, this business hotel comes with a public bath and sauna, and operates a free shuttle bus to Kaihin Makuhari Station and Makuhari Messe.



When our reporter Masanuki Sunakoma arrived to spend the night there, he opted to walk from the station as it was only a 7-8 minute journey from Makuhari Hongo Station.





As he walked through the streets though, he found himself in a love hotel district, which made him wonder if the great deal he got on the Famy Inn was because it was actually a love hotel.

▼ At 8,100 yen (US$52.88) a night, with a 1,000-yen discount voucher from travel provider Rakuten Travel, Famy Inn is a very cheap place to stay.



When he arrived at the lobby, however, he found his fears were unwarranted, as the only reference to love here was the image of Aphrodite on the foyer wall.



Upon entering his room, it was clear that this was a legit business hotel, with simple rooms that include a clean bed, a private bathroom, a desk, and a TV. It may not have been the pinnacle of luxury, but hey, for 8,100 yen a night, with a public bath and sauna thrown in, this was a great deal.





▼ The bath and sauna are open from 5 p.m. to midnight.



With an expressway nearby, the hotel provides earplugs in every room for those who might be sensitive to noise.



Pulling back the curtain to see where the expressway was, Masanuki stepped back in shock at the sight that lay before him.

▼ There was a super huge UFO right in front of his eyes.



Sitting there as if it had just landed, the UFO seemed to be hiding in plain sight amongst the lights of the city. Blinking in surprise, Masanuki realised he wasn't dreaming and quickly ran to grab his camera, before proceeding to take about 50 photos of the unusual sight.



There was no mention of a “UFO view” when he'd booked the hotel room so he quickly headed downstairs to find out what it was all about.



As he approached the structure, he discovered that this was actually a love hotel called “Hotel UFO”.

▼ For love that's truly out of this world.



Up close, it was even bigger than Masanuki had imagined. He says it was a masterpiece, and after doing some research on it, he found that the facility had just recently been completely renewed before opening in July 2024.



Heading back to his room, Masanuki left the curtains open awhile so he could admire the view.



Before hopping into bed, with thoughts of aliens outside the “Save Our Planet!”message card immediately jumped out at him as a warning of some sort. Upon closer inspection, though, he found this wasn't a threat to humanity from an alien invasion, instead it was a call to conserve resources during hotel stays.



As he snuggled up in bed, Masanuki drifted off to a peaceful slumber, feeling strangely comforted by the UFO outside his window.



In the morning, Masanuki felt like a child on Christmas morning as he pulled back the curtains to see what was there.

▼ To his joy, the UFO was still there.



Pulling on his clothes, Masanuki scampered outside to get a daytime view of the UFO, and it looked just as massive and awe-inspiring as it did the night before.



Returning to the hotel to hop on the shuttle bus to Kaihin Makuhari Station, he had a skip in his step that made him feel like he was going to have a great day.



For a UFO lover like Masanuki, who once saw an unidentified flying object when he was younger and even visited Japan's UFO village to indulge his curiosity, this was a remarkable find. It just goes to show that no matter how many years you live here, there's always something new to discover in Japan!

The ocean liner, once a symbol of British power that helped defeat Hitler, has become a favorite setting for horror films

In 1937, the renowned 40-year-old American journalist Paul Gallico made the bold decision to stop writing sports news to reinvent himself and dedicate his life to what he loved: fiction. He had just divorced his second wife, and that year he began this uncertain new personal and professional chapter by indulging in the luxury of traveling first class on the RMS Queen Mary, the newly launched British ocean liner that, over the course of about four days, covered the route between New York and Southampton (in southern England) and vied for the title of the world's fastest ship with the French SS Normandie. One morning, at breakfast, his destiny and that of the ship became permanently intertwined, far beyond the European port they were heading for.

“To the musical sound of plates, knives, forks, and glasses clattering against the wooden stands at the edge of the tables was added the faint tinkling of ornaments as the large Christmas tree, planted in a tub filled with sand and firmly bolted to the dining room floor, began to lean dangerously. Listing much more than it had ever been before, the ship seemed suspended and gave the impression that it would never right itself.” Gallico didn't write that paragraph in a memoir, but in one of the most celebrated novels of the disaster subgenre, The Poseidon Adventure (1969), made more popular by its 1972 film adaptation starring Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine; partly filmed, in fact, on the Queen Mary.

The writer completed the voyage unharmed, but the powerful impression left on him by the heeling of the colossal ship — 310 meters long and weighing over 81,000 tons — as it was struck by a massive wave planted the seed of what would become the greatest success of his career. The discovery that, in 1942, while transporting Allied troops, a 28-meter wave tilted the ocean liner at a 52-degree angle (just three degrees from capsizing) further fueled his nightmares.

The story of the Queen Mary is astonishing enough without needing fanciful embellishments: this incredibly expensive jewel in the crown, born from the merger of the two rival British shipping companies, Cunard and White Star Line (the one that built the Titanic), with a generous government loan, boasted 12 decks, swimming pools, paddle tennis courts, nurseries, libraries, a monumental lounge, and capacity for over 2,000 passengers, along with another 1,000 crew members. 

In 1941, its austere Art Deco ornamentation had to be removed and urgently replaced with bunks to transport between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers per voyage during World War II. Along with its sister ship, the RMS Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Winston Churchill said that the two vessels had helped hasten the end of the war by at least a year. Adolf Hitler had offered $250,000 and the Iron Cross to whoever sank the Queen Mary, a symbol of hope and an exceptional asset to his enemies.

Operational until 1967, when it was decommissioned following a drop in revenue after the golden age of ocean liners had ended, the legacy of the Queen Mary was far from over. “The ship today and its continued appeal owe a great deal to film and television. If it had ended up anywhere other than Southern California, it's unlikely its star status would shine as brightly as it does now,” Jonathan Quayle, a maritime enthusiast specializing in the ship's history, tells EL PAÍS. 

Quayle gives talks about the Queen Mary and the Cunard fleet, collects ship artifacts and previously unseen photographs, and is a leading authority in his field. The U.S. city of Long Beach has been home to the ocean liner for almost 60 years, now without most of its machinery and adapted to house a restaurant, tourist attractions, and even a hotel. And, of course, film shoots.

“Being located just outside Hollywood, it was the natural choice when a crew needed a location for an episode of Murder, She Wrote [1984], Charlie's Angels [1976], The X-Files [1993]... The list of productions filmed on board is enormous. The ship is unique; there's nothing else like it in terms of size, both inside and out, making it an incredibly rare resource for the film industry. There's nowhere else where you can rent a huge, three-story English ballroom, built in the 1930s and decorated with the finest woods,” Quayle explains. 

In the case of The Poseidon Adventure, only some parts were used, although the lounge where passengers and crew celebrated the fateful New Year's Eve in the famous capsizing scene was a replica of the dining room of the Queen Mary, an exponent of the romanticism of glorious ships that the film sought to capture. Due to the complexity of the impressive special effects, the lounge was reconstructed in sections so that it could be rotated. 

The ship has featured in many other on-screen moments. In Pearl Harbor (2001), the characters played by Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale culminated their first date with a kiss while hanging from a platform on the Queen Mary, even though, in the year in which the film is set — 1941, the year of the Japanese bombing of the U.S. base in Hawaii — the ship was neither there nor did it look that way: it had been painted gray to camouflage it, which led to it becoming popularly known as “the gray ghost.” 

Martin Scorsese used it in The Aviator (2004). In Assault on a Queen (1966), Frank Sinatra led a gang of thieves who, taking advantage of the discovery of a sunken Nazi submarine, tried to sneak onto the ship (which, at the time, still had a year of service remaining) at sea to steal the contents of its safe. The British master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, also took the opportunity to pay homage to an emblem of his country, opening Dial M for Murder (1954) with the arrival of the conspiring husband aboard the ocean liner.

Not forgetting, of course, the episode of The X-Files referenced by Quayle, where Agent Mulder boards a ship lost in the Bermuda Triangle, which is none other than the Queen Mary — renamed Queen Anne — and travels back in time to the day the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. 

For Quayle, the key lies in the “iconic status” that the Queen Mary has held since its troubled and protracted birth, marked by the ravages of the Great Depression, as it represents “what Great Britain could offer,” as well as a light at the end of the tunnel for the population after years of hardship. And, on the other hand, there are those “imposing and beautiful interiors” that The Poseidon Adventure revealed to later audiences, about which Quayle is preparing a book. “The ship's interiors were pioneers of British design in the 1930s, but their place in that history has been largely forgotten,” he laments, “with specifically commissioned artworks, fixtures and decorative elements.”

Furnished primarily by the Bromsgrove Guild, the Queen Mary featured exclusive pieces by artists such as Edward Wadsworth and the landscape painter Algernon Newton. Woods from various colonies of the then-British Empire were used, while the first-class dining room was dominated by a gigantic map depicting its transatlantic voyage, complete with a small motorized model of the ship to mark its position along the route.

The map of the grand dining room plays a significant role in La maldición del Queen Mary (in English, The Curse of the Queen Mary), a horror film released this year in Spain via Amazon Prime Video. A change in the model indicates that, as in the episode of The X-Files, a time jump has occurred, leading a married couple of audiovisual creatives in crisis to become entangled with a gruesome parricide committed aboard the ship (with no known basis). 

The film, with a touch of self-aware humor, satirizes the carnival sideshow status the ship has acquired in recent decades, particularly for horror fans. Filmed on board, it's not the only B-movie production to become associated with the once-luxurious vessel. Two terrible exploitation films by the shameless production company The Asylum, Titanic 2 (2010) and Titanic 666 (2022), have also been released using the sets of the Queen Mary.

It seems to have become what it is in popular culture: a haunted mansion on the water. The culmination of years of legends and ghost stories that have surrounded the ship since it ran aground in Long Beach, to the point of making it a place of pilgrimage for followers of the supernatural, which, in the eyes of its owners, is a serious commercial goldmine. 

Quayle admits to having a complicated relationship with it. “While I have no problem with these events, or with the revenue they generate when it is reinvested in the ship's upkeep, I don't like that half of the facilities are inaccessible due to shows that could be located anywhere on the property, nor that historic spaces that could otherwise be restored, opened up, and enjoyed are kept untouched,” he says, referring to horror tours, mazes, and other attractions whose appeal lies in the fact that they take place in normally unusable areas of the ship, which are deliberately kept in their original state to give the impression that the visitor is walking through eerie ruins.

Quayle recalls that this transformation of the Queen Mary into a supposedly haunted enclave took place under Disney, when the company briefly owned it in the 1980s. With an eye toward developing a future DisneySea theme park (which it would eventually build in Tokyo in 2001), Disney created a Ghosts & Legends tour. 

“Before, nothing related to ghosts or demons was mentioned in the promotion,” says Quayle. “Disney, with its magic wand, took elements of history and exploited them to create macabre tales that had no connection to events, purely for entertainment. It was in poor taste, as the ship had decades of incredible stories to share, and Disney didn't need to invent things or embellish the truth. For better or worse, it was a resounding success.”

Rumors have been circulating ever since: accounts of German or Italian prisoners who died there, of the souls of the HMS Curacoa (which the Queen Mary sank in an accident) wandering the corridors, of children's voices heard in the old nurseries… The official website offers up to three different paranormal activities, as well as a form for tourists to submit their video or audio recordings of unexplained experiences recorded on board. 

Quayle, who insists he is not opposed to this type of entertainment, despite calling it “poisoned candy,” now hopes that, with the ship's return to the control of the city of Long Beach for the first time in 40 years, the general approach will change. Steps are being taken in that direction, further encouraged by recognitions such as the Queen Mary's designation as one of America's Historic Hotels. “Those in charge seem to appreciate that the ship is more than just a handful of stories. Its history of war and peace far surpasses any macabre spectacle.”

Berry Pomeroy Castle where Sue Perkins once met The Storyteller to film an episode of Countryfile 

Reporter: 

The Storyteller


								09 Nov 2025 10:00 AM
							
						

As I write, I'm looking forward to being a guest on a paranormal radio show that will be available online, as of Thursday 6th November. 

The host is a guy called Barnaby Jones, who runs his own paranormal investigation group based in Wisconsin, in the States. The invitation came out of the blue, and of course I accepted straightaway,  as I love any opportunity to share my stories and experiences with anyone willing to listen.

This isn't my first rodeo! Ever since TIP (Torbay Investigators of the Paranormal) was formed, back in 1995, I've always had a healthy relationship with the media, whether that be featuring in newspaper or magazine articles, as well as writing my own; chatting on radio shows and podcasts; or popping up on TV...I always enjoy the experience, and it makes me feel I'm putting the three years of training I received at drama school to good use.

During the early years, a friend of mine asked me to set up an investigation at Barton Pines,  to be carried out during a charity Halloween event they were hosting, obviously I jumped at the chance. They managed to get publicity for it, and, as it was the spooky season, the local paper ran a week's worth of articles, leading up to it, covering several spooky hotspots...the majority of which, featured TIP, as they were locations we had actually investigated, or were investigating at that time.

Then, in 1999, just as we were planning on going public, inviting other, like-minded people to come and join us at our Monday night meetings at Churston Court, the same local paper were running a supplement about spooky locations in the area, over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend, and, for the princely sum of £52...the best £52 I've ever spent...I was able to advertise our intentions. 

That weekend, I fielded many phone calls, from people expressing interest in joining us, or offering suggestions of places to investigate. Then,  on the Monday night, we had a room full of around twenty people, all eager to listen, and share their own experiences...and so it began! However, we soon found out that dealing with the media can be a bit of a double-edged sword...

Our first investigation, after going public, actually came our way via a live phone-in on a local radio station, when we were invited to visit an allegedly haunted property, by the key holders. It turned out to be an intriguing case, offering up some interesting results, which we studied for the whole Summer of 1999. As our findings mounted, we were encouraged to take it to the local press, to share what we thought was some excellent examples of paranormal phenomenon.  

However,  just before our meeting with a local journalist, it was brought to our attention that we were being hoaxed, which brought into question everything that had happened during our visits, so I was forced to cancel the journalist...unfortunately they already smelt a story, thinking that a group of Ghostbusters being caught out was juicier than genuine paranormal activity. Not only did it make a headline in the local paper, but the journalist also got it published in The Sun, with the glaring headline “Ghoulded ya!”, featured on Page 3...next to a topless beauty! 

They do say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and as luck would have it, this certainly proved true for us that day. Not only did that headline get discussed on Radio 1, but Five Live rang me up, wanting an interview about the case, and the next day, I had a call from the BBC Overseas Radio Service, saying that the story might be of interest to the troops! I've no idea who I was talking to or why, but I gave the interview anyway.

More radio work came my way, when I was invited on to John Govier's Late-Night Radio Show, on BBC Radio Devon. Myself, and my friend Maia, became monthly guests, taking calls from his listeners, and discussing a certain topic with a paranormal slant. We did that for a few years, even managing to persuade him to do some live outside broadcasts, in haunted locations. 

These included two Halloween editions, the first at The Coffin House, in Brixham, the second at the old Exeter Court House, part of the remains of Rougemont  Castle, just before it was converted into flats, office space, and a nightclub. Here members of the group picked up on an ex-convict, still residing in the holding cells below the courtroom...now the ladies' toilets in the club! 

John also held a special birthday edition of his show, in the old ABC cinema in Plymouth, at my suggestion...just as they were uncovering skeletons in the walls of the building next door! At each location, we carried out an investigation, whilst John was broadcasting, giving him regular updates on our findings throughout the show. Those were fun times.

Whilst in The Coffin House, we were featured on Spotlight local news, as a Halloween feature, through our involvement with John, and this led to further exposure via the BBC, including some filming for their Video Nation project, whereby members of the public were encouraged to film themselves indulging in their favourite pastime, or a subject they were passionate about. I filmed myself telling folklore tales up on Dartmoor, and they chose to put my version of Kitty Jay's story up on their website, where people were able to write comments, and share their own experiences of visiting the grave. This proved to be a very valuable research tool.

Another phone call from the BBC, saw myself, and other members of the group, being invited to join Sue Perkins, at Berry Pomeroy Castle, to film a segment for Countryfile. The idea was, that Sue was going to be spending the night in the castle, and they wanted the local Ghostbusters to tell her all the spooky tales pertaining to the ruins, to make her stay slightly uncomfortable. 

It was a privilege to meet Sue, and give her the guided tour of the haunted hotspots. She was a good sport, and was looking forward to spending the night in a four-poster bed...no such thing in the old ruins, as most locals would know...instead, she was given a tent to sleep in! Having erected it, she said goodnight to the viewers and zipped herself in. She didn't spend the night on the lawn in a tent, instead she headed off to a comfy hotel, further up country, as she had an appointment elsewhere the next day, but it all looked very convincing in the finished programme. 

Some of our media involvement, was actually foretold by a local medium, who we met holding a demonstration at a Torquay hotel, which we both happened to have been invited to investigate at the same time. Having shared messages with various people around the room, she finally arrived at our table. Seeing some of our equipment resting on it, she made a bold statement, claiming that, someday, the work we did, would be seen all around the world. 

We smiled sweetly, thanked her for the messages, and she moved on. My initial scepticism, proved to be misplaced, for, during the following week, I received three phone calls from people, all asking for my involvement in their paranormal projects. The first was a guy from Australia, wanting to do a live interview on his radio show...job done! The second was a guy from the National Geographic offices in Washington DC, wanting to pick my brains about the best places to go ghost hunting in the UK...happy to help! The third, and most exciting, was a call from a researcher for a South Korean TV company, who was given the brief to find an eccentric English man who did ghost hunting...and she found me! This was so much fun to be involved with. 

For a couple of days, I escorted the researcher and the director/cameraman around the area, visiting haunted locations, and taking them to some of the properties we had recently investigated. The director spoke no English, being more at home filming serious pieces for news broadcasts, but he certainly got into the spirit of this particular assignment, having some very specific ideas of what he wanted to film, causing me a bit of grief into the bargain! We got told to stop filming in the Thai restaurant in Palace Avenue, when some fellow diners offered up a ghost story that they were willing to share on camera. Then the owners of a certain haunted property, that we visited, took umbrage, when the director insisted on filming in their bedroom, where their particular story had taken place, and we had subsequently investigated. 

They drew the line, when he wanted to film in their ensuite bathroom...we were no longer welcome to visit them after that! On a lighter note, when I took them to visit Lydford Church, next to the castle, the director spotted headstones with the surname Phillips on. He filmed me walking amongst them, to illustrate the fact I might be communing with my ancestors...probably not. Then, when I took them to meet a family, whose house we had recently investigated, they weren't home at the arranged time. As we waited outside, the director asked the mediums amongst us, where they thought they might be. The general consensus was, that they had gone shopping.  

He filmed their arrival back home, and got very excited, when they emerged from their car, carrying shopping bags! He even zoomed in, to emphasise the fact! The finished piece was dubbed in to Korean, and then shown in front of a live studio audience, before being broadcast around the country. Judging by their reaction, it was most enjoyable, and I'm quite proud to have that amongst my collection of TIP's time in the spotlight.

With this next interview imminent, I guess I'd better get ready for my close up...as they say in the business!

It's official: San Antonio Spurs fans are cooking right now when it comes to nicknames, the latest being ""Area 51."" Of course, that refers to Victor Wembanyama, who already has an alien-themed nickname and wears number 1, while Stephon Castle wears number 5. Area 51 itself is in the Nevada Air Base, with alien rumors swirling, adding to the cleverness of the nickname.


With Wembanyama and Castle emerging as a dynamic duo, Spurs fans are understandably interested in seeing more of the pairing. Castle has been tasked with playing point guard to start the season and has been responsible for running the offense and getting Wembanyama the ball. 


He has also been the team's second-leading scorer in the absence of De'Aaron Fox, helping the Spurs to a 7-2 start. His knack for attacking the basket, finishing in traffic, and tendency to draw free throws at an extraterrestrial rate have helped him make a big leap in his sophomore season. 


Meanwhile, Wembanyama has changed his game dramatically, taking far fewer threes and replacing those shots with much higher percentage attempts in the paint. That has also helped him draw more free throws, pushing his scoring average up this season.


With Castle and Wembanyama both taking a huge step forward, the Spurs should be loving what they are seeing out of Area 51.


The Spurs re-signed Fox with the intention of making him Wembanyama's co-star, but Castle's emergence is an intriguing development. He is developing faster than expected, even though there were some concerns about his shooting and what position he would play in the NBA. 


After turning the ball over 42 times in the team's first nine games, he has had some growing pains as a lead playmaker. That being said, it has been for the best. Despite the Spurs getting punched in their collective teeth against the Phoenix Suns, Castle had arguably his best all-around game. 


He played physical defense against Devin Booker, looked comfortable being the primary shot creator while keeping his turnovers down, and confidently knocked down shots. Add in that he was able to get to the rim and the free-throw line, and it was a glimpse into an exciting future for Castle.


Fox now back, it will be fascinating to see how the trio plays together. Fox may limit Castle's production with him handling the ball more, resulting in fewer touches for Castle, who needs the ball to attack the paint or get to the line. 


Or, as I suspect, Fox could help unlock other parts of Castle's game. Castle's jumper has been much better this season, and his playing off-ball means that he will have to take more jumpers, possibly allowing him to become a true shooting guard. 


He'll still have plenty of opportunities to create with the ball in his hands, but far fewer than he does now. That might be for the best, with him being able to further cut down on his turnovers and play to his strengths. 


As a physical driver who can get into the paint and finish or earn trips to the line, being forced to pick his spots and shoot more from outside could be just what he needs. That would allow him to finish rounding out his game and become the Spurs' third star.


Ultimately, the Spurs' early-season success has been a result of Wembanyama and Castle's improved play. Having both players level up has suddenly transformed the Spurs into contenders, with Area 51 officially becoming a problem for the rest of the NBA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Alien Probes May Already Be Hiding in Our Solar System, Study Suggests","https://indiandefencereview.com/alien-probes-may-already-hiding-solar-system/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 12:15:00 GMT","





Self-replicating alien probes may already be operating in our solar system, quietly carrying out long-term missions. A recent study suggests these probes could be hiding in plain sight, waiting to be discovered.

These so-called von Neumann probes, named after the mathematician who conceptualized them, could potentially explain the absence of direct contact with alien civilizations—if we know where, and how, to look.

The idea is not new. The concept of machines capable of reproducing themselves and traveling vast interstellar distances was introduced by John von Neumann in the mid-20th century. Over time, scientists involved in SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) have considered these probes as one of the most efficient ways an advanced species could explore the galaxy. Now, a new paper by Professor Alex Ellery, an engineer at Carleton University's Centre for Self-Replication Research, is reigniting interest in this hypothesis by pointing out that such probes may have already visited—if not remain operational—in the solar system.

The study, published as a preprint and highlighted by Universe Today, emphasizes that future SETI efforts should expand beyond the search for radio signals and focus instead on hunting for technosignatures left behind by these potential machines.

According to Ellery's findings, self-replicating probes would likely follow a systematic, resource-efficient process. They would begin by harvesting materials from moons and asteroids, chosen for their accessible raw components. From there, they would produce smaller survey units to scout the environment, identify rich locations, and set up manufacturing hubs to support replication.

Once operational, these factories would generate more probes—not only to replicate themselves, but also to conduct reconnaissance. These activities, in turn, could lead to more advanced missions, including long-term observation or even engineering projects such as O'Neill cylinders. The final steps might even include the seeding of life on suitable planets, a notion known as Directed Panspermia.

The predictable pattern of their activities, Ellery argues, would likely generate detectable technosignatures. These could include unusual isotope ratios or subsurface magnetic anomalies, particularly on the Moon, which he identifies as an ideal staging ground due to its composition and proximity.

The paper challenges the romantic idea that space exploration is primarily driven by the pursuit of knowledge. As Ellery explains in comments to Universe Today, the driving forces behind such missions might be far more utilitarian—or even existential.

He argues that survival would be the primary incentive. Whether facing the threat of stellar evolution, hostile civilizations, or runaway technologies, advanced species might choose to send autonomous machines as military scouts, colonization tools, or even as cultural emissaries. “Science per se is not much of a driver,” he noted. “Usually, greed or escape underlies exploration.”

Furthermore, self-replicating probes would not be limited by biological constraints. They wouldn't need oxygen, food, or complex life support. With no fear of high-G acceleration and the ability to extract raw materials from asteroids or even interstellar debris, they could explore space indefinitely—quietly, efficiently, and persistently.

Ellery's research positions the Moon as a potential hotspot for finding traces of alien technology. As human missions to the lunar surface increase—with NASA and other agencies planning sustained exploration—he recommends that technosignature detection become part of the agenda.

According to his study, specific isotopes like Thorium-232, Neodynium-144, and Barium-137 might reveal the presence of nuclear-powered replication systems. These materials could indicate that probes had once operated nearby—or still do. The Moon's rich subsurface metals, particularly nickel, cobalt, and tungsten, would have made it an ideal target for resource extraction.

Ellery even raises the possibility that advanced civilizations might leave behind “gifts”, such as buried universal constructor machines—technologies only accessible to species that reach a certain level of advancement. While speculative, this idea points toward the need for a broader definition of SETI success, one that accounts for indirect signs of intelligent life rather than explicit communication.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural Season 16 Can Bring Dean Back From The Dead Permanently, Despite Season 15's Ending","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-season-16-bring-dean-winchester-back-from-the-dead/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 03:30:00 GMT","

Supernatural did the thinkable in season 15's finale, as Dean Winchester met his untimely end. As much as Dean's death may have been foreseen, however, the manner of it was not. Rather than making a grand sacrifice to save the world from a biblical threat, Dean was impaled on an unfortunately-placed spike by a no-name vampire during a routine hunt.

The disappointment of Dean's death, combined with various other unsatisfying elements of Supernatural's last episode, only amplified the calls for season 16 that began as soon as the show's ending was announced. While official news on Supernatural season 16 has been unforthcoming over the past 5 years, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki have each expressed their willingness to return when the time is right, all but guaranteeing the Winchester brothers will be back on our screens sooner rather than later.

 It goes without saying that, were Supernatural season 16 to ever happen, Sam and Dean Winchester would need to be reunited. As The CW's string of failed spinoffs can attest, there is no Supernatural without the two brothers working together.

Dean's death actually does very little to impede the siblings teaming up in a potential revival. As seen in The Winchesters, Dean enjoys more or less free rein roaming around different realities, so if his own timeline came under threat and Sam needed help, Dean could quite easily pop down to Earth on a temporary visit. As such, it's incredibly likely that Supernatural season 16 would be a ""one last case"" arrangement where Dean is given leave from the afterlife to assist Sam and protect the world from the latest spooky bad guy.

The tragic expectation, however, would be that Dean ascends back to Heaven once again when Supernatural season 16's case is closed.

Supernatural's finale all but confirms this, as we see flashes of Sam's life without Dean, right up until his own demise as an old man in a terrible wig. From the way they embrace in Heaven to Old Man Sam owning the Impala, everything in those final moments strongly gives the impression that Sam spends the entire second half of his life sans Dean. In order to keep that continuity intact, Supernatural season 16 would be obliged to end with Dean Winchester remaining dead... right?

 Dean Winchester dying in Supernatural's final episode had been a long time coming. Throughout the later seasons, Dean was increasingly depicted as a warhorse hunter destined to die on the battlefield. As mentioned previously, however, the manner of Dean's last hunt proved disappointing. The Winchesters then removed any weight behind it by confirming Dean isn't exactly stuck in Heaven.

At this point, it would be better for Supernatural to drop the idea of Dean being dead altogether. The show had an opportunity to kill off Dean properly in season 15's finale. It botched the execution, and now it's time to backtrack by giving Dean a different fate.

Because there is another fitting ending that Dean could have after Supernatural season 16, and it involves a storyline from the main show that was never completely finished: Lisa and Ben.

After living with Lisa and her (potentially their) son between Supernatural seasons 5 and 6, Dean ended up realizing that his presence put the pair in danger. He had their memories wiped and never spoke of them again, but there's no doubt Lisa and Ben represented Dean's ""happily ever after.""

The most satisfying ending for Jensen Ackles' character in Supernatural season 16 would be a reunion with the family he left behind, and closure on an unfinished relationship that remains arguably Dean's biggest regret right up until Supernatural's final episode. As an added bonus, further Supernatural revivals could then avoid the obstacle of bringing Dean back from the dead altogether.

The only problem would be how Supernatural can align Dean coming permanently back to life and having a family with Sam's flashforward from the series finale, in which Dean is very clearly still deceased.

 The best way Supernatural can revive Dean while still accounting for the montage at the end of season 15 is to redefine Sam's later life from ""the"" future to ""a"" future.

Thanks to both the main show and The Winchesters, Supernatural is well-versed in the notion of alternate realities and changing the future. The Winchesters' very premise was built around it. Sam's post-finale timeline isn't necessarily set in stone, and could be reworked into just a glimpse of a potential future he would have in a timeline where Dean stays dead. In Supernatural's main timeline, however, Dean could return from the dead and everything in the flashforward would shift accordingly.

Under normal circumstances, blatantly backtracking on a flashforward could be viewed as a lazy retcon, but given the lack of love afforded to Supernatural's final episode - everything from Sam's older appearance to Dean's lackluster last hunt - it seems unlikely many would complain about Supernatural quietly relegating Sam's later years from official canon.

Sam's own happy ending wouldn't need to change, of course. He can still meet the same blurry woman we saw in Supernatural, have the same son, buy the same ridiculous cardigan, etc. The only difference would be Dean joining him for the ride... and keeping the Impala, obviously.

What if they made a spy series for goth kids? That question has been answered with Talamasca: The Secret Order, the latest branch in AMC's firmly rooted tree of Anne Rice adaptations.

The new series is part of the expanding Anne Rice's Immortal Universe, and the third show to launch following Interview With The Vampire and Mayfair Witches. (Additional series, Night Island and Memnoch the Devil, are in various states of development, but are not an official go yet.)

Talamasca stars Nicholas Denton as a new recruit into an agency (called Talamasca) that monitors the activities of the various supernatural beings that populate Rice's stories. Elizabeth McGovern, William Fichtner, and Maisie Richardson-Sellers fill out the cast.

David Gennard/AMC

Rice, of course, was the phenomenally successful New Orleans-based author of fantasy literature whose well-worn paperbacks still adorn every Airbnb you've ever stayed at, and whose diehard fans continue to grow in number despite her no longer being of mortal plane (though considering her subject matter, this does seem appropriate).

It's entirely possible that you've been itching for a Talamasca series ever since you first read the group mentioned by name in the 1988 best-seller Queen of the Damned (no doubt while playing Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me by the Cure in your dimly lit bedroom). Or you may be someone who always wanted to get into Anne Rice, but never picked up a book, saw any of the movie adaptations, and have slept on the previous AMC series. Is it possible for someone in this situation to jump in?

The answer, of course, is yes (and Denton's character Guy Anatole is your perfect audience surrogate to this hidden-in-plain-sight world.) But if you'd like a little cheat sheet for the mythical creatures that permeate Anne Rice's Immortal Universe, we are here for you.

Sophie Giraud/AMC

Let's start with the beings that built Anne Rice into a household name: vampires. With Interview With a Vampire and The Vampire Lestat, Rice brought new life to the undead, presenting vampires as sympathetic, lonely outsiders dwelling in the shadows of world history. Sure, they need to feast on the blood of humans to survive from time to time, but who among us can claim to be entirely without sin?

With eternal life, Rice's vampires achieve a remarkable physical beauty, but also an ennui that have made these characters so richly loved by millions of readers. They don't transform into bats or other creatures and can see their reflection in mirrors, unlike other fictional vampires, and garlic and holy water don't trouble them. They have enhanced strength and speed, and sometimes can levitate, but are not particularly keen on sunlight or fire in general.

Spirits are disembodied beings who are occasionally called upon to aid specific humans (usually witches), but can sometimes become harmful. Think of it like borrowing money from your pain-in-the-butt relative who will always want something back in return.

The origins of this species remains a little hazy, but it is believed that they are the souls of humans who have escaped from Hell. The journey and long spans of time, however, make their memories a bit untrustworthy. Others believe that spirits were never mortal beings.

Skip Bolen/AMC

Witches in Rice's world are humans born with special supernatural sensitivities, oftentimes extra sensory perceptions or the power of telekinesis. The ability to practice witchcraft is usually genetic, but not always.

Most witches are women, but there are some men, too, like Julien Mayfair. (Rice doesn't like sticking to preestablished rules, explaining much of her popularity.) Their powers are connected to specific spirits, whom they can manipulate to their advantage in a crutch, like to make a drastic change in weather or to help locate someone or something.

We're basically getting into monster cereals territory here, but mummies play a big part in Rice's fiction. They aren't usually called mummies, though, but rather Immortals.

They first come up in The Vampire Chronicles as a legend — creatures impervious to death who aren't harmed by sunlight. Over time, we learn their origins are with the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, who drank a stolen, magical elixir.

Rice awakened the Immortals (including Cleopatra) in the early 1900s. Oddly enough, it was the third book in this series about eternal life that Rice was working on when she passed away. (Her son Christopher Rice coauthored its published version.)

Leigh Page/AMC

First introduced in 1990's The Witching Hour and given prime focus in Taltos four years later, the taltos are a species that, on first glance, look human, but are usually taller, thinner, and have bones mostly made of cartilage.

In ancient times, the taltos, who originated in the very north of today's Scotland, tended to be rather clumsy and childlike. Among their unusual abilities was that they matured rapidly after birth, and the females of the species can ovulate on demand.

In the modern era, the crossbreeding of witches can sometimes result in a taltos birth. The taltos have superior strength and an enhanced libido.

Rice wrote two werewolf books, and while the species did not directly crossover with the vampires of The Vampire Chronicles or the witches from Lives of the Mayfair Witches, they did interact with the Talamasca, giving them the connective tissue to the wider Rice universe. Though The Wolf Gift Chronicles sold well, they were poorly received by readers. (If you want to see some howling reviews, poke around on Reddit.) So the Talamasca television series may end up being just the right venue to redeem these characters in the expanding Immortal Universe.

Skip Bolen/AMC

Ghosts are different from spirits. They are the souls of mortal beings who have died, but can become visible to witches (or other groups that have supernatural sensitivities). They can sometimes inhabit corporeal form, though it's not easy — and just temporary.

Ghosts aren't just humans — witches and taltos can die, and so can vampires (though it takes some extra effort) — so in a way, ghosts aren't really their own species. They are more of a ""state of being,"" one could say, but their traits are altered by their beyond-the-grave status.

Angels are noncorporeal creatures who exist outside of typical time and space. They were created before there ever was time and matter, and they cannot be perceived by mortals. Their main gig is to perceive the Universe and remark upon its beauty.

One such angel, however, decided to rebel against this way of life. His name was Memnoch, though most of us know him as Satan or the Devil.

As is central to Rice's fiction, the fallen angel gets his day in court, presenting his perspective in what is considered by many to be the strangest entry in the corpus, Memnoch the Devil, which is either a thrilling dialogue about the nature of good and evil or a boring philosophy text, depending on your point of view.

David Gennard/AMC

This does not involve Leonardo DiCaprio trudging through the snow and eating buffalo hearts, but in Rice's world, revenants have it pretty rough.

They are mortals who are in the process of being turned into vampires (""The Dark Gift,"" it is called), but are buried, entombed, or prevented in some way from feeding for long enough that their evolution is prevented — and they go a little nutty. I mean, think about how upset you get when you skip lunch, now draw that out for a millennia or so.

The revenants in Anne Rice's Immortal Universe on AMC thus far have functioned essentially as ""zombie vampires"" — mindless, dangerous, and certainly gross.

Okay, here's where it gets really weird. Replimoids are extra-terrestrial golems created by beings from the planet Bravenna called ""The Parents."" They were dispatched to Earth to assassinate a rogue named Amel, a spirit who is actually the progenitor of the vampire race. The replimoids rebelled against their creators and have been hanging around ever since.

They are mortal but have extremely long lifespans, and can basically pass for human. They reproduce by severing a limb and growing a new replimoid from that limb and regrowing back their own missing body part — frugal and efficient!

Each generation of replimoid is a little less like the ones originally made by ""The Parents"" — you can kinda tell by how much gold is in their hair. 

Another creation that appears in Rice's fiction is God. For it is He who created the angels, and thus Memnoch, a fallen angel, who God basically sees as the loyal opposition. There is a reason that Rice, who first renounced then rejoined her faith, often found her books banned.

Mark and Marla Palumbo were concerned when their friend and business partner Dr. Henry Han failed to show up for a meeting on March 23, 2016. They would learn the horrific reason why the following day from a news report.

Marla Palumbo: I was in the kitchen on my computer and I kept checking … And I just remember screaming, ""they're all dead.""

Dr. Han, his wife Jennie, and their 5-year-old daughter Emily were found dead in the garage of their Santa Barbara home. Mark Palumbo had just seen them on his way back from a business trip.

Mark Palumbo: We went out for dinner … played Connect Four with Emily.

Marla Palumbo: He brought his phone to me and I'm just looking at all these pictures of Emily … and they were … taken the Friday before …

Natalie Morales: Just horrific.

Marla Palumbo: Yeah. … and she's just goofing around with a book … making all these funny faces and … you could tell … she was loving life.

The Palumbos had recently embarked on a new business venture with Dr. Han.

Mark Palumbo: I really loved the guy. I mean he really was smart and curious and open-minded …

Marla Palumbo: He had to come with food … and in shorts and flip-flops you know … just no …  air about him.

Natalie Morales: But what made you trust him?

Marla Palumbo: His passion.

Mark Palumbo: Yeah. The way he cared about people.

Don Goldberg had known Dr. Han for more than 25 years and thought of him as a brother. To Goldberg, he was just ""Henry.""

Don Goldberg: I was … approximately 10 years older than Henry, but he still called me his younger brother. … you just don't come across a friend like Henry … It's once in a lifetime friendship.

When they met, Henry Han was making a name for himself after emigrating from China, where he came from a family of physicians. He would soon take over the Santa Barbara Herb Clinic. 

Dr. Glenn Miller: I had several patients … who had had medication side effects … They would say … I went to see Doctor Han … and it went away. … And it was like, I gotta meet this guy.

Dr. Glenn Miller, a psychiatrist, says he and Henry Han developed a mutual respect and even partnered on a book about how Eastern and Western medicine could work together to improve patients' quality of life. 

Dr. Glenn Miller: Henry's practice was flourishing … as far as active patients, he would see like in a month, it was hundreds … but he also tried to balance it.

In 2009, that balance he was seeking became a reality, when Henry met and married Jennie Yu.

Dr. Glenn Miller: He seemed incredibly happy … It was good to see Henry that happy.

Marla Palumbo: Jennie … was absolutely warm and lovely.

When they had Emily, the dream was complete.

Don Goldberg: Henry was just … on cloud nine. He was very proud father.

They were often together at the clinic, where Jennie had quickly become Henry's right hand, says her friend Isaiah Oregon.

Isaiah Oregon: He really trusted her and let her kind of take the reins …

In the spring of 2016, they were getting ready to celebrate Emily's 6th birthday. 

Isaiah Oregon: We were making plans for her birthday party and … you know, had all her presents wrapped. 

But just three days shy of her birthday, her loved ones were stricken with grief.

Don Goldberg: I don't really have adequate words to describe h — how I felt … The sadness … is too deep.

As night fell on the Han estate on Wednesday, March 23, Goldberg tried to process what he had just witnessed. He had called 911 when he couldn't find the Hans anywhere, and he was with sheriff's deputies when they discovered the bodies in the garage wrapped in plastic. 

Don Goldberg: None of it made any sense at all.

Prosecutor Ben Ladinig says it was shortly before midnight when Santa Barbara sheriff's investigators obtained a search warrant and began to piece together what had happened inside the house. It appeared the family had been shot while they slept upstairs on the second floor — Henry in the couple's bedroom, and Jennie and Emily across the hall in Emily's room.

Ben Ladinig: Emily's room was tough to see … Mom … probably read her stories to have Emily go to sleep that night and was sleeping with her.

Natalie Morales: What did that tell you about the depravity of the kind of person who could do something like that? … What were they after?

Ben Ladinig: We didn't know what he was after. But … the depravity I've never seen anything like it.

Detectives picked up on the distinct smell of the murderer's attempts to cover his tracks.

Ben Ladinig: The smell of bleach … was there. …We had bleach bottles found … There were bleach … stains on the carpet and throughout other items upstairs … and then you see bloody things in … a washing machine.

All the bedding, which had been stripped from the beds was found piled in the laundry room and in the machine.

Ben Ladinig: The washing machine, the alarm had gone off because it — the load was unbalanced. And within there are a huge group of bloody sheets …

Wedged in pillows in the laundry, crime scene investigators found a .22 caliber bullet and bullet fragments. Three matching shell casings were found within the wrapping of Jennie's body, and one was later found lodged between the baseboard and box spring of Emily's bed. 

Ben Ladinig: We had one bullet that was a through and through … it was perfect for comparison … for … the murder weapon. 

Ben Ladinig: As things are going, we start to find clues as to … who potentially could be involved. 

Inside a paper bag next to Henry's bed, detectives found a document signed the last day Henry was seen alive. It provided a name.

Ben Ladinig: It's basically a four-page business contract between two partners. Partner one, Pierre Haobsh, and partner two, Dr. Han.

Don Goldberg knew a Pierre that Dr. Han was associated with, but Goldberg thought he was harmless.

Don Goldberg: I did not think that … Pierre was capable of … murder … I never really saw Pierre become angry or agitated. 

But the Palumbos had a bad feeling.

Natalie Morales: You didn't trust him?

Mark Palumbo: I did not.

The indelible scar left by the murders was the kind that not even Dr. Han could've healed.

Kymberlee Ruff: It was like a bomb exploded … Nobody could move for weeks. … There is something … very, very, very dark going on. 

Kymberlee Ruff says Dr. Han treated her family for two decades — ever since she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer shortly after giving birth to her son. Ruff says Dr. Han's holistic approach allowed her to nurse her newborn while still treating her tumors.

Kymberlee Ruff: He could do anything. … No matter how scared you might be, or- or frightened, you just left feeling like it's gonna be OK. Yeah, he was something.

Instilling hope may have been one of the secrets to why his patients say Dr. Han could heal just about anything.

Sheri Buron: Dr. Han, like, saved my life.

Sheri Buron was also a young mother with cancer when she went to Dr. Han.

Sheri Buron: My daughter, Abbey, was 15 months old … I felt a lump under my armpit.

Even though she had the prescribed surgery and chemotherapy, she credits Dr. Han with her survival.

Sheri Buron: There were so many people that passed away around me. … He got me through it.

Natalie Morales: What was the impact for you of his loss?

Sheri Buron: It's the fear of … if something comes back. … And I'm … trying every day to be positive and … try to stay with his level of calm and how much confidence he had that like everything's taken care of. 

That conviction is what had drawn the Palumbos — who worked in the skincare industry — into their partnership with Dr. Han, hoping to treat various skin maladies. 

Marla Palumbo: Henry was very interested in CBD.

Having used CBD in his practice to treat pain and inflammation, Henry Han wanted to harness its full potential. It was groundbreaking science at the time, and he wanted 25-year-old Pierre Haobsh to help develop it.

Don Goldberg: Pierre … from what we gathered had a lot of experience, uh, in laboratories … in this case relating to CBD.

Henry Han had taken a liking to Haobsh after meeting him through another associate, but the Palumbos were uncomfortable with Pierre from the start.

Marla Palumbo: You know how when you meet somebody … you can't put your finger on it … but something's not right. That was Pierre.

Mark Palumbo: It was always this kind of little boiling simmer.

When it came time to do the lab work, the Palumbos say the results were disturbing. 

Marla Palumbo: What we came to find out was he was using toxic materials … when … we called him on it … he said, you know, ""I'm just learning more about the molecules"" … it was just weird. 

As it turned out, Haobsh wasn't a formally trained scientist. He didn't even have a college degree.

Mark Palumbo: The more you got under that surface, the more you realize that he could, uh, talk a game and stay over the folks' heads a bit scientifically …

Natalie Morales: Sounds like he was sort of … a snake oil salesman-type, right?

Marla Palumbo: He was —

Mark Palumbo:  — sophisticated one, but yes —

Marla Palumbo: Yeah, very sophisticated one.

There was more eyebrow-raising behavior — Haobsh had also made odd charges on Henry Han's account.

Marla Palumbo: I was doing all the finances … And I'm like, this doesn't look right.

Natalie Morales: Not a business expense —

Marla Palumbo: Not at all.

After Marla Palumbo flagged the charges to Henry Han, he discovered they were for escort services.

Marla Palumbo: Henry was, ""You won't believe this! Pierre's out.""

Natalie Morales: That was the final straw.

Marla Palumbo: That was Henry's final straw.

Mark Palumbo: For Henry, yeah.

But then, a few weeks before the murders, the Palumbos say Henry Han brought up Pierre Haobsh out of the blue. 

Marla Palumbo: Henry mentioned that he had learned a lot more about Pierre's upbringing … how much Pierre had to overcome from his childhood. … Mark nor I really responded. We didn't want to have Pierre back in our fold at all. 

The Palumbos were not alone in being wary of Pierre Haobsh. Jennie Han's friend, Isaiah Oregon, says Jennie also had concerns and confided in him about them four days before the murders. 

Isaiah Oregon: It was weighing on her heavily. … ""Do we trust him? … Do we give him another chance?"" … I was like, ""Absolutely not."" … If he stole from you before, he's gonna steal from you again.""

But Pierre Haobsh had already ingratiated himself back into Henry's good will.

Don Goldberg: Henry had a very trusting nature … Henry had shared with me that Pierre told him that he was … ill … that it was late-stage cancer and that, uh, he was going to do what he could to help Pierre.

Isaiah Oregon: Using Henry's good nature … by lying to him, by manipulating him.

Authorities learned that Haobsh had been an overnight guest at the Han's home before the murders and had formed a new partnership with the healer. There was that contract found in the master bedroom they had signed the last day of Henry's life. But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig says it didn't seem legitimate.

Ben Ladinig: It … was like a college sophomore drafted it. … It was not notarized, not witnessed.

Detectives had found something else of interest.

Ben Ladinig: A brilliant detective …  found … packaging to … the plastic … wrapping … that all three of the Han family were wrapped in … In a trash can, in the kitchen area next to packaging … of 3M duct tape, similar to the duct tape that was used to wrap all three of the bodies.

He recognized the plastic wrap was a Home Depot brand and reached out to the company's security department. 

Ben Ladinig: And Home Depot was, within hours of us … gaining an entry into the house, able to run those two items together, to see if they had been purchased in the Southern California region within the last several days or weeks.

A Home Depot in Oceanside, California, had security footage of a man who matched the DMV photo of Pierre Haobsh, who also happened to have an Oceanside address. 

Ben Ladinig: And that was ""Bam!"" We knew. … He's walking out with three huge plastic rolls … and sure enough, duct tape.

Natalie Morales: So within hours of … the crime scene being discovered, Pierre Haobsh became … a person of interest.

Ben Ladinig: Yes.

But where was Haobsh now? Detectives had a hunch. Data from the Hans' cellphones — which were missing — showed they were traveling south, further, and further from Santa Barbara.

Ben Ladinig: Then inexplicably, Henry's phone goes dark … but Jennie's is still on and it keeps going south. …We're getting basically digital footprints leading down to the Oceanside area from a dead woman's phone.

Sgt. Anthony Flores (driving): Anytime you're trying to stop somebody that is wanted for homicide, the stakes are gonna be high.

The day after the Han family was found murdered, a manhunt was underway in Oceanside, California — nearly 200 miles from the crime scene. Sgt. Anthony Flores and his partner were part of the local Oceanside Police team assisting the Santa Barbara investigation.

Sgt. Anthony Flores: We had come in to work with our Special Enforcement section … And we were gonna be the stop car for that day. … If … given a window of opportunity … to take him into custody or potentially stop him.

Meanwhile, undercover detectives were conducting surveillance at the residence Pierre Haobsh shared with his father and updating all units — including the homicide team that had driven down from Santa Barbara with Prosecutor Ben Ladinig.

Ben Ladinig: All of a sudden, we get chatter … on our intercoms … ""dad's on the move.""

The surveillance team followed Pierre Haobsh's father as he drove to a Walmart parking lot, where security cameras captured him meeting up with none other than Pierre.

Ben Ladinig: That's dad driving in … sedan and then you see the Lexus following shortly behind … They appear to be communicating briefly together … you can just see that trunk pop — on dad's car.

After transferring two large duffel bags to Pierre Haobsh's car, they both drove off.

Ben Ladinig: We gotta move quickly.

Sgt. Anthony Flores (driving): It was … a little after midnight and … we had just got the update that the suspect was on the move … As we're traveling, we're hearing that he's pulling into the ARCO station.

Sgt. Anthony Flores: He had a few miles of a head start.

The other units and Ladinig had pulled over by the ARCO station waiting for the arrest team to arrive. 

Ben Ladinig: Then all of a sudden, you see … an unmarked car … drive right through the middle of that intersection … sparks fly and … it just basically comes in, pulls in and lays on the brakes … Two huge dudes get outta the car and pull gun on him and prone him out. And our eyes are like saucers. We're like, whoa.

Natalie Morales: Wow.

Natalie Morales (at ARCO station): It's 200 miles away that this investigation started and it culminated here.

Sergeant Flores had handcuffed Pierre Haobsh.

Natalie Morales (at ARCO station): What do you remember about that arrest?

Sgt. Anthony Flores: I remember it going down really fast …  all of our senses were heightened ...

Within 48 hours of the murders, investigators had the Han family's alleged killer in custody. Pierre Haobsh waived his Miranda rights and started talking to detectives. What he told them was something out of a spy thriller. He claimed that his life was in danger.

PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): Over the past couple of days, I—I kid you not I've been shot at. … probably about five individuals so far that I shot in self-defense.

He claimed he was being targeted because of a scientific marvel he had invented.

DET. HENDERSON: What does it do?

PIERRE HAOBSH: It's, um, it's a very, very advanced energy source. … it's — it's a quantum kinda energy source. … I think probably at least 15 individuals who have been connected to this project are — are dead.

Pierre Haobsh said he had gone to Dr. Han's house earlier in the week to install one of his perpetual energy devices and that the plastic wrap and duct tape he was seen purchasing were for that purpose.

PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): Dr. Henry, we, um, we signed a contract together … he was going to facilitate taking the technology out to China. … love— love the guy to death. … he really, um, really liked this project … 

Pierre Haobsh said he had left Santa Barbara around 2 p.m. on March  22 — the day before the murders — after signing the contract. But detectives pushed back.

DET. HENDERSON: There's more to this story that you're not telling me. … Dr. Han is dead.

PIERRE HAOBSH: What!? … I had —no clue that — oh my gosh. Everything was perfectly fine when I left.

Pierre Haobsh was adamant he would never hurt the family and insisted the shadowy figures who had been after him had killed the Hans and were trying to frame him for murder.

PIERRE HAOBSH (to detective): … I invented a technology that changes the world… oil companies and people don't want this technology out there.

Ben Ladinig: It was this massive conspiracy to keep this … next-level energy system from getting out to market. … ""James Bond,"" ""Mission Impossible"" … this fantastical life.

Pierre Haobsh's outlandish story continued, but then detectives received an unexpected call from someone who claimed to have information about the murders.

TJ Direda: I'm a pretty rough around the edges guy … I have rough around the edges friends.

TJ Direda was a marijuana grower who said Dr. Han had approached him about supplying CBD-rich strains. Direda had also met Pierre Haobsh.

TJ Direda: Dr. Henry had told me … that he was … like a prodigy street chemist … he had done some stuff that was ahead of his time.

Natalie Morales:  So, a little bit of a mad scientist?

TJ Direda: Yeah, I would say.

Natalie Morales: Perhaps, yeah.

According to Direda, Pierre Haobsh had a penchant for making up grandiose stories to seek attention. But he befriended him, nonetheless.

TJ Direda: He was … that … awkward … kid that wanted to fit in. … And … I was the guy in high school that stuck up for kids like that … So … I, uh, took an interest in him … in that regard. …

Natalie Morales: You think he trusted you then?

TJ Direda: Oh, he absolutely trusted me. 

As Direda revealed to detectives, Pierre Haobsh had reached out to him via text the morning of the murders. The message sent at 09:39 a.m. said: ""I need your help with something urgently... Like its urgent!!!!!""

Natalie Morales: What was he asking for?

TJ Direda: Uh, he needed my help. … moving something.

He says Pierre Haobsh told him he was in Santa Barbara and needed to talk face to face. So Direda had him come to his house in Thousand Oaks, about an hour away.

TJ Direda: The first thing out of his mouth … ""just so you know, I'm a monster."" … He had told me right then and there that he had killed Dr. Henry … his wife and his child … and needed help …

Natalie Morales: Did he give you details … of what he did?

TJ Direda: He did.

Direda told detectives Pierre Haobsh said he had tried to put the bodies in his car, but they wouldn't all fit and Henry was too heavy — details Ladinig says only the killer would know.

Ben Ladinig: How the killings were done, how the bodies were wrapped up … how he had the doctor's phone …

Direda told detectives Pierre Haobsh had also revealed his motive: $20 million that he planned to drain from Henry's accounts after killing the family. Direda says he didn't know if what he was hearing was another one of Haobsh's far-fetched stories. And until he knew for sure, he decided to play along.

TJ Direda: I just wanted to get him out of the house and confirm whether what he had just said was true or not. … I said let me work on it and I'll call you later …

Once Pierre Haobsh was gone, Direda tried to reach Dr. Han and anyone who might have information, to no avail. 

TJ Direda: I didn't want to call the police because I didn't — I wasn't sure yet … it was chaotic. It was … it was scary and also … confusing. 

Pierre Haobsh kept messaging him. Around 5 p.m., when Direda still hadn't provided any assistance, Haobsh texted him with a proposition.

Natalie Morales: ""Want to come to Vegas tonight? I'll pay."" What did you think the reason for that all-of-a-sudden trip to Vegas?

TJ Direda: At that point, I wasn't sure. It didn't sound right … He was probably gonna kill me and somehow make it look like I had something to do with it.

Natalie Morales: You were gonna be the fall guy.

TJ Direda: Right.

Direda made up an excuse why he couldn't go. And Haobsh would send him one final text at 7:35 p.m. that night: ""Yep. Am screwed. They just found everything. My lives over. Only if I got to it all sooner.""

Ladinig says Pierre Haobsh had just returned to the crime scene with a big truck to transport the bodies, but law enforcement had beaten him to the scene. 

Ben Ladinig: He knew his goose was cooked.

Pierre Haobsh's arrest near Oceanside, California, had come at a critical juncture. He was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun that was in plain view on the driver's side floorboard. He also had his passport and those duffel bags, which he had received from his father minutes earlier.

Ben Ladinig: Two ""go bags."" … Basically, whatever you need, clothes … everything for the person to live for months.

Haobsh's father was also detained and questioned, but he was released later that morning.

Ben Ladinig: We could've charged him … as an accessory, but we didn't have any indication. … that dad … was involved in any way, shape, or form in the killing …

The next day, during a closer examination of Haobsh's car at the crime lab, ""You name it we found it in that car,"" said Ladinig.

There was Henry's wallet, credit card and Social Security number, along with an expended shell casing. There were also the victims' phones and tablet, all wrapped in aluminum foil, in an attempt to evade tracking.

Ben Ladinig: And in the trunk ... you lift up where the spare tire would be … the murder weapon … suppressor silencer, ammunition.

A week after the murders, the autopsies revealed the victims had been shot 14 times — three each into Henry and Jennie, and most disturbing, eight in Emily. 

Ben Ladinig: That ammunition … is the same stuff that we found at the crime scene, in the decedent's bodies … Match, match, match, match, match. Everything.

Pierre Haobsh was charged with three counts of first-degree murder, making him eligible for the death penalty. 

Defense attorney Christine Voss, who was with the Public Defender's Office at the time, represented Haobsh.

Christine Voss: It was one of the most challenging cases, if not the most challenging case I ever came upon. … He really wanted to be vindicated. … To me, the goal was for him to not get death.

At the eleventh hour, the D.A.'s office agreed to waive the death penalty in exchange for a more expedient bench trial, which meant a judge, not a jury, would render a verdict.

On Oct. 25, 2021 more than five-and-a-half years after the murders, the prosecution delivered its opening statement and laid out its theory of the case — that Pierre Haobsh had plotted the murder of the Han family for financial gain. They painted him as a career con man who up until the murders flaunted his intelligence and supposed wealth.

Marla Palumbo: His entire life's drive was being rich.

Ben Ladinig: He … sent … screenshots of his Chase account from anywhere from about $3 million up to $940 million dollars to various people attempting to dupe them that he's this jet setting, billionaire.

Pierre Haobsh claimed he had received big offers for his energy technology. 

Christine Voss: I'm not a scientist, but I don't know that there's a such thing as a perpetual energy machine.

But several years before the murders, Haobsh was actually being paid to build one.

Samantha Spidell: It was gonna be a new source of energy as if he was, you know, an Elon Musk …

Samantha Spidell met Pierre Haobsh circa 2012 when he moved into a penthouse apartment in a luxury high-rise she managed in Tempe, Arizona. 

Samantha Spidell: He … pulled up … and had this … bright red Ferrari … it was very flashy.

Ladinig says Haobsh had duped a group of high-rolling investors into financing his invention, until they realized it didn't actually work.

Ben Ladinig: He had basically defrauded all these people and the money dried up … When the murders were committed I think he had less than $500 to his name.

Prosecutors presented a detailed timeline retracing Haobsh's movements, including his digital footprint, in the days before and after the murders. They say as early as March 17 — six days before the murders — he had looked into impersonating the doctor at his bank.

Ben Ladinig: He's searching for Asian disguises and real flesh masks.

Natalie Morales: Like a ""Mission Impossible"" face mask.

Ben Ladinig: Right. Hundred percent. … this is his fantastical world that he lived in.

There's no evidence he ever purchased a mask. But a time-stamped receipt and security video placed him at an Arizona gun store four days before the murders — purchasing ammunition and two firearms, including the alleged murder weapon.

Ben Ladinig:  — a .22 pistol with a threaded barrel … for what is a silencer or suppressor …

On March 20, he was back in Oceanside, California, buying supplies before driving up to the Han's house under the guise of installing the energy machine. Instead, Ladinig says Pierre Haobsh bugged Henry Han's computer with a spyware app called a keylogger.

Ben Ladinig: What keyloggers do is every stroke, every click of the mouse, every navigation page you go, it documents all of it.

To their surprise, investigators also found the keylogger on Pierre Haobsh's laptop. On March 21, while Haobsh was still at the Han's home, the keylogger had recorded chilling search terms on his laptop.

Ben Ladinig: What part of the skull is more penetrable? … What ammunition would be better ...

Natalie Morales: As a guest in Dr. Han's house –

Ben Ladinig: A guest— he'd been staying there – 

Natalie Morales: -- for the two nights before ... Planning, this execution-style murder. 

Ben Ladinig: Yes.

Pierre Haobsh left the Han residence on March 22, but prosecutors allege he went back around 4 a.m. the next morning to carry out the murders. They say later that day he began frantically trying to siphon money from Henry Han's accounts.

Ben Ladinig: He's using phones. … He's using fake email accounts. He's doing all these things from … personal identifying information of Dr. Han's that he stole earlier that week.

A Chase fraud alert had flagged an attempted payment for $72,000. Meanwhile, Pierre Haobsh also rented that big truck he allegedly drove to the crime scene hoping to move the bodies.

Ben Ladinig: There are black and whites all over that house. … The crime scene's being processed.

The Palumbos say the meeting they were supposed to have with Henry Han just hours after he was murdered had foiled Pierre Haobsh's plans.

Marla Palumbo: He thought … that he had that whole day to clean up his mess before Henry would be missed.

Mark Palumbo: He wasn't fast enough.

Marla Palumbo: I think we screwed it up for him, happily.

That's when prosecutors say he fled, driving south toward Oceanside. Ladinig argues Pierre Haobsh's subsequent searches betray his guilty conscience: ""is car searched entering tijuana""; ""How Crime Scene Investigation Works""; and ""how long do fingerprints take to process"". Incredibly, he even consulted an online psychic named Count Marco and asked him ""will I get causght for what I did?"" 

Ben Ladinig: And Count Marco replies, well, what did you do, Pierre?

Pierre Haobsh never gave Count Marco an explanation, but on the stand, he couldn't stop talking.

Christine Voss: This was a tough case … but that didn't change the fact that Pierre was entitled to a vigorous defense.

Defense Attorney Christine Voss was in an unusual position.

Christine Voss: This was a really well investigated case. … Because my client wanted to have a trial and wanted me to turn every stone, I did. 

Turn every stone and raise any possible reasonable doubt.

Natalie Morales: You argued that there were elements presented that were implausible … unprovable and simply impossible, those were your words.

Christine Voss: Yeah.

Voss expressed concerns that the alleged murder weapon and silencer found in Haobsh's car didn't match up.

Christine Voss: It absolutely did not connect to the firearm that they believed was the murder weapon. 

She seized on discrepancies in the location data from Haobsh's car and phone that the prosecution had used in its timeline.

Christine Voss: He could not possibly have been in San Diego and Santa Barbara simultaneously, or Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara simultaneously. But that's what the GPS data showed.

And she attacked the credibility of the prosecution's star witness, TJ Direda. Voss questioned why Direda waited nearly two days to contact authorities, and argued in that time, he could have gotten details about the crime scene that the prosecution claimed only the killer knew.

Christine Voss: It was not the best kept crime scene … he was making various phone calls after he heard about the death of Dr. Han …

But Voss concedes much of Direda's testimony was corroborated by the evidence.

Ben Ladinig: This case was over within the first 72 hours.

In fact, the only witness who provided testimony that someone other than Pierre Haobsh was the killer was Pierre Haobsh. During three days on the stand, he repeated the action-packed account he'd given detectives about having shootouts with shadowy figures. Now he said he was sure they were sent by the Department of Energy. 

Natalie Morales:  It sounds like there'd be a trail of bodies … But yet, is there proof of this trail of bodies anywhere to your knowledge?

Christine Voss: No. … which further made him believe it was the Department of Energy …

And what about all that evidence investigators found?

Ben Ladinig: The DOE … planted them … it's all a frame, all that stuff is framed. The banking stuff, frame job. … What's in my car, frame job.

Christine Voss: It was difficult for me to embrace Pierre's testimony.

Natalie Morales: Do you think he himself believed some of the things … he was saying were true?

Christine Voss: Oh yeah, definitely.

Samantha Spidell: He was obsessed with the government.

Samantha Spidell attests there were some kernels of truth in his stories.

Samantha Spidell: Pierre mentions that his dad had ties to the CIA … And I could tell that he … wanted his dad's … approval. 

When his father died in 2023, his obituary stated he was, ""a key player in clandestine Central Intelligence Agency operations during the 1980s."" Pierre Haobsh also told Spidell that his sister was going to star in a reality TV show.

Samantha Spidell: She got cast on a newlyweds reality show … and Pierre was gonna be in it … come to find out that was true.

In fact, both Haobsh and his father made appearances on the second season of the Bravo TV series ""Newlyweds, The First Year."" Pierre was even shown giving his brother-in-law a cooking lesson. 

But Prosecutor Ben Ladinig argued any grains of authenticity in Haobsh's life were far outweighed by deceit.

Natalie Morales: You called him ""a lying liar who lies about lying.""

Ben Ladinig:  Right … Lie, lie, lie, lie hundreds of lies we found on him. … His life was a con.

On Nov. 24, 2021, Judge Brian Hill would get the case. None of Pierre Haobsh's family members attended his trial. The judge made his ruling: guilty on all counts. 

Natalie Morales: The judge, when he issued his ruling, said … his decision was beyond a shadow of a doubt, absolutely no doubt of Pierre Haobsh's guilt.

Ben Ladinig: Yeah … very satisfactory to hear that.

Christine Voss: I wasn't surprised.

Natalie Morales: And what was Pierre's reaction upon hearing that ruling?

Christine Voss: Well, he was visibly disappointed.

On April 15, 2022, Pierre Haobsh was sentenced to three life terms without the possibility of parole. It was little comfort to those still mourning Henry, Jennie and Emily. 

Don Goldberg: I don't understand how there really could be justice.

Isaiah Oregon: He's still alive … and — and they're not. …  He took precious moments that … we'll never get. (wipe tears from his eyes)

Marla Palumbo: I want him to feel every pain possible for what he did.

Mark Palumbo: Not enough bad things can happen for him.

Nearly a decade after the murders, the wounds are still raw.

Isaiah Oregon:  It's hard to think of them.

Dr. Glenn Miller: He was a really good man. … you don't replace a Henry Han. No.

Don Goldberg: Pretty much every day I think of Henry and Jennie and Emily. … There's an old … phrase that … a good man and a good family lives for limited time, but a good name shall live forever … They lived too short … but … their name lives on forever.

Haobsh's conviction was upheld by the California Court of Appeal in January 2025.

He also petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to release him. The Court denied his petition.

On Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, TJ Direda died.

A serial killer who was never detected by police may have been pinpointed by a new ‘murder map' of 1,000 unsolved cases in the UK.

The map shows that two women were strangled in Cardiff in strikingly similar crimes, which were committed just a few weeks apart in 1943. But perhaps because the murders were investigated during wartime blackouts, it appears that detectives didn't link the crimes at the time, and both remain unsolved to this day.

According to renowned criminologist Professor David Wilson, the likelihood is that once a predator starts such a violent pattern of behaviour, they won't stop until they are caught. However, the wartime environment that made it possible for a predator to get away with murder may have also brought the killing spree to an end before a third victim was killed, the number of murders required to define a serial killer.

Professor Wilson, a former prison governor and emeritus professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, said: “I was really intrigued by this. Could the murder of these two women in Cardiff be linked? Yes. The chances are, this was someone who was fighting in the war, or was about to fight in the war. He may have been stopped when he was killed in the fighting.”

The first case is the unsolved murder of Mabel Harper, dating back to August 1943. The wartime blackout meant there were no street lights to illuminate the way as she walked home late at night through the centre of Cardiff after missing her last bus.

The 53-year-old widow was attacked and beaten so savagely that a pathologist later said that her injuries may have been enough to kill her. But the murderer was not finished. He used her own clothing to tie and gag her, then sat on top of her and strangled her.

The crime occurred under the cover of darkness on Western Avenue, a busy throughfare. A married couple walking along the street that night actually saw the killer as he sat astride Mabel, but assumed they were lovers and walked on.

Three months later, a second woman, 29-year-old Alice Pitman, was similarly attacked in Cardiff. Her body was found in Cathays Park on Sunday, November 7, 1943, less than two miles away from where Mabel was murdered. Like Mabel, she had been strangled, this time with her own stockings.

This second murder garnered far less attention in the press, likely because police almost immediately swooped in to arrest a man who worked with Alice at a munitions factory, David Emlyn Davies. He was charged with murder, but was cleared during a trial barely six weeks later. 

Even after the collapse of the murder trial, police don't appear to have considered the possibility that Alice was killed by the same man who murdered Mabel, despite the fact that both women were strangled, within a two-mile area, three months apart. 

While that could be because detectives were convinced they had the right man for Alice's murder, police resources were badly stretched during the war. Many seasoned officers had left to join the fighting, to be replaced by inexperienced volunteers, like the War Reserve Police. The war effort also meant priorities had shifted to protecting lives and property during the Blitz.





Professor Wilson, whose latest book, A History of Modern Britain in Twenty Murders, includes an analysis of crime during the Second World War, said: “The Blitz and the war really did allow a number of murders to take place and go undetected. It is well documented that a number of killers deliberately staged how they left their victims' bodies, so it looked like they might have been killed by falling masonry.

“What this murderer did not do was to make any attempt to hide what he had done. This was very spontaneous and very violent. Once someone starts offending in that way, you don't normally stop until someone stops you.

“The other thing to remember is that being at war changes the underlying rules of civility. There's a breakdown if you are only expecting to live for the day, the week, or the year. Normal rules of behaviour are blown asunder.

“It's no surprise that two serial killers started their cycle of murders during the war, John Christie and Gordon Cummins, who was known as the Blackout Ripper.”

Christie, the Rillington Place Strangler, murdered his wife and a neighbour's baby daughter in 1943, and went on to strangle a total of eight women, hiding their bodies at his flat. Cummins, a serviceman in the RAF, murdered at least four women during a six-day period in London in February 1942.

Both serial killers were hanged. However, whoever murdered Mabel and Alice has never faced justice. 

And they were not the only Cardiff and South Wales victims of wartime killers who have never been caught. Five-year-old Joyce Cox vanished as she walked home from school in 1939. Her body was later found on a railway embankment. She had been strangled.

Less than two weeks after Alice was murdered, in November 1943, Norah Bartlett was strangled to death in Swansea. However, Professor Wilson believes Joyce's age and the distance between Cardiff and Swansea, where Norah was killed, rule out a link with whoever strangled Mabel and Alice.

A spokesperson for South Wales Police said: “All historic murder cases, often referred to in the media as ‘cold cases,' are allocated to the Major Crime Review Unit and remain under active consideration and will be subject of re-investigation as and when new information is received or when there are opportunities following advances in forensic science.  

“Each case is reviewed periodically. If information comes in from the public or other forces we act on it. 

“South Wales Police has had considerable success with cold case reviews, being one of the first forces in the country to set up a review team in 1999 to conduct cold case reviews.”



The possibility of a Cardiff blackout strangler was uncovered during research to map a database of 1,000 unsolved murders.

Our exclusive list was sourced from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, and supported with research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives.

The database - including many in-depth features focusing on specific cases - has now been published in a new special publication, Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders volume II: Midnight Stalkers.

Each case has also been included in our searchable, interactive online map.

Many of the features are so famous that they remain locked in the national psyche, such as the Bible John murders that terrified Scotland during the 1960s.

Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel and Alice.

Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers, as well as violent robberies, gangland killings, and contract murders. 

Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

A wartime killer who used the blackout to escape justice is one of the oldest crimes among more than two dozen Greater Manchester cold cases highlighted in a new crime map revealing 1,000 unsolved murders.

Every case has been the subject of a major police investigation, with some dating back to the pre-war era and others occurring in the last decade.

This exclusive list was compiled from Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every police force in the country, supported by research through a wide variety of local newspaper archives.

Cases include many seemingly random attacks, usually on women, carried out by strangers with no apparent motive.

The oldest Greater Manchester cold case included in the files is the wartime murder of 17-year-old Minnie Stott in in 1940.

A police constable found the Bolton teenager's body during a routine check of a lock-up shop.

It was believed Minnie had been strangled with her own scarf, which was missing, along with her underwear, indicating she had also been the victim of a sex attack.

Tragically, around two weeks earlier, a 15-year-old had been murdered in a similar fashion in Liverpool, and Minnie's mother had warned her “never to allow herself to be drawn into conversation with strangers”.

At the time, Bolton was in blackout due to the war effort to protect lives and property from German bombers, and this provided the perfect cover to allow the killer to get away with murder.

Other Greater Manchester cases highlighted in the map include the shocking murder of nine-year-old schoolgirl Susan Thomas, who was strangled in Platt Fields a few hours after she went missing in 1963, and 14-year-old Lisa Hession, who was found strangled in an alleyway in Wigan in 1984.

You can search our interactive map to find out if there are any unsolved murders near you.

The online map has been produced to support the special publication Britain's 1,000 Unsolved Murders Vol II: Midnight Stalkers.

It seeks to reexamine cold cases that have been held in the files of police forces nationwide, in some cases for decades.

The publication includes a full timeline of 1,000 unsolved murders, dating from the pre-war period to the last decade, alongside more than 20 in-depth features.

Many of the cases are so famous that they remain locked in the national psyche, such as the Bible John murders that terrified Scotland during the 1960s.

Other mysteries - however shocking at the time - have been consigned to history, such as the Cardiff murders of Mabel Harper and Alice Pittman, who were both strangled during the wartime blackout.

Each remains an enigma, with families still seeking justice and answers - and in many cases, the murderer may still walk the streets.

            The ritual begins, as it always does, with a pilgrimage.
    


            People pour in from the dense warrens of India's financial capital and from dusty villages thousands of kilometers away, all flowing towards the fortified, sea-facing Mumbai home of actor Shah Rukh Khan.
    


            The crowd is a mix of teenagers angling for a glimpse of the icon inside; middle-aged women for whom he was a first love; grown men who see their own aspirations mirrored in his trajectory.
    


            Known as “SRK” by millions, and “King Khan” to his fans, he turned 60 last week, and the chaotic display of devotion outside his home is a testament to a level of stardom rarely seen elsewhere.
    


            The air is thick with chants celebrating his milestone. Some have waited overnight. They don masks or T-shirts with his face on, or clutch posters of his movies. All are here for the same sacrament: to get a glimpse of the superstar and be included in the sweep of his signature open-armed embrace.
    


            “I have loved him for a long time so I have come here to wish him happy birthday,” one fan told a local news agency. “Happy, happy birthday Shah Rukh brother. Happy birthday to you.”
    


            Another said he comes here every year. “I've been a fan of him since I was born… I have watched all his films,” they said.
    


            This bond was forged in a bygone era. As India opened its economy to the world in the 1990s, Khan opened its heart. He was an outsider who stormed the dynastic gates of Bollywood with little more than wit, ambition, and dimples that could disarm a subcontinent.
    


            And while the adoring thousands gather outside his home to worship a film deity, they may also be witnessing the twilight of India's cinematic gods.
    


            “As stars become more relatable and fandom less devotional, the star-fan contract is less sacrosanct today,” said a recent IMDb report analyzing the last 25 years of Indian cinema.
    


            In today's fractured attention economy of streaming, the barbed wire of polarizing politics, and the cacophony of social media, winning adoration on this scale isn't just difficult; it might be impossible.
    


            As the IMDb report put it: “It's time to stop searching for the next Shah Rukh Khan.”
    


            The spectacle outside Khan's home, Mannat, is an echo of a moment that began three decades ago, when India itself was being reborn. The name itself is a powerful metaphor: Mannat means a prayer answered, and the crowd gathered here treat Khan's home like a shrine.
    


            In 1991, the government dismantled the protectionist economic policies of its socialist past, cracking open the nation to the world. It was a policy shift that ignited a period of economic growth and industrial expansion that essentially reshaped the country. Satellite television brought a plethora of choice into the living room, Western brands began to appear in shops and, for a burgeoning middle class, the definition of success was suddenly rewritten.
    


            An exhilarating mantra became mainstream: Anyone can make it.
    


            Into this moment stepped Khan.
    


            A Muslim boy from a middle-class Delhi neighborhood, Khan says he was shaped by a household rich in intellect but often short on cash.
    


            His father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was a lawyer and Indian independence activist from Peshawar, in modern-day Pakistan, who ran a series of failed businesses. His mother, Lateef Fatima, was the family's anchor, according to the younger Khan.
    


            “I come from a very normal lower-middle-class family. I saw a lot of failure,” he said during a 2012 speech at Yale University. “My father was a beautiful man and the most successful failure in the world… We were quite poor actually and let me tell you… poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression.”
    


            He began acting in school plays. By the age of 23, he was already on television in the successful series “Fauji” (Soldier). But just as his career was taking flight, his personal world fell apart.
    


            The death of his mother, years after he lost his father, prompted a move to Mumbai, the heart of India's film industry.
    


            “I was sad in Delhi,” Khan told CNN in a 2008 interview. “I said to myself: OK, come (to Mumbai) for a change of scene. Maybe I'll enjoy myself for a year and get over my depression of my parents' death. But I just I couldn't go back… I was never trying to be a movie star, I became one by chance.”
    


            Khan made his big-screen debut in the 1992 romantic drama “Deewana” (Obsessed) and soon became known for playing villainous, menacing characters in films like “Darr” (Fear) and “Baazigar” (Gambler). But it was his pivot to the romantic hero in the 1995 cult hit “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” (The Brave Hearted Will Take the Bride, widely known as DDLJ) that catapulted him to superstardom.
    


            His character, Raj, presented a new model of masculinity that wasn't the angry young man of the previous generation. He was the empathetic partner for the new one, offering a vision of modern love that felt safe and aspirational.
    


            Bollywood certainly has other megastars, like Deepika Padukone, who is among India's most celebrated women actors; Aamir Khan, known for his versatility; and Salman Khan. Yet, their followings are distinct from the quasi-religious fervor thar surrounds Khan.
    


‘DDLJ': Why a Bollywood classic about forbidden love still captivates Indian movie-goers 30 years on



            It is a phenomenon of near-mythic proportions, engendering a devotion so profound as to lead to the scenes of mass pilgrimage outside Khan's Mumbai home.
    


            Sher Mohammed had traveled 2,200 kilometers from his village in the eastern state of Jharkhand and waited 95 days for a chance to meet Khan. When Khan learned of Mohammed's determined vigil, he came out to the street to personally greet his fan.
    


            “Everyone told me I won't be able to meet him… I got even more motivated to meet him,” Mohammed said. “I felt so happy.”
    


            Also present was Visharukh, Khan's self-proclaimed “biggest fan,” whose home is plastered with posters of the actor, and whose children are named “Simran” and “Aryan” – after Khan's love interest in “DDLJ” and his real-life son, respectively.
    


            Visharukh's shrine to Khan is just one thread in an intricate tapestry of fandom.
    


            In her book, “Desperately Seeking Shah Rukh,” author Shrayana Bhattacharya explores what he means to women as someone who challenged masculinity in a newly liberalized economy.
    


            “For 15 years, I thought I was talking to fans about Khan,” she said. “Eventually, he became a research device for hundreds of his female fans to use his icon to talk about their own frustrated attempts to assert economic and emotional independence in one of world's most insidious patriarchies.”
    


            For Bhattacharya, there is no single explanation for his appeal.
    


            For a migrant tribal domestic worker, for instance, she found the appeal wasn't rooted in grand romance. She most appreciated his characters' willingness to participate in domestic life, Bhattacharya said, citing “simple gestures such as being in the kitchen in his films, helping with chores.”
    


            For the nation's elites, Bhattacharya found Khan symbolized something entirely different. He was a living embodiment of the dream that hard work could lead to limitless success. He represented, as she put it, “the myth of meritocracy at a time when India started its love affair with GDP growth and consumer spending.”
    


            And for another crucial group – the first generation of women to ever work in their families – she found his films offered a vital refuge. Khan's imagery became a “necessary entertainment and escape when their everyday rebellion of prioritizing a career over marriage caused heartbreak or exhaustion,” Bhattacharya said.
    


            “He is one person, but each fan has projected their aspirations and fantasies onto him in their own unique and deeply diverse ways.”
    


            Khan's dominance is quantifiable: he appears in 20 of the top 130 Indian movies of the past 25 years, according to IMDb's dataset.
    


            But in today's world of digital creators, those seeking fame face competition in a way Khan's generation never could have imagined.
    


            This new reality is the daily grind for Shivam Khatri, an aspiring actor in Mumbai. He, too, left his small town for the city of dreams, but his hustle operates in a different universe. For him, the formula has been inverted: where Khan became a star and then a brand, actors now must become a brand first.
    


            “It's not like someone gets picked up from the street,” Khatri said from the home he shares with several other people. “Social media, web shows, it's changed everything.”
    


            The influence of stardom in India is immense. Cultivated over years through a series of box-office hits, it can define eras, create cultural touchstones, and command a loyal fanbase that transcends generations.
    


            But the very nature of the connection between stars and their audience is now evolving, according to the IMDb report.
    


            “What was once a carefully mediated connection, built through iconic characters and controlled narratives, has become more porous,” it said. “The closing of the metaphorical gap between the big screen's larger-than-life star and the one on the (Instagram) reel you can hold in your hand has changed the equation between the star and the fan.”
    


            Khatri knows his follower count is as important as his headshot as he competes not just with actors but with food bloggers, comedians and dancers for screen time. “Everyone should have an online presence now,” he said, “and you have to constantly check it.”
    


            His struggle illustrates how the singular path to box-office fame has been replaced by a thousand algorithm-driven streams on social media apps like Instagram and TikTok.
    


            For Ibrahim Qadri, a Khan lookalike and social media influencer from Gujarat, it pays to trade on the existing fame of others, supplying a demand for connection that the real SRK could never sate.
    


            His Instagram feed is a meticulous recreation of Khan's world: the signature arm-spread pose in a mustard field, a lip-sync to a classic song, a frame-by-frame remake of a famous movie scene. He is, in many ways, more accessible than the real Khan, making a living through brand deals with local businesses and paid appearances at weddings.
    


            “When I perform, I don't think I'm imitating,” Qadri said. “I become him. I feel like I am him.”
    


            This profound devotion, which has garnered him more than 2 million followers, comes with a paradox: He might be the only person in India who doesn't want to meet Khan.
    


            “I've said that many times,” Qadri explains. “Because if I meet him, I feel my passion will end… what will be left to do in life?”
    


            As a Muslim icon embraced by a Hindu-majority nation, Khan has, for many, been the living embodiment of India's post-liberalization promise. He attended a Christian school, married a Hindu woman, and consistently championed a vision of national identity that transcended religion.
    


            “We don't talk about Hindu-Muslim,” he once said in a 2020 interview in Hindi. “My wife is Hindu, I'm a Muslim, and our children are Hindustan (Indian).”
    


            But in today's era of political polarization, defined by a new wave of Hindu nationalism, that same identity has been weaponized, transforming him from a unifying symbol into a cultural battleground.
    


            The 2023 release of his action film “Pathaan” (Warrior) served as a flashpoint. The brief appearance in a musical sequence of a female actor in a saffron bikini – a color associated with Hinduism – ignited a coordinated firestorm of outrage from far-right groups and politicians, who framed it as a deliberate insult to the religion.
    


            Calls for a nationwide boycott trended for weeks, and effigies of the actor were burned, according to local media reports. But the film's eventual record-breaking success was a deafening rebuttal from his loyal fanbase.
    


            “I don't know if there will be another SRK or not,” said the author Bhattacharya. “What I do know is that we will need icons who unite us in conversation, not divide us into spiritual silos.”
    


            Back at the birthday congregation in Mumbai, a sea of fans surges outside Khan's home. As the day wears on, the crowd swells to a formidable throng. Police struggle to maintain order, their wooden sticks cracking against the pavement in a futile attempt to control the sheer mass of people.
    


            Afternoon bleeds into evening, and as the sun sets over the Arabian Sea, the collective hope that they'll see their hero begins to fade. A message appears on X, confirming their disappointment. “Have been advised by authorities that I will not be able to step out and greet all you lovely people who have been waiting for me,” Khan writes, adding his “deepest apologies.”
    


            For Khatri, the aspiring actor, there will never be another like Khan.
    


            You have to almost be delusional to make it in the industry, he says. “It's fun until the money runs out… It's not going to happen in the next 10 days or months. But it will work out.”
    


            Inspired by Khan, a vision board in the corner of his room reads: “India's next superstar.”

NEW YORK, November 9. /TASS/. The United States' economic growth may fall by half is the shutdown continues, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.

""We've seen an impact [of the shutdown] on the economy from day one, but it's getting worse and worse. We had a fantastic economy under President Trump the past two quarters. And now there are estimates that the economy, economic growth for this quarter, could be cut by as much as half if the shutdown continues,"" he told ABC News.

The US federal government partially suspended work at midnight on October 1 due to a lack of funding after the ruling Republican party failed to reach agreement with the Democrats in the US Congress on some expenditure items, including healthcare. The parties accuse each other of provoking the shutdown and prolonging it for political purposes and an agreement is yet to be reached.

Since 1977, funding for the federal government has been interrupted more than 20 times due to disagreements between the administration and Congress. The current US government shutdown has become the longest in the country's history, breaking the record set in 2018-2019 during Donald Trump's first term as president (2017-2021).","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Live Updates


            • USDA's order: The Department of Agriculture ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits and to “immediately undo” steps taken to issue full benefits for November as the government shutdown drags on.
    


            • Thanksgiving travel in question: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told CNN he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday as airlines continue to implement FAA-mandated reductions in flights. You can track today's cancellations here.



            • In the Senate: Majority Leader John Thune indicated the Senate plans to take an initial vote today on a working plan to reopen the federal government, as Republicans hope to break the funding impasse with Democrats.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated the chamber plans to take an initial vote Sunday on a working plan to reopen the federal government, as Republicans hope to break the funding impasse with Democrats.
    


            Thune said he hoped text for the measure would be released “really soon” and expected the chamber to vote soon after. The procedural vote would move to break a Democratic filibuster of a House-passed bill that would have funded the government through November 21.
    


            The measure is expected to be changed to extend federal government spending into January, and will also include three full-year funding bills for military construction, veterans' affairs, the legislative branch and the Agriculture Department.
    


            It's not clear whether this new ​measure will garner enough Democratic support.
    


            Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin said the working plan would only guarantee a future Senate vote on enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, not an extension of the credits that some Democrats have made a key demand in exchange for their votes.
    


            Even if the Senate passes the new funding measure, it would have to go back to the House for another vote before going to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.
    


            As of Sunday around 2 p.m. EST, 1,780 flights have been canceled within, into, or out of the United States today.
    


            At least 5,731 flights have been delayed, according to flight tracking site, FlightAware.
    


            The air travel headaches caused by the ongoing US government shutdown and the Federal Aviation Administration's mandated 4% cut to flights has been compounded by air traffic control staffing problems and a surge of cold air sweeping across the eastern half of the country Sunday and Monday.
    


            More cancellations and delays are expected as airlines will be required to gradually increase their schedule reductions over the next week, unless Congress can come up with a funding compromise to reopen the government.
    


            The US Department of Agriculture on Saturday ordered states to cease issuing full food stamp benefits.
    


            It's the latest move in a month of uncertainty over the fate of the program during the government shutdown. For weeks, the 42 million Americans who rely on food stamp benefits have gotten inconsistent cues as lawsuits over distributing the aid have worked their way through federal courts.
    


Here's a timeline of the back-and-forth since the government shutdown began on October 1:



October 10: The Department of Agriculture indicates it will not tap into contingency funds to supply the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, which nearly 42 million Americans rely on, and tells states to not issue benefits for November.
    


October 16: Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins tells reporters that the program will run out of money in two weeks.
    


October 28: A coalition of 25 Democratic-run states sue the Trump administration to keep SNAP benefit funds flowing.
    


October 30: A coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses file a lawsuit against the Trump administration to distribute food assistance.
    


October 31: Two federal judges order the Trump administration to use the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits.
    


November 1: SNAP benefits were scheduled to begin distribution, but still face delays for the Department of Agriculture and states to get money flowing again.
    


November 3: The Trump administration says it will provide only half of the normal food stamp benefits for the month by tapping into the program's contingency fund.
    


November 4: After a threat from Trump to withhold assistance, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tells reporters that she spoke with the president and that the administration would be “fully complying” with a court order to keep some benefits flowing.
    


November 5: The USDA issues revised guidance to states that will result in food stamp enrollees receiving somewhat larger partial benefits.
    


November 6: A federal judge in Rhode Island says the Trump administration must fully cover food stamp benefits. The administration quickly appealed the new order, as well as the judge's ruling from the previous week.
    


November 7: Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to cover full food stamp benefits. Jackson's “administrative stay” freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case. It's unclear how the case will ultimately impact the billions of dollars spent in federal SNAP funding.
    


November 8: Following Jackson's stay, the US Department of Agriculture ordered states to cease issuing full food stamp benefits and to “immediately undo” steps taken to issue full benefits for the month of November. In the Saturday directive, the USDA warned states that failed to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP.
    


CNN's Devan Cole, Tami Luhby, Marshall Cohen, Sarah Ferris, John Fritze and Adam Cancryn contributed reporting.



United Airlines said Sunday it has finalized more than 600 flight cancellations through Tuesday, November 11, to comply with Federal Aviation Administration-mandated airline schedule reductions due to the US government shutdown.
    


            CNN has reached out to other major airlines for lists of planned FAA-mandated cancellations.
    


            Additional cancellations and delays may occur due to ongoing air traffic control staffing issues.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that cargo is being slowed and warned that “we could end up with shortages, whether it's in our supply chain, whether it's for the holidays” because of the ongoing government shutdown.
    


            In a wide-ranging interview on ABC's “This Week,” Bessent said the economy “is getting worse and worse” because of the shutdown, which at 40 days is the longest stretch of time the federal government has been closed.
    


            The economy has been in focus amid the shutdown, as inflation has climbed and with the Supreme Court hearing arguments last week about President Donald Trump's “reciprocal” tariffs, which include duties as high as 50% on goods from India and Brazil.
    


            Earlier today, Trump defended his tariff policy on Truth Social.
    


                     “So, let's get this straight??? The President of the United States is allowed (and fully approved by Congress!) to stop ALL TRADE with a Foreign Country … but is not allowed to put a simple Tariff on a Foreign Country, even for purposes of NATIONAL SECURITY. That is NOT what our great Founders had in mind!” In a separate post, Trump said those who are against tariffs “are FOOLS!” the president posted. 
                





            Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted that bipartisan negotiations on funding the government could have a “breakthrough” today because he thinks the strain of the record-breaking shutdown is “backfiring” on Democrats.
    


                    “I think this madness ends today,” Graham said on “Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” explaining that federal workers missing paychecks, Americans losing food stamp benefits and flight cancellations across the country shows the Democrats' “political terrorism” is “backfiring.”
                





            Graham rejected Democrats' demand to rollback Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump's domestic policy law, as well as the extension of enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which he called “the biggest scam on the planet.”
    


            He also praised the president's suggestion on Saturday that the billions of dollars used to offset ACA premium costs instead get sent directly to Americans to spend on purchasing their own health insurance.
    


                    “I think the government's going to open today because cooler heads are prevailing on the Democratic side,” he predicted, adding that he expects a bipartisan group of negotiators to have a “breakthrough” when the Senate returns this afternoon and “then we'll talk about how to change Obamacare to give the money to the people rather than insurance companies.”
                





            “The government will reopen today. We're not going to talk about health care until it does,” he said.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune threw cold water this weekend on a proposal by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that would offer enough Democratic votes to end the shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of enhanced ACA
    


            The Senate returns this afternoon as talks to end the record-breaking shutdown continue, after the chamber finished yesterday evening with no deal.
    


            The Senate will reconvene at 1:30 p.m. on the 40th day of the stalemate, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune has vowed to keep the chamber in session until the government reopens.
    


            A small, bipartisan group of negotiators has been working through a package that would include a stopgap funding bill and a small package of some full-year funding bills.
    


            Thune told reporters on Saturday that they were “getting close” to having legislation drafted, though it is not yet clear how a top sticking point for Democrats will be resolved.
    


            GOP leaders rejected a proposal earlier this weekend by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to vote on a one-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of a plan to reopen the government.
    


            President Donald Trump further muddied the waters with a Truth Social post yesterday suggesting that the billions of dollars used to offset ACA premium costs instead get sent directly to Americans to spend on purchasing their own health insurance, a proposal that Democrats have expressed no interest in pursuing.
    


            The US Department of Agriculture ordered states to cease issuing full food stamp benefits and to “immediately undo” steps taken to issue full benefits for the month of November, after a Supreme Court justice on Friday evening temporarily paused a lower court order requiring the agency to pay 42 million Americans their full allotments.
    


            In the Saturday directive, obtained by CNN, the USDA warned states who failed to comply that they could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as holding states financially responsible for over issuances of benefits.
    


            This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly 1 in 8 Americans who depend on the nation's larger anti-hunger program.
    


            The directive follows  a memorandum from the department on Friday saying it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with a federal court order, and the process should be completed later Friday.
    


            Several states had quickly pounced on the news, saying the money should start flowing to recipients in coming days.
    


            We're hearing from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who said today that he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, which is less than three weeks away.
    


            As for today, more than 1,000 flights so far have been canceled, according to FlightAware. More cancellations are expected as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight.
    


If you're just joining us, here's more on what we know about flight cancellations and delays: 



• Today's delays: Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed an average of more than two hours — and up to four and a half hours — Sunday morning due to staffing issues, according to information from the Federal Aviation Administration.
    


• Today's staffing shortages: Air traffic control for some of the country's busiest airports was understaffed today or expected to be, according to an FAA advisory, potentially causing widespread delays. Meanwhile, federal employees picketed outside Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport after more than a month of working without pay under the government shutdown.
    


• More reductions to come: Airlines have started implementing a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest US airports, following an order from the FAA. Duffy warned the percentage could rise to 15% to 20% if the government shutdown doesn't end soon.
    


If you're concerned about travel issues, here are some tips on how you can navigate flight disruptions.

            EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said today his agency will see a new round of furloughs that will impact “environmental protection across the board” on November 21 if the government shutdown continues.
    


            “This is the last pay period before a far more severe, drastic furlough is going to kick in at the EPA, we're going to see impacts for environmental protection across the board,” Zeldin said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.”
    


            CNN has previously reported that employees at the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management received intent to RIF notices last month. The division focuses on hazardous waste cleanup and responding to hazardous waste sites, including overseeing the Brownfields program that helps states clean up and reuse previously contaminated sites.
    


            Air traffic control for some of the country's busiest airports was understaffed Sunday or expected to be, according to an FAA advisory, potentially causing widespread delays.
    


            The staffing shortages could force air traffic control at each facility to reduce the number of flights at the airport to maintain safety.
    


            This could lead to flight delays.
    


            As Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warns air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of Thanksgiving, let's take a look at the extent of ongoing disruption to flights across the country.

            Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said today he believes air travel will be “reduced to a trickle” ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. More than 1,000 flights have been canceled so far today, according to FlightAware, with the number expected to climb.
    


                    “The two weeks before Thanksgiving, you're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle. We have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays, they want to see their family, they want to celebrate this great American holiday,” Duffy told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
                





            “Listen, many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if (the government) doesn't open back up.”
    


            Asked how many Americans' Thanksgiving travel plans could be impacted, Duffy said, “I think the number is going to be substantial. Again, you look at the trend line Jake, and it's only gotten worse as we've gone through the shutdown.”
    


            Airlines have started implementing a 4% reduction in domestic flights at 40 of the busiest US airports, following an order from the Federal Aviation Administration.
    


            Duffy has previously warned that the percentage could rise to 15-20% if the government shutdown doesn't end soon.
    


                    “We're working overtime to make sure that that it is safe to travel,” Duffy said. “And so, if we have staffing triggers in locations in the American airspace, what we'll do is we will slow traffic, which means you'll have delays, and then airlines might cancel flights.”
                





            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries defended Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's proposal to vote on a one-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies in order to reopen the government while casting distrust on Republicans intentions to negotiate on healthcare, highlighting the tenuous state of talks on Capitol Hill to end the record-breaking shutdown.
    


            Jeffries told NBC's “Meet the Press” he had previously rejected the idea of a one-year extension discussed by rank-and-file House Republicans because, he warned, House GOP leadership has “no interest in driving down the high cost of living for everyday Americans.”
    


            The Schumer proposal, which has already been shut down by Senate Majority Leader John Thune, was offered “in good faith,” Jeffries argued, adding that it “also provides a path toward bipartisan negotiations for a multi-year extension, which would provide the type of certainty that the American people need.”
    


            Asked if he thinks the shutdown will be resolved before Thanksgiving, Jeffries responded, “I hope so,” calling for President Trump to “get off the golf course and get back to the negotiating table.”
    


            President Donald Trump has spent this weekend in Florida and will leave for Washington this afternoon, according to the White House.
    


            He is expected to depart Palm Beach at around 2.45 p.m. ET, in time to attend the Detroit Lines game against the Washington Commanders at 5.35 p.m ET.
    


            The president is then due to arrive at the White House at 7.45 p.m. ET.
    


            Meanwhile, President Donald Trump defended his trade agenda in a Truth Social post this morning, calling opponents of his tariffs “fools” and promising rebate checks for Americans.
    


                    “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump's post read. “We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country In the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k's are Highest EVER. We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place. A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”
                





            Trump has previously weighed the idea of $2,000 rebates through revenue generated from tariffs. In an interview with OAN on October 1, Trump said. “We're thinking maybe $1,000 to $2,000 — it would be great.”
    


For context: Layering rebate checks on top of tariffs “is a very serious risk,” which can cause a more widespread and lasting inflation increase, David Kotok, co-founder of Cumberland Advisors, told CNN in August.
    


            “If you do it as the workforce is shrinking, which is what we have now, then you risk triggering a wage-price spiral,” Kotok said.
    


Remember: Trump's comments come after the Supreme Court heard arguments last week over Trump's authority to impose tariffs through a series of executive orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
    


            It's shaping up to be another messy travel day of flight cancellations and delays to continue as the government shutdown drags on.
    


            Have you had to rebook a flight because of the flight cuts? Are you flying out of a chaotic airport today? Do you have future travel plans you're worried about?

            Federal employees picketed outside Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport after more than a month of working without pay under the government shutdown.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration employees, including inspectors, technicians, and other specialists, gathered to raise awareness about how working without compensation has impacted their lives, CNN affiliate KNXV reported.
    


            In addition to some struggling to feed their families, employees warned that the situation could soon become dangerous for air travel.
    


            “At some point, people are going to stop showing up for work… Equipment will fail eventually if people don't come into work,” FAA technician and union representative Ashley Cioffi told KNXV.
    


            Another member of the union for aviation safety specialists, Andy Branigan, told KNXV that the shutdown has impacted workers beyond the control tower.
    


            “We are the people who make sure the plane is safe to fly. We are the people who make sure the pilot is safe to fly,” Branigan, an aviation safety inspector, said. “We are not out looking at our planes, we are not out looking for pilots, we are busy trying to justify our existence.”
    


            As we've been reporting, passengers across the US face mounting uncertainty today as airlines canceled flights in response to the Federal Aviation Administration's mandate to reduce air traffic amid the government shutdown.
    


            For Emmy Holguin, 36, flying from Miami to visit family in the Dominican Republic, the cancellations were a stark reminder of the broader political impasse.
    


                    “We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” Holguin told the Associated Press. “I'm hoping that the government can take care of this.”
                





            With the holiday season approaching, cancellations climbed to more than 1,200 by the end of yesterday, according to flight tracking data FlightAware.
    


            Many travelers struggled to navigate a system already stretched thin.
    


            Diana Alvear, who had planned a family trip to California, canceled her flight due to concerns over the shortage of air traffic controllers.
    


                    “It's really weighing on our hearts that we had to do this,” Alvear told the AP. “This has been costly to us, and it's a huge disappointment for us and our family.”
                





            Flights at Newark Liberty International Airport were delayed an average of more than two hours — and up to four and a half hours — Sunday morning due to staffing issues, according to information from the Federal Aviation Administration.
    


            The average delay was 134 minutes and the longest delay was 273 minutes, the FAA said.
    


            At least 871 flights within, into, or out of the United States were delayed Sunday, according to FlightAware.
    


            Not every staffing shortage results in a delay, as controllers can sometimes reroute flights. However, in some cases, planes must be slowed to maintain safety. Not all delays are caused by staffing shortages.

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            The biggest message New York City voters sent on election night was not their choice of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, who got a little more than 50% of the vote.
    


            City voters gave larger margins of approval to a trio of housing-related initiatives meant to set off a building boom to generate more affordable housing and leave a mark that should last much longer than Mamdani's four-year term.
    


            Taking cues from Austin, Texas, residents voted to sidestep their own city council and zoning boards to fast-track the construction of affordable housing, simplify zoning review and create an appeals board to give rejected building projects a second chance.
    


            New York's housing crisis is extreme and unique, but it is also part of a broader problem across the country. Many voters of all stripes do not feel they can afford to live. Supporters hope the new system will help nonprofit developers get past red tape and set off a building boom that still respects the character of neighborhoods. Finding that balance is going to be a massive challenge.
    


            I spoke by phone with Amit Singh Bagga, who is principal of Public Progress Solutions, a campaign strategy and public affairs firm, and who was campaign director for the “Yes on Affordable Housing” campaign to learn more about New York's housing crisis and how the passage of these three amendments should be viewed by the rest of the country. Here are some excerpts of that longer conversation.
    


WOLF: First, explain the problem. Why is there a crisis?



BAGGA: New York City has been experiencing a very acute housing crisis for several years now, which is primarily the result of our inability to build sufficient housing generally, as well as sufficient affordable housing.
    


            Just to understand the scope and scale of the crisis: Only one out of every 100 apartments in New York is currently available for rent. We have a 1.4% vacancy rate. The average three-bedroom apartment to buy now costs $1.8 million — and that's not just in Manhattan, that's citywide. Fifty percent of renters and homeowners are cost-burdened, which means they're spending more than 30% of their gross monthly income on rent. That's pre-tax. We now shamefully have 154,000 public school kids in our system that are considered homeless. So they might be living in shelters. They might be what's called doubled up, meaning they're living with friends or family, or they might be moving around quite a bit.
    


WOLF: Why was passing these three initiatives such a big deal?



BAGGA: New York City has just become the very first city in the nation to pass this type of overhaul to our local land-use and zoning regulations. Similar initiatives have been attempted in many places across the country, most notably in California, and have failed spectacularly. Which is why, from a national perspective, this is incredibly notable.
    


            The bill SB 79, which has gotten enormous amount of coverage in California, is a state bill to override a lot of local zoning regulations that had to be introduced in Sacramento and was bitterly fought over in the California State Legislature. So it is, I think, really notable that New York City voters took matters into our own hands.
    


WOLF: Explain what these proposals do.



BAGGA: The proposals essentially make it faster, less expensive and more affordable to build housing in all parts of the city. Currently, we have 12, what are called community districts — groupings of, let's call it two to four neighborhoods — that have built as much housing in New York City as the other 47 community districts combined in the last 10 years. That tells you that we are not producing nearly enough housing in New York City to meet our current demand.
    


            We're producing about 15,000 to 20,000 units a year in the last several years. Our outstanding demand is somewhere between half a million and a million units. A rate of producing housing of 15,000 to 20,000 is simply not going to get you there.
    


            The reason that we are only producing this much housing is not because we have run out of space. New York City is geographically enormous. There are many, many, large parts of the city that are incredibly low-density where we can absolutely add housing. But the current system can be far too easily weaponized by small groups of individuals to force local council members, who have had an outsized amount of power when it comes to land use and housing, into very difficult positions and impossible choices. The choice being: Block affordable housing or lose your seat. We've seen this play out in the New York City Council several times, including just a couple of years ago, where, in the East Bronx, which is a relatively low-density area, the Democratic city council member who supported a rezoning that increased some density and added some affordable housing ended up losing her seat to a Republican, which was the first time in 40 years that that district had been represented by a Republican. The political stakes can be very high.
    


            What these measures are really designed to do is to remove the politics from the equation of having a citywide solution to this very urgent citywide problem.
    


WOLF: Zoning boards were developed for a reason. Why do you think that system has failed?



BAGGA: The system has failed because it places an enormous amount of power in the hands of individual local council members. We have 51 council members who represent New York City, collectively. And essentially, the local council member is the individual that has the power to say thumbs up or thumbs down on anything from even just maybe one building or two buildings in their neighborhood, all the way up to a much larger project or a larger neighborhood rezoning. We have had a practice in New York City — it's not a law, it's not a rule, it's just a practice — called member deference. If a local council member says yea or nay to a particular project or proposal, the entire council votes with that member to say thumbs up or thumbs down. The logic behind this is that every individual council member, in theory, knows what's best for their neighborhood and is also navigating their own local politics in a very particular way, and they don't want other council members to have a say over what goes on in their backyard. One could argue there's a little bit of an inherent logic to this, and it is really designed to insulate local council members from interference from their own colleagues when it comes to local political decisions. The flip side, however, is that this system has been weaponized by almost always, small minorities of people in individual council districts to block the creation of affordable housing
    


WOLF: Will this lead to a new era of public housing projects like we saw built in cities in the ‘60s and ‘70s?



BAGGA: No. All of these projects are going to be proposed by for-profit or nonprofit development. It's only one out of the four types of housing that would be taxpayer-financed, but those projects are not owned and operated by the city. So it's not long-term public housing; it's housing that is permanently subsidized by taxpayers. That is all negotiated at the front end, and there is a very clear cost to it, and that is done project by project. This is not creating huge complexes of public housing at all. This is generally individual buildings and individual projects. Ultimately that housing is owned and operated by nonprofit developers. It's not owned and operated by the city.
    


WOLF: What is the waiting list like for subsidized housing in New York City?



BAGGA: The waiting lists are insane. There was an example given last year where for 10,000 units of housing, there was a waiting list of 6 million people.
    


            There is also an example given by the Chinese American Planning Council, which is the largest and oldest immigrant rights organization in New York City, one of our coalition partners. It took them 10 years to build just 150 units of 100% taxpayer-financed affordable housing for immigrant seniors, people who have low fixed incomes and no opportunity to make more money. For 150 units, they received 55,000 applications. So that just gives you a sense of the severity of the crisis.
    


WOLF: What lessons should other cities take from this election in New York City?



BAGGA: I would reframe that slightly to say New York is learning a lesson from other places, and in particular Austin, which experienced a tremendous amount of economic growth as a result of becoming a tech hub and did not initially build nearly enough housing to keep up with its new demand. Austin, of course, has had the benefit of the enormous amount of land into which it can sprawl.
    


            But beyond the sprawl, Austin loosened many of its restrictions on development when it came to, for example, height, and as a result, was able to add a lot of density in places where there previously had been none.
    


            When it did so successfully, which took just a couple of years, rents in Austin plummeted by an average of 20%. What we in New York did on Tuesday night is follow an example of another city. They didn't have to loosen their restrictions in the same way we did. It was easier for them to do it because Texas is a different type of state with a different set of laws and rules. But we are taking the Austin example and saying, “Unless we are able to get the local politics out of land use, we're not going to be able to solve this problem.”
    


            California is also part of the lesson. Multiple local such initiatives failed in California, in Southern California, in San Francisco. The state had to take matters into their own hands. And that's where SB 79 came from, and that was an incredibly difficult process in terms of getting that bill through the California state legislature.
    


            I think the lesson that we're seeing just across the board is unless we can wholesale overhaul a number of the restrictive regulations that we have at the local level, the affordability crisis is just going to worsen.

            President Donald Trump's vow to wage the biggest domestic deportation program in American history – expelling a million people a year – is one of his signature goals.
    


            His administration has enlisted multiple federal agencies to bolster immigration enforcement operations nationwide.
    


            Camo-clad officers are flexing their presence in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis, Washington, DC and New York, often clashing with protesters along the way.
    


            Some officers work for agencies such as US Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the US Coast Guard – all reporting up to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Other personnel are troops with the National Guard, the reserve arm of the Army and Air Force.
    


            Here is a look at the agencies involved and how their complicated and often overlapping duties have evolved under the current administration's deportation policy.
    


            In its own words, US Customs and Border Protection “is one of the world's largest law enforcement organizations and is charged with keeping terrorists and their weapons out of the U.S. while facilitating lawful international travel and trade.”
    


            The agency started as the Customs Administration in 1789 to collect tariffs, the federal government's primary source of revenue at the time.
    


            Back then, the United States was effectively an “open borders” country until the passage of a law in 1875 blocking the immigration of most Chinese women on the premise of curbing prostitution and human trafficking.
    


            Full federal border inspections under a new agency began in 1891, which later became the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
    


            The functions of enforcing immigration law and collecting tariffs and customs duties stayed separate until shortly after the  September 11 terror attacks, when a push to consolidate more agencies under the new Department of Homeland Security created Customs and Border Protection in 2003.
    


            “The intent was to create a single focused agency responsible for issues at the border,” Doris Meissner, a former commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute, told CNN.
    


            The sizeable agency has more than 60,000 employees, including about 20,000 Border Patrol agents, all tasked with one mission: “Protect the American people, safeguard our borders, and enhance the nation's economic prosperity.”
    


            Two decades later, the Border Patrol division of CBP has taken on an increasingly significant role in high-profile immigration actions under Trump, with sector chief Gregory Bovino emerging as the on-the-ground face of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The initiative targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago,” DHS says.
    


            Armed agents, who once apprehended migrants across the US's borders and stopped drug and human trafficking operations, now stand sentinel over federal immigration facilities that are the sites of immigration protests.
    


            “These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so,” former CBP Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske testified in a lawsuit filed by journalists. The lawsuit stemmed from what they called “overwhelming and illegal violence” against protesters in Los Angeles this summer, a response that was also helmed by Bovino.
    


            Tensions from the summer's violent clashes between immigration officers and demonstrators continued to boil over this fall in America's largest cities.
    


Jason Houser, a former DHS official, said the current administration is putting Border Patrol agents in security and crowd control situations they're not equipped to handle.
    


            “They're trained for border interdiction, terrorist threats, drug interdictions on swift boats,” Houser said. “Those tactics aren't for de-escalation of a protest or riots. That's not their core training.”
    


            In Chicago, the indelible image of a pastor in a clerical collar shot in the head with a pepper ball by agents standing on the rooftop of an ICE building is a direct violation of CBP's use of force policy.
    


            Officers using pepper balls “shall not intentionally target the head, neck, spine, or groin of the intended subject, unless the use of deadly force is reasonable,” ﻿the policy states.
    


            But Bovino, who has said agents have acted proportionally and in response to attacks from demonstrators, expressed ambivalence about protesters being injured – also a direct violation of CBP's use of force policy.



            “If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them,” Bovino told CBS News in October. “Don't protest and don't trespass.”
    


            Like many law enforcement agencies since 9/11, the CBP has substantially beefed up its equipment with military-style weaponry and aircraft, including a fleet of Black Hawk helicopters and Predator drones.
    


            The equipment was put to use in an overnight raid in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood, when agents clad in tactical gear rappelled from a Black Hawk helicopter and burst through the windows of an apartment building to pull families from their homes.
    


            “I've been on military bases for a good portion of my life, and the activity I saw – it was an invasion,” said neighbor Darrell Ballard.
    


            The show of force in Operation Midway Blitz even included sending speedboats – the kind typically seen on the waterways along the nation's borders – to patrol the Chicago River, in the shadow of the Windy City's Trump International Hotel and Tower.
    


            The boats “are from Detroit. Those are interdiction patrol boats that patrol up and down the border between Canada and Michigan,” said Houser, who worries their presence in Chicago leaves the northern border vulnerable.
    


            “If they're not there in Michigan, does that mean those smuggling lines are open that day, but they were out going up and down (the Chicago River) like it was St. Patrick's Day?”
    


            CBP has not said if the Border Patrol assets used on the Chicago River impacted operations along the Canadian border and did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            While a city that is more than 400 miles from the nearest international border crossing may seem like an unusual choice for intense stops and searches, there is a legal loophole.
    


            The CBP can legally conduct warrantless searches of vehicles and property believed to be involved in immigration violations anywhere within 100 miles of the US border or coastline. The agency also includes the entire coastline of Lake Michigan, which lies fully within the United States, as the “functional equivalent” of an international border.
    


            Under CBP policy, Chicago is as much of a border town as El Paso, Texas.
    


            “Border enforcement does need to be as modern as possible and as updated as possible in terms of technology,” Meissner said. “But it should be taking place at the border because that's the crossing point.”

            Like its cousin CBP, ICE started as part of the new Department of Homeland Security in 2003. But in addition to having a catchier name, ICE had a different mission – focus on the nation's interior to catch and deport undocumented immigrants, along with investigating “narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, gang violence, money laundering and other financial crimes,” the agency's website says.
    


            To accomplish these two very different tasks, the agency has two divisions: Enforcement and Removal Operations, which deports people in the country illegally, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), where agents “launch and pursue investigations into transnational crime.”
    


            During the Biden administration, HSI took steps to rebrand itself and set up its own website to try to distinguish its work from deportations.
    


            “The civil immigration enforcement side of the ICE mission is not what HSI does,” Katrina Berger, then-executive associate director of HSI, told ABC News last year, a few months before retiring.
    


            Since the start of his second term, Trump made clear that ICE – including HSI – has a singular focus under his administration.
    


            “The primary mission of (HSI) is the enforcement of … (laws) related to the illegal entry and unlawful presence of aliens in the United States,” the president said in an executive order signed on Inauguration Day.
    


            The HSI patch on uniforms has become a common sight in immigration raids. It was the lead agency in the operation at a Georgia Hyundai plant in September that rounded up nearly 500 workers accused of being in the country illegally.
    


            While HSI is typically the lead on worksite enforcement issues, former agency leaders fear that increasing HSI's focus on removing undocumented workers from the country comes at the expense of investigating more significant dangers to the US, like targeting the importation of fentanyl and firearms smuggling.
    


            “HSI, within ICE, has always been focused on human smuggling, sex trafficking, cybercrimes, Deep Web threats to children,” said Houser, who served as the ICE chief of staff during the Biden administration. “What we see now is a fundamental shifting away from that focus on national security.”
    


            The agency has also faced criticism for aggressive tactics used by ICE agents in executing the president's immigration policy. Migrants have been pulled from cars, off streets and tackled in courthouses by masked agents.
    


            The heavy-handed tactics have also been used to control crowds at protests, where federal agents have at times used pepper balls, rubber bullets and tear gas to clear demonstrators.
    


            ICE and US Customs and Border Protection agents are trained “to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
    


            Federal officers under DHS are “highly trained” in de-escalation tactics and “regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said.
    


            Illinois' Democratic governor disagreed, accusing the agents of being provocative with protesters.
    


            “ICE is causing this mayhem,” Gov. JB Pritzker said. “They're the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”
    


            Illinois state Rep. Hoan Huynh says he got firsthand experience after accusing an ICE agent of pointing a gun at him when he was following an ICE vehicle.
    


            “These are ICE agents who are wearing masks. Their badges aren't very clear,” Huynh told CNN.
    


            DHS did not comment on whether a gun was drawn, but McLaughlin accused Huynh of “stalking law enforcement” and said agents had to “assess if he was a threat.”
    


            Huynh's encounter demonstrates the difficulty people have just figuring out what agency an officer represents, especially since most DHS agencies do not have standard uniforms.
    


Video of the incident shows the ICE agents wearing camo uniforms marked with “POLICE.” The agency's tan and olive shoulder patch blends into the camouflage color scheme. On a backpack, another agent is identified as being with “SRT,” the ICE Special Response Team, with SWAT-style training. Another uniform appears to say BORTAC, the Border Patrol's own tactical unit. None of the uniforms seen in the video specifically said ICE.
    


            A federal judge in Chicago expressed her own concerns about the confusion caused when agents aren't clearly identified, issuing an order that all agents “must have visible identification.”
    


            “The way that they're carrying on without any visible identification – even that they're law enforcement, much less what agency they're with – it really is pretty unprecedented to see at this scale, and I think it's very dangerous,” said Scott Shuchart, a senior ICE official during the Biden administration.
    


            It's not just the uniforms – masked federal officers have also become the new calling card of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
    


            DHS officials say the masks are necessary to deal with increasing threats against ICE agents, including violence from protesters and doxxing.
    


            Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons has said federal officers are covering up to protect their families after some have been publicly identified and then harassed online, along with relatives.
    


            “I'm not a proponent of the masks at all, but if it's going to keep officers safe, it's going to keep people from using advanced AI to find out their addresses and their families' information, then by all means I'll let them do it,” he told NewsNation in October.
    


John Sandweg, an acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama and a former acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security, has been on dozens of ride-alongs during his tenure and said he never saw anyone wear a mask.
    


            “When you're at ICE and you're at DHS, the first and highest priority is the safety of the workforce, and you have to do what's necessary to protect them, but I think there's no doubt it's gone past what any reasonable policy would allow, and it really has to be a situation where it's the exception, not the rule,” he said.

            The Coast Guard was created in 1915 after a merger of agencies that focused on maritime tax evasion and emergency response on the high seas. The Coast Guard is responsible for “safety, security, and stewardship” on the water.
    


            Over the years, its jurisdiction has expanded to include coverage of inland waterways, coastlines, bridges and ports.
    


            It is the only agency of government that is a branch of the military but operates as a civilian law enforcement agency during peacetime. The Coast Guard has been under civilian command since the end of World War II, and DHS has been in charge of the agency since 2003.
    


            The Coast Guard's unique hybrid structure straddling the military and civilian worlds allows Trump a great deal of leeway in deployment. But the administration has turned its focus to largely urban areas instead of waterways, relegating the Coast Guard to a supporting role.
    


            The Coast Guard said it was preparing to support CBP agents at the Coast Guard base in Alameda, California.
    


            It is working with other agencies to “detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border,” the Coast Guard told CNN affiliate KCRA.
    


            Last month, Coast Guard “personnel defensively fired their weapons” at a U-Haul truck backing toward them outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda, where a protest had taken place against an anticipated federal deployment in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    


            No Coast Guard personnel were hurt, DHS said at the time, and the driver's injury was not life-threatening, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.
    


            Trump later stood down on plans to “surge” resources to San Francisco after friends, including local tech executives Jensen Huang of Nvidia and Marc Benioff of Salesforce, told him San Francisco had made “substantial progress” against crime.

            The National Guard says its beginnings go back more than a century before the Revolutionary War, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony established its own permanent militia. But the current organization didn't come until 1933, when the National Guard Mobilization Act created a unique two-tiered structure.
    


            Today's National Guard is the descent of state militias and also the combat reserve for the Army and Air Force. The National Guard is under the direction of its state's governor, who decides when and where to deploy troops. The president has full power over the DC National Guard and can also federalize the states' National Guard for US operations in the case of an emergency when “regular forces” are unable to enforce federal law. Exactly what the law means by “regular forces” is still being discussed in the courts.
    


            Prior to Trump's call-ups this year in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, the last time the National Guard was put under federal control for an operation within American borders was during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 – and it was coordinated with state officials at the time.
    


            The Trump administration's attempt to invoke a rarely used law to deploy National Guard troops to several major American cities to curb crime and shut down protests has been one of the most striking and legally aggressive moves by the president — and one that's come up against legal challenges over and over again.
    


            The Trump administration recently attempted to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to protect ICE facilities that have been targeted by demonstrators in Chicago and Portland, comparing the cities to a war zone and saying there is either “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion” there.
    


            “You look at a place like Portland, it's just — it's ridiculous, when they say that there's no problem. The place is — it was on fire over the weekend,” the president said last month.
    


            But both deployments have been halted by federal judges who say there is no justification to bring in the military.
    


            In August, Trump announced he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “under direct federal control” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation's capital, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the city. The president has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC, but overall crime numbers are lower this year than in 2024.
    


            More than 2,000 National Guard troops in DC are stationed throughout the city at metro stations and monuments or memorials, while other soldiers and airmen are helping with “beautification projects,” like picking up trash, replanting grass and spreading mulch.
    


            The ongoing mission costs about $1 million a day, experts estimated to CNN.
    


            The president brought the stepped-up law enforcement model next to Memphis, Tennessee, in an attempt to crack down on crime. The move marked the first such effort in a Republican state, and Tennessee Republicans, including Gov. Bill Lee, welcomed the announcement.
    


            Like in Washington, DC, the National Guard troops in Memphis are not dedicated just to securing federal property but are also supporting local law enforcement in their operations.
    


            Although the city's leadership disagreed with the Guard's deployment, officials have cooperated and advised residents that the troops will be “serving as extra ‘eyes and ears' in our neighborhoods.”
    


            “I want to be clear I did not ask for the National Guard and I don't think it is the way to drive down crime,” Mayor Paul Young said in September. “However, that decision has already been made.”
    


            Young and others said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.
    


            Democratic-elected officials in Tennessee filed a lawsuit  trying to stop the Memphis deployment, but the court has taken no action yet.

            Almost everyone agrees that the US air traffic control system is broken.
    


            Longstanding staffing shortages. Antiquated technology. And now, air traffic controllers are caught in the middle of a political tug of war that has nothing to do with their operations.
    


The government shutdown has left controllers working unpaid, six-day-weeks. That's worsened a staffing crisis, with some airports' control towers occasionally being without any controllers at all.
    


            And now that crisis, combined with the shutdown, has led to Federal Aviation Administration limits on flights at the nation's 40 largest airports, with hundreds of flight cancellations daily and disruptions across the country.
    


            There's no immediate remedy. But some experts say there are solutions that could change the dynamic in relatively short order — either privatize air traffic control or set up a separate government corporation that can run the system.
    


            Advocates of privatization, or at least separation of the service from the FAA, think the current crisis might create an opportunity for reform.
    


            “It opens a window to have this looked at seriously,” said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank, which has been working on ATC privatization since 1981.
    


            The US Postal Service already operates as a separate government-controlled corporation, providing service to communities large and small. And while the USPS has its own problems, its employees are still getting paid during the shutdown and mail deliveries haven't been reduced.
    


            Poole and other advocates want the service privatized either an independent not-for-profit corporation — as was done in Canada in 1995 — or as a separate government-controlled corporation with a dedicated revenue stream from fees and taxes collected from airlines and passengers.
    


            They argue this is the best way to get the air traffic control system the resources it needs to modernize and for a much-needed hiring increase. Keeping the system within the Federal Aviation Administration hampers both efforts, they argue.
    


            Privatization or separation from the FAA would be more efficient than the current system, said Michael McCormick, professor of air traffic management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida.
    


            “Being tied to the annual (congressional) appropriation bill means you don't get secured funding, and you can't really engage in active planning for investments, particularly capital investments,” he said.
    


            With some form of privatization, McCormick said, “you can plan better for how you're going to develop infrastructure.”
    


            He added that there are different forms of privatization, with some services more under the control of the government than others, but none are a for-profit model that would allow investors to demand profit over safety.
    


            But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has declared privatization a non-starter and a distraction from efforts to improve the system, despite Trump's support of the idea in the past.
    


            “Privatization is a fight that someone else can have at some other point,” Duffy said at an August press conference.
    


            The last privatization effort in 2017 and 2018 actually had the support of both the airline industry and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the controllers. It was the first time those key parties both agreed with the privatization efforts, said McCormick.
    


            But he said private plane owners and pilots and operators of business jets were able to kill the bill over concerns their ATC costs at smaller airports would jump.
    


            Those groups have a surprisingly powerful lobby, McCormick noted, with enough members of Congress who are pilots to form a “general aviation caucus.” And the business travel sector serves the interests of many of the nation's largest and most powerful corporations.
    


            The private plane owners and business jet operators have a financial incentive to fight privatization, as they currently are paying only about 10% of the cost of providing ATC at small airports through fees and fuel taxes, according to McCormick.
    


            Those groups are still opposed to privatization.
    


            “We do have the largest, most complex and safest system in the world. Others have pointed to a privatized model … if you look at some of them around the globe, you'll see that they have almost the same problems as the United States does with respect to staffing, with respect to funding,” said Jim Coon, senior vice president for government affairs and advocacy for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
    


            He agrees the system needs modernizing – but he says privatizing the ATC could disproportionately hurt smaller airports like the ones private planes use.
    


            “A privatized, economic-based air traffic control system really hurts the small world communities around the country, where their airports are really sometimes a lifeline of these communities,” he said. “Airports like New York and Los Angeles and Atlanta — that's where the investment will go.”
    


            The controllers' union and Airlines for America (A4A), the commercial airlines' trade association, declined to directly address the question of privatization when asked on Friday. The airlines trade group pointed to a joint letter it and other aviation groups sent to Congress in February calling for unity in support of modernizing the ATC system.
    


            Trump's domestic policy bill, passed in July, includes $12.5 billion in modernization funding.
    


            That money is a new opportunity for the country's ATC system, said Coons.
    


            “Congress has debated this issue, and they put it aside,” he said. “I think we have a rare chance here to get everyone together and get our system modernized as fast as possible.”

Fox News chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt says fake threat calls to college campuses are costing universities millions of dollars on ‘The Will Cain Show.' 

A startling rise in violent attacks and threats against historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) throughout the country is raising concerns among students, administrators and experts, as multiple shootings and fake threats have been reported across campuses.

Last month, gunshots rang out in the areas surrounding two HBCUs, leaving administrators scrambling as schools attempted to ramp up security in the wake of the violence.

On Oct. 24, as Howard University was hosting its annual homecoming event, one woman, three men and a teenage boy were shot just steps from the campus in Washington, D.C. Although none of the victims were students, one individual was reportedly enrolled at Maryland's Morgan State.

Police arrested two 19-year-old suspects and recovered three guns in connection with the shooting, according to FOX 5. However, authorities have since said that more individuals may have been involved.

Over the same weekend, one person was killed and six were injured by gunfire at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, according to authorities. One suspect was subsequently taken into custody in connection with the shooting.

""The sad commentary is, in these communities, you're finding that there are individuals who are armed and also enjoy athletic events,"" criminal and civil trial attorney Ted Williams, a former police officer in the capital, told Fox News Digital. ""They are armed with guns and decide to attend these athletic events, and they also bring their guns with them.""

Additionally, a shooting at South Carolina State University's homecoming killed a 19-year-old visitor and injured another attendee, according to Inside Higher Ed. The shooter was reportedly not a student at the university.

Another incident involving three individuals being arrested at Southern University and A&M College in Louisiana's homecoming after they were allegedly caught carrying guns on campus, the outlet reported. One individual reportedly fired a weapon, though no one was injured.

""These are individuals who are outside of the college community itself, [and] are creating problems and havoc for individuals who just want to go to one of these athletic events that are occurring on a HBCU campus without being shot,"" Williams said. ""It's very puzzling.""

Two additional HBCUs – Jackson State University and Alcorn State University – also reportedly saw shootings break out at their homecoming events, with one person fatally shot at Alcorn State.

""No one should have to live this way, but we do have thugs out here who attend these HBCU events and they're hell-bent on creating havoc,"" Williams said.

In addition to the various homecoming shootings on HBCU campuses, several schools have fallen victim to swatting hoaxes aiming to foster confusion and chaos among the community.

Swatting is the act of falsely reporting an emergency – such as a bomb threat or school shooting – in an attempt to prompt a large law enforcement response.

According to a UNCF study, HBCUs disproportionately receive more threats than other institutions throughout the country. Over the last three years, HBCUs received 76 threats, ultimately impacting 51 of the 101 institutions and halting campus operations while officials looked to identify the unknown threat.

In light of the uptick in threats and seemingly random acts of violence on HBCU campuses, many schools have opted to increase security in an effort to keep students safe.

Since 2022, numerous campuses have added new safety features – such as installing more cameras on campus and hiring additional police officers – while also working to strengthen their relationships with federal and local law enforcement, according to Inside Higher Ed.

The moves can help officials keep track of who is coming on and off campus as the vast majority of instances involve perpetrators who are unaffiliated with the school.

""The only deterrence that's going to be acceptable is for HBCU law enforcement to marry up with local law enforcement officers and try to bring a stop to these kinds of [incidents],"" Williams told Fox News Digital.

Williams pointed to schools potentially using magnetometers at events, while employing additional law enforcement to patrol the perimeter of large gatherings.

However, the threat to personal safety while attending college can linger in the back of a student's mind, potentially stoking fear among those who are just trying to earn their education.

""The fact that HBCU college students cannot attend an event without fear is harming their educational experience,"" Williams said. ""I think that it is devastating to a young college student, or their parents and relatives and friends who want to be able to go to these HBCU events and not be killed, shot, maimed or injured – and that is not happening right now.""

James Austin Johnson has become the linchpin of the show's catchall approach to political satire.

Keeping up with national politics this year hasn't been easy. Even amid a government shutdown, so much is happening in Washington, at such a rapid clip and such a high pitch, that a browser of The New York Times' homepage could be forgiven for giving up and clicking straight through to Spelling Bee. But what if keeping up is your job? What if you are, say, a comedy writer tasked with translating the week's headlines into fodder for a 90-minute live variety show? Saturday Night Live seems to have found its solution: Dump it all into the cold open.

This week's news cycle encompassed a seeming rebuke of Donald Trump at the ballot box, massive flight cancellations three weeks before Thanksgiving, and the expiration of food-stamp benefits nationwide. And then on Thursday, after most of the show had been written, a man collapsed in the Oval Office, generating an instantly meme-able photograph of the president staring into the camera, looking oblivious to efforts to revive the prone victim at stage left.

All of these moments had already been picked over by social-media commentators and daily talk shows, making it even more difficult for the 50-year-old weekly show to figure out what micro scandal to lampoon on TV comedy's biggest stage. So the weeks have gone at Saturday Night Live since Trump returned to the White House in January. Fortunately, the program has its ace in the hole: the uncanny Trump impersonator James Austin Johnson.

This week, the Oval Office fainting incident launched a cold open typical of SNL's Trump 2.0 era—a survey of recent happenings that included not only the democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral election and the Supreme Court's late-breaking ruling on SNAP funding but also the continuing shutdown, rising grocery prices, and the demolition of the White House's East Wing. “Each week, I like to create a big visual that sort of sums up how things are going,” Johnson as Trump said as he stepped out of the scene and into the spotlight. He could've been describing any number of recent openers too.

During a flood-the-zone presidency, this seems like a sound strategy. Any one of the topics covered in Johnson's monologue could've been fodder for a stand-alone sketch. Instead, the shotgun approach keeps SNL plugged into the political conversation in a way that suits a politician with zero chill or focus. Handling headlines in bulk ensures that Johnson's Trump, unlike the real one, can monopolize our attention for only so long.

Read: The strategy behind Trump's policy blitz

It's an ideal convergence of form, content, and performer. Before he was recruited by SNL, Johnson popularized his Trump impression during the coronavirus pandemic; in a series of discursive rants, he wound through such unpresidential topics as the Pokémon franchise's ever-expanding roster of catchable creatures and the ineffectual detective skills of a cartoon dog. (“Scooby-Doo, he doesn't do.”) The solo-act effect of these cold opens was already baked into Johnson's videos on X and Instagram; with the lockdowns ruling out live performances, he could do the bit on his own, based on a public figure who's something of a solo act himself.

Johnson hasn't just mastered the president's voice and mannerisms; he has replicated the president's signature way of drawing audiences down twisting paths of logic through thickets of mispronunciations and dropped articles. The hallmarks of his most viral early videos are still there, wryly fused to matters of national and international import: a Ratatouille reference tacked onto an account of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s quick exit from the Oval Office; a vague threat to steal not only Thanksgiving but also Christmas, a.k.a. “doing Grinch.” Johnson is uniquely positioned to race through the most pressing current events in the most humorous fashion, so that the show can satisfy the “can't wait to see SNL's take on this” crowd right at 11:30 Eastern, and then ease up on the politics until “Weekend Update” rolls around.

This isn't to say that the rest of the episode, which was hosted by the roast comedian Nikki Glaser, laid off the topical punch lines entirely: An absurdist travelogue about two bachelorette-party guests on a runaway mechanical bull still made room for a crack about drone strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. But such mentions (including those on “Weekend Update”) were quick hits, easily drowned out by pop-culture jokes and the like.

The opening sketch has long been the primary venue for the show's most enduring political satire. It's the slot where Will Ferrell, playing George W. Bush, summed up his first presidential bid in the word “strategery,” and where Tina Fey as Sarah Palin said “I can see Russia from my house!” But SNL can't satirize this administration with a single catchphrase. Trump's second term calls for an approach as overwhelming as the noise blasting from the White House every day. Johnson is the right man for that job. Sketches such as last night's Oval Office monologue compact the coal of the administration's info dumps into little diamonds of comedy, freeing the writers and cast to pursue more escapist fare.

Self-driving robotaxis and delivery robots are already on America's streets. Scaling them up, however, will require a significant amount of money.

Investors got a reminder of that this week when Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash reported quarterly earnings. A common topic was each company's plans for autonomous vehicles — and, to varying degrees, how much they'll need to invest to make them common sights across the US.

The most notable example came when delivery company DoorDash reported results on Wednesday. It said it plans to spend ""several hundred million dollars more"" than previously planned on key initiatives, including its autonomous delivery technology, in 2026.

DoorDash's autonomous delivery efforts include Dot, a stroller-sized robot launched this year that can navigate itself across bike lanes and sidewalks to make deliveries.

""This is not something that's going to happen overnight,"" CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call Wednesday. ""It does require making investments upfront.""

DoorDash's stock fell 17% on Thursday — the biggest one-day drop in its history — after the company unveiled its spending plan.

The CEOs of the major ride-hailing services also said that they need to invest more in robotaxis to expand those operations and make money from them.

Lyft, which has a partnership with Waymo, for instance, is planning to build a depot in Nashville to charge, service, and store cars available to Lyft riders there. The depot is expected to cost between $10 million and $15 million to build, CFO Erin Brewer said on Lyft's earnings call on Wednesday.

The upfront cost is necessary for the self-driving cars to operate smoothly, CEO David Risher said on the call.

""You've got to invest in some physical infrastructure, but we like the unit economics there a lot,"" he said.

Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, said on an earnings call Tuesday that self-driving cars are a money-losing venture for the company right now. However, over time, Uber plans to invest in expanding the availability of driverless cars for its users, aiming to increase demand from riders, he said.

It's the same model Uber has used in the past and plans to use in several areas of growth, from robotaxis to Moto, which offers trips on motorbikes in some foreign markets, Khosrowshahi said.

""We can turn those products profitable if we want it tomorrow, but it's about the balance of investing in profitability and growth,"" he said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't ""undo"" those food stamp payments.

The late-night directive from the Trump administration adds to the chaos surrounding the anti-hunger program that serves more than 42 million Americans.

The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November.

""To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,"" the memo said.

State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said.

States must also ""immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,"" the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for ""any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.""

It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move.

""The cruelty is the point. It is their choice to do this,"" Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X.

The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The memo was first reported by The New York Times.

It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The judge rejected the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program amid the U.S. government shutdown.

The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration.

The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had ""confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.""

The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied that request on Friday.

But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits.

The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.

U.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell on Oct. 31 told the administration to use that fund to pay partial benefits, at least, and to explore other options to provide full benefits.

The administration, days later, said it would pay 65% of the benefits, but ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds to make up the difference.

The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.

The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1.

Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.

At least two people died in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Fung-wong lashed central and eastern parts of the country, with heavy rains and strong winds cutting power in large areas of the Bicol region ahead of its expected landfall in northern Luzon.

More than a million people have evacuated vulnerable areas ahead Super Typhoon Fung-wong's projected landfall in Aurora province as early as Sunday night, with officials urging residents to heed evacuation orders.

Sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) and gusts of up to 230 kph (140 mph) are already battering many parts of Luzon with the Fung-wong's massive rain bands, the authorities said.

More areas across Luzon, the Philippines' most populous island, have been placed under the highest and second-highest storm warning levels while Metro Manila and nearby provinces remain at level 3.

As a safety precaution, the civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, including Bicol International Airport and Sangley in Metro Manila.

The civil defense office reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City.

Named locally as Uwan, Fung-wong is the 21st storm this year to hit a nation that normally has about 20 a year and threatens to place further strain on disaster response efforts as the Southeast Asian archipelago recovers from Typhoon Kalmaegi, which killed 224 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam.

Fung-wong is expected to head northwest from Monday and then north by Tuesday, remaining at typhoon intensity, said weather bureau PAGASA.

By Wednesday, it is projected to move towards the Taiwan Strait, weakening before landfall in western Taiwan on Thursday. It is then forecast to lose strength rapidly before emerging over the waters of Ryukyu Islands as a weak tropical system.

Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro urged residents in the storm's path to heed evacuation orders, warning that refusing to comply was dangerous and unlawful.

""We ask that people to preemptively evacuate so that we don't end up having to conduct rescues at the last minute, which could put the lives of police, soldiers, firefighters and coast guard personnel at risk,"" he said in a public address.

Authorities hope to avoid casualties this time, civil defense official Raffy Alejandro told a press conference.

The military has redirected about 2,000 troops from field training to focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster response.

In Isabela in northern Luzon, dozens of families were sheltering in a basketball court repurposed as an evacuation center.

""We heard on the news that the typhoon is very strong, so we evacuated early,"" said Christopher Sanchez, 50, who fled with his family.

""We left our things on the roofs of our house, since every time there's a storm, we come here because we live right next to the river,"" he told Reuters. ""In previous storms, the floodwaters rose above human height.

""We're scared. We're here with our grandchildren and our kids. The whole family is in the evacuation area.""

Bitcoin and Ether steadied Sunday as traders weighed a fragile hold above $100,000 for BTC and a rebound in ETH toward the mid-$3,000s amid tentative risk appetite.

Bitcoin and Ether held steady on Sunday as traders balanced on a knife-edge. As per Coingecko data, Bitcoin traded near $102,100, about +2% in 24 hours.

On the other hand, Ethereum hovered around $3,530, about +4% in 24 hours.

The market was shaped by a modest increase in US spot Bitcoin ETF demand late last week, alongside a cautious macroeconomic backdrop that kept crypto prices stuck in a range.

US spot Bitcoin ETFs turned positive again on Thursday, November 7, attracting roughly $240M after six consecutive days of outflows.

Most of the buying came from products offered by BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest, according to figures from Farside Investors.

Ethereum developers have set December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade, which will introduce PeerDAS.

The feature is meant to expand data capacity for layer-2 networks. It's an important step for the ecosystem, even as ETH prices remain choppy.

The swing back to ETF inflows followed a rough start to November and arrived alongside calmer weekend trading. It suggests a more stable mood rather than a clear shift in direction.

Earlier in the week, Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000. The slip came during a broader pullback across crypto and related stocks, with liquidations and position cuts adding pressure.

Bitcoin's heat map shows thick liquidity sitting between about $110,000 and $125,000. That suggests many resting sell orders above the current price.

The market has been easing since early October, when Bitcoin briefly traded near $123,000. Since then, it has moved lower, marking a pattern of lower highs and lower lows into early November near $100,000.

Liquidity looks heaviest around $115,000 and $120,000, where the yellow-green bands cluster. Areas below show lighter activity, pointing to fewer buyers.

A sharp slide in mid-October left a thin pocket of support, though liquidity has started to form again.

Ethereum is also approaching a significant supply zone near $3,700. About 869,000 ETH were bought around this level, creating a strong resistance cap.

Glassnode's cost-basis data shows many holders sitting near break-even here, so some may sell if prices bounce.

Recent price action tells a similar story. ETH has tried several times to break above the $3,700–$4,200 band but failed, with each attempt followed by sharp pullbacks.

Ethereum has been making lower highs since mid-October. That shows momentum is slowing. Unless the price can push above this tight resistance area, it may keep moving sideways or slip lower, as sellers still sit overhead.

On the hourly chart, ETH is working its way back after a sharp pullback earlier in the week.

The price has been making higher lows along a rising trendline, suggesting buyers are stepping in. It recently climbed toward $3,440 after holding support near $3,300.

Momentum looks better in the short term. Price candles are holding above the trendline and trying to clear the recent congestion zone.

There is no firm breakout yet, but the slow grind higher points to growing interest. A clean move above $3,480–$3,500 could open more upside.

If ETH falls back under the trendline, the picture weakens. For now, the market looks like it's building pressure to the upside.

Bitcoin is not looking great right now. 

Traders kicked off the year by being told that the top cryptocurrency's price would skyrocket to $200,000 before the end of 2025, but investors now find themselves watching it tremble around $100,000. 

Rather than confirming expectations that the price would surge in October, Uptober failed to materialise. Instead, traders saw the total crypto market shed some $800 billion of its value, roughly 19%.

“Bears have clearly been in control,” Jasper De Maere, OTC Trader at trading firm Wintermute, told DL News.

“The market now seems to be tipping again, chopping around the critical $100,000 level, a zone that continues to be defended firmly,” De Maere continued. “This level is not just technically important but also a major psychological threshold.”

The plunge in market confidence comes on the back of what should've been a victory lap for the crypto industry after a record 2025. 

Since US President Donald Trump took office in January, he's been busy ticking off items on the industry's wishlist. 

He freed Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht, pardoned Binance co-founder Chanpeng Zhao, signed pro-crypto executive orders, and signed a landmark stablecoin bill into law. 

Yet, the price plunged. Even the Federal Reserve deciding to cut interest rates in October, which is usually bullish for Bitcoin's price, failed to drive the price up.

And analysts are losing hope. Galaxy Digital's analysts now say the price may only manage to drag itself to $120,000 before 2026. They previously said Bitcoin would hit $185,000 ahead of January.

There are several reasons why confidence has been zapped from the market. 

The crypto industry is still reeling from the October 10 crash that saw some $20 billion in liquidations, as well as the $128 million Balancer hack on November 3.

Another part of the problem, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset investment firm CoinShares, is that traders have failed to update their playbook.

“Some long-term investors appear to be acting on the four-year cycle narrative, a self-fulfilling pattern we do not subscribe to but cannot ignore” Butterfill told DL News. “Adherents to this framework are locking in profits, convinced that the cycle top is approaching.”

To him, this mindset explains why many big investors have sold their positions and driven the price down 19% since its $126,000 high at the beginning of October. 

And it's not just crypto traders that are feeling a bit down in the dumps.

American consumers' sentiment about their future prospects have plunged to nearly record lows. Rising inflation and unemployment coupled with Trump's trade wars and the longest running government shutdown ever darken their mood. 

Add to that, there are also fears over whether the artificial intelligence bubble will burst, which also weigh on global markets.

Even so, market watchers remain bullish for the long-term prospects of crypto.

“While the pullback is likely to rattle some investors, volatility of this scale is not unusual,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at trading platform eToro, told DL News on Friday.

He noted that Bitcoin dropped from $109,000 to $74,500 between January and April before rallying to reach its latest all-time high price.

Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, said on November 5 that he expects the price to hit $1 million around 2028, provided that governments keep issuing debt to pay for themselves.

But for Bitcoin to bounce back, Sean Dawson, head of research at perpetual-trading platform Derive, said it needs no more bad news to strike decentralised finance.

“No insolvency announcements, nor hacks, would re-establish trust in the market,” he told DL News on Friday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Inside the Mind of Jared Esguerra: A Decade of Innovation in Blockchain and Finance","https://hauteliving.com/2025/11/inside-the-mind-of-jared-esguerra-a-decade-of-innovation-in-blockchain-and-finance/779925/","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:11:11 GMT","

In an era defined by rapid technological evolution and financial reinvention, few figures have navigated the crossroads of blockchain and finance with as much foresight and precision as Jared Esguerra. Over the past decade, Esguerra has emerged as one of the most forward-thinking investors in fintech and crypto currency traders— a rare blend of visionary strategist, disciplined investor, and hands-on builder. His story isn't just one of financial success; it's a masterclass in how to anticipate disruption, harness emerging technologies, and shape the future of an entire industry.

Jared Esguerra's journey into the world of fintech began long before blockchain became a buzzword. Early in his career, he cut his teeth in traditional finance.

But it was this very exposure that made Esguerra question the system he was part of. He noticed how outdated infrastructure, slow transaction systems, and regulatory red tape limited innovation in banking and finance. He saw an opportunity — not just to optimize the system, but to reinvent it.

Then came the breakthrough moment: the discovery of blockchain technology. To many, Bitcoin was a speculative gamble; to Esguerra, it was the spark of a new financial paradigm. He saw past the hype and volatility to the underlying principle — the ability to transfer value without intermediaries, to record trust through code rather than centralized institutions. “What excited me wasn't just digital currency,” Esguerra has said in interviews. “It was the promise of a new kind of infrastructure — programmable money, programmable trust.”

As blockchain technology evolved, Esguerra positioned himself not as a mere investor, but as a bridge between two worlds: traditional finance and decentralized innovation. His unique strength lay in translating complex blockchain principles into financially sound, scalable opportunities.

Esguerra began working on blockchain projects, focusing on those that solved real problems — not just those chasing hype.

Among his early investments were blockchain-based lending platforms and digital payment infrastructures that aimed to simplify cross-border transactions. At the time, these ideas seemed niche. Today, they underpin billions of dollars in decentralized financial activity.

Esguerra's thesis was simple yet profound: finance and technology are no longer separate industries — they are converging into one ecosystem. This foresight allowed him to identify trends years before they hit mainstream awareness. From stablecoins to decentralized identity verification, Esguerra's portfolio reflects a consistent focus on the infrastructure layer of fintech — the systems that make financial innovation possible.

Over the past ten years, Esguerra's track record reads like a timeline of fintech's evolution. Early on, he championed digital payment platforms that reduced friction for emerging markets, empowering small businesses to transact globally with minimal fees. Later, he turned his attention to DeFi — the movement to recreate financial instruments like lending, borrowing, and trading using blockchain technology.

Where many investors saw DeFi as risky and experimental, Esguerra saw its inevitability. He understood that the financial system's central intermediaries — banks, brokers, clearinghouses — were ripe for disruption. “Every layer of finance that charges a fee for access or validation,” he once remarked, “is an opportunity for decentralized innovation.”

What sets Jared Esguerra apart isn't just his technical knowledge or investment acumen — it's his mindset. He's guided by a blend of patience, pragmatism, and long-term thinking that's increasingly rare in a fast-moving industry.

Esguerra often emphasizes strategic foresight — the ability to look several years ahead, anticipate market trends, and act before they become obvious. He's known for identifying “inflection points” — moments when technology shifts from experimentation to real-world adoption.

Equally important is his emphasis on discipline. In an industry prone to hype cycles, Esguerra is deliberate about when to enter and exit markets. He studies macroeconomic conditions, token velocity, governance models, and long-term adoption metrics. His decision-making process is both quantitative and intuitive — data-driven, yet deeply informed by experience and human insight.

Despite his success, Esguerra has never been blind to the challenges that come with innovation. The blockchain and fintech sectors are fraught with volatility, fraud risks, and evolving regulations. Rather than avoiding these complexities, Esguerra confronts them head-on.

He has worked closely with compliance experts to help shape balanced frameworks for decentralized finance. His goal is to ensure that innovation can thrive responsibly, without compromising consumer protection or financial stability.

As he looks toward the future, Jared Esguerra remains as curious and driven as ever. He sees the next decade as one defined by convergence — the merging of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics into a unified fintech ecosystem.

AI-driven risk assessment, blockchain-secured transactions, and decentralized digital identity are no longer theoretical concepts; they're becoming the new foundation of finance. Esguerra is already investing at this intersection — those using AI to analyze on-chain data, or creating blockchain frameworks.

But even as technology evolves, Esguerra's guiding principle stays constant: innovation must empower. For him, fintech isn't just about creating smarter systems — it's about creating fairer systems. The ultimate goal is a financial landscape that is borderless, inclusive, and transparent — one that gives every individual, regardless of geography, equal access to opportunity.

Inside the mind of Esguerra lies a blend of data-driven insight, creative foresight, and unshakable conviction in the power of technology to reshape finance. Over a decade of innovation, he has proven that true success in fintech comes not from chasing trends, but from anticipating transformations — and building the systems that make them possible.

As blockchain continues to mature and fintech continues to expand into every corner of the global economy, Jared Esguerra's influence will only grow. He is not just investing in companies; he's investing in the future of finance itself — one block, one vision, one innovation at a time.

Roundtable and RYVYL announced that Aly Madhavji, Managing Partner of Blockchain Founders Fund, a blockchain investor, will become Chief Financial Officer of the soon-to-be merged entity as the companies move toward a NASDAQ listing. Madhavji will guide the merger integration and connect the combined company with traditional and blockchain investment communities. Current RYVYL CFO George Oliva will transition to Chief Accounting Officer after the merger is complete.

Madhavji brings experience investing in more than 200 blockchain infrastructure companies across global markets and maintains relationships with over 500 co-investors worldwide. Based in Singapore, he holds multiple financial credentials, including Chartered Accountant, CPA, CMA, and CIM designations. His academic background includes a Master's in Global Affairs from Tsinghua University, an MBA from INSEAD, where he was a Blockchain Fellow, and a BA in Commerce with Distinction from the University of Toronto, where he serves on the Governing Council. He has served on the board of Soluna Holdings and is an author, speaker, and industry analyst with media presence, including the Amazon Prime Video series Crypto Knights.

Roundtable's leadership team includes CEO James Heckman, blockchain pioneer and Chief Product Architect Eyal Hertzog, and COO Bill Sornsin. Hertzog previously architected the automated market-making and liquidity pool model used across decentralized finance and founded Bancor. He also co-founded the social video platform MetaCafe. Heckman has built and scaled multiple digital media companies and platforms, including Arena Group, Rivals.com, Scout.com, and 5to1.com, and held senior roles at Yahoo, Google, and News Corp.

Roundtable operates a Web3-based enterprise media distribution and monetization platform offering decentralized payments, real-time revenue reporting, and on-chain audience and data ownership for journalists and publishers. RYVYL provides digital payment processing solutions and turnkey financial products.

Upon closing of the merger, the combined company will be renamed RTB Digital, Inc., doing business as Roundtable. James Heckman will serve as CEO and Walton Comer will become Chairman, leading a seven-member board. Aly Madhavji will serve as CFO of the merged company and George Oliva will serve as Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer. One RYVYL independent director, Brett Moyer, will remain, while the other RYVYL directors will step down. The merger is subject to shareholder approval and regulatory review.

KEY QUOTES:

“In over 30 years of financing and operating technology companies, I've not met someone with more intensity and thoroughness as a board member and investor, which is consistent with his technical and financial acumen. His contribution has been so impressive, we invited him to join this once in a lifetime opportunity to transform an entire industry. Aly has the unique ability to translate the vision of our revolutionary platform to both traditional and blockchain focused investment communities.”

James Heckman, Chief Executive Officer, Roundtable

“I'm joining Roundtable as CFO because Roundtable has turned the media industry's long-aspired Web3 vision into practical reality. The RYVYL merger brings bank grade payments and public market discipline; our platform gives publishers what they've wanted for years: real-time revenue, transparent reporting, and control of their data, audiences, and IP, only possible with Web3. After diligencing and investing in hundreds of blockchain infrastructure teams, this is the one that stands apart; and why Blockchain Founders Fund made Roundtable our largest investment, and so I'm stepping in to lead our NASDAQ journey and align Roundtable with both traditional and Crypto focused investors.”

The world's most loveable bears have done it again. Milk Mocha ($HUGS) tokens have taken the crypto scene by storm. Its whitelist slots have filled up and has now closed, while the $HUGS presale has gone live. Fans and traders alike are flocking to secure their spot in what's shaping up to be 2025's biggest and most heart-driven presale.

This isn't your average meme coin hype cycle. With its blend of emotional fandom and functional cryptoeconomics, $HUGS has turned the simple act of clicking “Join” into one of the year's hottest opportunities. There's no KYC, no minimum buy, and no complex forms. It takes just one click, but wait too long, and you'll miss your chance to be part of the most talked-about crypto right now.

The $HUGS whitelist has officially closed, and the numbers are jaw-dropping. With 100% of all slots filled, its now-live presale is rewriting what “high demand” means in Web3. Milk Mocha's global reach, with millions of fans worldwide, has turned a routine whitelist into an internet-wide rush.

Entry couldn't be simpler. There's no KYC, no wallet limits, and no minimum purchase requirement. All it takes is a valid email and wallet connection to unlock access to the 40-stage presale, which began at $0.0002 per token. Each stage gradually increases the price, ensuring early participants gain the most value. Any unsold tokens are automatically burned, keeping supply tight and deflationary. The result? A record-breaking registration rate that's leaving even seasoned crypto investors stunned. 

At first glance, Milk Mocha's $HUGS token might look like a feel-good project wrapped in fuzzy branding, but underneath that charm lies a powerhouse of token utility. $HUGS is a multi-utility ecosystem token, designed to fuel staking, NFTs, governance, and gamified features, all tied to one deflationary core.

Holders can earn 60% APY through flexible staking, with daily compounding and instant reward withdrawals. There are no lockups, making it easy for users to earn while they engage. Every transaction, whether buying an NFT or playing a mini-game, triggers token burns, reducing supply and strengthening long-term value.

This isn't about temporary hype; it's about sustainable design. Milk Mocha has fused sentiment with structure, showing that a project can be both adorable and intelligent. The token's model encourages real participation and continuous growth, proving that in the world of crypto, the cutest projects can also be the most credible.

The heartbeat of Milk Mocha's success has always been its fans, and they're the real driving force behind this record-breaking presale. With over 50 million followers across social platforms and merchandise stores, Milk Mocha already had the kind of global recognition most crypto brands dream of. Now, that emotional connection is translating directly into on-chain activity.

The 10% lifetime referral system has supercharged this growth, rewarding users who bring new buyers into the ecosystem. Every referral boosts both participants' earnings, turning fandom into a financial opportunity. Meanwhile, the governance tool for $HUGS holders, lets the community steer the direction of the project, from NFT themes to charitable donations.

This combination of incentives and inclusivity has transformed the Milk Mocha community into a powerful movement. Fans aren't just buying tokens; they're building the project's future. It's proof that love, loyalty, and liquidity can thrive side by side.

With the whitelist now closed, the journey for $HUGS has accelerated. The $HUGS presale will continue through its 40 pricing stages, each round offering fewer tokens at higher prices. Early-stage participants stand to gain significantly, with projections of 150x to 200x ROI by the time of exchange listings and ecosystem expansion.

Upcoming roadmap milestones include the launch of the $HUGS NFT collection, a gamified staking dashboard, and interactive mini-games that all integrate with the token. Each new feature adds fresh layers of engagement and deflationary mechanics, ensuring the $HUGS economy stays active and valuable.

This forward momentum is what sets Milk Mocha apart from fleeting meme coins. It's not just about being first; it's about being part of something that continues to evolve, reward, and grow. The whitelist might be closing, but for $HUGS holders, the story is just beginning.

Milk Mocha's $HUGS token is in its most crucial stretch with the whitelist now open, and the buzz is deafening. Fans and traders are racing to claim their space before the window shuts for good. This isn't another meme coin moment; it's a movement built on transparency, creativity, and community strength.

Offering 60% APY staking, NFT integration, deflationary cryptoeconomics, and real governance, $HUGS stands as one of the most well-rounded projects in the 2025 presale outlook. Add a fanbase of millions, and you've got a token that combines warmth with wealth potential.

In the end, it all comes down to timing. And with the whitelist closed and presale live, there's no time left to hesitate. One click, that's all it takes. Investors are rushing to join the presale now and become part of the sweetest success story in crypto.

Monroe, Louisiana--(Newsfile Corp. - November 9, 2025) - Krown Network, the quantum-secured, bootstrapped Layer 1 blockchain, sold out its final pre-sale batch of $500,000 in just over 4 hours - delivering a scorching $125,000 per hour fundraising velocity that surpasses industry legends. 

This raise burst surpasses Ethereum's full 2014 ICO, which raised at a velocity of $18,162 per hour. Krown's speed eclipses it by seven times that rate in head-to-head final timeframes, while BTC was mined at a negligible value in 2009, gradually increasing to under 1,000 wallets by mid-2010, with no significant capital influx.

Krown: $125,000/hourEthereum ICO: $18,162/hourBitcoin (2009-2011): $0/hour

Ethereum's ICO was tainted with a 12% pre-mine for the founders and the foundation, fueling early concerns about centralization. Krown, by contrast, bootstrapped $3M with zero VC interference, echoing Bitcoin's grassroots purity while channeling Ethereum's visionary scale - all in a 2025 crypto VC market exploding past $20 billion year-to-date, where over 90% of Layer 1 funding hides behind private VC deals and vesting schedules.

Krown's traction extends beyond ETH and BTC. This final batch velocity outruns foundational ICOs like Cardano (16 months at ~$5,399/hour) and Fantom (3 months at ~$18,519/hour), proving bootstrapped innovation still thrives amid hype-driven projects and coins. 

In a year where crypto startups raked in billions through centralized exchanges and VCs, Krown's community-fueled raise signals a return to decentralized roots.

""This velocity isn't luck; it's validation of quantum-secured innovation,"" declared Krown CEO James Stephens. ""While giants retrofit for tomorrow's threats, Krown launches ready - with $500K vanishing in hours, fully liquid, and community-owned. ""With MainNet igniting on January 3, 2026, and 70% of $KROWN supply staked pre-launch, Krown isn't chasing history - it's rewriting the playbook. 

Positioning for MainNet Launch

Krown's pre-sale success fuels momentum toward its MainNet launch on January 3, 2026, when the native $KROWN token will power the Camelot Ecosystem, including the recently launched Qastle hot wallet and upcoming KrownDEX - the world's first quantum-secured decentralized exchange. With 70% of the supply already staked pre-launch, Krown is poised for explosive post-MainNet growth, integrating quantum entropy from equity partner, Quantum eMotion Corp. (TSXV: QNC) (OTCQB: QNCCF) (FSE: 34Q0), to safeguard against both classical and quantum threats.

While Apple's iPhone already supports texting, calling emergency services, and contacting roadside assistance via satellite connectivity, the company has many more satellite-powered features in the works, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

In-development features reportedly include an API allowing app makers to support satellite connections in their own apps, a version of Apple Maps that allows users to navigate without a cell or WiFi connection, adding photos to messaging, and increased support for “natural usage,” allowing users to connect to a satellite even if their phone isn't pointed directly at the sky.

All of these features would potentially increase the usability of iPhones when their owners are outside the range of traditional cell networks. Another potential upgrade, first reported by The Information, could improve 5G networks by allowing them to connect to satellites for increased coverage.

The basic features would be free, Gurman says, with customers paying carriers for more advanced support. In addition, Apple's satellite partner Globalstar reportedly needs to improve its infrastructure to support these upgrades, which Apple is helping to finance.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

The F1 São Paulo Grand Prix live stream is available for free, great news! Especially since November is one of the best months for F1 fans. After Brazil, we'll watch the Las Vegas and Qatar GPs, making the month even more exciting.

But if you're here just to watch the F1 São Paulo Grand Prix on a free channel, don't worry. We'll explain how to access the live stream at no cost and watch the full weekend in HD on any device, wherever you are.

Watch the Sao Paulo GP With NordVPN

The Brazilian GP airs on SRF, a Swiss-based on-demand streaming service.

SRF is a Swiss broadcasting company with channels like SRF 1, 2, and Info accessible via its eponymous online platform. SRF Play, as the platform is often called, is in German, but at least the broadcast is 100% free.

Best of all, you don't even need an account to watch it on SRF Info, which displays the GP without fees. Simply visit SRF, pick SRF Info, and watch the F1 Sao Paulo Grand Prix online for free and in Full HD.

If you're outside Switzerland, there's a quick solution. You'll need a VPN because SRF works only in this country. How does it work? Simply put, a VPN connects you to a server in another country.

It assigns you an IP from that server while overriding your original IP. In turn, you appear in Switzerland, letting you use SRF and watch the F1 Brazil GP live. F1 fans worldwide rely on NordVPN, and here's why.

NordVPN is a frequent choice due to its vast server fleet.

It offers servers in 127+ countries, including Switzerland. This means you can be abroad, use a Swiss VPN server, and get its IP address. NordVPN works on all devices, so you can live-stream the F1 Sao Paulo GP anywhere.

Plus, you get unlimited bandwidth and speeds, ensuring no buffering even when increasing the quality to Full HD or higher. NordVPN costs very little, about three dollars, but the main appeal is a 30-day money-back guarantee.

This allows you to watch the F1 Brazilian GP on a free channel and get a refund immediately after it's finished. However, with so much time, you can also catch up with the Las Vegas and Qatar GP in the same month!

Still unsure how to unblock the race abroad? Install NordVPN, launch it, and click Switzerland on the server list. Now launch the browser, go to SRF's website, and select SRF Info. It takes two minutes and works without fail.

Try NordVPN today

SRF is hardly the only choice, as other channels and streaming services air this exciting event, but with a caveat. Other free options require an account, which may be impractical if you just want to watch the race and get out.

As for paid options, you have many, but they're expensive.

NordVPN isn't free, but it can be if you use a 30-day refund policy. However, the following channels and services have hefty, non-refundable monthly fees that start at as little as $9+10.99 monthly and go up to nearly $90.

Here's what's on the table:

We have some American, Australian, British, and Canadian options. The least expensive are ESPN+ in the US, TSN in Canada, and Kayo Sports in Australia. They're restricted to their regions, so only a VPN unblocks them abroad.

Simultaneously, they're paid platforms without free trials and refund policies, so if you spend money now, be content with not getting it back. A free channel for watching the F1 Sao Paulo GP makes more sense, doesn't it?

To summarize, you can stream the F1 Brazilian GP for free on SRF.

Go to SRF Play, choose SRF Info, and enjoy. If you're abroad, use NordVPN, and if you no longer need it afterward, get a full refund. Explore other channels if you will, but be aware of their numerous caveats.

Most are paid, still region-locked, and non-refundable. If you favor the harder way, by all means, go for it. If not, use the easiest way and enjoy the November weekend from the 7th to the 9th in an exciting F1 showdown.

Try NordVPN risk-free now

Now, for the schedule:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","AMD's rare PlayStation 5 APU-based BC-250 mining board resurfaces for $120 and can actually run Cyberpunk 2077","https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/playstation/amds-rare-playstation-5-apu-based-bc-250-mining-board-resurfaces-for-usd120-and-can-actually-run-cyberpunk-2077","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 17:30:01 GMT","

A YouTuber managed to boot and game on AMD's BC-250 mining board built around PS5 silicon.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Back in 2021, AMD's crypto-mining-focused BC-250 graphics card, powered by the Sony PlayStation 5's APU instead of regular GPU chips, started popping up on eBay for around $500. Fast forward to the present day, and similar units are now available in China for as low as £96, or about $120. One such unit was ordered and procured by the creator of the YouTube channel Budget-Builds Official, notably sold as the “PS5 graphics card.”

The unit received by the YouTuber indeed looked like a GPU; however, in reality, it was a server-style motherboard with a large passive heatsink, power and fan headers, I/O ports including DisplayPort, USB 2.0/3.0 ports, Ethernet, as well as a CMOS battery slot. The unit also included a standard 8-pin PCIe connector to feed power and an I/O shield. According to the YouTuber, at its core, the custom board included the BC-250, a cut-down version of the APU used on the PS5, with six Zen 2 cores (compared to eight on the console), 12 threads, 24 compute units (compared to 36 on the console), and 16GB of GDDR6 memory. Interestingly, the board did not include any provision for standard DDR memory; instead, the GDDR6 memory was divided equally between the system and the Radeon GPU.

To power up the board, a standard 1,000W PSU was used along with an SSD, peripherals, monitor, CMOS battery, and a standard 120mm fan to actively cool the heatsink. To the YouTuber's surprise, the janky system came to life, booting directly into the BIOS. After loading Linux, initial testing with Half-Life 2 and 3DMark's Time Spy and Fire Strike benchmarks failed, likely due to issues with Linux drivers.

After some tinkering, the YouTuber was eventually able to run Half-Life 2 at over 200 FPS, however, 3DMark benchmarks did not show any signs of stability. Additionally, more games were tested, including GTA V Enhanced Edition, which ran at an average of 65 FPS at 1440p high settings and 25–30 FPS with ray tracing enabled. Counter-Strike 2 rendered fairly well at 1440p in a competitive setting, averaging 130 FPS. Surprisingly, demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Hitman 3 also managed to run at 1080p high settings with 42 FPS and 47 FPS, respectively.

While the performance of the custom BC-250 board may not be able to replace your Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon GPU-powered gaming rig any time soon, it is interesting to see a PS5 APU converted into a working desktop. At $120, it might be one of the cheapest gaming PCs out there, but in reality, it is truly a collector's item and highlights how inventive PC enthusiasts can get when given the right hardware and a bit of determination.

The RTCt temperature calibrator marks a significant improvement in use and versatility. Building on the success of the RTC, the new RTCt model has more user-friendly features such as a larger, customizable touchscreen display, dual sensor input capabilities, and enhanced remote connectivity choices.

Lloyd created the RTCt to simplify calibration operations, making it an excellent choice for professionals looking for a dependable, adaptable, and user-friendly solution.

The RTCt has a huge, vivid main display and a unique touchscreen interface. When combined with customization options, this improved UI enables users to optimize calibration operations, decreasing setup time and simplifying operation.

In addition to Ethernet and USB connections, the RTCt now has Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing remote operation from anywhere. These connection features enable users to control calibrations without being physically present - ideal for sensitive or difficult-to-access areas, whether monitored from another room or across the building.

The inclusion of twin sensor inputs enables the RTCt to calibrate several sensors simultaneously. This feature improves throughput, making it easier to manage complex or high-volume calibration tasks quickly and accurately.

The RTCt's real-time graphing capability automatically changes based on temperature and calibration stage settings, a first in the industry (patent pending). Once calibration stability is attained, the RTCt switches to a relative graph that displays even little variations from the original temperature graph, which is calibrated against a stability line.

The RTCt is designed with professionals in mind and offers improved functionality.

Engineered for perfection, the RTCt is the ultimate temperature calibration solution, combining modern technology with customization to provide unparalleled control and accuracy. The RTCt is designed to satisfy the exacting needs of modern industry and establishes a new standard for calibration quality.

≡ INFANTINO TALKS AND TALKS ≡

“Well, I really don't know if Americans realize what is going to happen. Mexicans, they get it probably a bit more because they know more about football. Canadians are even more north, so, but what will happen in this country is something incredible.”

FIFA President Gianni Infantino (SUI) rarely misses an opportunity to talk about football and he was center stage at last week's American Business Forum in Miami, Florida, about FIFA, the 2026 FIFA World Cup and his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke to the Forum a day earlier.

Infantino was the most energized when he spoke about the impact of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in 11 U.S. cities, three in Mexico and two in Canada. Overheated? For sure, but always entertaining … and always looking for money:

“I mean, let me say one more thing first, because after you're going to conclude, I guess, since we are in a business forum here. So there are business people here as well.

“I need to say one thing about business as well, otherwise they think I'm just, you know. kind of having fun as a president but … the business has to has to also work. So the football GDP, global football GDP is around 300 billion U.S. dollars a year. Out of this $300 billion, 70% is generated in Europe but mainly from outside of Europe. In the U.S. it's around $10 billion. If the U.S. would be doing – and this is an advice to all business people in this room to invest in FIFA and in football – if the U.S. would be doing one-third of what European countries do, you would speak about $110 billion – instead of $10 – $110 billion GDP in the U.S.

“So this to say that there is such a big potential and I think that those Americans – why I say this – because I think that those Americans who didn't or don't realize what is happening next year they will realize it, because this country and Canada and Mexico will be you know, flipped upside down, back up, back down.

“You will have a horde of barbarians, but happy barbarians invading the country with the result that soccer or football will conquer America. This is a country that's never been conquered for the first time. We will conquer America.

“This I announce it here officially.”

Infantino actually said this before, after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but maybe he forgot. He continued:

“Yes, it is an incredible economic impact of only the World Cup, [that] has an economic impact of around $40 billion, 200,000 jobs which will be created, five, six million people coming here to watch the games but also you know to enjoy their holidays in Miami Beach or anywhere else in beautiful Florida.

“So it moves so much and not just that because the entire world will be focused on North America and Canada, Mexico and the United States next year. I was mentioning the figure of six billion – six billion – people will be watching the World Cup. I mean the [NFL] Super Bowl is watched by 120 million people, 130 [million], we have six billion people watching the World Cup. This means that the eyes of the world will be focused on Miami and the rest of North America.”

¶

Earlier in the session, Infantino was asked by host Carlos Diaz-Rosillo, head of the Adam Smith Center for Economic Freedom at Florida International University, about his relationship with Trump:

“I have a great relationship. I'm really lucky. I have a great relationship with President Trump, who I consider really a close friend. But of course he's been and is very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup. He was the president. He mentioned it today when the U.S., together with Canada and Mexico was awarded the World Cup.

“And he's really engaged. He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He does things. He does what he says. He says what he thinks. He says actually what many people think as well but maybe don't dare to say and that's why he's so successful.

“And I have to say I am a bit surprised sometimes when I read some comments, some negative comments because as far as – I'm not American – but as far as I understand, President Trump was elected in the United States of America. Was quite clearly elected, and when you are in such a great democracy as the United States of America, you should first of all respect the results of the election.

“And then you know, again, he was elected based on a program based on what he said and he's just implementing what he said he would do. So I think we should all support what he's doing because I think he's doing pretty good, and for FIFA even more.”

This did not sit well with some folks, who pointed to FIFA's policy of political neutrality. Miguel Maduro (POR), the former head of the FIFA Governance Committee told The Athletic:

“While he can recognize the legitimacy of President Trump, he should also recognize that in a democracy, others can oppose his policies. To remain politically neutral requires not to take a position on that political debate, much less to argue that all should support President Trump's policies. To do so appears a clear violation of the duty of political neutrality imposed on any FIFA official by Article 15 of its Code of Ethics.”

FIFA also announced a “FIFA Peace Prize” which will be awarded for the first time at the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw on 5 December at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Trump is widely expected to be the first recipient.

Morocco U17 team made headlines at the World Cup after coach Baha used FIFA's new green card system

Rabat – Morocco's U17 team made headlines at the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Doha, Qatar after coach Abdelhamid Baha used FIFA's new green card system to challenge a red-card decision. 

The move helped Morocco take full control of their final group match against New Caledonia, ending the first half with a 7–0 lead and finishing the match with 16-0

In the 31st minute, New Caledonia's Jean Canehmez was sent off with a yellow card, following an earlier red card for Typhan Dreuko in the 23rd minute. 

Coach Baha used the green card to challenge the second dismissal. After a quick review using FIFA's Football Video Support (FVS) system, it was found that Canehmez in fact should be given a red card, and was taken out of the game. With two players down, New Caledonia were left with nine men, and Morocco took full advantage.

With more space on the field, Morocco attacked strongly. Goals came from Bilal Soukrat (3′), Oualid Ibn Salah (11′, 18′), Abdelali Eddaoudi (41′, 43′), Ilyas Hidaoui (44′), and Ziyad Baha (45+2′). Morocco had 73% possession, 12 shots, and 8 corners. New Caledonia only managed two shots.

The green card is part of FIFA's test system called FVS, used in youth tournaments without full VAR. 

Coaches can challenge two decisions per match, including goals, penalties, red cards, and mistaken identity. If the challenge is correct, they keep their right to challenge again.

Last month, Morocco's U20 coach, Mohamed Ouahbi, made history by using FIFA's green card system for the first time to overturn a penalty against Spain. 

But that wasn't the only time Morocco used the feature; the team used it multiple times throughout the tournament. 

One of the key moments came in the final when Ouahbi successfully challenged a decision that led to a free kick. Yassir Zabiri stepped up and scored a stunning goal in the 12th minute, giving Morocco the lead in what became a 2–0 victory. 

The green card intervention helped shift momentum and was seen as a turning point in the match

Even after their big win over New Caledonia, Morocco U-17's future in the World Cup is still uncertain. They now have three points, but that may not be enough to qualify for the next round. Their fate depends on results from other groups, especially Group C and Group D.

Manchester City capitalised on Chelsea's draw with Arsenal 24 hours earlier to go top of the Women's Super League after a closely contested 2-1 victory over Everton on Sunday. The visitors were made to work for all three points, but good finishing by Vivianne Miedema and Khadija Shaw, coupled with some smart stops by Ayaka Yamashita in between the sticks, ensured City would leave Merseyside with the win.

City took the initiative early on and threatened to take the lead within moments of the game kicking off. Just two minutes in, the visitors should have gone ahead when a loose ball bounced kindly to Shaw six-yards out, but the Jamaican could only direct a low effort at Emily Ramsey in the Toffees' net.

A Yamashita clearance would eventually lead to the opener 20 minutes in as the City attack found the key to unlocking the stubborn Everton defence. Making a run from midfield beyond Rion Ishikawa, Miedema was slipped in by the creative Iman Beney and curled low and beyond the onrushing Ramsey.

Despite City taking a 1-0 advantage, you could not write off Brian Sorensen's side, and with five minutes to go until half-time, Rebecca Knaak misjudged a long ball over the top and was left deserted in the middle of the park. Toni Payne took advantage and carried the ball wide before whipping in a low cross to Kelly Gago who, with a spectacular back-heel, flicked the ball cleverly into the corner.

The half-time break allowed Andree Jeglertz to have a word with his players, and City began the second period with added impetus. Ten minutes after the interval, Leia Ouahabi's efforts down the left were finally rewarded when Shaw met her cross to the back post and thundered a header past the helpless Ramsey.

Looking to put the game beyond doubt, Shaw's class began to show and on the hour mark, the talismanic forward's deft flick sent Miedema in behind, but the WSL's record goal-scorer could only flash wide. The visitors were almost punished moments later when Ornella Vignola left Laura Blindkilde Brown and Gracie Prior for dead with a beautiful Cruyff-turn and smacked the upright with a vicious effort from distance.

The Everton pressure continued and Yamashita produced a stunning stop from Hikaru Kitagawa to prevent the hosts grabbing an equaliser.

GOAL rates City's players from Goodison Park...

Ayaka Yamashita (8/10):

Read danger well and swept up passes sent through to Payne by Everton expertly. Made a number of top saves to resist the Toffees' pressure.

Kerstin Casparij (8/10):

The City captain worked tirelessly and was superb in attack and defence for the away side.

Jade Rose (7/10):

Was strong at the back and helped City maintain their lead in the closing stages. 

Rebecca Knaak (5/10):

Making her first appearance of the season, the German defender looked rusty and was caught out by Payne for Everton's goal.

Leila Ouahabi (8/10):

The left-back produced the winning assist for City when she chased down Fujino's pass.

Laura Blindkilde Brown (6/10):

Started well, but became overrun in the middle of the park when Everton grew into the game.

Yui Hasegawa (7/10):

As usual, Hasegawa was particularly tidy in midfield and helped City retain control late on.

Vivianne Miedema (7/10):

A constant threat with her intelligent runs into the box and took her goal well to give City the lead. Faded in the second-half.

Iman Beney (7/10):

Provided a nice assist for Miedema's opener and was bright down the City right.

Khadija Shaw (8/10):

A menace for the Everton defenders and should have scored more than just the one. The striker's header proved to be the difference, but she will curse at least two chances that went begging.

Aoba Fujino (7/10):

The quietest of the City front-line, but never stopped running and almost set up Hemp for a late third.

Gracie Prior (7/10):

Came on for the struggling Knaak and helped steady a previously shaky City defence.

Lauren Hemp (7/10):

Came on for the final 30 minutes and almost secured all three points with a late curling effort.

Sydney Lohmann (6/10):

Replaced Miedema to offer a more defensive option in midfield.

Grace Clinton (6/10):

Came on to carry the ball up the pitch when City were under pressure.

Andree Jeglertz (6/10):

The three points are most important, but the City boss will not be best pleased with how his side almost surrendered their spot at the top.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Liverpool player ratings vs Man City: Rotten Reds put in woeful display as Ibrahima Konate and Conor Bradley are run ragged while all-star forward line again falls short in damaging Premier League loss","https://www.goal.com/en-sg/lists/liverpool-player-ratings-vs-man-city-rotten-reds-register-woeful-display-ibrahima-konate-conor-bradley-run-ragged-star-forwards-struggle-again/blteae17982404b4d57","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:36:18 GMT","

Liverpool saw their mini-revival come to an end as they lost 3-0 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday. The Reds were unable to build on their victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid in a sluggish performance which saw Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez and Jeremy Doku put them to the sword during Pep Guardiola's 1,000th-game as a manager.

In a lacklustre start to the 199th meeting between the two sides, Liverpool conceded an early penalty when goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili brought down the electric Doku inside the area. However, Georgia's No.1 was able to make amends, diving to his left to deny Haaland. City didn't have to wait long to get another chance, though - Norway international Haaland leaping above Ibrahima Konate to head home from Matheus Nunes' cross after 29 minutes.

Still struggling to get a foothold, Liverpool thought they delivered a sucker punch when Virgil van Dijk met Mohamed Salah's corner with a superb header. However, the goal was ruled out as Andy Robertson was adjudged to have been interfering with play. And to compound the visitors' misery, City soon doubled their lead when Gonzalez's strike deflected in off Van Dijk.

Much better in the early stages of the second half, substitute Cody Gakpo passed up a great chance to pull a goal back for Liverpool, firing wide from Conor Bradley's low cross. And the champions were then made to pay when Doku capped off a scintillating performance by curling home City's third.

As the match wore on, Salah almost scored a late consolation but he stabbed his effort just past the post as City secured a huge three points which sees them - and not Liverpool - confirm themselves as Arsenal's closest challengers for this season's Premier League title.

GOAL rates Liverpool's players from the Etihad Stadium...

Giorgi Mamardashvili (6/10):

Gave the penalty away by clipping Doku with his left knee, but the shot-stopper made amends by saving Haaland's resulting spot-kick.

Conor Bradley (6/10):

The youngster found it difficult to contain Doku, though he admirably stuck to the task. Going forward, he whipped in a number of teasing crosses, which his team-mates were unable to do more with.

Ibrahima Konate (4/10):

Getting involved in Bradley's battle with Doku when he didn't need to, with the Belgium ace subsequently squirming free inside the penalty area, the defender was partly responsible for the spot-kick which Mamardashvili then saved. The France international was beaten in the air moments later as Haaland headed City in front.

Virgil van Dijk (5/10):

The Dutchman thought he had equalised with a brilliant header, but the goal was disallowed by the officials. And then to make matters worse, Gonzalez's low drive deflected off him and past Mamardashvili for City's second.

Andy Robertson (5/10):

While he failed to close down Nunes, whose cross brought about Haaland's header, the left-back appeared to be under instruction to stay narrow and not engage with the City man. He was then deemed to be interfering with play in the build up to Van Dijk's header, with the goal later being chalked off.

Ryan Gravenberch (5/10):

Was often second-best in his ground duels, winning just 22 per cent (2/9) of his attempted challenges.

Alexis Mac Allister (4/10):

Emerging successful from just two of his five ground duels (40%), he struggled to get near City's midfielders, receiving a yellow card for a foul on Doku.

Dominik Szoboszlai (5/10):

As Liverpool struggled to make inroads in the encounter, the Hungary international had few moments to do what he does best, marauding forward to launch attacks.

Mohamed Salah (7/10):

While he received little service in the first half, the forward was a threat whenever he did have the ball, curling in a great corner which led to Van Dijk's disallowed goal. The Egypt international went close to scoring late on, stabbing an effort just wide of the post.

Hugo Ekitike (5/10):

The striker was left to plough a lonely furrow as Liverpool struggled to muster up enough opportunities. He was then withdrawn early in the second half.

Florian Wirtz (5/10):

Operating from the left-hand side, the German allowed Liverpool to catch their breath on one or two occasions, floating infield on the counter-attack.

Cody Gakpo (5/10):

Introduced early in the second half, he should have converted one of Bradley's dangerous crosses but the forward completely missed the target.

Milos Kerkez (5/10):

A second-half substitute, the full-back found it difficult to make an impact.

Curtis Jones (6/10):

Replacing Mac Allister in the second half, the midfielder was neat and tidy as Liverpool pushed for a consolation.

Joe Gomez (N/A):

Brought on too late to effect the game.

Federico Chiesa (N/A):

Another late substitute, he was unable to register another strong cameo.

Arne Slot (5/10):

The manager could only watch on as his side struggled in an opening 45 minutes which ultimately decided the game.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Juventus FC forward Arkadiusz Milik will not soon forget his visit to the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals. First the football star watched top seed Carlos Alcaraz win his opening match against Alex de Minaur, then he met the Spaniard.

“It was a very, very nice experience, a beautiful experience,” Milik told ATPTour.com. “Basically it was my second time to see him play and he's an amazing player, nothing more to say.” 

Milik admitted that he is not the most hardcore fan in the world, but explained that he enjoys following stars like Alcaraz.

“I am following them and watching him play with his qualities is something special,” Milik said. “It's always a pleasure to see these kind of players play and it's nice to be here.”

The 31-year-old is used to showing his athleticism on the pitch, combining his movement with precise and powerful strikes. What was impressive about Alcaraz inside Inalpi Arena?

‘To come away with nothing is devastating' – Hamilton on his Sao Paulo DNF

Gabriel Bortoleto suffered a major crash on the final lap of the Sprint at Interlagos and missed out on Sao Paulo Grand Prix Qualifying as a result.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto missed out on taking part in Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix following a high-speed crash in the earlier Sprint, despite the heroic efforts from the team to try and get the car rebuilt in time.

The Brazilian rookie, competing in his first F1 home event this weekend, crashed on the final lap of the Sprint while trying to move out of Alex Albon's slipstream. Heading into Turn 1, he slammed into the inside wall before being thrown back across the track and ending up in the barriers.

Replays showed that his front and rear wings had been torn off the car during the crash, and with only three hours between the end of the Sprint and Qualifying, there was not enough time for mechanics to complete the extensive repairs needed despite their best efforts.

A statement from the team after Q1 read: “The crew did a formidable job trying to get Gabriel's car ready for Qualifying. Unfortunately, it was not possible to get him out in time for him to set a lap, but this should not detract from the effort every single team member in the garage put in. We will now shift our focus to the race.”

Bortoleto fortunately sustained no injuries in the crash, for which Team Principal Jonathan Wheatley credited the FIA.

""At the moment it sounds like he's absolutely fine, no injuries at all,"" he told F1 TV. ""I should say first of all, the incredible work the FIA have done in terms of safety, working with the teams – you've seen it today.

""Having a crash of that magnitude and for the driver to be fine, get out and go to the medical centre...""

Asked whether the team knew what caused the crash, he replied: ""It's a little bit soon. Obviously we saw it happen and then waited for a replay, but then before you know it, your first thought is to make sure the driver is okay.

""That's what I focused on really after the session. I'm sure we'll have a look at it. It looked like one of the biggest crashes I've seen for a while, frankly. I'm just pleased that he was okay and, like I say, the safety standards in Formula 1 are so impressive.""

The news rounded off a frustrating Sprint for Sauber, with Nico Hulkenberg skidding off the track in a similar vein to the incident that saw Oscar Piastri's Sprint come to an early end. While the team were able to replace his broken front and rear wings under the red flag, he struggled to recover positions and crossed the line in P16.

‘I don't think Oscar deserved all the blame' – Leclerc talks through his Lap 9 DNF

‘To come away with nothing is devastating' – Hamilton on his Sao Paulo DNF

Watch the action from the opening lap at Interlagos as Lando Norris sets his sights on a crucial victory.

Lando Norris fended off Kimi Antonelli to cling onto the lead of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, as Gabriel Bortoleto crashed out of his home event later on in the opening lap.

The McLaren driver executed a better launch than Antonelli, leaving the Mercedes youngster under threat from Charles Leclerc, but the top three ultimately remained in the same order.

There was a close battle between Oscar Piastri and a charging Isack Hadjar, with the Australian narrowly holding onto fourth position while George Russell came close to losing a place to Pierre Gasly.

Elsewhere, there was heartbreak for Bortoleto who found the barrier during a tussle with the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, forcing a Safety Car period to recover his damaged car.

Lewis Hamilton also had a less than ideal opening lap as he clipped the rear of Franco Colapinto's car and lost his front wing, sending him into the pits for a replacement.

‘I don't think Oscar deserved all the blame' – Leclerc talks through his Lap 9 DNF

‘To come away with nothing is devastating' – Hamilton on his Sao Paulo DNF

It was a difficult Qualifying session for Lewis Hamilton in Brazil, as he dropped out during the Q2 phase.

Lewis Hamilton cut a frustrated figure after Qualifying for the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the Ferrari driver falling at the Q2 hurdle.

Hamilton entered the main Qualifying session of the weekend following an encouraging Sprint display, which involved him climbing from 11th on the grid to seventh to bag a couple of points.

However, he followed up his SQ2 elimination with a Q2 exit in Saturday's grid-decider, leaving him at a loss for words when he spoke to the world's media.

“I didn't have any rear end,” he lamented. “The tyres weren't working today.”

Pushed on whether any changes were made to his SF-25 after the Sprint, Hamilton added: “The car set-up felt good, it was just how we prepared the tyres.”

While team mate Charles Leclerc went on to qualify third and has his eyes on a podium finish in Sunday's race, Hamilton is braced for a tough afternoon.

“I can't do anything from there,” he sighed.

Nonetheless, Ferrari will be looking for as many points as possible at Interlagos as they try to keep the pressure on Mercedes for P2 in the Teams' Championship.

Mercedes hold 368 points to Ferrari's 362, while Red Bull are a little further back on 351 – though they face a difficult day after Q1 exits for both Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda.

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


Tim Davie has dramatically quit as the BBC director general. The British national broadcaster's news chief Deborah Turness has also resigned amid a scandal involving edited footage of Donald Trump.


	The BBC announced that the duo would be vacating their roles on Sunday evening, in news that will send shockwaves through the UK media industry. Deadline is told that Davie and Turness' resignations were personal decisions, and they were not shown the door by Samir Shah, the corporation's chairman. Davie will remain in post while a successor is recruited.


	In an email to staff (full text below), Davie said: “I wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave the BBC after 20 years. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the chair and board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days.

					After Bruising Week, BBC News CEO Deborah Turness Tells Staff: ""It's Always Difficult When The BBC Becomes A Story""		
			








	He added: “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the charter plans they will be delivering.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Davie has worked at the BBC for 20 years, the past five of which as director general. He was expected to stay in the job, the biggest in British television, at least until the corporation renewed its operating agreement, known as its royal charter, by the end of 2027.


	The bombshell comes after the BBC was accused of selectively editing Trump‘s January 6 speech to make it appear as if the U.S. president was encouraging the 2021 Capitol riot.


	The concerns originated in an excoriating leaked memo attacking BBC News output, including Gaza coverage and reporting on trans rights. Obtained by The Daily Telegraph, the document was penned by Michael Prescott, who was an external adviser to the BBC board's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee until June.


	The Trump issue, described as “purposefully dishonest” fake news by the White House, was the final straw rather than the main reason for Davie's decision. 

	











	He has endured a bruising year after a series of scandals, including the Greg Wallace MasterChef misconduct crisis; live streaming Glastonbury act Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF;” and broadcasting documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, without declaring it was narrated by the child of a Hamas minister. At one point over the summer, culture secretary Lisa Nandy openly questioned Davie's leadership.


	The Trump edit and Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone scandal have taken place on the watch of BBC News chief Turness. The former NBC News executive has worked at the BBC for three years.


	She told staff: “The ongoing controversy around the Panorama on President Trump has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC – an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and current affairs, the buck stops with me – and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director-general last night.”


	She continued: “In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong. 


	“In a polarised world, BBC News journalism is more vital than ever, and I could not be prouder of the work that you do. Together we have bucked the global trend, to grow trust in BBC News, and I want to thank you, wherever you are in the world, for your courageous work to deliver that.”


	BBC chair Samir Shah said: “This is a sad day for the BBC. Tim has been an outstanding director-general for the last five years. He has propelled the BBC forward with determination, single-mindedness and foresight.


	“He has had the full support of me and the board throughout. However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. The whole board respects the decision and the reasons for it.


	“Tim has given 20 years of his life to the BBC. He is a devoted and inspirational leader and an absolute believer in the BBC and public service broadcasting. He has achieved a great deal. Foremost, under his tenure, the transformation of the BBC to meet the challenges in a world of unprecedented change and competition is well underway.


	“Personally, I will miss his stamina, good humour and resilience and I will miss working with him. I wish him and his family the very best for the future. This is an important time for the corporation and the Board and I will continue to work with Tim in the interim while we conduct the process to appoint his successor.”


	Nandy, the culture secretary, added: “I want to thank Tim Davie for his service to public service broadcasting over many years. He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years.


	“The BBC is one of our most important national institutions. Every day, it tells the story of who we are – the people, places and communities that make up life across the UK. Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high-quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world.”

Tim Davie's Full Email To StaffI wanted to let you know that I have decided to leave the BBC after 20 years. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days.  I am working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months. I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.   In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility. Our organisation is a critical ingredient of a healthy society, as well as a thriving creative sector.  We should champion it, not weaponise it.   Despite a hugely competitive market, I am proud that the BBC remains the most trusted news brand globally. We have continued to ensure that it is used by almost everyone in the UK as well as hundreds of millions of people globally.  Despite the inevitable issues and challenges, our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard. Our transition to a digital organisation has been deeply impressive, and our thriving commercial businesses are admired globally. Also, our work together on ensuring that we have the right culture has been important and motivating.  I could not be more impressed by what you are achieving.  You will ask why now, why this moment?  I am BBC through and through, having spent the last 20 years of my life working for this organisation as Director of Marketing, Communications and Audiences, Director of Audio and Music, acting Director-General and Chief Executive of BBC Studios. I care deeply about it and want it to succeed. That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC.  This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next Charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth. Thank you again, it has been a wonderful ride, which I have loved. I count myself very lucky to have served as DG no.17. I will have a proper chance to see many of you before I go but I have been incredibly proud to lead the BBC as DG for over five years. It is a precious UK institution and you are a world-class team. Thank you all for the tireless support and friendship.  I will always be a passionate cheerleader for civilised society, a strong BBC and a thriving UK.  Best wishes,Tim

She's dressed to kill.

Kim Kardashian channeled one of Halle Berry's iconic “Die Another Day” looks for Kris Jenner's 70th birthday bash in Beverly Hills, Calif., Saturday.

According to photos obtained by Page Six, the Skims co-founder arrived at the James Bond-themed party — held at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's $175 million Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion — in a sparkly purple top and dangerously low skirt.

The back of Kardashian's crossed straps were embellished with crystals, as well as the top of her plunging skirt.

The mom of four wore her dark tresses in a slick-backed bun with curls.

The outfit Kardashian, 45, wore bore a striking resemblance to the Lindy Hemming- and Donatella Versace-designed top and skirt Berry rocked in the 2002 action film “Die Another Day.” 

The Oscar winner, who played Giacinta ”Jinx” Johnson in the action-packed movie, stunned in a purple crystal-encrusted halterneck top and skirt.

Page Six exclusively reported that Jenner's “007 theme” came from “007(0) for her 70th birthday.”

We also reported that the starry bash was thrown by Kris' six children: Kim, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Rob Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner.

Additionally, guests included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Zuckerberg, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg, Tina Knowles, Paris Hilton, Bill Gates, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Tyler Perry and more. 

Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, also attended the festivities, holding hands as they arrived at the multimillion-dollar residence.

The Duke of Sussex, 41, looked dapper in a classic black tuxedo and bow tie, abiding by the Bond theme. Harry also rocked a traditional poppy pin on his jacket in honor of Remembrance Day next week.

The Duchess of Sussex, 44, stunned in a black long-sleeved top and a matching floor-length skirt. Markle paired her look with black peep-toe heels and a black velvet purse.

	It's official: The White Stripes are in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. The induction took place on Saturday in Los Angeles, with Jack and Meg White honored for their indelible, decade-long mark on music.


As expected, Meg did not attend the ceremony — she has completely left the music industry and public life in general since the White Stripes broke up in 2011 — but thankfully a handful of artists were on hand to help fill the void left by the essential artist, one of Rolling Stone‘s 100 Greatest Drummers of All Time.


Olivia Rodrigo and Feist teamed up for a rendition of the White Blood Cells classic “We're Going to Be Friends,” while Twenty One Pilots, themselves a guitar-drums duo like the White Stripes, delivered a rendition of the ultimate stadium rocker “Seven Nation Army.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The White Stripes were inducted into the Rock Hall by fellow Motor City rock icon Iggy Pop, who took the stage and led the crowd through a chant of “Seven Nation Army.” He held his speech in his hands and joked, “Let me see if I can read this shit.” 

	











	Pop described the duo as “a 21st century Adam and Eve, who had started a rock & roll band,” and praised Meg's drumming ability, saying it was her support that launched “the rocket of racket that was Jack White.”


	Next, Jack himself took the podium for his induction speech, thanking “Uncle Iggy.” Standing in a red suit and white tie, he revealed that he'd been talking to Meg about being honored, and that Meg made “punctuation and corrections” to his speech. “I spoke with Meg White the other day; she said she's very sorry she couldn't make it tonight, but she's very grateful for the folks who have supported her throughout all the years, it really means a lot to her tonight,” he said.

	Jack thanked the White Stripes' musical heroes, and also named other iconic duos in pop culture: Leiber and Stoller, Siegel and Shuster, and Abbott and Costello. “I myself have been in a lot of bands that you've probably never heard of,” he said. “But for some reason, people especially connected with this one two-piece duo project that I was in called the White Stripes. We don't know why these things happen, but when they do, it's the most beautiful thing you can have as an artist or musician when people are responding and sharing with you.”

	Rodrigo, who was born just two months before the White Stripes released Elephant since April 2003, has long praised the group, saying she grew up listening to the album and especially “The Hardest Button to Button.” 


	“Meg's drums really shine on that one, and from there I dove into all their other incredible albums and became a massive fan,” Rodrigo told Elle in 2023. “Meg's drumming and the White Stripes in general [provided] a huge lesson to me on the value of simplicity in music. They taught me that a truly great song doesn't need to have crazy production or layers of sound. It just needs to move you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Britain's BBC boss Tim Davie resigns following criticism over Trump documentary edit","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/09/britain-bbc-tim-davie-resign-trump.html","Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:21:25 GMT","



The director general of Britain's BBC, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of news, Deborah Turness, have resigned following criticism over bias at the corporation, including in the way it edited a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The BBC has been embroiled in a spate of allegations that it had failed to maintain political neutrality in its reporting, including in its coverage of Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and over trans issues.

In the most recent controversy, the Daily Telegraph had reported for days on an internal document produced by a former BBC adviser on standards who had listed a raft of errors, including in the way a speech by Trump on Jan. 6, 2001, was edited.

The document suggested the flagship Panorama program had edited two parts of Trump's speech together so he appeared to encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021.

""This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days,"" Davie said in a statement.

""I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering.""

Trump, in the BBC documentary, was shown telling his supporters that ""we're going to walk down to the Capitol"" and that they would ""fight like hell,"" a comment he made in a different part of his speech.

Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the BBC as ""100% fake news"" and a ""propaganda machine"" in an interview published on Friday.

Davie will stay on for the next few months while a replacement is found.

A person familiar with the situation said Davie's decision had left the BBC board stunned by the move.

Day trading and dabbling in $GME, shitcoins, post-2023 NVIDIA, individual stocks, etc. are all bubbles.Day trading is a scam. Trading firms are more than well-positioned to eat retail's lunch, every single time.

What do you mean? Over the last year any one of the index funds I'm in has beat inflation by a factor of five, some beat inflation by an order of magnitude. My worst performer is an iShares world fund, which generally has more temperate gains, clocking in at 10% YoY.Looking at Canadian indices such as $VCN, it's the same story.

There are a lot of people playing at being upper middle class right now, living large paycheck to large paycheck, and they don't realize that the people whose lifestyles they're emulating are getting money for nothing. If the layoffs start getting deeper i.e. if AI takes off OR if AI does not take off, they'll be at the food banks in a year.We'll see what happens in society when the comfortable middle class that makes all of the demands in our political system gets halved.

Christian Pulisic is back on the pitch for AC Milan, but he won't be in the U.S. men's national team for the November friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay. 

The American superstar returned from injury on Saturday in Serie A action, coming off the bench in the 70th minute as Milan picked up a 2–2 draw in their visit to Parma. It was Pulisic's first minutes in Serie A since a scoreless draw with Juventus on Oct. 5, snapping a four-game absence. 

The 27-year-old suffered a hamstring injury after he came out on the wrong side of a tough challenge from Australia's Jason Gerria while representing the USMNT on Oct. 15. The Stars and Stripes went on to win 2–1, but Pulisic was soon confined to the infirmary.

Despite making his long-awaited return at the club level this weekend, the winger will not back with the USMNT until at least the next international window in March. Mauricio Pochettino agreed to Milan's reported request to leave the superstar out of his November squad so Pulisic can further recover from injury. 

For Milan this season, Pulisic has four goals in Serie A and six across all competitions. 

In his 20 minutes against Parma, Pulisic completed all 10 of his attempted passes, missed a shot from just inside the penalty area and created two chances in his side's disappointing draw. 

Yet Pochettino and the UMSNT are making sure not to rush Pulisic back into international action. 

“It's common sense not to call a player who maybe is coming back from an issue,” Pochettino said. “It's to provide him the possibility to recover 100%, be full and be ready to play after the international duty with his team. 

“That is common sense. We never risk players.”

Other key pieces of Pochettino's squad, including Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie and Crystal Palace center back Chris Richards, were also left off the team to improve their club situations. 

The players will focus on their recoveries while the Stars and Stripes take on Paraguay and Uruguay during the November international window. Fans will not get to see Pulisic back in action for Milan  until Nov. 23, when the Italian giants take on rivals Inter Milan.
