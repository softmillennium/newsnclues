                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The director general of Britain's BBC, Tim Davie, and the chief executive of news, Deborah Turness, have resigned following criticism over bias at the corporation, including in the way it edited a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump. The BBC has been embroiled in a spate of allegations that it had failed to maintain political neutrality in its reporting, including in its coverage of Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and over trans issues. In the most recent controversy, the Daily Telegraph had reported for days on an internal document produced by a former BBC adviser on standards who had listed a raft of errors, including in the way a speech by Trump on Jan. 6, 2001, was edited. The document suggested the flagship Panorama program had edited two parts of Trump's speech together so he appeared to encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021. "This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days," Davie said in a statement. "I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering." Trump, in the BBC documentary, was shown telling his supporters that "we're going to walk down to the Capitol" and that they would "fight like hell," a comment he made in a different part of his speech. Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the BBC as "100% fake news" and a "propaganda machine" in an interview published on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't "undo" those food stamp payments. The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November. "To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized," the memo said. State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said. States must also "immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025," the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for "any overissuances that result from the noncompliance." It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move. It is their choice to do this," Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X. The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration. The Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had "confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday." The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits. The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November. The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1. Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo But it returns with an old and still-unsolved problem: storing all of the radioactive waste created as a byproduct of nuclear power generation. In May, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at quadrupling the current nuclear output over the next 25 years by accelerating construction of both large conventional reactors and next-gen small modular reactors. Last week, the U.S. signed a deal with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the country that could result in Westinghouse attempting to spinoff and IPO a stand-alone nuclear power company with the federal government as a shareholder. There's a growing consensus among governments, businesses and the public that the time is right for a nuclear power renaissance, and even if the ambitious build-out could take a decade or more and cost hundreds of billion of dollars, it will be an eventual boon to legacy and start-up nuclear energy companies, the AI-fixated wing of the tech industry and investors banking on their success. But there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. Only two nuclear power plants have been built since 1990 — more than $15 billion over budget and years behind schedule — and they went online in just the last two years. And though often unspoken, there's the prickly issue that's been grappled with ever since the first nuclear energy wave during the 1960s and '70s: how to store, manage and dispose of radioactive waste, the toxic byproduct of harnessing uranium to generate electricity — and portions of which remain hazardous for millennia. The most viable solution for permanently storing nuclear waste was first proffered back in 1957 by the National Academy of Sciences. Its report recommended burying the detritus in deep underground repositories (as opposed to the long-since-abandoned notion of blasting it into low-Earth orbit). It wasn't until 1982, though, that Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, assigning the DOE responsibility for finding such a site. Five years later, lawmakers designated Yucca Mountain, a 6,700-foot promontory about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada, as the nation's sole geological repository. Thus began a contentious, years-long saga — involving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, legislators, lawyers, geologic experts, industry officials and local citizens — that delayed, defunded and ultimately mothballed the project in 2010. Sweden has started construction on a similar project, and France, Canada and Switzerland are in the early stages of their subterranean disposal sites. An American startup, Deep Isolation Nuclear, is combining the underground burial concept with oil-and-gas fracking techniques. The methodology, called deep borehole disposal, is achieved by drilling 18-inch vertical tunnels thousands of feet below ground, then turning horizontal. Corrosion-resistant canisters — each 16 feet long, 15 inches in diameter and weighing 6,000 pounds — containing nuclear waste are forced down into the horizontal sections, stacked side-by-side and stored, conceivably, for thousands of years. Deep Isolation foresees co-locating its boreholes at active and decommissioned nuclear plants, according to CEO Rod Baltzer. "Eighty percent look like they have good shale or granite formations nearby," he said, referring to a geologic prerequisite. "That means we would not have to transport the waste" and the risk of highway or railway crashes unleashing radioactive material. The company has received grants from the DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy program, Baltzer said, and in July closed a reverse merger transaction, an alternative to an IPO for going public. Through that deal, he said, "we raised money for a full-scale demonstration project [in Cameron, Texas]. It will probably be early 2027 by the time we get that fully implemented." The process is being explored by several startups, including Curio, Shine Technologies and Oklo. France has been utilizing reprocessed nuclear fuel at its vast network of reactors since the 1970s. The company — which went public via a SPAC in 2024, after early-stage funding from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Peter Thiel's venture capital firm and others — announced in September that it is earmarking $1.68 billion to build an advanced fuel reprocessing facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Concurrently, the company signed an agreement with the Tennessee Valley Authority "to explore how we can take used nuclear fuel sitting on its sites and convert it into fuel we can use in our reactors," said a company spokeswoman. That refers to the TVA's three nuclear reactors — two in Tennessee, another in Alabama — as well as the other part of Oklo's business model, which focuses on constructing SMRs. In September, the company broke ground in Idaho Falls, Idaho, on its Aurora fast reactor, a type of SMR that will use reprocessed nuclear fuel. On one hand is the attraction of repurposing nuclear waste and building dozens of SMRs to electrify AI data centers and factories. Oklo's stock has risen nearly 429% this year, with a current market valuation of more than $16.5 billion, but share prices have fluctuated over the past month. "It's a high-risk name because it's pre-revenue, and I anticipate that the company will need to provide more details around its Aurora reactor plans, as well as the [fuel reprocessing] program on the [November 11] earnings report call," said Jed Dorsheimer, an energy industry analyst at William Blair in a late October interview. "But we haven't changed our [outperform] rating on the name as of right now," he added. In the meantime, more than 95,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel (about 10,000 tons is from weapons programs) sits temporarily stockpiled aboveground in special water-filled pools or dry casks at 79 sites in 39 states, while about 2,000 metric tons are being produced every year. But because the DOE, despite its mandate, still hasn't found a permanent disposal facility for nuclear waste, taxpayers pay utilities up to $800 million every year in damages. The DOE's Department of Nuclear Energy has initiated several programs to address nuclear waste, including coordination with Deep Isolation and Oklo. Opponents to nuclear power cite the well-documented accidents at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania (1979), Chernobyl in Ukraine (1986) and Fukushima in Japan (2011) — all three which resulted in radiation leaks, and, at Chernobyl and Fukushima, related deaths — as reasons enough to halt building new reactors. Following Fukushima, Japan, Germany and some other nations shut down or suspended operations. Japan has since restarted its nuclear energy program, and its new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, is expected to accelerate it. There's also the viewpoint, related to climate change, that nuclear energy is a emissions-free power source — and unlike solar and wind runs 24/7/365 — that produces relatively manageable waste. By comparison, she said, "we are under much graver threat from fossil fuel emissions than we are from nuclear waste." Macfarlane deems spent fuel reprocessing as far too expensive and a source of new waste streams, and dismisses deep borehole disposal as a "non-starter." Macfarlane said that the Trump administration's fast-tracking of new reactors is neither realistic nor achievable, but "I certainly would not support shutting down the operating reactors. She added that while nuclear may not face the current intermittent production challenges of renewables, it is one of the most expensive forms of electricity production, especially compared to utility-scale solar, wind and natural gas. Google and NextEra Energy are teaming up to reopen Iowa's Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear plant that closed five years ago. Microsoft and Constellation Energy plan to restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 reactor in 2028. Although no SMRs have been completed yet in the U.S., several projects are under development by companies including NuScale Power, Holtec International, Kairos Power and X-Energy, which has received backing from Amazon. The only SMR actually under construction is from Bill Gates' co-founded TerraPower, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, which aims to be operational by the end of 2030. "It is fanciful to think that nuclear energy is going to be helpful in dealing with the increases in electricity demand from data centers," he said, "because nuclear power plants take so long to build and the data centers are being built today." "I'm not sure that the tech industry has really thought through whether they want to be responsible for managing nuclear waste at their data center sites." But you can count Gates, the big tech billionaire who was backing nuclear even before the AI data center boom, as having not only thought about the waste problem, but dismissed it as major impediment. "The waste problems should not be a reason to not do nuclear," Gates said in an interview with the German business publication Handelsblatt back in 2023. ... Say the U.S. was completely nuclear-powered — it's a few rooms worth of total waste. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump on Sunday said that a dividend payment of "at least" $2,000 would be paid to most Americans from US tariff revenues. In a post on Truth Social, he wrote: "We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion." Lower courts previously determined that many of the levies were unlawful. The president had floated the idea of a $1,000 to $2,000 "distribution to the people" in an interview with One America News Network in October, touting tariff revenues he predicted would bring in over a trillion dollars a year. But any such scheme would likely need congressional approval, and Trump has previously signaled he would prefer to use tariff revenues to tackle the national debt. Appearing on ABC's "This Week" on Sunday morning, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told host George Stephanopoulos that the administration's goal with tariffs was to "rebalance trade" rather than to take in revenue. Trump's announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running political battle over affordability. Trump had partially built his presidential campaign on the issue, repeatedly lambasting former President Joe Biden over inflation and promising to "immediately bring prices down" should he take office. Democratic candidates, including Zohran Mamdani, swept to victory in elections in New York City, New Jersey, and Virginia this week after running campaigns focused on cost-of-living concerns. Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect who Trump has branded a "communist," had pledged to freeze rent, make childcare and buses free, and create city-owned grocery stores as part of his bid for office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High valuations for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the focus of the market this week, with fears of a potential AI bubble capping investor sentiment. But the view on Wall Street is still that several tech stocks offer strong fundamentals and are delivering rapid, AI-induced growth, justifying their sky-high valuations. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors find attractive AI stocks displaying  robust long-term growth outlooks. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN) recently impressed investors with its upbeat Q3 results. Accelerating growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit confirmed the Street's faith in Amazon's expansion into artificial intelligence. In reaction to the solid Q3 print and the recently-announced deal with OpenAI, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley increased his price forecast for Amazon to $315 from $300 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock, with an "outperform" rating and a price target of $276. Walmsley said that the Q3 performance, OpenAI deal and positive outlook for Amazon's Trainium chips made him more optimistic toward AWS's long-term growth. "We believe investors continue to rotate into AMZN shares given a valuation well below its historic ranges and positive news likely to continue into the AWS ReInvent Conference in early December," said Walmsley. The analyst's bullish investment thesis is also based on the cost-to-serve improvements in Amazon's retail business, driven by automation in fulfillment centers and an enhanced logistics network. 103 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. This second stock pick is Google- and YouTube owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with AI driving solid momentum in its cloud business. Impressed by the Q3 performance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet to $340 from $300 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $316 with an "outperform" rating on GOOGL. The top-rated analyst noted Alphabet's robust performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth across every major business. Interestingly, Anmuth believes that Q3 results and favorable insights on AI search formats could change investors' views toward Google's AI search transition. Alphabet noted AI-induced acceleration in query growth and paid clicks, while Anmuth noted that industry conversations indicate that paid clicks using Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM) features are driving higher conversion rates. "Overall, the AI search transition has been viewed as the greatest risk to Google, but additional signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat will continue to flip the narrative," said Anmuth. Overall, Anmuth is confident about Alphabet's prospects and said it remains JPMorgan's Top 2 idea, behind only Amazon. 113 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. The third tech giant this week is chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which delivered strong results in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. In reaction, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy increased his price target for AMD to $280 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. With a price target of $285, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AMD stock. Roy noted that AMD's Q3 top line was driven by strength across the company's data center, AI, server and PC businesses. AMD expects Q4 revenue growth will be supported by strong performances in its data center, client and embedded businesses, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the gaming segment. Interestingly, Roy believes that AMD's performance in the near-term is being fueled more by increasing demand for server central processing units and continued share gains in client CPUs rather than data center AI graphics processing units. "Looking ahead, we continue to believe that AMD is executing well as the company nears production shipments of the MI400/450 series GPUs and the Helios rack next year," Roy said. The analyst is also optimistic on AMD's recently-announced deals with OpenAI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, saying they provide clarity on the longer-term growth outlook in its data center AI business. Roy awaits further insights from AMD about its technology roadmap and total addressable market (TAM)  at an upcoming Analyst Day event on November 11. 20 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least two people died in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Fung-wong lashed central and eastern parts of the country, with heavy rains and strong winds cutting power in large areas of the Bicol region ahead of its expected landfall in northern Luzon. More than a million people have evacuated vulnerable areas ahead Super Typhoon Fung-wong's projected landfall in Aurora province as early as Sunday night, with officials urging residents to heed evacuation orders. More areas across Luzon, the Philippines' most populous island, have been placed under the highest and second-highest storm warning levels while Metro Manila and nearby provinces remain at level 3. As a safety precaution, the civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, including Bicol International Airport and Sangley in Metro Manila. The civil defense office reported that one person drowned in Catanduanes and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris of a collapsed home in Catbalogan City. Named locally as Uwan, Fung-wong is the 21st storm this year to hit a nation that normally has about 20 a year and threatens to place further strain on disaster response efforts as the Southeast Asian archipelago recovers from Typhoon Kalmaegi, which killed 224 people in the Philippines and five in Vietnam. Fung-wong is expected to head northwest from Monday and then north by Tuesday, remaining at typhoon intensity, said weather bureau PAGASA. By Wednesday, it is projected to move towards the Taiwan Strait, weakening before landfall in western Taiwan on Thursday. It is then forecast to lose strength rapidly before emerging over the waters of Ryukyu Islands as a weak tropical system. Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro urged residents in the storm's path to heed evacuation orders, warning that refusing to comply was dangerous and unlawful. "We ask that people to preemptively evacuate so that we don't end up having to conduct rescues at the last minute, which could put the lives of police, soldiers, firefighters and coast guard personnel at risk," he said in a public address. Authorities hope to avoid casualties this time, civil defense official Raffy Alejandro told a press conference. The military has redirected about 2,000 troops from field training to focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster response. "We heard on the news that the typhoon is very strong, so we evacuated early," said Christopher Sanchez, 50, who fled with his family. "We left our things on the roofs of our house, since every time there's a storm, we come here because we live right next to the river," he told Reuters. "In previous storms, the floodwaters rose above human height. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Self-driving robotaxis and delivery robots are already on America's streets. Scaling them up, however, will require a significant amount of money. Investors got a reminder of that this week when Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash reported quarterly earnings. The most notable example came when delivery company DoorDash reported results on Wednesday. DoorDash's autonomous delivery efforts include Dot, a stroller-sized robot launched this year that can navigate itself across bike lanes and sidewalks to make deliveries. "This is not something that's going to happen overnight," CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call Wednesday. The CEOs of the major ride-hailing services also said that they need to invest more in robotaxis to expand those operations and make money from them. "You've got to invest in some physical infrastructure, but we like the unit economics there a lot," he said. Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, said on an earnings call Tuesday that self-driving cars are a money-losing venture for the company right now. However, over time, Uber plans to invest in expanding the availability of driverless cars for its users, aiming to increase demand from riders, he said. "We can turn those products profitable if we want it tomorrow, but it's about the balance of investing in profitability and growth," he said. Do you have a story to share about Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, or another gig app?</p>

Across KPMG's offices nationwide, employees say they prefer round tables. So with that feedback and more in mind, the Big Four consulting firm designed and opened a new, 450,000-square-foot office at Two Manhattan West in Manhattan's Hudson Yards neighborhood. The firm hopes the gleaming new headquarters will not only reassert its presence in New York City but also tempt its more than 5,000 employees in New York back to the office more often. At KPMG, employees typically split their weeks between the office, client sites, and home. Last month, 81% of New York-based partners and employees worked in person about 2 days a week, the firm said. "This is certainly a strong recommitment on behalf of KPMG in terms of how important this market is for our firm." "It's certainly brand elevating, in my opinion," he added. I visited the office on a rainy morning in October. What surprised me most was how much the office design was shaped by employee feedback, which also guided the choice of location — one that keeps commuting times steady or shorter for two-thirds of the firm's staff. A firm representative told Business Insider that the design was informed by feedback gathered from employees after they moved into earlier offices. These suggestions were used to identify what was working well and where adjustments might be needed. In addition, they also had an ambassador program which drew employees from across departments to guide colleagues through the transition, the KPMG spokesperson said. The firm also distributed a newsletter, digital renditions, and built a lab, where they piloted various types of workspaces and technology to obtain feedback from staffers on what worked best. "It's changing the way our people will work together and collaborate. Navigation has been simplified by using room names that match New York City landmarks. The firm tracks attendance through badge swipes and time sheets. Projects that the firm has worked on through Ignition include helping large banks develop a system for employees to navigate international assignments, assisting large retailers with corporate storytelling, and helping clients through mergers and acquisition decisions. They really don't know what's next, and they might come to us to explore that next level," Caroline Berman, a manager at KPMG supporting Ignition, told me at the office the day I visited. Clients spend anywhere from a minimum of 90 minutes to multiple days in KPMG's Ignition experiences, she said. When a client has a change in leadership, or new board members join an organization, they may turn to KPMG for guidance on "effective teaming," she said. Participants begin in the Arrival Lounge at Ignition, then branch into different paths based on session size. From there, they move into the lab, which is equipped with modular furniture that's rearranged throughout the day for workshops and exercises, she said. "We want them to leave here with tangible outcomes, like a 30-60-90 roadmap," or even "actual shifts in mindset and behavior," Berman said. Spaces for deep work and collaboration are an important part of the firm's effort to upskill its workforce on AI. The firm has developed several internal AI tools like aIQ Chat, which gives employees secure access to large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and its Digital Gateway, an AI-powered platform the firm says helps it model and scenario plan in real time for changing legislation and regulations for its tax clients. KPMG has also been running an internal AI transformation program to train employees on AI for the past two years, a spokesperson for the firm told Business Insider. "In the US, we know virtually every KPMG employee is using AI —and not just occasionally. 90% of our people are actively engaging with our advanced AI tools, and our data shows that those who use them more frequently are seeing the greatest benefits, including higher quality output, reduced stress, and more time to focus on strategic work," the firm's spokesperson said. "So I wouldn't say we're asking more from our employees, but what we are saying to everyone at KPMG is you need to adopt and use the tools that are being provided because it's critical to your success in the future." The office isn't just a place for work. KPMG's new office features areas where employees can gather and socialize. Scaglione said it captures the atmosphere of classic New York City bars — for her, it's reminiscent of the famous Old Town Tavern, which opened in 1854. There's an employee lounge, known as The Manhattan, where employees can network. The intention is to create an environment where employees feel comfortable, Walsh said. That's the furthest thing from what we did here," he said. "We provided so many spaces for people to come in and just feel good about being here."</p>

A key phase of President Donald Trump's plan to overhaul student-loan repayment has concluded. On November 6, the Department of Education wrapped up negotiations with stakeholders on Trump's changes to student-loan repayment and borrowing that he signed into law in his "big beautiful" spending legislation in July. The changes are scheduled to take effect in July 2026. In addition to borrowing caps, the department will eliminate existing income-driven repayment plans and replace them with two options: a standard repayment plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan with loan forgiveness after 30 years. "The consensus language agreed upon by the negotiators today will help drive a sea change in higher education by holding universities accountable for outcomes and putting significant downward pressure on the cost of tuition," Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. "This will benefit borrowers who will no longer be pushed into insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off." Do you have a story to share about student loans? The department said that to be eligible for the higher student-loan cap available to professional students like those studying law or medicine, the borrower would have to be enrolled in one of 10 programs. Some advocates raised concerns that the limits on who qualifies for the higher student loan cap could strain participation in healthcare professions. "At a time when the need for healthcare services is rapidly expanding, restricting access to financial support for future healthcare providers is a step in the wrong direction," Todd Pickard, president of the American Academy of Physician Associates, said in a statement. Undersecretary Kent told negotiators that it's "by far not the perfect proposal." "We have a really challenging job in front of us, but I think what we did in our proposal is to meet you all at least halfway," Kent said. For example, borrowers who took out loans prior to July 1, 2026, will retain access to income-based repayment, while borrowers who take out loans after that date will be eligible to enroll in the new Repayment Assistance Plan.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. On Thursday, 75% of Tesla shareholders voted to approve his proposed $1 trillion pay package as the company's CEO, contingent on a set of performance metrics he would need to meet over the next decade. And based on the standing ovation and exuberant cheering Musk received at the shareholder meeting, Tesla superfans in attendance seemed to love it. The massive compensation package is in hopes that Musk could increase Tesla's market cap by more than sixfold and create a million robots. Ian Keas, managing director of Gallagher's executive compensation consultancy team, told Business Insider that it's rare for a pay package to carry such high stakes. "Moon shoot incentives have been, for some time, pretty rare," said Keas. "You don't normally see these types of pay packages in US publicly traded companies." Jesse Fried, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider that the decision makes sense due to the "huge upside to keeping Musk hyper-focused on Tesla." "I don't believe any other public company has ever voluntarily put CEO pay to a shareholder vote." Keas said that when dealing with an executive pay above market rate, there is no significant accountability issue as long as the pay is "tightly linked" to "clear and rigorous" performance goals with no gray areas. "When there's an award that's been designed by a board of directors and approved by a shareholder vote, that kind of contract is binding," said Keas. "If the future of the company is successful through proper incentives for a CEO that result in shareholder value appreciation over time, then I don't think shareholders have too much to worry about." The new compensation plan follows a Delaware judge's decision that voided Musk's $56 billion compensation deal from 2018, ruling that Tesla's board was unduly influenced by Musk when they agreed to his pay. Tesla relocated its incorporation to Texas and has continued to appeal the decision; it is unclear whether its success or failure would impact Musk's new pay package. Meanwhile, robotaxis have thus far remained with safety drivers while operating. Some investors and industry watchdogs are alarmed by Musk's record-setting pay package. Shua Sanchez, national campaign director at Safe Autonomous Vehicles Everywhere, told Business Insider in a statement that he is concerned that nothing in Musk's performance metric incentivizes autonomous vehicle safety. "This pay plan creates a dangerous financial incentive to rush partially-autonomous vehicles and robotaxis onto public roads before they're proven safe," said Sanchez. Tejal Patel, Executive Director of the SOC Investment Group, which holds Tesla shares, told Business Insider that Musk's "outsized influence" over Tesla has spilled over in voting results. On Tuesday, Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, also said it had voted against the pay package over concerns that the company may become overly reliant on one individual, that being Musk. Patel said that it would be hard to deduce how independent shareholders actually feel about the pay package without a full vote breakdown. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. "Personality wise, we are quite different," she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party. Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It. The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities. CakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents. "My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine," said Zhuo. I like to create all these little pretty things," she said. Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down," she said. In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes. Similar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up. "I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing," said Chan. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it," he said. In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town. In June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake. "It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... I know [which] hotel this is,'" he said. So [that's when I] went there," he said. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views. This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more. Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal. "We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities," said Chan.

Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is "disrespectful" and "wastes time." "If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing," he said at the time. Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week. Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the "damage" that work from home was doing to younger recruits. "Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I've had it with this kind of stuff," he said in the recording. "They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company." He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. "And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does," he added. Anastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette. That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable.
