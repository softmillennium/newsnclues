                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic is back on the pitch for AC Milan, but he won't be in the U.S. men's national team for the November friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay. The American superstar returned from injury on Saturday in Serie A action, coming off the bench in the 70th minute as Milan picked up a 2–2 draw in their visit to Parma. The 27-year-old suffered a hamstring injury after he came out on the wrong side of a tough challenge from Australia's Jason Gerria while representing the USMNT on Oct. 15. The Stars and Stripes went on to win 2–1, but Pulisic was soon confined to the infirmary. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Mauricio Pochettino agreed to Milan's reported request to leave the superstar out of his November squad so Pulisic can further recover from injury. For Milan this season, Pulisic has four goals in Serie A and six across all competitions. In his 20 minutes against Parma, Pulisic completed all 10 of his attempted passes, missed a shot from just inside the penalty area and created two chances in his side's disappointing draw. Yet Pochettino and the UMSNT are making sure not to rush Pulisic back into international action. “It's common sense not to call a player who maybe is coming back from an issue,” Pochettino said. Other key pieces of Pochettino's squad, including Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie and Crystal Palace center back Chris Richards, were also left off the team to improve their club situations. Fans will not get to see Pulisic back in action for Milan  until Nov. 23, when the Italian giants take on rivals Inter Milan.

Canadians are even more north, so, but what will happen in this country is something incredible.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino (SUI) rarely misses an opportunity to talk about football and he was center stage at last week's American Business Forum in Miami, Florida, about FIFA, the 2026 FIFA World Cup and his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke to the Forum a day earlier. Infantino was the most energized when he spoke about the impact of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be played in 11 U.S. cities, three in Mexico and two in Canada. “I mean, let me say one more thing first, because after you're going to conclude, I guess, since we are in a business forum here. So there are business people here as well. If the U.S. would be doing – and this is an advice to all business people in this room to invest in FIFA and in football – if the U.S. would be doing one-third of what European countries do, you would speak about $110 billion – instead of $10 – $110 billion GDP in the U.S. “So this to say that there is such a big potential and I think that those Americans – why I say this – because I think that those Americans who didn't or don't realize what is happening next year they will realize it, because this country and Canada and Mexico will be you know, flipped upside down, back up, back down. “You will have a horde of barbarians, but happy barbarians invading the country with the result that soccer or football will conquer America. This is a country that's never been conquered for the first time. Infantino actually said this before, after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, but maybe he forgot. “Yes, it is an incredible economic impact of only the World Cup, [that] has an economic impact of around $40 billion, 200,000 jobs which will be created, five, six million people coming here to watch the games but also you know to enjoy their holidays in Miami Beach or anywhere else in beautiful Florida. “So it moves so much and not just that because the entire world will be focused on North America and Canada, Mexico and the United States next year. I was mentioning the figure of six billion – six billion – people will be watching the World Cup. I mean the [NFL] Super Bowl is watched by 120 million people, 130 [million], we have six billion people watching the World Cup. Earlier in the session, Infantino was asked by host Carlos Diaz-Rosillo, head of the Adam Smith Center for Economic Freedom at Florida International University, about his relationship with Trump: But of course he's been and is very, very helpful in everything we do for the World Cup. He has such an incredible energy and this is something that I really admire. He says actually what many people think as well but maybe don't dare to say and that's why he's so successful. Was quite clearly elected, and when you are in such a great democracy as the United States of America, you should first of all respect the results of the election. So I think we should all support what he's doing because I think he's doing pretty good, and for FIFA even more.” This did not sit well with some folks, who pointed to FIFA's policy of political neutrality. “While he can recognize the legitimacy of President Trump, he should also recognize that in a democracy, others can oppose his policies. FIFA also announced a “FIFA Peace Prize” which will be awarded for the first time at the FIFA World Cup 2026 Final Draw on 5 December at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Trump is widely expected to be the first recipient. ★ Sign up a friend to receive the TSX Recap by clicking here. ★ Please consider a donation here to keep this site going.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liverpool saw their mini-revival come to an end as they lost 3-0 against Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday. The Reds were unable to build on their victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid in a sluggish performance which saw Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez and Jeremy Doku put them to the sword during Pep Guardiola's 1,000th-game as a manager. City didn't have to wait long to get another chance, though - Norway international Haaland leaping above Ibrahima Konate to head home from Matheus Nunes' cross after 29 minutes. And to compound the visitors' misery, City soon doubled their lead when Gonzalez's strike deflected in off Van Dijk. Much better in the early stages of the second half, substitute Cody Gakpo passed up a great chance to pull a goal back for Liverpool, firing wide from Conor Bradley's low cross. And the champions were then made to pay when Doku capped off a scintillating performance by curling home City's third. As the match wore on, Salah almost scored a late consolation but he stabbed his effort just past the post as City secured a huge three points which sees them - and not Liverpool - confirm themselves as Arsenal's closest challengers for this season's Premier League title. GOAL rates Liverpool's players from the Etihad Stadium... Gave the penalty away by clipping Doku with his left knee, but the shot-stopper made amends by saving Haaland's resulting spot-kick. Going forward, he whipped in a number of teasing crosses, which his team-mates were unable to do more with. And then to make matters worse, Gonzalez's low drive deflected off him and past Mamardashvili for City's second. While he failed to close down Nunes, whose cross brought about Haaland's header, the left-back appeared to be under instruction to stay narrow and not engage with the City man. He was then deemed to be interfering with play in the build up to Van Dijk's header, with the goal later being chalked off. Emerging successful from just two of his five ground duels (40%), he struggled to get near City's midfielders, receiving a yellow card for a foul on Doku. While he received little service in the first half, the forward was a threat whenever he did have the ball, curling in a great corner which led to Van Dijk's disallowed goal. He was then withdrawn early in the second half. A second-half substitute, the full-back found it difficult to make an impact. Replacing Mac Allister in the second half, the midfielder was neat and tidy as Liverpool pushed for a consolation. Brought on too late to effect the game. The manager could only watch on as his side struggled in an opening 45 minutes which ultimately decided the game.</p>

PARIS (AP) — Winger Florian Thauvin replaced injured forward Randal Kolo Muani in the France squad on Sunday for upcoming World Cup qualifiers.

Kolo Muani hurt his lower jaw playing for Tottenham against Manchester United on Saturday and was replaced at halftime. France coach Didier Deschamps replaced him after consulting national team doctor Franck Le Gall.

France hosts Ukraine in Paris next Thursday on the 10th anniversary of the November 2015 terror attacks and then is away to Azerbaijan three days later. Les Bleus will qualify for next year's World Cup by beating Ukraine.

Kolo Muani has scored nine goals in 31 games for France while Thauvin, who has been in good form for Lens this season, has two goals in 12 matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Diego Wave midfielder Kenza Dali likes to swim in the ocean on Thursdays. One day after training in July, the 34-year-old France international waded out into the Pacific, as she normally does, but this time was different. Before panic took hold, Dali remembered something her Wave teammate, defender Quincy McMahon, had told her once: when a rip current strikes, angle your body parallel to the shore and let go. Dali was grieving when the Wave called late last year, feeling herself pulled away from the sport she loved and unsure if she wanted to continue playing. She was living in Birmingham, England, and playing for local Women's Super League club Aston Villa at the time, and her home was filled with nothing but memories of the person she'd lost. (Dali was not comfortable naming the person, out of her desire for privacy.) Wave head coach Jonas Eidevall was familiar with Dali from their time as rivals in the WSL: she was first with Everton and then Villa when he was Arsenal manager from 2021 to 2024. “It was really like my last bit of, like, it's all or nothing, clearing my head and having a different environment,” Dali told The Athletic from the club's training ground in August. They entered what was their fourth season in the NWSL desperate to bounce back from a 10th-place finish in the 14-team league the year prior, a position which might have been understandable for what was still a fairly new club had it not been for the impact they made their first two seasons. As an expansion side in 2022, San Diego made history by reaching the playoffs before falling to the Portland Thorns in the semifinals (They play Portland again later on Sunday in this season's quarterfinals). Back then, the roster glistened with U.S. women's national team stars Alex Morgan (who won the Golden Boot that year with 15 goals), center back Naomi Girma (who was named both Rookie of the Year and Defender of the Year) and midfielder Jaedyn Shaw, who signed with the club when she was 17 years old. In June, Stoney was fired, a move that was still widely considered abrupt despite the team's form at the time. A perplexing duo of interim managers replaced her: Paul Buckle, once an interim assistant coach for the Wave in 2022, and former USMNT forward Landon Donovan, for whom the Wave marked his foray into managing a women's side. “Things were s**t,” Kailen Sheridan, the Canadian goalkeeper who is one of three players on the current roster who have been with the club since its inception, said of that season. In October, the Wave came under new ownership as the Levine Leichtman family completed their purchase from Ron Burkle for a then-record valuation of $120 million. By then, the club had already found and hired a new sporting director/general manager in Cami Ashton, who had last been with fellow NWSL team Kansas City Current in a similar role. There was much to be done on the culture front. Also last October, five former Wave employees filed a lawsuit against the club over multiple allegations of discrimination, retaliation, wrongful termination and sexual harassment. The claims in their case followed allegations first raised by one of the named complainants, Brittany Alvarado, against Jill Ellis, the Wave club president who would then step down in December. Alvarado accused Ellis of creating a hostile work environment, and Ellis later filed a defamation lawsuit against her. “There was a lot of internal reflection and player reflection and challenging the ownership, challenging the club itself to (ask), ‘What do you want to be? On Mondays now, the Wave train with a boys' team. Ashton also facilitated a renovation of the training facility, which they lease from the San Diego Surf, a youth club. They hired a full-time chef, improving the catered food they once relied on, and added dedicated rooms for meetings and hanging out. Before pivoting to NWSL front offices, Ashton worked in wrestling's WWE as a talent manager, where she was exposed to the scale of a mature professional sporting environment. They became a quartet in this summer's transfer window when the Wave signed Laurina Fazer. No NWSL team has had as many French players on the roster at once, and their familiarity with each other has proven lethal. Fazer arrived on July 29 and has played just over 500 minutes. By then, 13 different players had scored a combined 21 times for the club this season. The cautious optimism was justified, but as Sheridan and other Wave veterans know, an NWSL season is long, and a team's run can change on a dime. After the summer break, San Diego began to unravel. Once a possession-oriented team, they began coughing up balls. They struggled to convert chances in front of goal and deny opponents' scoring opportunities. Eventually they finished sixth, two points clear of the ninth-placed Courage. Had it not been for their strong start and the insulation of those points won early on, they might not have reached the postseason. It's possible Sheridan anticipated that dip in August when she described the next step in this team's development as one that synthesized the strengths of prior Wave rosters. Nobody was going to outwork this team,” she said. “Now we have talent on top of that, so we need to hold to the standard of that work ethic of the people who were here before and really ingrain that into a group who have more talent. “This team has more talent, but that (prior) group was just gonna run through a brick wall. So if we can put those two together, it'll be unstoppable.” “Despite having the nerves and having maybe a little bit of pressure, because I do have high expectations for myself, I feel like definitely the past years have set me up for success this season,” Barcenas, who is currently out with a foot injury, told The Athletic in August. “I'm finding myself off the field, talking more… I think just from being in the environment the past year has definitely helped, and having people that can make me feel confident in myself.” It also takes time for intergenerational dynamics to gel. Dali can still recall moments from her career when she was the young renegade, figuring herself out with each game, and the importance of growing through that. She sees a lot of herself in her Wave teammate Gia Corley, a 23-year-old midfielder signed in January from German club Hoffenheim and eligible to represent either Germany or the United States. “She's so talented, but it's risky,” Dali said of Corley. Corley will often apologize to Dali when she loses the ball, but has said part of the reason she gambles in possession is because she trusts the French veteran to clean up after her. “I played crazy in PSG (Paris Saint-Germain) because I had (two-time Olympic silver medalist with Sweden) Caroline Seger behind me: ‘I can lose the ball anywhere on the pitch and she's gonna cover me', and this is how I expressed myself.” Now it's her job to do the same for Corley and other young players at the Wave, while also trusting them in turn. It helped that 20-year-old Brazilian forward Dudinha, whom the club signed in July, arrived from São Paulo FC and was activated. She's played 10 games, seven of which she's started, and already has five goals — equal to Dali and Cascarino as the team's leading scorers this season. The Wave's highs and lows this year make it difficult to know which version of the team will show up at Providence Park in Portland later today. But they are rebuilding momentum — a very different kind of trajectory from their origin story as an NWSL team, but one that could take them just as far in the long run.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday's reports claim that FIFA are considering a change in rules to the seeding process for the 2026 World Cup, which could come to help Italy if they end up qualifying via the play-offs. As things stand, Gennaro Gattuso's side sit second in Group I, three points behind Norway with two matches to go. As Norway have a +16 advantage over Italy on goal difference, the Azzurri are effectively left needing Norway to drop points against Estonia next week if they are to finish top of the group and qualify directly for the World Cup. That means that if Italy were to qualify via the play-offs, they would be among the lowest-ranked teams in the tournament, and would be drawn into a group with teams from pots 1, 2 and 3. Pots 1, 2 and 3, however, are decided by the current world ranking. According to reports from Football Meets Data and Calcio e Finanza, FIFA are currently considering a change in rule so that all four pots are determined by world rankings. If that were the case, Italy would almost certainly be in pot 1, rather than pot 4, which means that they would avoid having to face any of the other top seeds at the World Cup group stage assuming that they qualify.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a finale that perfectly encapsulated his bittersweet tenure with Club León, James Rodríguez signed off from Liga MX with a touch of brilliance. In his last match for La Fiera against Puebla, the Colombian superstar delivered a “masterclass” assist, reminding fans of the world-class talent that is now officially on the market. At the 20-minute mark, Rodríguez seized a rebound and threaded a masterful through pass into the gap for his teammate Iván Moreno, who converted the chance for an equalizing goal. It was a final flash of the vision and precision that León had hoped would lead them to glory. In his 35 games for Leon, James had the most impact on the team, averaging a 41.15 Impact Rating—topping his teammates Cadiz (29.79) and Steven (29.26) who left the club in October. Even on a per-minute basis, the Colombian was the most impactful player, averaging 0.55 IR per minute. It has been confirmed that Club León's management decided not to renew Rodríguez's contract, which is set to expire in December 2025. Reports indicate Rodríguez's hefty $5 million annual salary was a major factor in the club's decision, especially after a disappointing season. As the team's performance faltered, Rodríguez's own prominence faded, contributing only three goals in 12 matches this season. As a free agent in December, Rodríguez is now in a pivotal race against time. His primary focus is finding a new club that will keep him fit and in top form as he prepares to captain Colombia in the 2026 World Cup, just over six months away. As he leaves León with one final, memorable assist, James Rodríguez's future is uncertain but full of high-stakes options. His next choice will not just be for a new contract, but for a chance to build momentum and lead his nation on football's biggest stage one last time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is an alternative nearby in SoFi Stadium -- the world's most expensive sports arena thanks to a huge $5.5 billion price tag. Per the Los Angeles Times, it is alleged in the complaint that UCLA is “unequivocally expressing its intent to abandon the Rose Bowl Stadium and relocate its home football games to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood." It adds that the situation is “a profound betrayal of trust.” Taxpayers have invested over $150 million into the Rose Bowl. “Some commitments are too fundamental to be traded away.” UCLA denies that it has breached its contract. The Rose Bowl has a storied history, hosting college sports for 103 years. The Rose Bowl Game is known as 'The Granddaddy of Them All' as the oldest of college's postseason bowls. It has been the venue for five Super Bowls despite never serving as a full-time home for an NFL team. Pasadena has also enshrined itself in soccer folklore. The Rose Bowl has hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup Final, where over 94,000 fans watched Brazil beat Italy 3-2 on penalties. It also held the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup Final -- a USA victory over China, also on penalties -- and the 1984 Olympic Gold Medal Match as France overcame Brazil 2-0. No other venue has completed the hat-trick of prestigious events. Quarterbacks of all-time - Can anyone better Tom Brady? Wide receivers of all-time - Does Randy Moss or Jerry Rice come out on top? Running backs of all-time - Stacking Jim Brown, Barry Sanders, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith and more Tight ends of all-time - How does Travis Kelce compare? SoFi Stadium has been chosen as a venue for the 2026 edition, however, as the famous old ground fights to stay relevant. USA boss Mauricio Pochettino sat down with talkSPORT ahead of December's draw in Washington. He revealed his expectations for the tournament and generously promised to let President Donald Trump lift the trophy if he pulls off a stunning victory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Assistant head coach Anthony Barry says building a “brotherhood” could help England to World Cup glory. Barry is the trusted deputy of boss Thomas Tuchel, charged with helping the German end 60 years of hurt in North America next summer. And the 39-year-old, who has also worked with Belgium and Portugal, believes the key to success is building an unbreakable spirit rather than trying to recreate successful club teams. Try to win the World Cup for England,” he said to a small group of reporters at St George's Park. “But beneath that, what are we trying to build. Because for me, overall, if you create a brotherhood that can connect to the nation, then you have a chance. “But if you can create something, a brotherhood, a connection, an energy between each other, then that is the petrol in the car in international football. “We have to build something here that they want to be a part of, this brotherhood, this Team England that they all want to be a part of to come here and play.” That desire to build the spirit has been highlighted by Tuchel's eye-catching selections, where he has repeatedly left high-profile players out of the group. Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden were notable absentees for the first two international camps of the season, but were named in the German's most recent squad for the final World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania next week. Tuchel is spoiled for choice in attacking areas, with the likes of Foden, Bellingham, Cole Palmer, Morgan Rogers and Eberechi Eze all battling for potentially one spot. Past England managers have fixated on shoehorning all of their best players into a disjointed XI, but Barry does not believe that will bring success next summer. “What is the best XI?” he said. If you build a band, then you put 11 lead singers on the stage and throw them one mic will they produce top music? I'm pretty sure it won't happen. What we try to build here is a team is because a team wins titles. “It's not always about just putting what everyone perceives to be the best 11 players on the pitch together. “The shirt should feel like a cape and not body armour.”</p>
