                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus FC forward Arkadiusz Milik will not soon forget his visit to the 2025 Nitto ATP Finals. First the football star watched top seed Carlos Alcaraz win his opening match against Alex de Minaur, then he met the Spaniard. “Basically it was my second time to see him play and he's an amazing player, nothing more to say.” Milik admitted that he is not the most hardcore fan in the world, but explained that he enjoys following stars like Alcaraz. “I am following them and watching him play with his qualities is something special,” Milik said. The 31-year-old is used to showing his athleticism on the pitch, combining his movement with precise and powerful strikes. What was impressive about Alcaraz inside Inalpi Arena? “I am here just as a simple fan. I am enjoying watching tennis, so it makes me happy.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The good news for Felix Auger-Aliassime Saturday night was that he learned he qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals. The more difficult news was that his first opponent will be defending champion Jannik Sinner. “It's one way to start a tournament, for sure. It's different in all the other tournaments,” Auger-Aliassime said. I start the tournament with the toughest challenge, which is interesting in a way because I think winning a match like this one would kind of give you confidence that you can go very far in this tournament. “But I'm going to get ready to be a little bit better than I was in Paris. I'm looking forward obviously to matching up with him, and also the atmosphere. In the championship match at the season's final ATP Masters 1000 event, he fell to Sinner in a competitive straight-sets defeat. Shortly thereafter, Auger-Aliassime withdrew from Metz and returned home to recover, leaving open the possibility of Lorenzo Musetti capturing the Athens title to leapfrog him in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. That does not mean he was glued to the television watching matches, though. “I was trying to stay away from all that stress. I was obviously following the scores, the results, but just focusing on what was under my control, trying to get ready and stay relaxed.” You May Also Like: Auger-Aliassime's full-circle return to Turin Importantly, Auger-Aliassime feels better than he did at the end of Paris and is ready to begin his charge in Turin. “I think it was not even the right decision for me, it was the only decision because for me it was tough to think to play Wednesday already in any other tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The top seed on Sunday powered past Alex de Minaur 7-6(5), 6-2 to ignite his quest for a maiden crown at the prestigious season finale. Alcaraz, who had fallen to Alexander Zverev (2023) and Casper Ruud (2024) in his two previous opening matches in Turin, looked determined to rewrite the script, even if he did have to overcome a nail-biting first-set test in the process. 👌@carlosalcaraz kick-starts his 2025 #NittoATPFinals campaign with a straight sets win over De Minaur pic.twitter.com/6qqfQMniGY “This tournament is one of the best tournaments we have on Tour, without a doubt,” Alcaraz said. This year is a little bit different, which I'm proud about [as] I'm doing the right things to give myself a shot to try and win this tournament.” Alcaraz impressed the crowd inside Inalpi Arena early with his shotmaking en route to a 4-1, 40/0 lead in just 25 minutes. Yet that advantage quickly slipped away as De Minaur clawed back, forcing Alcaraz into a tense tie-break. The top seed settled in, however, twice rallying from a mini-break down and reeling off four straight points from 3/5 to eventually clinch the set. The big-hitting Spaniard earned another healthy lead, but this time he contained his unforced errors and raced through the finish to improve to 5-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with De Minaur. I'm just really happy to get through this really difficult challenge, and happy with how I'm playing [going into] the next matches.” 1 presented by PIF honours for the first time since 2022. Alcaraz will next seek a win on Tuesday, when he faces either Taylor Fritz or Lorenzo Musetti in the Jimmy Connors Group. He owns a Tour-leading 68 wins and eight trophies in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.

Rybakina achieved another special feat on Saturday, too.In a year where Sabalenka dominated the rankings from start to finish—she was ranked No. 1 every single week of the 2025 season—Rybakina was the only player who managed to beat her twice, defeating her in the quarterfinals of Cincinnati and now in the final of the WTA Finals in Riyadh.And she very nearly got Sabalenka three times, holding quadruple match point up 6-2 in the third set tie-break of their quarterfinal thriller in Berlin, on grass, before Sabalenka fought back to sneak the breaker out, 8-6.Sabalenka's other 10 losses in 2025 came to different players—Madison Keys (Australian Open), Ekaterina Alexandrova (Doha), Clara Tauson (Dubai), Mirra Andreeva (Indian Wells), Jelena Ostapenko (Stuttgart), Zheng Qinwen (Rome), Coco Gauff (Roland Garros), Marketa Vondrousova (Berlin), Amanda Anisimova (Wimbledon) and Jessica Pegula (Wuhan).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From jet-lagged and sore to flawless in Riyadh, Elena Rybakina won five straight matches -- including a straight-sets final over Aryna Sabalenka -- by trusting her swing and her serve. RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- She entered the tournament at less than her best and decided to go all in on a first-strike, attack-mode strategy. And then, as she progressed through the WTA Finals field, Elena Rybakina -- despite a sore right shoulder -- started to feel better and better about her game. 1 Aryna Sabalenka in Saturday night's final and didn't change a thing. “I feel like she just decided that she's just going to step in and go for her shots without, thinking and without doubting any decisions,” Sabalenka said. “And I think she was a bit more brave today than me.” Rybakina was a 6-3 7-6 (0) winner and, because of her undefeated 5-0 record, collected $5,235,000 in prize money. It was the 11th straight match-win for the 26-year-old from Kazakhstan, a win streak that started after a loss to Sabalenka in Wuhan, China. After hitting 15 aces against Jessica Pegula in the semifinals, she added 13 more against Sabalenka -- and saved all five break points. She also won nearly 77 percent of her first-serve points. Sabalenka has a reputation for power, but Rybakina produced far faster groundstrokes from both sides. She constantly had Sabalenka under pressure, hitting off-balance shots -- and talking to herself. Even before that ultimate tiebreak, Rybakina asserted herself. “I was just trying to wait for opportunity.” You arrived here jet-lagged, tired from playing so many matches and, by your own admission, had low expectations How did those low expectations help you win the tournament? It's a lot of challenges when you come from tournament to tournament, even if it's not a long travel. We did only two days of practice, and I went right into my first match. But the advantage I had was the serve, that's what we were focusing on because we knew in the longer rallies I wouldn't be feeling so confident because we just arrived. I was trying to go for early shots. The best players, they will give you some chances but not that much. How do you turn it on like that? For example, Iga plays with more spin on the ball, and she has unbelievable footwork and energy on the court. Sometimes I'm a little too slow to start the match, not serving as good when the match goes longer. It's really little details, but I managed to find a way and put things together. No one was better than Sabalenka in tiebreaks this year, and yet, you didn't give her one point in the second-set breaker. I remember when the tiebreak started that once this year I played against her in the third set [in Berlin], and I was up and had so many match points because it was a tiebreak. Looking back, first few points were really important. You won Wimbledon three years ago … How can this big a springboard to more success at the Grand Slam level next year? All that happened this week, I can bring to the next season. It gives me so much more motivation to work even more because we did good progress in the little blocks between the tournaments. Physically, even when I wasn't at my best, we did a good job. I've experienced winning a Slam, losing in a final to Aryna [2023 Australian Open] … each match like this brings so much experience and this time it went my way, everything worked. I'll try to carry every positive thing from this tournament into my next big matches. You're flying back to Dubai on Sunday … Any vacation plans? Rybakina: I'm going to spend a couple of days in Europe, different cities. I've been having some [illness] issues that went away and are coming back. Since I live in Dubai, there are good places to train.
