                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Congressional approval would likely be required for plan to take effect, an idea Trump has floated before Donald Trump on Sunday mused about giving most Americans $2,000 funded by tariff revenues collected by the president's administration – an evident bid to rally public support on the issue. The post also made it a point to call people against tariffs “FOOLS!” For such a plan to take effect, congressional approval would likely be required. Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing $600 in tariff rebates for nearly all Americans and their dependent children. “Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families' savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration's main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. As of October, consumers were paying an average effective tariff rate of nearly 18%, the highest since 1934, according to data from the Yale Budget Lab. Since the president introduced widespread tariffs on global trading partners in April, companies have passed part of those costs on to consumers. This isn't the first time Trump has floated the idea of giving Americans stimulus checks based on revenue from his tariffs. These payments never came to be as the national deficit actually increased under Doge, and the amount cut from federal spending was significantly exaggerated.</p>

NEW YORK, November 9. /TASS/. The United States' economic growth may fall by half is the shutdown continues, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.

"We've seen an impact [of the shutdown] on the economy from day one, but it's getting worse and worse. We had a fantastic economy under President Trump the past two quarters. And now there are estimates that the economy, economic growth for this quarter, could be cut by as much as half if the shutdown continues," he told ABC News.

The US federal government partially suspended work at midnight on October 1 due to a lack of funding after the ruling Republican party failed to reach agreement with the Democrats in the US Congress on some expenditure items, including healthcare. The parties accuse each other of provoking the shutdown and prolonging it for political purposes and an agreement is yet to be reached.

Since 1977, funding for the federal government has been interrupted more than 20 times due to disagreements between the administration and Congress. The current US government shutdown has become the longest in the country's history, breaking the record set in 2018-2019 during Donald Trump's first term as president (2017-2021).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over 2,500 flights cancelled as transportation secretary says flight reductions could reach 20% if shutdown persists Flight cancellations and delays are set to grow as airline passengers across the United States spent the weekend grappling with those issues at major airports nationwide after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated a 4% reduction in air traffic in response to the ongoing federal government shutdown. “We have a number of people who want to get home for the holidays. The FAA's requirement for airlines to cut 4% of daily flights at 40 “high traffic” US airports began Friday and represented an attempt to ease the mounting pressure on air traffic controllers. Like other federal employees, those controllers have not been paid for weeks amid the government shutdown, which has become the longest in history and reached its 40th day. He also said that between 20% to 40% of controllers had not been showing up for work over the last several days. On Sunday, Duffy told CNN that the US is “short air traffic controllers” and that he was “trying to get more air traffic controllers into the towers and be certified, but I am about a 1,000 to 2,000 controllers short”. Airlines were offering full refunds to customers for canceled flights. “This situation creates substantial distractions for individuals who are already engaged in extremely stressful work,” they said. On Saturday, the union said it had delivered 1,600 handwritten letters from members to Congress calling for the shutdown to end. On Friday, the White House blamed Democrats for the cancellations and delays, saying they “are inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving”. On Saturday, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, accused the Republicans of “playing games” and said that “instead of negotiating with Democrats, Republicans would rather let air-traffic controllers go unpaid, they'd rather ground flights, and they'd rather punish travelers.” For passengers, uncertainty remained about which flights would be canceled, and analysts warned that the disruption would likely intensify and spread beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week. Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people simply canceled flights altogether. Some analysts have pointed out that there was the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft. There is also the possibility of higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, and further losses, from tourism to manufacturing, that will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues.</p>

Campus police officer Roger Smith was killed during a struggle and a ‘person of interest' is in custody, police say

A police officer was shot and killed during a struggle in the emergency department lobby at a North Carolina hospital Saturday.

The shooting happened around 9am at the WakeMed Garner Healthplex, killing WakeMed campus police officer Roger Smith, according to a WakeMed statement.

A “person of interest” in the shooting was in custody, a Garner police department statement said.

The emergency department lobby was closed, and hospital officials were working with local police and state investigators. Further details about what happened weren't immediately released.

“Law enforcement officers put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and we are forever grateful for officer Smith's sacrifice,” North Carolina governor Josh Stein said in a statement on X.

Garner is a city of about 31,000 people just south of Raleigh in central North Carolina. The WakeMed police department patrols six facilities in the health care system, including the Garner hospital.

The officers are sworn law enforcement who receive all the police training required under state law.</p>

MOSCOW, November 9. /TASS/. More and more countries prefer Russian-made weapons to Western arms, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.

According to the top Russian diplomat, Asian, Arab, African, and Latin American countries are Russia's old partners. "These relations have long been established with many countries," he said in an interview with the Voennaya Priyemka (Military Acceptance) program dedicated to the 25th anniversary of Russia's major arms trader Rosoboronexport.

"There are some who used to rely on Western manufacturers until recently but now, following global developments, various conflicts involving the use of various types of weapons, they see that our weapons are the best," he noted. "They are easier to handle. They have proved their efficiency compared with similar weapons and systems manufactured in Western countries. They are cheaper, in a good sense.".</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hollywood star Angelina Jolie described how she was forced to wait while a drone flew over her during her recent trip to Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts, where she met families living on the front line of Russia's war. "The threat of drones was a constant, heavy presence. The families here live with this every single day." Jolie traveled with the U.K.-based Legacy of War Foundation to embattled southern Ukraine on Nov. 5. The actress wrote how Russian troops "track, hunt, and terrorize" locals constantly in a "human safari." During her visit, she noted how schools, clinics, and daycares were forced to operate underground, and she spoke to locals about the psychological impact of living under constant threats, as well as their fears about being forgotten by the world. She called on governments to end the conflict and to protect civilians, both in Ukraine and also in Sudan, Gaza, Yemen, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while highlighting the work of several Ukrainian humanitarian organizations helping children, including Ukrainian Gen, Fight for Right, Help Ukraine, and Marsh Zhinok. Reports initially circulated that a Ukrainian man in Jolie's entourage was detained by military enlistment officers and that Jolie visited the recruitment office with the man. Local media later confirmed that the man, a reserve officer, lacked a valid medical commission certificate and was redirected to another location to settle the issue. He has written articles for a number of publications, including the Financial Times, bne IntelliNews, Radio Free Europe/Liberty, Euronews and New Eastern Europe. Previously, Dominic worked with StopFake as a disinformation expert, debunking Russian fake news in Europe. "He has already successfully negotiated the release of 100 Hostages, and is going for an additional 50," Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. Names on the list include Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy for investment Kirill Dmitriev, Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut, and FSB agent Aleksey Komkov. Russia launched yet another wide-ranging attack on Ukrainian cities overnight on Nov. 8, using a combination of drone and missiles to strike targets across the country. In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on a deadly Russian strike that killed Ukrainian soldiers and civilians allegedly during a military ceremony, prompting outrage and an internal investigation into security lapses. The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has restored access to backup power for the first time in six months after its second power line was repaired, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported on Nov. 8. "The threat of drones was a constant, heavy presence. A thermal power plant in Voronezh, Russia was reportedly attacked overnight on Nov. 9. Russian forces targeted energy substations that power the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne nuclear power plants overnight on Nov. 7-8, amid its large-scale attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said. The Kizlyar Electromechanical Plant produces equipment for Russian Sukhoi and MiG aircraft and has been sanctioned for its role in the war against Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany and the United Kingdom have warned of the growing threat posed by Russian and Chinese space satellites, which have been regularly spotted spying on satellites used by Western powers. “Russia's actions, especially in space, pose a fundamental threat to us all. A threat we can no longer ignore,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told a Berlin conference of space industry leaders in September. Disrupting navigation and positioning systems can impact military operations as well as civil aviation, according to the global think tank RAND. Ukrainian officials say Moscow has increased its level of cooperation with China, with Beijing conducting satellite reconnaissance of Ukrainian territory on its behalf. Here is what officials and experts say about the satellite threats in space. Pistorius noted that two Russian reconnaissance satellites were recently spotted tracking two IntelSat satellites, which are used by the German Armed Forces and its allies. “Russia and China have rapidly expanded their space warfare capabilities in recent years: They can jam, blind, manipulate, or kinetically destroy satellites,” Pistorius added, announcing a multi-billion-dollar boost in funding for German space programs. “They've got payloads on board that can see our satellites and are trying to collect information from them,” Major General Paul Tedman told the BBC last month. Russia has spent years developing electronic warfare capabilities amid the war in Ukraine. Separately, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte once again warned this year of Russia's plans to develop nuclear weapons in space to disable and destroy satellites. But Russia also vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called for member states to not develop space-based nuclear weapons in 2024. In general, it's relatively simple for space forces to detect and locate foreign satellites, but it's difficult to determine their exact capabilities and intentions. Experts believe the Russian satellites that got close to the two IntelSat satellites used in part by Germany were there to intercept signals. Meanwhile, in lower orbits, Russian satellites have previously tested “things that look like weapons and fired projectiles,” Swope told CNN. The United States and France first warned more than a decade ago that Russian satellites appeared to be spying and collecting information on their assets, including on commercially run satellites. The US Department of Defense said in 2015 that a Russian military satellite had parked itself near two Intelsat satellites, prompting the US to contact Moscow about its movements, which many at the time described as “mysterious.” Putin floats the possibility of fresh nuclear tests following Trump comments Then in 2017, after France and Italy jointly launched an intelligence satellite, Russian satellites were soon getting close to it to take a look, according to Juliana Suess, a security policy researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP). “All of these things ought to be seen in the broader context.” Although the threats from Russia are more pressing for Europe due to their proximity, “the much bigger space power is obviously China,” Suess said. Analysts have noted some sophisticated Chinese maneuvers in space aimed at getting close to other satellites, “at just incredibly high speeds and with precision that I think has really raised some eyebrows in the West.” Some of China's capabilities have raised international concerns, according to the SWP analyst. China also has “a lot more money to conduct themselves in space,” Suess said. “We're not going to see much more space growth out of Russia at the moment. “We don't always know what they're doing, and they're doing a lot of different things that leave a lot of people scratching their heads,” Swope added. I think it also reflects that there's a sort of political will to now catch up and, you know, really get things going,” Suess said. But she also stressed that the space race is an ongoing process, with no finish line in sight. Germany certainly has a lot to catch up on.” A spokesperson for the German Ministry of Defense told CNN that its procurement measures relating to space will amount to around €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2025, “but will grow significantly in the coming years.” The UK government also announced a commitment to increase defense spending this year and a strategic review of British capabilities outlined that “greater attention must be given to the space and cyber and electromagnetic domains.” The UK announced in October that it is testing sensors to detect laser threats in space as part of measures to protect British satellites. What those satellites will look like is an open question, he added, with development ongoing. But European allies may benefit from that through cooperation under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances. NATO declared in 2019 that space is an “operational domain” for the transatlantic alliance and years later announced that Article 5 would apply in space. Analysts at RAND have argued, though, that NATO needs to “throttle up” on its space enterprise or risk falling short at a critical time. While falling behind is a real concern, particularly compared to China's advances, there is also evidence that the Russia has not integrated its satellite systems into its military infrastructure as well as many other space powers. Analysts have also seen evidence that Russia is procuring commercial satellite imagery from the private market – an indication that its own capabilities are not up to scratch. “We have seen from anecdotal evidence in Ukraine that Russia does not have some sort of level of confidence that one would typically expect in their own systems,” Suess added.</p>
