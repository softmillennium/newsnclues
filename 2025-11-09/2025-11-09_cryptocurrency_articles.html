                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Monroe, Louisiana--(Newsfile Corp. - November 9, 2025) - Krown Network, the quantum-secured, bootstrapped Layer 1 blockchain, sold out its final pre-sale batch of $500,000 in just over 4 hours - delivering a scorching $125,000 per hour fundraising velocity that surpasses industry legends. This raise burst surpasses Ethereum's full 2014 ICO, which raised at a velocity of $18,162 per hour. Krown's speed eclipses it by seven times that rate in head-to-head final timeframes, while BTC was mined at a negligible value in 2009, gradually increasing to under 1,000 wallets by mid-2010, with no significant capital influx. Krown, by contrast, bootstrapped $3M with zero VC interference, echoing Bitcoin's grassroots purity while channeling Ethereum's visionary scale - all in a 2025 crypto VC market exploding past $20 billion year-to-date, where over 90% of Layer 1 funding hides behind private VC deals and vesting schedules. This final batch velocity outruns foundational ICOs like Cardano (16 months at ~$5,399/hour) and Fantom (3 months at ~$18,519/hour), proving bootstrapped innovation still thrives amid hype-driven projects and coins. In a year where crypto startups raked in billions through centralized exchanges and VCs, Krown's community-fueled raise signals a return to decentralized roots. "This velocity isn't luck; it's validation of quantum-secured innovation," declared Krown CEO James Stephens. "While giants retrofit for tomorrow's threats, Krown launches ready - with $500K vanishing in hours, fully liquid, and community-owned. With 70% of the supply already staked pre-launch, Krown is poised for explosive post-MainNet growth, integrating quantum entropy from equity partner, Quantum eMotion Corp. (TSXV: QNC) (OTCQB: QNCCF) (FSE: 34Q0), to safeguard against both classical and quantum threats. Krown Technologies, Inc. develops advanced blockchain, fintech, and quantum-secured products within the Camelot Ecosystem, delivering practical, enterprise-grade blockchain solutions that merge DeFi, AI, gaming, and post-quantum security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, Esguerra has emerged as one of the most forward-thinking investors in fintech and crypto currency traders— a rare blend of visionary strategist, disciplined investor, and hands-on builder. His story isn't just one of financial success; it's a masterclass in how to anticipate disruption, harness emerging technologies, and shape the future of an entire industry. Jared Esguerra's journey into the world of fintech began long before blockchain became a buzzword. “What excited me wasn't just digital currency,” Esguerra has said in interviews. His unique strength lay in translating complex blockchain principles into financially sound, scalable opportunities. Among his early investments were blockchain-based lending platforms and digital payment infrastructures that aimed to simplify cross-border transactions. Today, they underpin billions of dollars in decentralized financial activity. This foresight allowed him to identify trends years before they hit mainstream awareness. From stablecoins to decentralized identity verification, Esguerra's portfolio reflects a consistent focus on the infrastructure layer of fintech — the systems that make financial innovation possible. Over the past ten years, Esguerra's track record reads like a timeline of fintech's evolution. Early on, he championed digital payment platforms that reduced friction for emerging markets, empowering small businesses to transact globally with minimal fees. Later, he turned his attention to DeFi — the movement to recreate financial instruments like lending, borrowing, and trading using blockchain technology. He understood that the financial system's central intermediaries — banks, brokers, clearinghouses — were ripe for disruption. “Every layer of finance that charges a fee for access or validation,” he once remarked, “is an opportunity for decentralized innovation.” Esguerra often emphasizes strategic foresight — the ability to look several years ahead, anticipate market trends, and act before they become obvious. He's known for identifying “inflection points” — moments when technology shifts from experimentation to real-world adoption. He studies macroeconomic conditions, token velocity, governance models, and long-term adoption metrics. Despite his success, Esguerra has never been blind to the challenges that come with innovation. Rather than avoiding these complexities, Esguerra confronts them head-on. He has worked closely with compliance experts to help shape balanced frameworks for decentralized finance. His goal is to ensure that innovation can thrive responsibly, without compromising consumer protection or financial stability. He sees the next decade as one defined by convergence — the merging of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and data analytics into a unified fintech ecosystem. AI-driven risk assessment, blockchain-secured transactions, and decentralized digital identity are no longer theoretical concepts; they're becoming the new foundation of finance. Esguerra is already investing at this intersection — those using AI to analyze on-chain data, or creating blockchain frameworks. But even as technology evolves, Esguerra's guiding principle stays constant: innovation must empower. The ultimate goal is a financial landscape that is borderless, inclusive, and transparent — one that gives every individual, regardless of geography, equal access to opportunity. Over a decade of innovation, he has proven that true success in fintech comes not from chasing trends, but from anticipating transformations — and building the systems that make them possible. As blockchain continues to mature and fintech continues to expand into every corner of the global economy, Jared Esguerra's influence will only grow.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's most loveable bears have done it again. Milk Mocha ($HUGS) tokens have taken the crypto scene by storm. Fans and traders alike are flocking to secure their spot in what's shaping up to be 2025's biggest and most heart-driven presale. This isn't your average meme coin hype cycle. It takes just one click, but wait too long, and you'll miss your chance to be part of the most talked-about crypto right now. With 100% of all slots filled, its now-live presale is rewriting what “high demand” means in Web3. Milk Mocha's global reach, with millions of fans worldwide, has turned a routine whitelist into an internet-wide rush. All it takes is a valid email and wallet connection to unlock access to the 40-stage presale, which began at $0.0002 per token. Any unsold tokens are automatically burned, keeping supply tight and deflationary. A record-breaking registration rate that's leaving even seasoned crypto investors stunned. At first glance, Milk Mocha's $HUGS token might look like a feel-good project wrapped in fuzzy branding, but underneath that charm lies a powerhouse of token utility. $HUGS is a multi-utility ecosystem token, designed to fuel staking, NFTs, governance, and gamified features, all tied to one deflationary core. Holders can earn 60% APY through flexible staking, with daily compounding and instant reward withdrawals. There are no lockups, making it easy for users to earn while they engage. Every transaction, whether buying an NFT or playing a mini-game, triggers token burns, reducing supply and strengthening long-term value. Milk Mocha has fused sentiment with structure, showing that a project can be both adorable and intelligent. The heartbeat of Milk Mocha's success has always been its fans, and they're the real driving force behind this record-breaking presale. With over 50 million followers across social platforms and merchandise stores, Milk Mocha already had the kind of global recognition most crypto brands dream of. Now, that emotional connection is translating directly into on-chain activity. Every referral boosts both participants' earnings, turning fandom into a financial opportunity. This combination of incentives and inclusivity has transformed the Milk Mocha community into a powerful movement. Fans aren't just buying tokens; they're building the project's future. The $HUGS presale will continue through its 40 pricing stages, each round offering fewer tokens at higher prices. Early-stage participants stand to gain significantly, with projections of 150x to 200x ROI by the time of exchange listings and ecosystem expansion. This forward momentum is what sets Milk Mocha apart from fleeting meme coins. It's not just about being first; it's about being part of something that continues to evolve, reward, and grow. Milk Mocha's $HUGS token is in its most crucial stretch with the whitelist now open, and the buzz is deafening. Fans and traders are racing to claim their space before the window shuts for good. This isn't another meme coin moment; it's a movement built on transparency, creativity, and community strength. Offering 60% APY staking, NFT integration, deflationary cryptoeconomics, and real governance, $HUGS stands as one of the most well-rounded projects in the 2025 presale outlook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ether steadied Sunday as traders weighed a fragile hold above $100,000 for BTC and a rebound in ETH toward the mid-$3,000s amid tentative risk appetite. As per Coingecko data, Bitcoin traded near $102,100, about +2% in 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum hovered around $3,530, about +4% in 24 hours. US spot Bitcoin ETFs turned positive again on Thursday, November 7, attracting roughly $240M after six consecutive days of outflows. Most of the buying came from products offered by BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest, according to figures from Farside Investors. Ethereum developers have set December 3 for the Fusaka upgrade, which will introduce PeerDAS. The feature is meant to expand data capacity for layer-2 networks. It's an important step for the ecosystem, even as ETH prices remain choppy. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000. Bitcoin's heat map shows thick liquidity sitting between about $110,000 and $125,000. That suggests many resting sell orders above the current price. The market has been easing since early October, when Bitcoin briefly traded near $123,000. Liquidity looks heaviest around $115,000 and $120,000, where the yellow-green bands cluster. Areas below show lighter activity, pointing to fewer buyers. Ethereum is also approaching a significant supply zone near $3,700. About 869,000 ETH were bought around this level, creating a strong resistance cap. Glassnode's cost-basis data shows many holders sitting near break-even here, so some may sell if prices bounce. ETH has tried several times to break above the $3,700–$4,200 band but failed, with each attempt followed by sharp pullbacks. Ethereum has been making lower highs since mid-October. Unless the price can push above this tight resistance area, it may keep moving sideways or slip lower, as sellers still sit overhead. The price has been making higher lows along a rising trendline, suggesting buyers are stepping in. It recently climbed toward $3,440 after holding support near $3,300. There is no firm breakout yet, but the slow grind higher points to growing interest. A clean move above $3,480–$3,500 could open more upside. Melden Sie sich an, um Ihr Portfolio aufzurufen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency prices nudged higher after U.S. President Donald Trump said a direct tariff dividend of “at least” $2,000 will be paid out to most Americans. Bitcoin BTC$103,668.95 climbed 1.93% over the past 24 hours to trade above $103,000. The modest rally comes amid a broader weekly slump that saw the CD20 index plunge nearly 15% before it started to recover. Still, the reaction suggests traders may be pricing in the potential for higher consumer spending and crypto market inflows if and when these funds reach recipients. The President alone cannot authorize or execute this payment, as federal spending decisions rest with the legislative branch and any plan to distribute funds collected from tariffs requires approval and appropriation by Congress, as Andy Constan, CEO and CIO of Damped Spring Advisors, pointed out X. Meanwhile, tax and budget experts have pointed out that the total amount of revenue generated from tariffs so far falls short of the funds needed to cover payments to the large number of eligible recipients. "The President just proposed a $2,000 tariff “dividend” for each person, excluding high-income earners. If the cutoff is $100,000, 150M adults would qualify, for a cost near $300 billion. Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far," Erica York, vice president of Federal Tax Policy, noted on X. Every dollar raised through tariff revenue effectively offsets approximately 24 cents of income and payroll tax collections due to the broader economic effects on taxable income. This gap means Trump could face challenges in funding the $2,000 dividend solely from tariff revenues. 15:53 UTC: Adds a section on potential legislative and budgetary challenges to Trump's plan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rather than confirming expectations that the price would surge in October, Uptober failed to materialise. Instead, traders saw the total crypto market shed some $800 billion of its value, roughly 19%. “Bears have clearly been in control,” Jasper De Maere, OTC Trader at trading firm Wintermute, told DL News. “The market now seems to be tipping again, chopping around the critical $100,000 level, a zone that continues to be defended firmly,” De Maere continued. “This level is not just technically important but also a major psychological threshold.” Since US President Donald Trump took office in January, he's been busy ticking off items on the industry's wishlist. Even the Federal Reserve deciding to cut interest rates in October, which is usually bullish for Bitcoin's price, failed to drive the price up. There are several reasons why confidence has been zapped from the market. Another part of the problem, according to James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset investment firm CoinShares, is that traders have failed to update their playbook. “Some long-term investors appear to be acting on the four-year cycle narrative, a self-fulfilling pattern we do not subscribe to but cannot ignore” Butterfill told DL News. “Adherents to this framework are locking in profits, convinced that the cycle top is approaching.” To him, this mindset explains why many big investors have sold their positions and driven the price down 19% since its $126,000 high at the beginning of October. And it's not just crypto traders that are feeling a bit down in the dumps. American consumers' sentiment about their future prospects have plunged to nearly record lows. Even so, market watchers remain bullish for the long-term prospects of crypto. “While the pullback is likely to rattle some investors, volatility of this scale is not unusual,” Simon Peters, crypto analyst at trading platform eToro, told DL News on Friday. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, said on November 5 that he expects the price to hit $1 million around 2028, provided that governments keep issuing debt to pay for themselves. But for Bitcoin to bounce back, Sean Dawson, head of research at perpetual-trading platform Derive, said it needs no more bad news to strike decentralised finance. “No insolvency announcements, nor hacks, would re-establish trust in the market,” he told DL News on Friday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're in the world of cryptocurrencies, using a crypto credit card is an easy way to earn crypto. Since some cards have different requirements to earn the highest rewards rate, it's important to know the details. CNBC Select takes a look at some of the current crypto cards for anyone interested in digital currencies. This card earns rewards in the form of Bitcoin, Ether or 50+ other cryptocurrency options. The Gemini Credit Card® is a good option for people who are looking to earn various forms of cryptocurrency via spending in everyday categories, such as transit and dining. Types of crypto earned: You can earn 50+ cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum Other great perks: The Gemini Card offers a welcome bonus of $200 in crypto after you hit the spending goal. It has no annual fee and comes with Mastercard® World Elite benefits. With enough assets in Coinbase, users can earn up to 4% back in crypto for every purchase, with no annual fee None, but it does require a Coinbase One membership The Coinbase One Card could be a good option for heavy crypto enthusiasts who already have a large portion of assets invested in the ecosystem. The Coinbase One Card could be a good option for you if you're already an avid Coinbase customer, as it requires a large deposit to earn the highest rewards rates. Other great perks: If you have more than $200,000 in assets on Coinbase, you can earn up to 4% back in Bitcoin on the first $10,000 in monthly eligible purchases (then 2% back), and the card comes with Amex benefits like purchase protection and travel cancellation insurance. Other great perks: You can toggle the option of earning cryptocurrency vs. cash back as rewards on and off right in the Venmo app, and can easily add it to your Apple Pay®, Google Pay™, or Samsung Pay® wallet. Users can earn from a rotating catalogue of cryptocurrency rewards via spending on everyday purchases. Information about the Coinbase Visa® Prepaid Debit Card has been collected independently by Select and has not been reviewed or provided by the issuer of the card prior to publication. The Coinbase Visa® Prepaid Debit Card is a good way for people less familiar with cryptocurrencies, as you can choose (from a selection) which crypto you earn, and it has no annual fees. Coinbase Visa® Prepaid Debit Card is a simpler option, with no annual fees or subscriptions required, but less control over your exact rewards. Other great perks: If paying with cryptocurrency, the Coinbase Prepaid Debit Card automatically converts your crypto of choice to USD for the purchase, plus the card earns uncapped rewards with no subscription required. If you personally believe in the future of cryptocurrency, that could make it a good fit for your financial portfolio, but you should typically follow similar investing guidelines. With crypto being a decentralized currency, meaning it's not controlled by a single entity like a government or bank, it can be more accessible and have faster transfer times with lower fees. This also means that cryptocurrencies are not insured by any government-backed programs, like the FDIC, while more traditional bank accounts are. Investing in cryptocurrency isn't inherently good or bad, but it comes down to your risk tolerance and current financial goals. Most crypto cards earn rewards in a similar way to traditional cash-back credit cards, you spend with the card and receive a percentage of that purchase in rewards. Instead of opting for a credit card that earns crypto, consider using a regular cash-back card with a high return where you spend the most and then buying crypto directly. While this adds extra steps, it also gives you more control over the crypto you purchase and how it's stored. Earning cryptocurrency rewards via credit card spending can be a good option for those who'd prefer to swipe without thinking about it or to make use of the additional benefits these cards offer. However, since credit cards require spending to earn crypto rewards, these are typically not taxable. There are often a few different ways to spend your earned crypto rewards, with some cards allowing you to spend it directly or you can sell your crypto. While it's less common, some crypto cards, like the Gemini Credit Card, have welcome bonuses for new cardholders to earn. At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every credit card article is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of credit card products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. Money matters — so make the most of it. To determine to the top crypto cards, CNBC Select analyzed over major credit cards that are widely available in the U.S. and earn crypto rewards. We also considered additional perks (e.g., ongoing travel or merchant statement credits), cardholder protections (e.g., purchase protection, $0 liability protection and travel insurance), the application process when available (e.g., is there a credit pull or required credit score) and how easy it is to redeem points (e.g., are rewards are tied to a specific brand; if transferable, to how many/which partners, can you redeem for straight cash back). We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. For the cards that offered a rewards program, we considered consumer spending data forecasts from location intelligence firm Esri to determine where U.S. consumers are spending the most money, like on dining and travel. We used this to help determine what bonus categories are most useful for consumers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both networks offer fast transactions, large communities, and powerful developer ecosystems. However, despite their strengths, a new generation of utility-focused tokens is emerging. Digitap's fast-growing crypto presale, live financial app, and real-world banking features have positioned it far ahead of other emerging projects. Investors are rushing to buy top altcoins that offer practical use rather than speculation. Digitap is attracting attention faster than almost any other new token because it solves real financial problems. A major feature is the Visa-backed Digitap Card, which works online and in stores worldwide. This gives Digitap real utility that traditional altcoins do not offer. Digitap's AI Smart Routing system automatically finds the best exchange paths for international transfers. This keeps global fees around 1%, which is lower than those charged by traditional banks. For freelancers, travelers, remote workers, and global businesses, this feature alone is game-changing. Its crypto presale has gained massive traction, raising over $1.6 million so far. With a price of $0.0297, set to rise to $0.0313 in the next round, early investors are getting a strong value entry before exchange listings. Each transaction supports buybacks and burns, reducing supply over time. Its smart contract capabilities have powered DeFi, NFTs, and major blockchain innovation for years. Even so, Ethereum is now in a more stable phase of growth. It attracts builders, institutions, and long-term holders, but its mature position limits the explosive upside that early-stage investors often look for. This is why some traders are exploring new utility tokens that have more room to grow. Ethereum remains strong and reliable, but analysts believe it's price has stalled this month. Its price actions reflects a network with stability rather than explosive early-stage potential. Because of this, investors who want fast growth or entry-level pricing often look toward newer altcoins to buy, especially those with real-world functionality. Ethereum and Solana continue to be strong pillars of the crypto space. But the next wave of growth is coming from practical financial tools, real-world utility, and early-stage entries. Investors today want tokens that offer practical use rather than mere speculation. Digitap's focus on global payments, privacy-first banking, and instant card access gives it a competitive advantage in a world where digital finance is rapidly expanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every bull run brings a new set of champions. From Bitcoin's early dominance to the rise of Ethereum, Solana, and meme tokens like Dogecoin, each cycle redefines what “winning” means in crypto. Recent market trends have observed that gaming and decentralised finance tokens are back into investor focus. These segments are supported by increasing blockchain adoption and institutional funding. Its skill-to-earn model is an innovation on the BNB chain that gives faster transactions and lower fees. However, Tapzi (TAPZI), the new crypto coin in town, builds a transparent and skill-based structure that directly affects the rewarding system. The unique gaming landscape attracts gamers, of course, but also interests streamers and creators who wish to monetize their digital skills. All one needs to do is join the Tapzi (TAPZI) presale, acquire tokens, and stake them to participate, play, and win. Why it could outplay others: Tapzi's combination of fairness, gameplay depth, and real user engagement gives it real staying power and not just speculative value. While Tapzi represents the next generation of gaming projects, Gala Games remains a veteran powerhouse. GALA tokens are used to power in-game transactions, node rewards, and community governance. Currently, GALA trades around $0.045, significantly below its all-time high, offering room for growth as the market shifts bullish again. If GameFi continues to attract mainstream attention, Gala's established infrastructure could benefit from the renewed momentum. Why it matters: Gala's strength lies in its experience and partnerships, a solid option for conservative GameFi investors. In the DeFi space, Aave has remained a consistent leader. Known for its lending and borrowing protocol, it allows users to earn interest on deposits or borrow assets without intermediaries. Aave's technology is secure, audited, and proven, with a total value locked (TVL) exceeding $8 billion across chains. Aave has quietly evolved, introducing GHO stablecoin and cross-chain integrations. As of now, AAVE trades near $110, up from $65 earlier this year, signaling a slow but steady uptrend. Why it's one of the best altcoins to buy now: Aave represents stability amid market volatility. It's a blue-chip DeFi token that benefits directly from growing on-chain liquidity and institutional interest. While it might not be 20x overnight, its strength lies in long-term reliability, which is perfect for investors balancing Tapzi's high-growth GameFi exposure with lower-risk assets. PEPE's trading volume consistently ranks among the highest in its category, reflecting active participation and retail enthusiasm. Its price, currently around $0.0000011, has shown resilience despite volatility. While meme tokens are risky, they thrive in speculative cycles, and Pepe's established reputation gives it a better survival chance than newer projects. Why it still matters: As retail traders return, meme coins like Pepe often lead early rallies, offering short-term profit potential. Born during Solana's recovery phase, Bonk has turned into a symbol of community revival. Distributed to Solana users as an airdrop, BONK gained popularity as the “people's meme coin.” Its integration across Solana dApps and games makes it more than just a joke. BONK is trading near $0.000022, with an active community and constant burn events helping to stabilize supply. Analysts expect it to perform well if Solana continues its upward trajectory in 2025. Why investors like it: Bonk merges fun with function, showing how meme coins can fuel user engagement in major ecosystems. Tapzi's ongoing presale is creating massive buzz across social media and investor groups. With each phase closing ahead of schedule, demand has been outpacing expectations. The team has also announced upcoming cross-chain integration, mobile game releases, and partnerships with indie studios, signaling that Tapzi is building real value, not just hype. What sets Tapzi apart from other presales is its transparent roadmap and continuous updates. The developers release progress reports after every milestone, which has built confidence among early buyers. If Tapzi maintains its growth rate and achieves a market cap of even $150 million post-launch, early $500 investments could easily grow 10x or more, according to early community projections. This kind of balanced allocation captures upside while limiting downside risk, especially as Bitcoin consolidation tends to rotate liquidity into altcoins. As crypto gears up for its next bull cycle, investors are again asking the same question: what is the best altcoin to buy now? With its ongoing presale success, strong roadmap, and real-world appeal, Tapzi stands out as a top crypto to buy now for 2025's biggest breakout.
