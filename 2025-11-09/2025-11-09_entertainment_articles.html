                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Davie has dramatically quit as the BBC director general. The British national broadcaster's news chief Deborah Turness has also resigned amid a scandal involving edited footage of Donald Trump. Deadline is told that Davie and Turness' resignations were personal decisions, and they were not shown the door by Samir Shah, the corporation's chairman. Davie will remain in post while a successor is recruited. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the chair and board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days. BBC Plans Apology Over "Dishonest" Trump Edit, As UK Minister Says Incident Is "Incredibly Serious" After Bruising Week, BBC News CEO Deborah Turness Tells Staff: "It's Always Difficult When The BBC Becomes A Story" He added: “I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the charter plans they will be delivering.” The concerns originated in an excoriating leaked memo attacking BBC News output, including Gaza coverage and reporting on trans rights. He has endured a bruising year after a series of scandals, including the Greg Wallace MasterChef misconduct crisis; live streaming Glastonbury act Bob Vylan chanting “death to the IDF;” and broadcasting documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, without declaring it was narrated by the child of a Hamas minister. At one point over the summer, culture secretary Lisa Nandy openly questioned Davie's leadership. The Trump edit and Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone scandal have taken place on the watch of BBC News chief Turness. She continued: “In public life leaders need to be fully accountable, and that is why I am stepping down. While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong. “In a polarised world, BBC News journalism is more vital than ever, and I could not be prouder of the work that you do. Together we have bucked the global trend, to grow trust in BBC News, and I want to thank you, wherever you are in the world, for your courageous work to deliver that.” Tim has been an outstanding director-general for the last five years. He has propelled the BBC forward with determination, single-mindedness and foresight. However, I understand the continued pressure on him, personally and professionally, which has led him to take this decision today. “Tim has given 20 years of his life to the BBC. “Personally, I will miss his stamina, good humour and resilience and I will miss working with him. Nandy, the culture secretary, added: “I want to thank Tim Davie for his service to public service broadcasting over many years. “The BBC is one of our most important national institutions. This is entirely my decision, and I remain very thankful to the Chair and Board for their unswerving and unanimous support throughout my entire tenure, including during recent days. I am working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months. I have been reflecting on the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times, combined with the fact that I want to give a successor time to help shape the Charter plans they will be delivering. In these increasingly polarised times, the BBC is of unique value and speaks to the very best of us. It helps make the UK a special place; overwhelmingly kind, tolerant and curious. Like all public organisations, the BBC is not perfect, and we must always be open, transparent and accountable. While not being the only reason, the current debate around BBC News has understandably contributed to my decision. Overall the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as Director-General I have to take ultimate responsibility. We have continued to ensure that it is used by almost everyone in the UK as well as hundreds of millions of people globally. Despite the inevitable issues and challenges, our journalism and quality content continues to be admired as a gold standard. Our transition to a digital organisation has been deeply impressive, and our thriving commercial businesses are admired globally. Also, our work together on ensuring that we have the right culture has been important and motivating. I could not be more impressed by what you are achieving. That is why I want to create the best conditions and space for a new DG to come in and positively shape the next Royal Charter. I hope that as we move forward, a sensible, calm and rational public conversation can take place about the next chapter of the BBC. This timing allows a new DG to help shape the next Charter. I believe we are in a strong position to deliver growth. Thank you again, it has been a wonderful ride, which I have loved. I count myself very lucky to have served as DG no.17. I will have a proper chance to see many of you before I go but I have been incredibly proud to lead the BBC as DG for over five years. Thank you all for the tireless support and friendship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay revealed he was shocked by the price of his wife's seafood birthday meal, which came in at over $200. Ramsay, known for his reality food TV shows Hell's Kitchen and MasterChef, told the LAD Bible that he was left stunned by the price of his wife's birthday plate. The couple, who have been married since 1996 and share four children, celebrated Tana Ramsay's birthday with a dinner in the south of France. Ramsay isn't exactly a stranger to pricey meals. According to Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, dining experience for restaurant-goers at his Hell's Kitchen location in Southern California can cost between $150 and $200 per person, depending on the restaurant's menu and what meal they order. Ramsay told LAD Bible he didn't want the seafood to go to waste, so he “grabbed it and ate it.” “If my mum heard that I'd paid €220 for a lobster main course in the south of France she would kick my [expletive],” he continued. “She doesn't even spend that a month on her shopping.” Ramsay also celebrated his wife's birthday in an Instagram post on August 23. “Happy birthday to this incredible woman @tanaramsay wife mother professional and best friend love you ❤️,” he wrote in the caption. Ramsay once ate a meal on one of his competition shows that the contestant said would cost $225. In season 21 of Hell's Kitchen, contestant Vlad Briantsev, who earned the nickname “Truffle Boy,” presented Ramsay with his “signature dish” topped with truffle, an already expensive addition to a meal. “How much would you charge for this dish? “Honestly, I would pay 230 bucks for that,” Ramsay said after indulging in the dish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated: Exceeding expectations, 20th Century Studios/Disney's Predator: Badlands slayed it this weekend with an $80M global opening. Of that, $40M is from the international box office, making for an even split with domestic. 'Predator: Badlands' Opening To Franchise Record With $40M, 'A-' CinemaScore Is Best Ever For Series - Sunday Box Office Update 'Predator: Badlands' Hopes To Alleviate Autumn's Box Office Drought With $60M+ Global Opening - Preview When excluding China from that total, Badlands claims the No. Badlands overperformed pretty much everywhere and had great momentum in markets like Korea where it held No. Strong word of mouth and critical reactions helped drive business. Overall internationally, where the Trachtenberg, Ben Rosenblatt and John Davis production opened across all markets, the film had top starts everywhere; either No. 1 (including UK, Spain, Australia, China, Korea and Mexico) or No. 1 non-local (ie France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Brazil). In the UK, Netherlands, Korea, Taiwan, India, Brazil and several smaller markets it had the best launch ever for a Predator title. And in China, Predator: Badlands is the first studio movie to open at No. 1 since Jurassic World Rebirth way back in July. In China, Maoyan consistently increased its final box office projection over the past few days, now landing at $14M. While Predator: Badlands has runway ahead in other markets, China finally gets Demon Slayer this coming Friday – that movie having already done about $13M in pre-sales there. The Top 5 Predator: Badlands markets at launch are: China ($7.4M), UK ($3.2M), Mexico ($2.3M), France ($1.8M) and Japan ($1.7M). In Imax, the Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi/Elle Fanning-starrer delivered a $10.8M global debut. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

According to photos obtained by Page Six, the Skims co-founder arrived at the James Bond-themed party — held at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's $175 million Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion — in a sparkly purple top and dangerously low skirt. The back of Kardashian's crossed straps were embellished with crystals, as well as the top of her plunging skirt. The mom of four wore her dark tresses in a slick-backed bun with curls. The Oscar winner, who played Giacinta ”Jinx” Johnson in the action-packed movie, stunned in a purple crystal-encrusted halterneck top and skirt.

Page Six exclusively reported that Jenner's “007 theme” came from “007(0) for her 70th birthday.” Additionally, guests included Oprah Winfrey, Mark Zuckerberg, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg, Tina Knowles, Paris Hilton, Bill Gates, Justin and Hailey Bieber, Tyler Perry and more. Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, also attended the festivities, holding hands as they arrived at the multimillion-dollar residence. The Duke of Sussex, 41, looked dapper in a classic black tuxedo and bow tie, abiding by the Bond theme. Harry also rocked a traditional poppy pin on his jacket in honor of Remembrance Day next week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bravo describes her as “an entrepreneur, creative consultant and mother of three, known for her international, intuitive and thoughtful approach to curating enriched modern living.” She co-founded Blackmore Hair, a high-end wellness-focused haircare company centered on simplicity and self-care. From design projects to wellness partnerships, Natalie's professional world revolves around beauty and elevated living. Their wedding — a three-day celebration in Napa Valley costing more than $2.5 million — drew A-list guests including Victoria Beckham, Annie Lennox, and Claudia Schiffer. The couple raised three children — Grace, 14, and 9-year-old twins — while splitting their time between homes in London, Beverly Hills, and the South of France. Their marriage appeared picture-perfect until early 2025, when Natalie filed for divorce citing “irreconcilable differences.” Sources told the outlet that Simon had “been living on his own for some time” and that Natalie's decision to officially file took “their separation to the next level.” The high-stakes split has drawn attention not only for the potential financial implications but also for Natalie's poised reemergence into Beverly Hills society. Bravo insiders say Natalie brings “old Hollywood glamour meets global elegance” to the show. With her refined accent, sleek fashion sense, and connections across London and Los Angeles, she's expected to stand out among the franchise's American socialites. Natalie's calm demeanor and upscale aesthetic could make her either the show's peacekeeper or its quiet disruptor. After nearly two decades in one of entertainment's most powerful marriages, Natalie is focused on independence and reinvention. Her Bravo bio sums it up best: “Natalie continues to shape a life and career that embodies strength, elegance and success on her own terms.” Translation? She's rich, centered, and ready for whatever Beverly Hills throws her way. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, chair Samir Shah will write to UK Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee to admit that a 2024 BBC Panorama film should not have altered Trump's speech in the way it did. Shah is expected to tell lawmakers that the BBC has reviewed the Trump edit again in light of audience complaints in recent days, Deadline understands. Shah is expected to acknowledge that Panorama could have been clearer that Trump's speech was changed, but he will say there was no intention to mislead viewers. 'Saturday Night Live' Opens With Donald Trump Ignoring Rising Prices And An Election Rebuke, As Well As The Guy Who Collapsed In The Oval Office Olivia Rodrigo Slams Donald Trump's DHS: "Don't Ever Use My Songs To Promote Your Racist, Hateful Propaganda" The Sunday Times and Sunday Telegraph first reported on Shah's planned apology, which comes after a week of headlines about the Trump edit and the BBC's reporting on Gaza and transgender rights. The concerns originated in an excoriating leaked memo attacking BBC News output. Appearing on BBC show Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Nandy said the edit was “incredibly serious.” Nandy said she had held “too many” conversations with BBC leaders over the past year regarding editorial standards. The Labour minister said she was confident Shah and BBC director general Tim Davie were gripping the Trump matter, but she questioned why issues keep occurring. Shah's apology will be the first time a senior BBC figure speaks out on the issue, though Deadline revealed that BBC News CEO Deborah Turness emailed staff admitting it had been a “difficult” week. The incident is awkward for Shah, Davie, and Turness because they sit on the Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee, where Prescott originally raised his concerns months ago. In the Panorama documentary, Trump appears to say: “We're gonna walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.” He actually said: “We're gonna walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're gonna walk down, we're gonna walk down any one you want but I think right here, we're gonna walk down to the Capitol and we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen.” Some 54 minutes later, when Trump was talking about the U.S. election being “corrupt,” he said: “Something's wrong here, something's really wrong, can't have happened, and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.” Nick Robinson, the seasoned presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today show, referenced the story live on-air on Saturday, telling listeners: “It's clear that there is a genuine concern about editorial standards and mistakes. There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organisation … Both things are happening at the same time.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. BBC being leaned on yet again by a weak government sucking up to the far right. For all the talk about the Beeb being woke, Tim Davie boasted of his right wing credentials by cancelling satire shows for being too left wing, pulling all shows critical of Israel's conduct of the Gaza ‘war' and openly stating he was trying to appeal to Reform, who get more unchallenged air time than all the other parties combined. Oh, no mention of nearly 300 plainclothed FBI agents being part of the crowd or a Capitol Police Officer laying pipe bombs near the RNC building? You know Trump was still president on Jan 6, right?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soundgarden were officially inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday (Nov. 8), with actor-comedian Jim Carrey leading the tribute in a heartfelt, deeply personal speech that recalled his first experience seeing the grunge pioneers perform live.

Carrey revealed that after the show, the band gifted him one of his most prized possessions: a Fender Telecaster signed by all four members, including late frontman Chris Cornell. Cornell's eldest daughter Lily took the stage following a video tribute to her father, delivering a touching speech and acknowledging her mother and Cornell's former wife, Susan Silver, who once managed Soundgarden. Yamamoto, who reunited with the band for the occasion, referenced his family's internment during World War II: “That affected my life greatly,” he said. Let's not add another story like this to our history.” Kim Thayil reflected on Cornell's creative leadership, stating, “If one of us ever hesitated in sharing an idea, Chris would be the first to say, ‘Let's just try it out and see.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update wouldn't let Andrew Cuomo forget about his failed bid for mayor of New York. Michael Che then trashed Cuomo for going around town in the final days before the election in a white Ford Bronco, even with its obvious connotations to O.J. Later, Jost mentioned how Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum was groped during a public appearance this week. “So no, he's not taking the loss well,” Jost joked a photo flashed on screen of Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid allegations of sexual harassment from eleven women. Another hot topic during the segment was the medical emergency during an Oval Office press conference this week—more specifically, how Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy each reacted to it. When a pharmaceutical executive fainted, Kennedy quickly left the room.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump couldn't be bothered to help a man who had fainted in the Oval Office, instead using the break in his press conference to grumble about New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and other Democratic election winners. “I think my plan is pretty normal: stand here and stare like a sociopath,” Trump (James Austin Johnson) said while others tended to the man, leading to a viral photograph. “Didn't even pretend like I was going to help, like when someone drops something and you do the fake bend.” Joke's on them: they're Stephen Miller's policies,” he said. We'll put him in line behind ‘Ursha' Vance,” he said. Well, the good news is your family isn't coming because all the planes are gone,” he said, as his administration plans to cut ten percent of flights as the shutdown drags on.

The host of this weekend's episode appeared in a pharmaceutical sketch for Hudsacilin, “the only medication proven to cure Spirit Tunnel-related symptoms” for guests of the syndicated talk show. RELATED: Pete Davidson Would Return To ‘SNL' If Lorne Michaels Asked: “I Owe That Guy My Life” A voiceover explains, “Hudsacilin works, not by taking your anxiety away, but by making you so violently ill, you have no choice but to cancel.” While Glaser gets sick in the bathroom, the voiceover continues to note that Hudsacilin is “made from a gentle blend of E. coli, influenza, C. diff and rancid buttermilk.” In recent months, celebs including Michelle Obama, Simon Cowell, Renee Rapp, Kevin Hart and more have appeared on The Jennifer Hudson Show, which has the show's staff line the hall from their dressing room to the stage, hyping them up with a personalized chant and dance.

Though White's emotion was palpable throughout the speech, it was most felt in the poem he brought to the room, one that he said he was going to send to Meg ahead of time but hadn't. And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float, one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. He looked at the girl, his sister, he thought, and like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let's put on a show.' And they paraded this float through the Cass Corridor, standing atop the Peppermint, pulled by white horses or maybe it was a red Econoline van. And many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. Jack and Meg released six studio albums, including the Grammy-winning Icky Thump, together as the White Stripes before parting ways in 2011. Following Jack's speech, Olivia Rodrigo and Feist performed a sweet duet of the band's “We're Going to Be Friends” (2002) and 21 Pilots took on “Seven Nation Army” (2003), in tribute to the honorees. Rodrigo's been vocal about the White Stripes being her favorite band: “I was so obsessed with Jack White's guitar, and I made my mom take me to guitar lessons so I could learn how to play all of his songs,” she said in a 2021 interview. “Fell in Love With a Girl” was one of the first songs she learned to play. The 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony honored the White Stripes as well as Bad Company, Chubby Checker, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, OutKast and Soundgarden in the performer category; Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon for musical influence; Thom Bell, Nicky Hopkins and Carol Kaye for musical excellence, and Lenny Waronker with the Ahmet Ertegun Award.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There have been multiple reports about season 15 of Bravo's “The Real Housewives of New Jersey.” Now, ahead of any official announcement, Teresa Giudice has made it clear that she wants to reconcile with her brother, Joe Gorga, and his wife, Melissa Gorga. Regarding his ex-wife patching things up with her brother, he said, “I know they met Saturday night.” The Giudices announced their separation in 2019, after both had been released from jail. The former “Housewives” husband appeared on Gia Giudice's “Casual Chaos” podcast in August 2025, providing a career update. I'm getting a lot of things in the works with construction. And I'm just waiting on a couple of big things to come through, and hopefully they come through so I can get back into the real estate [business].” Giudice continued, “I would love to get back into the real estate game out here because that's what I love doing. And I mean, the real estate out here is very good. I could definitely see myself getting back into it out here, for sure. Prior to Giudice giving his thoughts on his ex-wife reconciling with Gorga, she revealed why she decided it was time to bury the hatchet. While talking to Page Six, she said, “Not because I'm worried about getting back on the cast because it is what it is.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a sketchy, unverified image showing accused assassin Luigi Mangione happily hanging with a group of inmates at the notorious Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn was released — sources tell Page Six that Mangione is indeed a “model prisoner” who's mentoring other inmates. He's in general population, and he's just been very helpful [to prisoners] to stay out of trouble. The legal source said he knows of another inmate who “got in trouble the other day because his shirt wasn't tucked in properly for [their] prison uniform, so the rules are sometimes pretty strict. Mangione had help learning the jailhouse ropes from prison consultant Craig Rothfeld, whose clients have included fallen movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere. The MDC has hosted a cavalcade of famous criminals, often as they await trial, including Diddy, crypto dude Sam Bankman-Fried, R. Kelly, Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, pharma bro Martin Shkreli and Donald Trump friend turned foe Michael Cohen. Weinstein's lawyer, appeals ace Arthur Aidala, tells Page Six that Mangione will face worse conditions after his federal trial — when he's transferred to Rikers Island to await separate New York state charges. “I don't want to say [the MDC] is like the Taj Mahal, but it's a hell of a lot nicer than Rikers,” Aidala said. Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal and state charges for allegedly gunning down the health care exec outside his insurance company's annual investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He was then arrested in Pennsylvania after a five-day manhunt by authorities. He's due back in federal court on Dec. 5, and trial date has yet been set.</p>
