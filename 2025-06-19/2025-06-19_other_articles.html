                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Filmed over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020, this footage adds to the growing body of mysterious aerial phenomena captured by military personnel. The clip was made public by investigative filmmakers Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp on Tuesday, igniting fresh debate about the nature of UFOs and UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). According to Daily Mail, the newly released footage, captured by a high-altitude Air Force reconnaissance platform, shows a massive disc-shaped object weaving in and out of cloud cover. Unlike previous UFO sightings—particularly the now-famous “tic-tac” shaped objects—this particular UAP is notably distinct. Corbell, who has long investigated UFO phenomena, called this a major revelation. “This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” he stated. The object displays an unexpected absence of propulsion. As Corbell pointed out, “You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object.” Typically, traditional aircraft, whether jet-powered or propeller-driven, leave behind clear heat signatures due to the use of engines. However, this UFO appears to lack any visible means of propulsion. The lack of heat is a significant element for investigators. As Corbell explained, “This was captured on a thermal sensor – it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. This was on News Nation today look at the third ufo they show. This was filmed by the US military look at my next post I filmed the same one in Holland. Corbell and Knapp have estimated the object to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though the exact size is still under debate. The UAP can be seen shifting direction rapidly while weaving through clouds, a behavior that is unlike anything conventional aircraft would perform. This high-speed maneuvering—especially the abrupt turns and changes in altitude—suggests that the object is operating with an advanced, and as yet unknown, technology. This UFO sighting is not just another curious video; it's part of an ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena that has captivated both the scientific and military communities. According to Corbell and Knapp, they spent over two years verifying the authenticity of the footage, consulting multiple sources with direct knowledge of official U.S. UFO programs. This strategic location, fraught with military activity, makes the UFO sighting even more intriguing. Investigators are now pouring over the video's geolocation data, hoping to find more answers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The work just happens to be dirtier when extra-dimensional ghouls are involved. That's the premise of Remedy Entertainment's new cooperative shooter, FBC: Firebreak (out now), and it's one that the developers have leaned into with hilarious results. Whereas Control was a single-player, third-person adventure that focused on exploration and backtracking, Firebreak is Remedy's take on cooperative first-person shooters like Left 4 Dead (2008). It's a very different kind of game for the studio, whose previous work like Control and the Alan Wake series have been celebrated for their atmospheric and often experimental storytelling — routinely blending live-action footage with in-game graphics to eerie effect. Here, the plot takes a back seat to gameplay, making for a strange mash-up of inspirations that feels equal parts dollar store Ghostbusters and intense extraction shooter. Under perpetual siege by the Hiss, the FBC relies on Firebreak to mow down monsters that have possessed their office workers and solve an escalating series of problems (often mundane tasks like fixing ventilation and cleaning up haunted stick notes) before things get out of hand. Players can choose from three Crisis Kits, which serve as specific class specializations. Weapons and gear (like grenades) are interchangeable between the kits, but each serves a specific purpose. Around each level, certain jobs must be completed, like fixing machines dedicated to powering fans or workstations, which can be done more quickly by Fix and Jump classes. The last bit is key, too, because players themselves can quickly fall victim to environmental hazards and having a Splash Kit handy can quickly correct a series of mishaps. Ground Control is set deeper in the depths of the Quarry, where players pop leech pods like pimples to find irradiated pearls to shove into a cart. Frequency Shift is pulled directly from Ghostbusters 2, where pink slime gunks up the gears of the facility and must be cleared before antennae can be restored. Lastly, Freezer Duty sees the team igniting portable generators to heat up frozen extra-dimensional anomalies. Most tasks have some sort of inherent threat that must be managed, and multitasking becomes key. Gathering pearls in Ground Control requires shooting pods that are high up, collecting the bright green pearl and racing back to the cart (which can be pushed, but slides back on the rails when left alone). In this instance, the pearls themselves are radioactive, and can kill you quickly if not tossed. Players must then either rinse off in a nearby shower (or Splash Kit hose) to reduce their radiation levels. ‘007 First Light' Ditches Franchise Lore for a Whole New James Bond Woodkid Says Hideo Kojima Changed ‘Death Stranding 2' Because It Wasn't  'Polarizing' 10 Years of ‘Critical Role': ‘We Are Never Going Away' When the comms ring alerting players to a Hiss invasion, it's time to drop the job at hand and hunker down for battle. Enemy difficulty and density can be decided prior to the mission, and for veteran players, a Corruption modifier can be added making certain high-powered foes appear. Jobs and the individual tasks required can become a little redundant, however. Hotwiring a generator or mining ammunition from a workstation always requires the same rapid input of shoulder button presses, which can harm the player if they mess up. The design shines when players are under duress; fumbling to properly string together prompts for just one more clip of ammo as an enemy's footsteps loom closer can be riveting. This is somewhat offset by the pace of each level which, unlike the 40-minute plus journey of each level in Left 4 Dead, can be made to run much faster. Jobs can be selected at levels one through three; choosing level one means there's only a single area to clear, which can be done in a couple of minutes. The option to go deeper for better and more plentiful materials (used for unlocking and upgrading gear and skills) can be worth the extra effort, but it's nice to be able to play a cooperative shooter than offers a blitz mode. Not everyone has time to descend every layer of hell, every time; an occasional jaunt can be just as fun. Starting up your own team by selecting a job and waiting for other players rarely pans out; it's easier to begin a mission solo and hope someone jumps aboard. Annoyingly, quick start tends to drop you into a mission at random, meaning that any specific goals you might have (like completing certain levels to unlock more) are at the will of the draw. It's commonplace to be disconnected from servers too, losing progress toward unlockables. While the game is a cooperative shooter with different skins and progression systems, Firebreak isn't exactly a live-service — meaning there's no battle passes or ongoing events to keep up with. ), what levels, classes, and unlockables there are what you get, although the developers have a roadmap for releasing more classes, jobs and more for free. While Alan Wake and Control aren't themselves deadly serious, Firebreak hues much more heavily into broad comedy than the mainline Remedyverse titles. If the humor clicks with you, there's joy to be had in accidentally setting yourself on fire over and over again while being chased by a Slenderman-like apparition made of Post-Its.

It packs in plenty up front, but with some redundant missions and tasks, it might be better suited for occasional spurts of high-octane gameplay with friends or strangers.

SpaceX's Starship has exploded once again — adding to a growing list of setbacks for the company's rocket. The upper stage of the rocket, the largest ever built, was undergoing routine testing to prepare for its 10th test flight at SpaceX's South Texas Starbase site on Wednesday night (June 18) when it "suffered a catastrophic failure and exploded," local authorities wrote on Facebook. The ship exploded mid-flight during two previous test flights in January and March, and fell to pieces during an earlier-than-planned reentry in May. In a post on X, SpaceX has attributed the latest explosion to "a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase," yet the exact cause of the malfunction is unclear. "Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing [sic] operations continue."

Standing 403 feet (123 meters) tall and propelled by a record-breaking 16.5 million pounds (7.5 million kilograms) of thrust from its 33-engine Super Heavy booster rocket, Starship can carry 10 times the payload of SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rockets. Designed primarily with affordable and efficient manufacturing in mind, the gargantuan rocket uses inexpensive stainless steel for its construction and methane — which SpaceX claims can be collected on Mars — to power the rocket. —New NASA robot with X-ray vision will watch Earth 'breathing' from the moon —NASA and Japan launch world's 1st wooden satellite into orbit.

SpaceX has also won around $4 billion in NASA contracts to develop the Human Landing System (HLS). The impact of yesterday's explosion on SpaceX's launch date for Starship's 10th flight is unclear.

Aquifers in the U.S. Southwest will be more badly affected by climate change than those farther north, a new study suggests. Climate models predict that a warmer climate will lead to less rainfall in regions like Southern California and wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest. But what could really spell trouble for the Southwest is that groundwater pools there are more sensitive to climate shifts than pools farther north, researchers said. Modern aquifer records are poor indicators of what happens when Earth gets warmer, because humans have pumped out huge amounts of groundwater. "The last ice age gives us a window to explore groundwater dynamics that might be quite relevant to future change," study lead author Alan Seltzer, an associate scientist specializing in marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a statement. Researchers looked at the period between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago, when ice sheets retreated from North America and storms moved northward. Related: Groundwater in the Colorado River basin won't run out — but eventually we won't be able to get at it, scientists warn For the new study, Seltzer and his colleagues analyzed ancient groundwater from the Palouse basin aquifer, which sits beneath Washington and Idaho. Ancient groundwater holds geochemical clues, such as dissolved noble gases, that can reveal past changes in water table depth. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The researchers measured different versions, or isotopes, of the noble gases krypton and xenon from 17 wells in the aquifer, which enabled them to reconstruct water table depths over 9,000 years of global warming. The scientists then compared these records with records from the San Diego aquifer in Southern California that Seltzer and other researchers had previously compiled in a 2019 study. In response to global warming and drier conditions at the end of the last ice age, water table levels in Southwestern aquifers dropped sharply. The reason for this may be that groundwater systems with a shallow water table — where water sits nearer the surface, such as the Palouse basin — are able to transfer more water to neighboring soils than systems with a deep water table, so they remain relatively stable. —1.2 billion-year-old groundwater is some of the oldest on Earth —'Precipitation, the source of all fresh water, can no longer be relied upon': Global water cycle pushed out of balance 'for 1st time in human history' Systems with a deep water table, such as the San Diego aquifer, are more sensitive to changes in rainfall. Without precipitation, these aquifers rapidly dry out, according to the study. Millions of people in the Southwest depend on groundwater to live — and "these results should help direct research and adaptation efforts" to combat water insecurity, study co-author Kris Karnauskas, a climate scientist and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since then, the 59 suites, bar, and ballroom have remained frozen in time, with some of its fixtures and fittings still in tact. And while the last time guests checked in for an overnight stay may be long gone, it doesn't mean the hotel is fully unoccupied. Ghostly goings on have been documented at the hotel for years, according to Geoff Hill, chair of the Middleton St George Memorial Association. The rooms that were once bouncing with music, dancing, and happy holidaymakers - like the old Mynarski's Bar here - are now just a shell of their former self. But now empty pint glasses, mattresses, curtains, and chandeliers are the only brief reminders of the hotel in its heyday. Geoff, from Sedgefield, said it was a "crying shame" to see the hotel this way - but said that many areas have actually stood the test of time. And as with many abandoned hotels, talk can often turn to its paranormal guests - and it's fair to say Geoff knows a few. (IMAGE: CHRIS BOOTH)Raymond's Gloster Meteor aircraft lost control and ploughed into Room 52 on November 24, 1951 - and despite surviving the crash, he was killed by falling bricks. The room he crashed into, Room 52, has since been split into two, but back then was normally occupied by a flight controller. He said: "She would say: 'Raymond, please stop, I have got work to do!" Geoff, who stayed in Room 16 when he got married, said he believes Room 44 is home to its own hanger-twitching poltergeist. Geoff's grandson, air cadet Reece Downs, 19, said he had also seen some otherwordly incidents - describing how he saw someone walk past while alone. Suites are now in varying states and boast random bits of furniture, mainly due to an auction was held for fixtures and fittings after the closure in 2018. This bathroom, for example, looks almost ready to use. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)One room that still looks well is The Spitfire Room, which was once stayed in by Queen Elizabeth in 1951. It hasn't changed much from its closing day either - with the grey carpets and panelling looking almost brand new. A particularly sad room for Geoff is the RAF Middleton St George Memorial Room, where an array of memorabilia and wartime artifacts once adorned the walls.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Read, 45, was found not guilty of the January 2022 murder of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, after jurors rejected the prosecution's argument that she hit him with her SUV when she dropped him at a house party and left him to die in the snow. Her defense team alleged that Read was the victim of an elaborate plot by local Boston law enforcement to frame her, claiming other police officers at the gathering killed O'Keefe. After Read's first trial last year ended in a hung jury, the case gained national attention amid scrutiny over Read's claims that investigators planted evidence and covered up other suspects. 'Today, our hearts are with John and the entire O'Keefe family. 'While we may have more to say in the future, today we mourn with John's family and lament the cruel reality that this prosecution was infected by lies and conspiracy theories spread by Karen Read, her defense team, and some in the media. Read's attorneys argued that some attendees at the party including Brian and Colin Albert and Brian Higgins could have been involved in killing O'Keefe, however none have been formally accused of any wrongdoing by authorities. Read's case sharply divided opinions in Boston and the true crime community, with the accused gaining an ardent following who gathered at court during her trial. The 'Free Karen Read' supporters were such a presence at her trial that the judge ordered they be kept 500 feet away from the courthouse and banned attendees inside the court from wearing pink, a color that they wore to show support for Read. 'I could not be standing here without these amazing supporters,' she said. Read was found not guilty on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but was convicted on Wednesday on the lesser charge of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. Several hours before O'Keefe was found dead on the front lawn of Albert's home, McCabe searched how long it takes 'to die in the cold.' Prosecutors argued that there was no evidence that O'Keefe ever went inside the house party, however forensic investigators never took evidence from inside Albert's home, muddying theories over whether he was beaten inside. Read and O'Keefe had been drinking heavily on the night he died, and voice messages she left him that night where she fumed over their turbulent relationship were also played in court. He had been serving on the Boston Police Department for 16 years. After saying she dropped O'Keefe at Albert's home for an afterparty, Read said she woke up around 5am and panicked when he hadn't returned home, immediately driving back to the scene of the house party. Read then searched for O'Keefe with a friend, and prosecutors allege that during the search she told her friend: 'What if he's dead? … I don't remember anything from last night, we drank so much I don't remember anything.' At 6am, Read found O'Keefe laying in the snow outside Albert's home. Investigators said they found pieces of broken taillight around O'Keefe's body, however Read's defense alleged this could have been planted after the debris was not found in an initial search and was only discovered hours later. 'She could have driven home, they could have talked about it the next day... (instead), she takes a 6,000-pound Lexus and she makes a decision - she steps on the gas after banging it into reverse,' prosecutors said. O'Keefe's phone data last recorded at 12:32am that night, the same time that prosecutors argued car data from Read's SUV showed she hit the reverse pedal hard. The phone's temperature then steadily dropped over the next several hours, which prosecutors said was evidence that he never went inside and lay in the snow after they say he was hit. An autopsy found that the cause of death was blunt impact injuries and hypothermia. Read's defense pointed to apparent dog bite marks on O'Keefe's body they argued were evidence that he had been attacked by Albert's dog. 'What if it wasn't the home of a Boston cop?' Read's attorney Alan Jackson said in his closing argument. Read, a financial analyst and college professor, also faced backlash from followers of her case for her antics, including winking at cameras, embracing her supporters and snacking and laughing in the courthouse. 'The defense did a very good job of poking holes in the prosecution's case and generating reasonable doubt about her guilt,' he said in his analysis of the verdict.</p>

Jason Aldean sat down with Taste of Country Nights and rolled through the gamut of conspiracy theories, and you will be surprised which ones he believes in and which ones he refutes.

Taste of Country Nights host Evan Paul began tossing out the conspiracy theories to Aldean, who gave his answers:

Interesting answer to the last one about the Illuminati, due to the fact that the Aldeans are friends with President Donald Trump, and Aldean was tapped to perform at Trump's inaugural ball on Jan. 20.

Could it be possible that some of Aldean's opinions could have been swayed by the fact that he is an acquaintance of the current President of the United States?

Of course, we can't confirm that, but we do know that the "Whiskey Drink" singer does have President Trump's cell phone number, and the two text one another.

Granted, those texts are more along the lines of talking about golf, but it could be intimidating to answer conspiracy theories about our country and the world knowing that one wrong answer could solicit a text from the President of the United States of America.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eleven-year-old orphan Elio (voiced by Yonas Kibreab) is ­obsessed with outer space and the prospect of extraterrestrial life there. So much so, in fact, that he's using homemade apparatus to send a signal offering himself up for alien abduction. When events at the nearby airforce base where aunt and guardian Olga (Zoe Saldana) works bring that dream to reality, Elio is zapped to the Communiverse, a peaceful space society of various alien races. But he's mistaken for an official emissary from Earth rather than just a lonely boy reaching out to see who's listening. When Elio befriends the offspring of a galactic warlord, he causes a diplomatic incident. This is all very “nice”, with the character expressions and elasticated action sequences bound to strike a chord with little people. But Pixar's name was built upon the grown-up wit it smuggled beneath the kid-acting, somewhere Elio declines to boldly go. As for the title character and the story's child-alien bromance, co-directors Madeline Sharafian, Domee Shi and Adrian Molina seem to be banking on their target market not having seen a certain ­Spielberg sci-fi classic just yet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gas cloud beings and telepathic fashion critics. Drenched in meteor silk, bioluminescent scales, and gravity-defying accessories. Welcome to Alien Fashion Week, a celestial extravaganza of fashion, where the laws of terrestrial haute couture no longer hold. You don't require a spaceship to get there. All you require is an imagination, a sense of surreal, and Dreamina's AI image generator that can translate your most fanciful dream style into digital imagery. Let's discuss trends before we get to the designing. Galactic fashion doesn't observe seasons—it observes cycles of radiation, wormhole styles, and planetary hues. These are just some of the hottest trends this solar cycle: All you need is the proper canvas—and that's where the AI picture maker comes in as your gateway. Rather than drawing, simply put into words your ideal alien fashion and let the gadget bring it to life with extraterrestrial panache. In just a few phrases, you can bring the whole setting to life that seems ripped from a space opera's high-fashion conclusion. Maybe your brand is called “VOIDRIFT” and specializes in geometric gowns stitched from dark matter threads. Or Glimmr, a high-concept label that tailors clothing for light-based beings who change shape every 17 minutes. Every fashion brand for space needs a logo—and luckily, you don't need to create one from the ground up. Employ Dreamina's AI logo generator to create a visual identity that blends cosmic sophistication with future weirdness. Whether tentacle typography, starry night skies formed into brand initials, or flowing alien glyphs inserted into holographic crests, AI can make it happen with a surreal, out-of-this-world look. No look is complete without the accessories—and that's where things get truly fun. Make these designs into portable, collectible art with Dreamina's sticker maker. You can even make themed sticker sheets—such as “Venusian Streetwear” or “Haute Mars Couture“—and trade them with fellow worldbuilders, gamers, or fashion dweebs. Your stickers aren't adorable–they're an invitation to a world of visual possibility only you can imagine. Alien style is so interesting because every look has a story behind it. Every tiny detail can mean much politically, emotionally, and ceremonially. Use AI-generated art to animate these figures. Combine the fashion with bios, snippets of lore, or fictional interviews with methane moon models in Sector YZ-4. Display your work in a scrollable “runway” thread, share a carousel on social media with fake commentary, or produce a zine called Intergalactic Vogue: The Outer Rim Edition. With your logo at the front, backstory each photo, and allow people to get lost in your orbit. It is unlike any other-an-otherworldly gathering sewn from starlight, circuitry, and imagination. Fashion does not have to remain earthbound. The universe is your catwalk—and there's no dress code in space. The Daily Guardian is a renascent Iloilo-based publishing firm and media outfit with bureaus in Kalibo, Boracay, Roxas, Bacolod, Antique, Guimaras, and Manila. Led by Iloilo's most respected journalists, the Daily Guardian pledges to tell the Ilonggo story as seen through the various lenses of society so that every side may be told.</p>
