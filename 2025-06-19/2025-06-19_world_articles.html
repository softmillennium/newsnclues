                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After days of tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Iran, for the civilians caught up in Israel's bombing campaign, life is filled with uncertainty. “This is war,” one 58-year-old father of two in the capital, Tehran, told CNN, adding, “no one really understands what that means.” A week into the conflict, Iranians' contact with the outside world is difficult, hampered by sporadic internet and phone coverage. Speaking through voice recordings, messages and occasional calls, all the people interviewed asked CNN not to reveal their full names for fear of retribution from Iran's authorities. Life has found a new wartime rhythm, they  said, with local shops still open but some accepting payment on credit, the  father of two told CNN. Unable to withdraw money from Iran's Sepah Bank, this credit has become a lifeline. “We have electricity but gasoline is useless to us because we have nowhere to go outside Tehran,” he said, after long lines of traffic departing the capital were seen in recent days. Glued to the TV watching an outlawed Iranian broadcaster based in London, he said his family hadn't left their house in recent days. ⁠”Daily life is filled with constant fear and distrust,” he said. “The workers were completely overwhelmed and said they just cannot process all these requests for cash. I come to Tehran and they bomb here,” a 27-year-old conscript soldier told CNN. A hairdresser from Shiraz lamented the destruction being inflicted: “I don't even know what to say. “You want to hit the real target, but it's surrounded by ordinary people. “Rebuilding all this may take decades, if not longer, and in the end it's we the people who will have to bear the cost,” a 22-year-old janitor of an apartment building in Tehran told CNN. More than 200 people have been killed in Iran, according to Tehran, with Israel's strikes  taking out much of the key leadership in the country's military and nuclear program. But Iran has accused Israel of also targeting its energy and digital infrastructure. “But now that all its forces (in the region) have been destroyed, it seems that its own turn has come,” she added. But a week into the fighting, even as diplomatic channels for peace start to coalesce, there's still no sign of an end to the bombings. Uncertainty has only been fueled by US President Donald Trump teasing the possibility of US aircraft joining the bombing campaign. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has slammed Trump's call for surrender, warning that America's involvement in Israel's military campaign would “100% be at their loss.” Related article Iran watches decades-old red lines vanish from view, but Trump still faces a huge risk “I lost a son during the Iran-Iraq War and will be happy to fight America and the Zionists again,” a 78-year-old mosque caretaker from Isfahan told CNN, “Those who love martyrdom cannot be defeated.” The prospects of peace look slim, one engineering student from Mashad told CNN. “Now that Trump has come this far, he will see it through to the end. They don't let a wounded bear go free,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three employees of a firm that provided workers to pick grapes for champagne has gone on trial for human trafficking, in one of the biggest labour scandals to hit France's exclusive sparkling wine industry. The employees of the firm supplying grape pickers for the champagne harvest in 2023 were charged with human trafficking and exploiting seasonal workers, submitting vulnerable people to undignified housing conditions, and employing foreign nationals without authorisation. A police investigation found that a total of 57 men and women, mostly from west African countries and many of them undocumented, were allegedly held in fetid housing. A labour inspectorate found what it said in a report were “disgusting” and “dilapidated” living conditions at the house. Grape-pickers were allegedly forced to sleep on what they described as stinking inflatable mattresses in a house without proper flooring, walls or windows, amid dangerous electrical wiring and rusty bed frames. The workers, from countries including Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast and Senegal, were allegedly given too little food – either rice or sandwiches that were rotting. They were said to be transported to vineyards crammed into the back of vans, standing up, with no seats or windows. Some told investigators they worked for 10 hours with only a 30-minute break and were threatened if they wanted to rest or drink water. They are believed to have been hired from areas in northern Paris where refugees and undocumented people often sleep rough or in tents and were driven to the Champagne region with the promise of work. Two of the former workers told local French media that they still cried when thinking about the conditions they experienced. Maxime Cessieux, a lawyer for the workers, said the accused had “a total contempt” and disrespect for “human dignity”. A lawyer for one of the accused employees told the Nouvel Obs he had only been involved in initial recruitment, and had had nothing to do with housing or work conditions. The CGT trade union said there must be an end to exploitation of seasonal workers in vineyards. Every year, about 120,000 seasonal workers are brought into the Champagne region to handpick grapes grown across 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) and used to make the sparkling alcoholic drink. But the plight of seasonal workers has sometimes cast a shadow over champagne's reputation. During the 2018 champagne harvest, dozens of workers, including many from Afghanistan, were discovered housed in fetid conditions. Two members of a firm providing labour to the wine industry were found guilty of human trafficking and given prison sentences.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Army chief's effusive welcome in Washington hints at strategic recalibration amid Middle East turmoil After years in the diplomatic deep freeze, US-Pakistan ties appear to be quickly thawing, with Donald Trump's effusive welcome for Pakistan's army chief, Gen Asim Munir, signalling a possible major reset. Pakistan's top-level access in Washington, including a White House lunch for Munir on Wednesday and meetings with top national security officials, has raised Indian eyebrows, especially amid sensitive trade negotiations with the US. India considers the Trump administration to be glossing over Pakistan's record on terrorism. In the phone call, Modi made it “absolutely clear”, said India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, that hostilities ceased only after Pakistan requested a ceasefire, and that no third-party mediation took place. “India has not accepted mediation in the past and never will,” Misri said. Adding to the confusion, a White House press officer said Munir had been invited after suggesting Trump be nominated for the Nobel peace prize for ending the conflict, which followed a terror attack that killed 26 mainly Hindu holidaymakers in Indian-administered Kashmir. Munir's red-carpet treatment in Washington and high praise from US Central Command hint at a strategic recalibration. Gen Michael E Kurilla, the head of Central Command, recently called Pakistan a “phenomenal” counter-terrorism partner, citing Islamabad's role in helping to capture the alleged Islamic State Khorasan Province planner behind the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport, an attack that killed 13 US troops and more than 170 Afghan civilians. But they don't get entertained at the White House,” noted Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based south Asia analyst. “Ayub Khan and Zia ul-Haq were exceptions but they came as heads of state.” Just a few years ago, Trump himself accused Pakistan of offering “nothing but lies and deceit”. Against that backdrop, Washington's embrace of Munir strikes a jarring note in Delhi, where critics say the US is engaging with the same military establishment long accused of enabling cross-border militancy. Analysts say the pivot may be driven by more than just strategic cooperation. “He has a thing for strongmen,” said one US analyst. That may help to explain why Munir was granted access usually reserved for heads of state. “He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up,” Kugelman said. But Munir's visit is taking place as the Middle East is in turmoil, with Israel striking Iranian targets and Iran firing missiles in retaliation. There's also a more delicate calculation, with Israel pushing the US to join its military campaign against Iran, which shares a 900km border with Pakistan. Some analysts believe the US may be probing whether Munir would allow surveillance flights or logistical cooperation. But Pakistan's room for manoeuvre is limited, with public opinion strongly pro-Iran. “Even privately, Pakistan's military would likely balk at the risks,” Kugelman said. For Indian officials, Munir's reception has revived old memories of the US tendency to tilt towards Pakistan at critical junctures, such as in the cold war moments or post-9/11. But this time, analysts say, the reset may also involve commercial opportunity. He added: “This is classic Trump: ‘What can you do for me?</p>

They will study this period one day: Iran, Israel, Gaza, Ukraine, Russia. Fortunately, there is a wealth of documentation about these matters, delivered daily (even if some accounts are more credible than others). But what happens when a country deliberately sets out to erase its history? And we are seeing it right now in the U.S. – another illustration of this weird and ugly chapter in American history. Signs have gone up at U.S. national parks urging visitors to report plaques, brochures or other information (perhaps your park ranger's historical tour) “that are negative about either past or living Americans.” A QR code is supplied for your tattletaling convenience. This follows a government directive to the National Park Service (NPS) to remove or cover “all inappropriate content” that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times),” according to the New York Times, which reports that the NPS must do so by a Sept. 17 deadline. We're not just talking about hiking trails and sandy beaches. “How do you talk about Martin Luther King without talking about racism?” asks Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonpartisan advocacy group for the parks. Five years after George Floyd's murder, U.S. sees sharp reversal in support for racial-equity efforts The placement of these Orwellian signs follows Donald Trump's executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” part of the President's crusade against wokeness. The new signs also encourage visitors to report any information that fails to “emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” Be complimentary, or else. In Canada, we are learning the value of telling history accurately, in particular the history of Indigenous people. The Truth and Reconciliation process has been bumpy at times, sure, but it has exposed this country's real history to many Canadians (not just students) who simply didn't know about the harms of colonialism, including residential schools. We are seeing this reflected in school curricula, at museums, on the calendar (we mark National Indigenous Peoples Day on Saturday) and, consequently, in the zeitgeist. What if they did this in, say, Germany – where monuments and museums tell the country's chilling Nazi history, along with tens of thousands of Stolpersteins (literally “stumbling stones”), small brass plates marking places from which people were deported? (Memorials that speak to the despicable actions of past governments of that period are also prominent in Hungary, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and France.) Imagine if, in an effort by a hypothetical German government to avoid casting shade upon its history, those sites were watered down. Any thinking person would be outraged – even much of the MAGA set, too. Picture Minidoka, currently billed as “An American Concentration Camp,” instead being described as “a unique visiting experience in the scenic Gem State, along the refreshing waters of Clover Creek with its fine fishing?” What an insult to the memory of all who suffered there. This move to sanitize historic sites is a testament to the idiocy of this U.S. administration – as history, one hopes, will show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Customs and Border Protection agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” Alistair Kitchen said. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. A leading press freedom advocate on Tuesday condemned the United States' “disturbing pattern” of screening and expelling international visitors for their political viewpoints following the detention and removal of an Australian journalist who criticized the Trump administration's targeting of Palestine defenders on college campuses. Alistair Kitchen said he was detained for 12 hours and interrogated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in Los Angeles International Airport while en route from Melbourne, Australia to New York last week. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Kitchen said that CBP agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” and although he “had cleaned up my online presence expecting ad hoc digital sweeps,” he “was not prepared for their sophistication.” “If you are deleting social media 48 hours before your flight to the U.S., it is already too late,” he stressed. Kitchen wrote that the agents “just came out and said it: ‘We both know why you've been detained…it's because of what you wrote about the protests at Columbia,'” he recounted. "Writers, artists, and scholars must be free to express their views openly without compromising their free movement across borders," said PEN America's @jonfreadom.bsky.social following detainment and deportation of Australian writer Alistair Kitchen for his personal writings pen.org/press-releas… Responding to Kitchen's ordeal, Jonathan Friedman, managing director of the U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America, said in a statement Tuesday that “it is gravely concerning to read an account of someone being detained and turned away at the border due to their writings on student protests, Palestine, and the Trump administration.” The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — which earlier this year issued its first-ever travel advisory for journalists entering the United States, including warnings about searches of electronic devices — called Kitchen's detention and expulsion “alarming.” “Alistair Kitchen's deportation is a clear case of retaliation in connection with his reporting, and such action sends a chilling message to journalists that they must support the administration's narratives or face forms of retribution,” CPJ U.S., Canada, and Caribbean Program coordinator Katherine Jacobsen said Monday. Kitchen suspects CBP agents used technology contracted from Palantir, which has been targeted by the No Tech for Apartheid movement over its involvement in Project Nimbus, a cloud computing collaboration between Israel's military and tech titans Amazon and Google criticized for enabling Israeli human rights crimes. In March, Kitchen published a piece on his Kitchen Counter blog, titled “On the Deportation of Dissent.” The post highlighted the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and former Columbia University student and Palestine solidarity activist arrested on March 8 by plainclothes Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers in front of his pregnant wife in New York before being transferred to New Jersey and then to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in Louisiana, where he missed the birth of his son. Numerous foreign nationals, including green-card holders, have been targeted under the law for criticizing Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza and U.S. complicity. In an executive order 10 days ago, the Trump administration promised to “go on offense to enforce law and order” by “cancel[ing] the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” This is a mode of speech suppression that seeks to physically remove the undesirable elements it can, and, through fear, ensure silence in everyone else. That role is untenable so long as it does not involve the ferocious protection of student speech. However, a DHS spokesperson denied Kitchen's assertion, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he was denied entry to the United States “because he gave false information” regarding alleged drug use on his Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application. “There's certainly not proof of me doing drugs on my phone,” he said. “But this is a method of interrogation that uses entrapment.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A weekly look at some small-cap stocks making news - or about to. Canada's S&P/TSX Small Cap Index TXTW-I is up 22 per cent over the past 52 weeks. Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB-T shares fell this week after the company said it expects “temporary declines” in some of its international markets in the current quarter. Aurora told investors to expect continued strong global cannabis revenue in its current fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by improved performance in Canadian medical and consumer sales. But it cautioned that global performance would be an offsetting factor. In a call with analysts, CEO Miguel Martin said regulatory changes in Poland affected the ability of its patients to access prescriptions “and generally the size of the market,” adding that he expects that to be temporary. “We are excited about the long-term aspects of Poland coming back.“ Before markets opened on Wednesday, the Edmonton-based cannabis producer reported revenue of $90.5-million for its 2025 fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with $67.4-million in the prior-year period. Its net loss narrowed to $17.2-million from $20.3-million in the year-ago quarter. Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Bottomley, who has a “buy” and $12.50 target on the stock, said the results were generally in-line with his expectations “amid what we believe was a transformational year for the company as it continued to refocus efforts on international medical markets, which doubled [year over year] [fiscal] 2024 levels.” “Aurora has not entered into any such agreements, has had no discussions with MedLeaf Therapeutics or MediPharm GmbH with respect to any business combination transaction or strategic partnership, and has not made any statements or filed any information pertaining to any such transactions,” it stated, adding that the “erroneous articles posted on Investing.com state that they were generated ‘with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.” Aurora said it's “launching an investigation into the genesis of these articles,” adding that it's “not in the possession of material non-public information.” Both articles were removed from the Investing.com website by midday Thursday. In an e-mail statement to the Globe, an Investing.com spokesperson said the articles were published “due to a technical issue and were immediately removed upon receiving notice.” Kraken Robotics Inc. PNG-X shares fell this week after the St. John's-based company announced a $100-million bought deal financing. After markets closed on Tuesday, Kraken said it has an agreement with Desjardins Capital Markets, as sole lead underwriter and bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, to buy 37.6 million common shares for $2.66 each. Kraken said it expects the net proceeds will be used to support its “transition into a scalable global prime contractor,” including boosting its ability to consider larger acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and European Union and to demonstrate a stronger balance sheet when bidding for larger governmental and commercial contracts. Diversified Royalty Corp. DIV-T shares hit their highest level since early 2023 this week after the company announced a 10-per-cent annual dividend increase. After markets closed on Tuesday, Diversified said it was able to fund the transaction without raising equity. “In our view, this transaction fits well into management's strategy of buying into growing brands and elevates the company's status to the U.S. franchisor market, which will be critical for sourcing further deals,” he wrote in a June 18 note. “We view positively DIV's acquisition of Cheba Hut's royalty stream, which expands DIV's portfolio in the larger U.S. market, but on familiar terrain,” he wrote in a June 18 note. “The acquisition increases distributable cash flow per share by [about] 4 per cent while keeping leverage at a manageable level and facilitating an increase to the dividend.” He noted management has been focusing much of its active search efforts in the U.S. market, “where lower familiarity with DIV and the royalty model in general have been hurdles to getting deals done. We believe each successful deal should help DIV gain traction there.” SIR Royalty Income Fund SRV-UN-T units hit a 52-week high this week after the company reported higher revenue and adjusted profit for its third quarter ended May 4. After markets closed on Tuesday, the trust behind restaurant brands such as Jack Astor's Bar and Grill and Scaddabush Italian Kitchen & Bar, said revenue from corporate restaurant operations increased by 4.5 per cent to $64.8-million, compared to $62-million for its third quarter of 2024. It said the increase was due mainly to a $2.9-million increase in earnings from corporate restaurant operations in the third quarter of 2025 compared to a year earlier. Groupe Dynamite Inc. GRDG-T shares hit their highest level since going public last fall after the Montreal-based retailer reported a 20-per-cent jump in revenue and 13-per-cent growth in same-store sales for its first quarter ended May 3 – results that beat expectations. “The company's speed to market and capabilities when it comes to managing assortment architecture should mitigate the shock of any potential future increases in tariffs; further, the average price point of its offering allows its customers to enjoy ‘affordable indulgences' even during periods of softer consumer sentiment.” “We now view GRGD to be a top pick in our discretionary universe along with Dollarama,” Mr. Shreedhar said in a June 17 note. “Investment in GRGD is differentiated by strong financial metrics, with an EBITDA margin and ROIC [return on invested capital] that is amongst the highest in our apparel group.” Read more on Groupe Dynamite's recent earnings report from the Globe's Susan Krashinsky Robertson here Reitmans (Canada) Ltd. RET-X reported lower revenue and same-store sales for its first quarter ended May 4 and a wider loss compared to the same quarter last year. After markets closed on Tuesday, the retailer reported revenue fell 4 per cent to $158.9-million, “primarily due to severe winter weather in the month of February and economic uncertainty.” It said comparable same-store sales fell 4.5 per cent year over year. “Our disappointing financial results underscore the importance of implementing the five-year strategic plan we announced in April,” CEO Andrea Limbardi stated in a release. “This strategy is designed to drive long-term profitable growth and ultimately make our business more resilient.” High Tide Inc. HITI-X reported higher revenue but swung to a loss for its second quarter ended April 30. Ventum Capital Markets analyst Andrew Semple maintained his “buy” rating and $8.50 target after the earnings report. "It is one of the few cannabis companies in Canada to sustainably grow EBITDA, generate sustainable positive FCF [free cash flow], and maintain clear growth drivers ahead.“ Lightspeed Commerce Inc. LSPD-T announced this week that it reached an agreement in principle to resolve a proposed class action proceeding filed in Quebec. CEO and founder Dax Dasilva stated that resolving the class action can help Lightspeed focus on its transformation, “concentrating on the markets where we have a proven right to win–and delivering exceptional experiences to our customers worldwide.” Ballard Power Systems BLDP-T announced this week that its president and CEO Randy MacEwen will step down on July 7 and will be replaced by Marty Neese. Mr. Neese has served on Ballard's board for the past 10 years and has been CEO of Verdagy, an electrolysis and green hydrogen company, for the past four years. Before markets opened on Monday, the company said it had an agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp to buy 5.8 million units of the trust for US$17.25 per unit. The tax dispute relates to a 2013 income tax audit of Aimia's former subsidiary, Aeroplan Inc., the company said in a release before markets opened on Monday. Aimia said it expects to use the proceeds from the CRA refund to support its 2025-2026 normal course issuer bid and for general working capital purposes. Following the sale of Aeroplan Inc. to Air Canada in January, 2019, Aimia said it agreed to indemnify Air Canada for pre-closing income tax liabilities and put $100-million from the sale proceeds into an escrow account. “Aimia anticipates that a similar resolution is likely,” it stated.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Kurilla said to be power behind throne as US president mulls over direct military action “Shots fired!” shouted Gen Michael Kurilla moments before charging towards the sound of gunfire to save two junior officers. Weaving through the rubble-strewn alleyways of war-torn Mosul, Iraq, the then-lieutenant colonel was pursuing a group of terrorist suspects when three more shots rang out. Taking bullets to the arm and both legs, one snapping his femur in half, he “performed a judo roll” and carried on firing his rifle, witnesses say. The 59-year-old has apparently overruled other top Pentagon officials in managing the crisis and has had nearly all his requests approved for more weapons and air defences for the region, multiple sources told Politico and Axios. According to one former official, his tough-guy persona and commanding physical presence give Gen Kurilla powerful influence over the US defence secretary. “If the senior military guys come across as tough and war fighters, Hegseth is easily persuaded to their point of view.” “Hegseth has sided with him time and again,” a diplomat told the website. Hailed by Israeli news outlet Ynet as “the US general Israel doesn't want to strike Iran without”, Gen Kurilla is a long-time Iran hawk who is expected to retire from the military this summer. A veteran of Panama, the Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Kurilla is seen as “one of Israel's staunchest allies in the American defence establishment”, according to Ynet, and has travelled to the country dozens of times since he first visited as a young officer in his 20s. “He knows the type of every munition launched at Israel that night, and where each interceptor was positioned,” an Israeli official told the news outlet last year. According to The New York Times, the general had been open to US involvement in an Israeli strike plan to attack Iran earlier this spring, combining a bombing campaign with commando raids on nuclear sites, but was blocked by Mr Trump, who favoured a diplomatic approach. “He has been pushing for war with Iran and away from diplomacy since before Trump took office in ways that run over civilian officials,” Justin Logan, director of foreign policy and defence studies at the Cato Institute, told Responsible Statecraft. Since taking over as head of Centcom in 2022, Gen Kurilla has pursued a strategy of military integration with Israel and regional partners to deter Iranian aggression, known as “Kurilla's umbrella”. Explaining his approach to a US House congressional committee in March, Gen Kurilla said that Iran had taken a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the region to its advantage”, which could be halted by a “deep partnership” between Israel, the US and the Gulf States. The 30-day operation cost more than $1 billion and was widely viewed as an ineffective use of resources, yet it enabled Mr Trump to strike a deal to end the fighting. He also is said to have released a statement in which he reiterated the two nations' “ironclad military-to-military relationship”, The Jerusalem Post reported. Gen Kurilla may have also played a decisive role in determining Israel's decision to pull the trigger on operation “Rising Lion” last Friday, when it launched a devastating series of precision air strikes on Iranian military sites and personnel. Although Israel acquiesced to Mr Trump's demands in April to hold off attacking Iran, military sources told The Jerusalem Post at the time that they hoped to strike before Gen Kurilla stepped down in July, recognising him as a key ally. “I think it's been reported, and you know, based on my experience with him, that he takes a fundamentally different view of the importance of the Middle East than a lot of other people in the administration,” Dan Caldwell, former adviser to Mr Hegseth, told the Breaking Points podcast on Monday. With time running out before Iran produces an atomic bomb and with Gen Kurilla's retirement looming, it may well be that Israel saw its window of opportunity closing. This is how the Pentagon does, and should, function.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. A new coronavirus variant is spreading in many parts of the world. A summer wave also could occur in the United States. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NB.1.8.1 already represents about one-third of new Covid-19 cases as of June 7. This is a significant increase from just a month before, when the new variant represented just 5% of new Covid-19 cases. Do current vaccines still work, and if so, who should consider getting another dose now? And what precautions should people take to reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19? To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Marijuana use dramatically increases risk of dying from heart attacks and stroke, large study finds CNN: What should people know about the new variant? Wen: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly mutating, and it's entirely expected that there will be new variants. This new variant, NB.1.8.1, also called Nimbus, is a descendant of the Omicron strain. The World Health Organization has deemed the new strain a “variant under monitoring.” However, WHO also reports that surveillance data do not show that it has increased severity compared with previously circulating variants. Given that this strain is outcompeting previous variants, it's possible that it could be more contagious, but there is nothing to suggest that it is being spread differently compared with past variants. As for whether existing vaccines work against this variant, the answer is not known. WHO cites laboratory data showing that it could have some immune escape, which means it may be less responsive to the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection and suggesting a possible reduction in vaccine efficacy. I expect there will be more data available in the coming weeks, as federal health officials will soon decide the formulation of this fall's updated Covid-19 vaccine. Knowing that NB.1.8.1 constitutes a growing proportion of cases, they will most likely try to ensure that the formulation has efficacy again this variant. There is a large range of symptoms and severity. Some patients may have allergy-like symptoms, such as stuffy and runny nose. While most people will recover, some could become severely ill and require hospitalization. Some individuals who contract Covid-19 may also develop the post-viral condition known as long Covid. A wave also could occur simply because of declining population immunity. Some experts believe that the emergence of this new strain combined with less recent Covid-19 activity could start a wave in the next couple of months. What we have seen from several years of experience with Covid-19 is that infections tend to come in waves. Infection rates decline for several months, then they begin to increase again. Summer waves of Covid-19 have occurred over the past few years. It's certainly possible that the pattern repeats this year. When kids use screens, parents worry about the wrong thing, new study suggests Wen: This is a difficult question to answer because the landscape around Covid-19 vaccination has been changing. Just last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. These shots appear to still be accessible for children; for instance, the CDC's guidance now reads that children can get the shots after consulting with their health care provider. However, there are already reports of pregnant women having more difficulty obtaining these vaccines. This and other guidance could soon change, as Kennedy has reconstituted the panel of external experts who advise the CDC on vaccine recommendations, and this new panel could make different decisions during their upcoming meeting in late June. Another uncertainty is when a new round of vaccines will be made available. Those who are 65 and over or who have chronic underlying medical conditions should consider getting another dose of the vaccine now, if they are eligible. That way, they have additional protection in case there is a summer wave, since the existing vaccine probably retains some efficacy against the new variant. As for those who are younger and generally healthy, some who have not yet received the 2024-25 formulation also may consider getting the vaccine now before guidelines change and they may no longer be eligible. These dads lost everything, and then they found each other CNN: What precautions should people consider to reduce their risk of contracting this variant? If they need to go into, say, a crowded train station, they should consider wearing a well-fitting N95 or equivalent mask.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin has received an official invitation to attend the G20 summit in South Africa, Russian Ambassador-at-Large Marat Berdyev said in an interview with state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti on June 19. South Africa is a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and a signatory to the Rome Statute, meaning it is obliged to arrest Putin if he enters the country. "Last week, we received an official invitation. This is an appeal from the head of state, the president of South Africa (Cyril Ramaphosa), to his colleagues," Berdyev said. Berdyev noted that Russia's final decision on Putin's participation will be made closer to the date. In recent years, Russia has been represented at G20 summits by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Despite the warrant, South Africa continues to deepen political and military ties with Moscow. In 2023, the country conducted joint naval drills with Russia and China, and maintains its membership in the BRICS bloc alongside both nations. In November 2024, Putin skipped the G20 summit in Brazil, another ICC member state, and sent Lavrov instead. Russia's G20 participation has continued uninterrupted despite its war against Ukraine.</p>

A constitutional amendment, passed overwhelmingly by voters, removed language that had long allowed involuntary servitude to continue in state prisons — a holdover from the 13th Amendment's infamous “exception clause.” The 13th Amendment, though widely celebrated at the time for abolishing most forms of slavery, still allows for involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime, and has remained the legal backbone for the vast system of prison labor in the U.S., where incarcerated people can be compelled to work under threat of punishment. In Alabama, that legal framework is now gone. The new constitution is clear: slavery and involuntary servitude are banned in all forms, period. Incarcerated people in Alabama are still being forced to work, in part through “work release” programs where refusal can mean being sent to solitary confinement, transferred to more dangerous prisons, or denied parole. Some are punished not for choosing not to work, but for being unable to work — because of disability, injury, or chronic illness. In some cases, people are removed from work release without explanation, and when they seek to be reassigned or evaluated medically, they are told they are “noncompliant” or “refusing.” The punishment is the same. It's against this backdrop that a group of incarcerated workers filed an ongoing federal lawsuit in December 2023, challenging Alabama's continued use of forced prison labor. Their claims go far beyond the state's constitutional ban on slavery. The lawsuit also invokes the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which prohibits labor obtained through coercion, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 — a Reconstruction-era statute designed to combat racially motivated abuses by government officials. The suit further alleges that Alabama's overly harsh and racist parole policies trap Black people in prisons for years beyond when they have proven ready for release, as part of a plan to keep large numbers of workers enrolled in forced, off-site work release. Together, the claims argue that Alabama's prison labor system is not only unconstitutional, but part of a broader pattern of racial discrimination, corruption, and systemic violence. The plaintiffs allege they are “entrapped in a system of ‘convict leasing' in which incarcerated people are forced to work, subject to threats of physical violence, deprivation of bare necessities, and threat of extended imprisonment, for little or no money, to the significant benefit of the numerous government entities and private businesses that ‘employ' them.” The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry. The lead plaintiff, who goes by Kinetik Justice, has faced years of retaliation for creating the Free Alabama Movement, through which he encourages incarcerated people to strike and engage in other nonviolent refusal to work. In the complaint, Justice alleges that after helping organize a 2014 strike, he faced retaliation, including “years of solitary confinement, torture, taking away his personal and legal documents and records, beatings and transfers to prevent him from speaking about Alabama's forced labor system.” Another plaintiff, Lakiera Walker, who was incarcerated from 2007 to 2023, alleges that for years she was forced to work long, daily hours of unpaid physical labor in the prison, under threat of solitary confinement. When a work supervisor demanded sex, Walker refused and reported him to the prison. In response, she alleges prison officials issued her a disciplinary offense for purportedly refusing to work and sent her back to unpaid work in the prison. During the final years of her incarceration — including after the 2022 state constitutional amendment banned forced labor — Walker was sent on work release to off-site, private companies, including one where she regularly worked 12-hour shifts inside freezers without adequate work clothes. The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry. Once, when Walker was so ill she had to be carried to the healthcare unit, she says a prison job placement officer told her to “get up and go make us our 40%.” In its March 2024 legal response to the allegations, Bama Budweiser does not meaningfully address the constitutional issue — whether Alabama's prison labor system violates the state's explicit ban on slavery. Instead, the company's brief resorts to a series of dehumanizing attacks and dangerous arguments that seek to delegitimize the plaintiffs themselves. If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone. This, of course, ignores that the company has contracted with ADOC to knowingly obtain and benefit from the labor of incarcerated workers. But Bama Budweiser's response then quickly shifts into something much darker. “What we have, then, are two murderers, an attempted murderer, multiple violent felons, robbers, burglars, and drug dealers. And they come into this Court complaining about having to work for a beer distributor.” It's a moral judgment — one that seeks to strip incarcerated people of constitutional protection by appealing to public fear and disgust. The clear implication is that some people do not deserve rights. Elsewhere in the brief, Bama Budweiser points back to the previous version of the Alabama Constitution that provided an exception legalizing slavery for people in prison, which seems to suggest that the amendment — passed in 2022 by 76 percent of Alabama voters — banning slavery and involuntary servitude for all, without exception, should never have passed. They dismiss media reports of inhumane prison conditions as unreliable “hearsay,” and mock the idea that enforcing labor rules against incarcerated people might ever rise to the level of coercion. All of this is done under the brand name of Budweiser — a company that, in recent years, has styled itself as a champion of inclusion and human dignity. Its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has released national advertisements promoting LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant narratives, and “American values.” They have called themselves proud allies of “marginalized communities.” But in this brief, filed in a federal court in Alabama, a place where marginalized communities are plentiful, a distributor making use of the company's name is sending an unambiguous message: people in prison are not worthy of dignity. They must state clearly whether they support the position their distributor has taken — that the constitutional ban on slavery does not apply to people behind bars. I've been incarcerated in Alabama since 2006, and I've spent years in solitary confinement — not for violence or escape, but for speaking out against forced labor. Since 2016, I've helped organize work strikes, exposed illegal retaliation, and insisted that every person behind these walls deserves the right to refuse labor without facing abuse. Those in prison have lost nearly everything, but under the U.S. Constitution we still have the right to say no to bodily abuse and exploitation. And the fact that such basic assertions of bodily integrity are met with punishment shows just how far this system has strayed from anything resembling rehabilitation. People in prison are disciplined for refusing to work even when they are mentally or physically unable to perform the assigned task. There are men here with untreated injuries, degenerative conditions, serious mental illness — and still, refusal is met with sanctions. But the question before the public is even more urgent: will we allow companies to profit from forced labor, while branding it “corrections”? Will we let corporate lawyers rewrite the meaning of abolition from inside federal courtrooms? If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone. And neither could the line that's been crossed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel's strikes against Iran amount to US military action despite official denials from Washington, US Senator Ted Cruz has suggested. Tehran has accused America of complicity in Israel's attacks on its nuclear infrastructure. Israel launched a series of attacks on Iran last Friday, targeting sites linked to its nuclear program and killing scientists and senior military officials. Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, defended the strikes and called for regime change in Tehran during a tense interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson this week. ”Right now, this tiny little country the size of the state of New Jersey is fighting our enemies for us and taking out their military leadership, and trying to take out their nuclear capacity,” he added. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it sees no evidence to support Israel's allegations. US intelligence agencies have offered similar assessments, though President Donald Trump has dismissed these conclusions. Carlson confronted Cruz over his failure to recall basic facts about the Iranian population, including its size and composition, raising concerns about the senator's support for regime change. Cruz pushed back, accusing Carlson of being overly skeptical about allegations that Iran had plotted to assassinate Trump – a claim brought up by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during an appearance on Fox News last week. ”You don't believe they are trying to murder Trump because you are not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation,” Carlson argued. ”We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz replied. Carlson noted that it was Israel conducting the attacks, to which Cruz responded: “Right, with our help. Carlson highlighted the significance of Cruz's comments, pointing out that they contradict statements made by National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer, who has denied US military involvement. Cruz went on to say he hopes Iran's government will fall to a popular uprising – a scenario Israeli leaders have endorsed during the conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"The fourteenth phase of Operation True Promise 3 began with a combined strike involving kamikaze drones and strategic missiles. According to the IRGC, the Israeli military has evacuated its bases and "deployed its ineffective missile and air defense systems in city centers, using residential buildings as shields." Iran's IRNA news agency reported earlier that the headquarters of the Israeli army's cyber command, the C4I Corps, and a military reconnaissance center in Gav-Yam came under Iranian missile strikes on Thursday morning. According to the outlet, "thousands of troops" were stationed at the site, tasked with handling intelligence data and conducting cyber operations. IRNA stated that the Gav-Yam reconnaissance center was situated near Soroka Hospital in the city of Be'er Sheva in southern Israel. Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Iran carried out a retaliatory attack in less than 24 hours. Israel and Iran exchanged strikes again in the following days. Both parties reported casualties and admitted damage to a number of facilities. Russia has condemned Israel's actions and expressed readiness to act as a mediator in resolving the conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A senior Russian official on June 19 inadvertently confirmed the staggering troop losses incurred by Moscow's forces during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite ongoing U.S.-led peace efforts, Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraws from the four partially occupied regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia — as a precondition for negotiations. Meanwhile, according to figures from Kyiv, Russia has suffered more than 1 million dead, wounded, and missing soldiers since the start of its full-scale invasion. Kelin dismissed the 1 million casualties figure but did confirm that "about 600,000" Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, a number which tallies with Ukrainian estimates from January. "I'm not a specialist in this area, but as I understand it we have 50-60,000 a month, those volunteers who are coming, recruiting, posting, and they would like to get engaged in this thing (in Ukraine)," he replied. According to figures from Ukraine's General Staff, Russia has lost 217,440 troops since Jan. 1, 2025. The discrepancy tallies with Western analysis of Russia's staggering losses. Given that Russia is having to pay people to sign up, the losses have potentially huge ramifications for the country's economy. According to an analysis by economist Janis Kluge, Russia's daily bill just for sign-up bonuses is $24 million. The ballooning bills come at a time when Russia's economy is already under huge strain from Western sanctions and falling oil and gas revenues. "The implications for Russia are grave," energy security analyst Wojciech Jakobik wrote in an op-ed for the Kyiv Independent this week. "If you look at the current Russian economic indicators, for example their inflation rate, their overnight lending interest rates, Russian monetary constraints… government spending is out of control — it's a very loose fiscal policy and so the economy is at risk of overheating," he said. Kelin also said Ukraine must accept Moscow's terms for ending the war or face further military advances and eventual "surrender" — you can read the full story here.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 19. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he does not even want to discuss the possibility of Israel killing Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

"If I may, I hope this will be the most correct answer to your question: ‘I do not even wish to discuss such a possibility'," he said at a meeting with the heads of the world's leading news agencies organized by TASS, when asked what Russia's reaction would be if Israel were to assassinate the ayatollah.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said there are currently no plans to eliminate Iran's supreme leader, adding that Khamenei is an easy target.</p>

The Supreme Court has issued a major decision upholding Tennessee's ban on so-called gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, for minors. Its decision on June 18 will likely influence how states craft legislation and how other gender-related cases unfold in the legal system.

In the case United States v. Skrmetti, a majority of the justices disagreed with the Biden administration's argument that Tennessee's law should undergo more rigorous scrutiny in the courts. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that courts should apply a less rigorous standard known as rational basis, under which states have to show that their law is rationally related to a state interest.</p>
