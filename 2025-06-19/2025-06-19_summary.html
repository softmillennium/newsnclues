            After days of tit-for-tat strikes between Israel and Iran, for the civilians caught up in Israel's bombing campaign, life is filled with uncertainty.
    


            “This is war,” one 58-year-old father of two in the capital, Tehran, told CNN, adding, “no one really understands what that means.”
    


            A week into the conflict, Iranians' contact with the outside world is difficult, hampered by sporadic internet and phone coverage. Some – typically wealthy activists – have access to Starlink terminals providing independent internet access.
    


            Speaking through voice recordings, messages and occasional calls, all the people interviewed asked CNN not to reveal their full names for fear of retribution from Iran's authorities.
    


            Life has found a new wartime rhythm, they  said, with local shops still open but some accepting payment on credit, the  father of two told CNN. Unable to withdraw money from Iran's Sepah Bank, this credit has become a lifeline.
    


            “We have electricity but gasoline is useless to us because we have nowhere to go outside Tehran,” he said, after long lines of traffic departing the capital were seen in recent days.
    


            Glued to the TV watching an outlawed Iranian broadcaster based in London, he said his family hadn't left their house in recent days.
    


            ⁠”Daily life is filled with constant fear and distrust,” he said.
    


            From Shiraz in southern Iran, a 55-year-old English teacher described a “huge group of people waiting” to withdraw cash at a bank branch in the city center.
    


            “The workers were completely overwhelmed and said they just cannot process all these requests for cash. I wouldn't say it was chaotic, but I do feel there is an underlying feeling of panic,” he said.
    


            “It feels like a missile is following me. I go to Karaj and they bomb there. I come to Tehran and they bomb here,” a 27-year-old conscript soldier told CNN. Posted in Tehran, he was able to visit family in Karaj at the weekend, but in the capital is prohibited by military rules from using his phone or other devices. “We can't even check the news.”
    


            A hairdresser from Shiraz lamented the destruction being inflicted: “I don't even know what to say. You watch the videos, the photos. People are being killed, our country is being looted, falling apart like this.”
    


            “Israel and the US don't care about the Iranian people,” she said. “You want to hit the real target, but it's surrounded by ordinary people. They're destroying the country.”
    


            “Rebuilding all this may take decades, if not longer, and in the end it's we the people who will have to bear the cost,” a 22-year-old janitor of an apartment building in Tehran told CNN.
    


            More than 200 people have been killed in Iran, according to Tehran, with Israel's strikes  taking out much of the key leadership in the country's military and nuclear program. But Iran has accused Israel of also targeting its energy and digital infrastructure.
    


            “We are paying the price for a dictatorship and its arrogance,” shared a nurse from Mashad, northeast Iran, whose father was a decorated war veteran. “But now that all its forces (in the region) have been destroyed, it seems that its own turn has come,” she added.
    


            Watching the attacks on a deeply unpopular regime, some Iranians confessed to welcoming the strikes, even as civilians were caught up in the bombings.
    


            “I want to say what I truly feel,” a student from Shiraz told CNN, “I don't know what I'll be judged for, what I'll be accused of.
    


            “Still, I'll say it, I'm genuinely happy. Really, deeply happy!” she added. “I believe it's worth it, for the sake of future generations.”
    


            But a week into the fighting, even as diplomatic channels for peace start to coalesce, there's still no sign of an end to the bombings. Uncertainty has only been fueled by US President Donald Trump teasing the possibility of US aircraft joining the bombing campaign.
    


            Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has slammed Trump's call for surrender, warning that America's involvement in Israel's military campaign would “100% be at their loss.”
    


            Other Iranians share his defiance.
    


            “The mood in Iran is starting to morph into an environment of nationalism,” according to a 69-year-old Iranian-American woman visiting Tehran. “I saw a lot of cars waving the Islamic Republic flag from their windows as we drove out of town.”

            “I lost a son during the Iran-Iraq War and will be happy to fight America and the Zionists again,” a 78-year-old mosque caretaker from Isfahan told CNN, “Those who love martyrdom cannot be defeated.”
    


            The prospects of peace look slim, one engineering student from Mashad told CNN.
    


            “Now that Trump has come this far, he will see it through to the end. They don't let a wounded bear go free,” she said.

Police found 57 people allegedly held in fetid conditions in case known as ‘grape harvest of shame'

Three employees of a firm that provided workers to pick grapes for champagne has gone on trial for human trafficking, in one of the biggest labour scandals to hit France's exclusive sparkling wine industry.

The employees of the firm supplying grape pickers for the champagne harvest in 2023 were charged with human trafficking and exploiting seasonal workers, submitting vulnerable people to undignified housing conditions, and employing foreign nationals without authorisation. The firm itself was also on trial for moral responsibility in the case.

The case, being heard at the criminal court of Châlons-en-Champagne in north-east France, has become known in France as “the grape harvest of shame”.

A police investigation found that a total of 57 men and women, mostly from west African countries and many of them undocumented, were allegedly held in fetid housing. They were allegedly forced to work in conditions likened to slavery while hand-picking grapes in Champagne's picturesque vineyards, in a region recognised as a Unesco world heritage site.

The case came to light when residents in the small village of Nesle-le-Repons called police to complain about noise and activity in a derelict house during the September 2023 grape harvest.

A labour inspectorate found what it said in a report were “disgusting” and “dilapidated” living conditions at the house.

Grape-pickers were allegedly forced to sleep on what they described as stinking inflatable mattresses in a house without proper flooring, walls or windows, amid dangerous electrical wiring and rusty bed frames. There was no adequate water supply, washing facilities or sanitation and only three blocked and unusable toilets.

The workers, from countries including Mali, Mauritania, Ivory Coast and Senegal, were allegedly given too little food – either rice or sandwiches that were rotting. They were said to be transported to vineyards crammed into the back of vans, standing up, with no seats or windows. Some told investigators they worked for 10 hours with only a 30-minute break and were threatened if they wanted to rest or drink water.

They are believed to have been hired from areas in northern Paris where refugees and undocumented people often sleep rough or in tents and were driven to the Champagne region with the promise of work.

The state prosecutor said the housing in the Champagne area included “worn and dirty sanitation facilities”, outdoor kitchen and living areas that were unprotected from the weather, and bedding strewn on the floor.

Two of the former workers told local French media that they still cried when thinking about the conditions they experienced. Maxime Cessieux, a lawyer for the workers, said the accused had “a total contempt” and disrespect for “human dignity”.

A lawyer for one of the accused employees told the Nouvel Obs he had only been involved in initial recruitment, and had had nothing to do with housing or work conditions.

The CGT trade union said there must be an end to exploitation of seasonal workers in vineyards.

In a sign that the case was being taken seriously by the industry, the Champagne Committee, which represents 16,200 winemakers, 130 cooperatives and 370 champagne houses, took part in the trial as a civil party – a first for legal proceedings concerning the living conditions of seasonal workers.

The committee is “firmly opposed to these unacceptable practices”, its director, Charles Goemaere, said in a statement in March.

A wine cooperative in the Marne was also on trial for moral responsibility in using illegal labour.

Every year, about 120,000 seasonal workers are brought into the Champagne region to handpick grapes grown across 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) and used to make the sparkling alcoholic drink.

But the plight of seasonal workers has sometimes cast a shadow over champagne's reputation. In 2023, four grape-pickers died, believed to have suffered sunstroke after working in scorching heat. During the 2018 champagne harvest, dozens of workers, including many from Afghanistan, were discovered housed in fetid conditions. Two members of a firm providing labour to the wine industry were found guilty of human trafficking and given prison sentences.

David Desgranges, vice-president of the Consortium Contre l'Esclavage Moderne (Committee Against Modern Slavery), told Agence France-Presse: “The public should be made aware of the extent of human trafficking in the agricultural sector, and producers should know that they may face legal action.”

Army chief's effusive welcome in Washington hints at strategic recalibration amid Middle East turmoil

After years in the diplomatic deep freeze, US-Pakistan ties appear to be quickly thawing, with Donald Trump's effusive welcome for Pakistan's army chief, Gen Asim Munir, signalling a possible major reset.

Pakistan's top-level access in Washington, including a White House lunch for Munir on Wednesday and meetings with top national security officials, has raised Indian eyebrows, especially amid sensitive trade negotiations with the US. India considers the Trump administration to be glossing over Pakistan's record on terrorism.

In a phone call with Trump on Tuesday, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, strongly rejected the US president's repeated claims that he had personally brokered peace in the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May.

The next day, while calling Modi a “fantastic man”, Trump described Munir as “extremely influential” in halting the brief but intense war. “I love Pakistan,” Trump said, before repeating: “I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”

In the phone call, Modi made it “absolutely clear”, said India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, that hostilities ceased only after Pakistan requested a ceasefire, and that no third-party mediation took place. “India has not accepted mediation in the past and never will,” Misri said.

Adding to the confusion, a White House press officer said Munir had been invited after suggesting Trump be nominated for the Nobel peace prize for ending the conflict, which followed a terror attack that killed 26 mainly Hindu holidaymakers in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Munir's red-carpet treatment in Washington and high praise from US Central Command hint at a strategic recalibration.

Gen Michael E Kurilla, the head of Central Command, recently called Pakistan a “phenomenal” counter-terrorism partner, citing Islamabad's role in helping to capture the alleged Islamic State Khorasan Province planner behind the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport, an attack that killed 13 US troops and more than 170 Afghan civilians.

Munir's five-day US tour includes meetings at the Pentagon, the state department, and Central Command headquarters in Florida. Such access is extraordinary for a Pakistani general. “Senior US officials often meet with Pakistani generals. But they don't get entertained at the White House,” noted Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based south Asia analyst. “Ayub Khan and Zia ul-Haq were exceptions but they came as heads of state.”

The shift in tone is stark. India has long positioned itself as the more reliable partner for the US as the world's largest democracy, a bulwark against China, and a hub for expanding trade and intelligence-sharing. Pakistan, by contrast, has been dogged by accusations of sheltering terrorists and undermining civilian rule.

Just a few years ago, Trump himself accused Pakistan of offering “nothing but lies and deceit”. Joe Biden later called it “one of the most dangerous nations in the world”.

Indian officials continue to point to Pakistan's links to major terror attacks, including on its parliament in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2008. Against that backdrop, Washington's embrace of Munir strikes a jarring note in Delhi, where critics say the US is engaging with the same military establishment long accused of enabling cross-border militancy.

Analysts say the pivot may be driven by more than just strategic cooperation. For Trump, it could be personal. “He has a thing for strongmen,” said one US analyst. “He sees something in Munir – the mystique, the military credentials, the aura of control. Trump responds to dominance, and Munir projects it.”

That may help to explain why Munir was granted access usually reserved for heads of state. “He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up,” Kugelman said. “Trump knows that in Pakistan it's the army chief who really runs the show.”

But Munir's visit is taking place as the Middle East is in turmoil, with Israel striking Iranian targets and Iran firing missiles in retaliation. The US may be hoping that Pakistan, one of the few countries with diplomatic ties to Tehran, could play a role in de-escalation.

There's also a more delicate calculation, with Israel pushing the US to join its military campaign against Iran, which shares a 900km border with Pakistan. That geography puts Islamabad in a pivotal position. Some analysts believe the US may be probing whether Munir would allow surveillance flights or logistical cooperation.

But Pakistan's room for manoeuvre is limited, with public opinion strongly pro-Iran. “Even privately, Pakistan's military would likely balk at the risks,” Kugelman said. “They can't afford to be dragged into this. The backlash would be enormous.”

For Indian officials, Munir's reception has revived old memories of the US tendency to tilt towards Pakistan at critical junctures, such as in the cold war moments or post-9/11. But this time, analysts say, the reset may also involve commercial opportunity.

Pakistan is actively courting US investment in two of the most volatile and potentially lucrative global commerce sectors: cryptocurrency and critical minerals. “The Trump-Munir meeting shouldn't be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war,” Kugelman said. “There's been US-Pakistan engagement on crypto, minerals and counter-terrorism, and Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these.”

He added: “This is classic Trump: ‘What can you do for me? What can I get out of this?'”

Signs have gone up at U.S. national parks telling visitors to report 'negative' information about America.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images

We are living through history. Right now, this week. We are being dragged, kicking and screaming, through it. They will study this period one day: Iran, Israel, Gaza, Ukraine, Russia. Donald Trump. 

Fortunately, there is a wealth of documentation about these matters, delivered daily (even if some accounts are more credible than others). But what happens when a country deliberately sets out to erase its history? The unpleasant bits, in particular. We saw this in 20th-century totalitarian regimes. And we are seeing it right now in the U.S. – another illustration of this weird and ugly chapter in American history.

Signs have gone up at U.S. national parks urging visitors to report plaques, brochures or other information (perhaps your park ranger's historical tour) “that are negative about either past or living Americans.” A QR code is supplied for your tattletaling convenience. 

This follows a government directive to the National Park Service (NPS) to remove or cover “all inappropriate content” that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times),” according to the New York Times, which reports that the NPS must do so by a Sept. 17 deadline. 

We're not just talking about hiking trails and sandy beaches. The NPS also encompasses monuments and historic sites, including the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington; the Stonewall monument in New York; the incarceration sites at Minidoka in Idaho and Manzanar in California, commemorating the forcible confinement of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War; and the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site in Colorado, the site of a 19th-century American slaughter of about 750 Indigenous people. 

These sites (and many others) are being instructed to fudge the history, tone it down, literally whitewash it.

“How do you talk about Martin Luther King without talking about racism?” asks Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), a nonpartisan advocacy group for the parks. Yes, but also, how do you talk about the United States, period, without talking about racism? Slavery, the Civil War, the civil rights movement, George Floyd, Black Lives Matter – the government can't just erase these historical pillars, or fiddle dee dee them away. You can't shove the facts of history aside, to be gone with the wind produced by the huffing and puffing of a tyrant. 

Five years after George Floyd's murder, U.S. sees sharp reversal in support for racial-equity efforts

The placement of these Orwellian signs follows Donald Trump's executive order “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” part of the President's crusade against wokeness. The new signs also encourage visitors to report any information that fails to “emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and abundance of landscapes and other natural features.” Be complimentary, or else.

Rather than rat out tour guides or wall plaques, visitors are being urged by the NPCA to use their voices to tell the government to stop meddling. And good news: The publication Government Executive reports that almost all of the nearly 200 submissions received in the first few days urged the government not to censor history. 

In Canada, we are learning the value of telling history accurately, in particular the history of Indigenous people. The Truth and Reconciliation process has been bumpy at times, sure, but it has exposed this country's real history to many Canadians (not just students) who simply didn't know about the harms of colonialism, including residential schools.

We are seeing this reflected in school curricula, at museums, on the calendar (we mark National Indigenous Peoples Day on Saturday) and, consequently, in the zeitgeist. That's how it works.

“If our country erases the darker chapters of our history, we will never learn from our mistakes,” said Ms. Pierno in a news release. Exactly.

What if they did this in, say, Germany – where monuments and museums tell the country's chilling Nazi history, along with tens of thousands of Stolpersteins (literally “stumbling stones”), small brass plates marking places from which people were deported? (Memorials that speak to the despicable actions of past governments of that period are also prominent in Hungary, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and France.)

Imagine if, in an effort by a hypothetical German government to avoid casting shade upon its history, those sites were watered down. What if Berlin's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe was renamed to play down the murder part? Any thinking person would be outraged – even much of the MAGA set, too. 

Picture Minidoka, currently billed as “An American Concentration Camp,” instead being described as “a unique visiting experience in the scenic Gem State, along the refreshing waters of Clover Creek with its fine fishing?” What an insult to the memory of all who suffered there. What a disservice to any visitor.

This move to sanitize historic sites is a testament to the idiocy of this U.S. administration – as history, one hopes, will show.

Brad Lander was manhandled and marched out of the courthouse after trying to shield a man from arrest – but, he tells the Guardian, he's not backing down

As the New York city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was hauled away by masked Ice agents on Tuesday, all he could think about was whether there was anything more he could do for the man he was trying to help, an immigrant New Yorker named Edgardo.

Both men ended up detained, but unlike Edgardo's, Lander's ordeal was over after a few hours. By the time the New York governor, Katy Hochul, marched him out of the courthouse – after proclaiming, of his arrest: “This is bullshit” – videos and photos of the officers manhandling him had gone viral. The arrest of yet another elected official prompted widespread condemnation of another sign of the US's steady slide into authoritarianism. A host of New York politicians, along with a swelling crowd of angry New Yorkers, awaited Lander outside the courthouse in downtown Manhattan. (Andrew Cuomo, the former governor and mayoral race frontrunner, was a notable absence, though he did condemn the arrest.)

“I wasn't surprised there were a lot of folks outside angry both about the violations of the rights of immigrants and about Trump's efforts to undermine democracy,” Lander told the Guardian in an interview.

“The Trump administration has been very clear that they are looking to stoke conflict, weaponize fear, and undermine democracy, and here they are doing it,” he added.

Lander was “just fine”, he told the crowd. He had lost a button in the commotion. But he would sleep in his bed and while no charges against him were filed, he would have had access to a lawyer if they had been. “But Edgardo will sleep in an Ice detention facility God knows where tonight,” he said. “He has been stripped of his due process rights in a country that is supposed to be founded on equal justice under law.”

A day after the ordeal, Lander said he had no updates on Edgardo, a Spanish-speaking immigrant whom Lander had met just before they were both detained. Lander had been accompanying Edgardo as part of an organized effort to shield immigrants from agents who have been increasingly stalking them for arrest when they appear for their regularly scheduled court hearings. On Tuesday, the group watching proceedings at the court included four rabbis, in addition to Lander, his wife Meg Barnette, and other advocates.

He's been showing up, he says, because people in the immigration court system are otherwise unprotected. “This is one of the rights violations of this system,” he said. “All these people in it with no lawyers and really no one, no advocates, no one looking out for them.”

With early voting well under way and election day less than a week away, the New York City mayoral race is heating up – and Wednesday's arrest has significantly raised the visibility of Lander, a well-respected, longtime New York politician who has nonetheless struggled to gain recognition in what is largely a race between Cuomo and the leftist Zohran Mamdani. (Mamdani rushed to the courthouse on Wednesday as soon as news of Lander's arrest broke.) Lander, who like Mamdani is pitching a progressive vision for a more affordable city, is also running on his years-long experience with city government and his bridge-building skills.

Lander is the third Democratic politician recently detained by Department of Homeland Security officials in connection with Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. In this distinction, he joins the California senator Alex Padilla, recently handcuffed and forcibly removed from a DHS press conference, and Newark's mayor, Ras Baraka, who was arrested while protesting outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey last month.

Lander sees in the targeting of outspoken Democratic politicians the fulfillment of the Trump administration's promise to “liberate” cities such as Los Angeles and New York. He said it was “strange” to find himself a casualty of the administration's crackdown.

“But unfortunately not that strange, as Trump has named New York City on the list of places where they are planning to both ratchet up immigration enforcement and put pressure on elected officials.”

In recent weeks Ice agents have been ordered to ramp up arrests, even without warrants. In a video of Lander's arrest, he is heard asking Ice agents multiple times for a warrant – which they do not produce – before telling them, as they place him in handcuffs, that they “don't have the authority to arrest US citizens asking for a judicial warrant”.

The Ice agents who arrested him knew he was an elected official, Lander said. He tried to learn more about them while he was detained. “I asked a few questions just to understand who they were,” he said. They were also immigrants – one a Pakistani Muslim resident of Brooklyn, the other an Indo-Guyanese man from Queens. “I asked about their shifts. I hear that Ice agents are working a lot of hours right now,” he said.

“Brad's arrest was shocking – not in the violence, not in the lawlessness, because we've seen this directed at immigrants and citizens profiled as immigrants – but in the decision from Ice to inflict that violence on a sitting elected citywide official,” said Sophie Ellman-Golan, an organizer with Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, of which Lander has been a member for decades. Along with JFREJ, he has been working with Immigrant Act, another advocacy group, in shifts to accompany immigrants to court hearings.

Lander has gained some momentum after challenging Cuomo during a recent mayoral debate and cross-endorsing fellow progressive Mamdani. But he consistently polled in third place in the race, well behind the other two.

Lander called out the current mayor – Eric Adams, who offered little sympathy – of having “sold out our city” through corruption.

He said Cuomo “made no effort whatsoever to reach out to most New Yorkers” and that he and Mamdani cross-endorsed one another “because we fundamentally agree that Andrew Cuomo is utterly unfit to be mayor of this city”. He cited Cuomo's hesitation when he was asked in a recent debate whether he had visited a mosque. “He has nothing to say to Muslim New Yorkers,” said Lander. “He is an abusive bully who doesn't even love New York City and is just in it for himself.”

While some of his supporters criticised him over the Mamdani endorsement – largely due to Mamdani's openly pro-Palestinian views – Lander said that there was “an enormous outpouring of goodwill for it”.

“It really did prompt a sense of, ‘Oh, politics could be not just about individuals looking out for themselves, but trying to build something broader that would build a more aspirational vision for the city, and help people come together around it.

“Obviously, I am putting my case out for why I will be the best mayor of New York City,” he said, citing recent endorsements as a sign his campaign is surging. But, he added, he also hoped to promote a politics “that's trying to bring people together across divides, and in this case, having one Jewish New Yorker and one Muslim New Yorker cross-endorse in that way offers a hopeful project”.

“Whoever wins, I intend to continue to pursue that hopeful politics.”

Customs and Border Protection agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” Alistair Kitchen said.

A leading press freedom advocate on Tuesday condemned the United States' “disturbing pattern” of screening and expelling international visitors for their political viewpoints following the detention and removal of an Australian journalist who criticized the Trump administration's targeting of Palestine defenders on college campuses.

Alistair Kitchen said he was detained for 12 hours and interrogated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in Los Angeles International Airport while en route from Melbourne, Australia to New York last week.

“I was denied entry, detained, and deported from the USA over the last 48 hours because of my reporting on the Columbia [University] student protests,” Kitchen wrote Friday on the social media site Bluesky. “I arrived back in Melbourne hours ago and had my phone handed back to me upon landing.”

“I had it easy,” he added, “one woman had been in that detention room four days when I arrived; she's still there.”

Kitchen said that CBP agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” and although he “had cleaned up my online presence expecting ad hoc digital sweeps,” he “was not prepared for their sophistication.”

“If you are deleting social media 48 hours before your flight to the U.S., it is already too late,” he stressed.

Kitchen wrote that the agents “just came out and said it: ‘We both know why you've been detained…it's because of what you wrote about the protests at Columbia,'” he recounted.

"Writers, artists, and scholars must be free to express their views openly without compromising their free movement across borders," said PEN America's @jonfreadom.bsky.social following detainment and deportation of Australian writer Alistair Kitchen for his personal writings pen.org/press-releas…

Responding to Kitchen's ordeal, Jonathan Friedman, managing director of the U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America, said in a statement Tuesday that “it is gravely concerning to read an account of someone being detained and turned away at the border due to their writings on student protests, Palestine, and the Trump administration.”

“Writers, artists, and scholars must be free to express their views openly without compromising their free movement across borders,” Friedman added. “Kitchen's account fits a disturbing pattern, in which border agents appear to be screening visitors to the U.S. for their viewpoints. That is anti-democratic, and it must be halted.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — which earlier this year issued its first-ever travel advisory for journalists entering the United States, including warnings about searches of electronic devices — called Kitchen's detention and expulsion “alarming.”

“Alistair Kitchen's deportation is a clear case of retaliation in connection with his reporting, and such action sends a chilling message to journalists that they must support the administration's narratives or face forms of retribution,” CPJ U.S., Canada, and Caribbean Program coordinator Katherine Jacobsen said Monday.

“Foreign media operating on U.S. soil are covered by First Amendment protections, and it is incumbent upon U.S. officials — from [CBP] to the White House — to allow journalists to do their jobs and travel freely without fear of reprisal,” Jacobsen added.

Kitchen suspects CBP agents used technology contracted from Palantir, which has been targeted by the No Tech for Apartheid movement over its involvement in Project Nimbus, a cloud computing collaboration between Israel's military and tech titans Amazon and Google criticized for enabling Israeli human rights crimes.

In March, Kitchen published a piece on his Kitchen Counter blog, titled “On the Deportation of Dissent.” The post highlighted the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and former Columbia University student and Palestine solidarity activist arrested on March 8 by plainclothes Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers in front of his pregnant wife in New York before being transferred to New Jersey and then to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in Louisiana, where he missed the birth of his son.

Khalil, who the Trump administration admits has committed no crime, is being held as a political prisoner under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which empowers the secretary of state to expel noncitizens whose presence in the United States is deemed detrimental to U.S. foreign policy interests. Numerous foreign nationals, including green-card holders, have been targeted under the law for criticizing Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza and U.S. complicity.

Kitchen wrote:

The goal here is the deportation of dissent. In an executive order 10 days ago, the Trump administration promised to “go on offense to enforce law and order” by “cancel[ing] the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” This is a mode of speech suppression that seeks to physically remove the undesirable elements it can, and, through fear, ensure silence in everyone else.

To my mind the arrest of a student on utterly specious grounds by a neo-fascist state, clearly designed to breed a climate of fear among students, calls for the resignation of a university president. That role is untenable so long as it does not involve the ferocious protection of student speech. The same goes for faculty, who last year demonstrated a mixed commitment to the defense of students. The situation requires their concerted action.

“The CBP explicitly said to me, the reason you have been detained is because of your writing on the Columbia student protests,” Kitchen told Guardian Australia on Sunday.

However, a DHS spokesperson denied Kitchen's assertion, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he was denied entry to the United States “because he gave false information” regarding alleged drug use on his Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application.

“Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from [vetting] measures, which are designed to protect our nation's security,” the spokesperson added. “However, those intending to enter the U.S. with fraudulent purposes or malicious intent are offered the following advice: Don't even try.”

Kitchen told Guardian Australia that he had previously indicated on an ESTA application that he had not done drugs, but admitted under interrogation that he legally purchased marijuana in New York state and partook while abroad.

“There's certainly not proof of me doing drugs on my phone,” he said. “But this is a method of interrogation that uses entrapment.”

Kitchen added that “in retrospect, I should have… accepted immediate deportation,” but that he was “too compliant, too trustful, too hopeful” at the start of his detention.

Free press advocates said Kitchen's detention and removal was yet another sign that “we are becoming a police state,” as well as a reason “to avoid the United States as a holiday destination like the bubonic plague,” and, as the hacktivist collective Anonymous called it, “a harsh lesson in digital footprints.”

A weekly look at some small-cap stocks making news - or about to. 

Canada's S&P/TSX Small Cap Index TXTW-I is up 22 per cent over the past 52 weeks. The index hit a record 915.92 on Wednesday. The Russell 2000 in the U.S. is up about 4 per cent over the past 52 weeks. 

Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB-T shares fell this week after the company said it expects “temporary declines” in some of its international markets in the current quarter.

Aurora told investors to expect continued strong global cannabis revenue in its current fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by improved performance in Canadian medical and consumer sales. But it cautioned that global performance would be an offsetting factor. 

“Taken together, global cannabis should be slightly lower compared to Q4 2025 and is expected to improve in later quarters due to increased distribution and further innovation,” it said in its earnings release.

In a call with analysts, CEO Miguel Martin said regulatory changes in Poland affected the ability of its patients to access prescriptions “and generally the size of the market,” adding that he expects that to be temporary. “We are excited about the long-term aspects of Poland coming back.“ 

He also said that Germany “continues to deliver at a high level, it is a growth market for us, not only growing overall, but also from a market share standpoint. And the U.K., which is the other key market of size in that part of the world is also growing.”

Before markets opened on Wednesday, the Edmonton-based cannabis producer reported revenue of $90.5-million for its 2025 fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with $67.4-million in the prior-year period. It said the increase was mainly due to 48-per-cent growth in our global medical cannabis business and 32-per-cent growth in its plant propagation business, slightly offset by lower quarterly revenue in our consumer cannabis business.

Its net loss narrowed to $17.2-million from $20.3-million in the year-ago quarter.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Bottomley, who has a “buy” and $12.50 target on the stock, said the results were generally in-line with his expectations “amid what we believe was a transformational year for the company as it continued to refocus efforts on international medical markets, which doubled [year over year] [fiscal] 2024 levels.”

Aurora also issued two releases after the earnings report, citing “misinformation” posted on the news website Investing.com related to MedLeaf Therapeutics and MediPharm. 

“Aurora has not entered into any such agreements, has had no discussions with MedLeaf Therapeutics or MediPharm GmbH with respect to any business combination transaction or strategic partnership, and has not made any statements or filed any information pertaining to any such transactions,” it stated, adding that the “erroneous articles posted on Investing.com state that they were generated ‘with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.”

Aurora said it's “launching an investigation into the genesis of these articles,” adding that it's “not in the possession of material non-public information.”

Both articles were removed from the Investing.com website by midday Thursday. 

In an e-mail statement to the Globe, an Investing.com spokesperson said the articles were published “due to a technical issue and were immediately removed upon receiving notice.” 

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $9.90 and a low of $4.95.

Other small caps making news this week:

Kraken Robotics Inc. PNG-X shares fell this week after the St. John's-based company announced a $100-million bought deal financing. 

After markets closed on Tuesday, Kraken said it has an agreement with Desjardins Capital Markets, as sole lead underwriter and bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, to buy 37.6 million common shares for $2.66 each. 

Kraken said it expects the net proceeds will be used to support its “transition into a scalable global prime contractor,” including boosting its ability to consider larger acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and European Union and to demonstrate a stronger balance sheet when bidding for larger governmental and commercial contracts.

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $3.07 and a low of 92 cents.

Diversified Royalty Corp. DIV-T shares hit their highest level since early 2023 this week after the company announced a 10-per-cent annual dividend increase. The company also announced the addition of its ninth royalty stream, Cheba Hut, a U.S.-based cannabis-themed sandwich franchise, for US$36-million. 

After markets closed on Tuesday, Diversified said it was able to fund the transaction without raising equity. Cheba Hut has 77 sub sandwich restaurants in the U.S.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Lee increased his target to $4.75 from $4.50 after the news, and maintained his “buy” rating.

“In our view, this transaction fits well into management's strategy of buying into growing brands and elevates the company's status to the U.S. franchisor market, which will be critical for sourcing further deals,” he wrote in a June 18 note. 

CIBC analyst Ty Collin increased his target to $3.20 from $3.10 and maintained his “neutral” (hold) rating after the announcement. 

“We view positively DIV's acquisition of Cheba Hut's royalty stream, which expands DIV's portfolio in the larger U.S. market, but on familiar terrain,” he wrote in a June 18 note. “The acquisition increases distributable cash flow per share by [about] 4 per cent while keeping leverage at a manageable level and facilitating an increase to the dividend.”

He noted management has been focusing much of its active search efforts in the U.S. market, “where lower familiarity with DIV and the royalty model in general have been hurdles to getting deals done. We believe each successful deal should help DIV gain traction there.”

The company also announced an annual dividend increase to 27.5 cents from 25 cents, effective July 1. 

Mr. Lee of Canaccord said the dividend increase reflects “the firm's confidence in its ability to balance growth and shareholder capital returns.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $3.14 and a low of $2.50.

SIR Royalty Income Fund SRV-UN-T units hit a 52-week high this week after the company reported higher revenue and adjusted profit for its third quarter ended May 4.

After markets closed on Tuesday, the trust behind restaurant brands such as Jack Astor's Bar and Grill and Scaddabush Italian Kitchen & Bar, said revenue from corporate restaurant operations increased by 4.5 per cent to $64.8-million, compared to $62-million for its third quarter of 2024. The increase reflects the impact of the five new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2024, the trust stated. Same-store sales declined by 1.4 per cent.

Adjusted net earnings of $2.5-million compared to $657,000 a year earlier. It said the increase was due mainly to a $2.9-million increase in earnings from corporate restaurant operations in the third quarter of 2025 compared to a year earlier.

In the past 52 weeks, the units have traded between a high of $13.90 and a low of $11.11.

Groupe Dynamite Inc. GRDG-T shares hit their highest level since going public last fall after the Montreal-based retailer reported a 20-per-cent jump in revenue and 13-per-cent growth in same-store sales for its first quarter ended May 3 – results that beat expectations.

Before markets opened on Tuesday, the retailer behind the Dynamite and Garage women's apparel brands, reported revenue of $226.7-million compared to $188.9-million in the year-ago quarter. The expectation was for revenue of $209.4-million.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 19.8 per cent to $66.8-million.

Net earnings came in at $27.3-million or 24 cents per share compared to $23.9-million or 22 cents a year earlier. The expectation was for 22 cents.

Cannacord Genuity analyst Luke Hannan increased his target to $33 from $33 after the earnings report, and maintained his “buy” rating. 

“We believe GRGD's Q1/F25 performance should go a long way to building credibility with investors and demonstrating the business is equipped to handle a macro backdrop featuring heightened trade uncertainty,” he wrote in a June 17 note. “The company's speed to market and capabilities when it comes to managing assortment architecture should mitigate the shock of any potential future increases in tariffs; further, the average price point of its offering allows its customers to enjoy ‘affordable indulgences' even during periods of softer consumer sentiment.”

National Bank Financial analyst Vishal Shreedhar increased his target to $25 from $23 and kept his “outperform” (buy) rating.

“We now view GRGD to be a top pick in our discretionary universe along with Dollarama,” Mr. Shreedhar said in a June 17 note. “Investment in GRGD is differentiated by strong financial metrics, with an EBITDA margin and ROIC [return on invested capital] that is amongst the highest in our apparel group.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $23.36 and a low of $10.35.

Reitmans (Canada) Ltd. RET-X reported lower revenue and same-store sales for its first quarter ended May 4 and a wider loss compared to the same quarter last year.

After markets closed on Tuesday, the retailer reported revenue fell 4 per cent to $158.9-million, “primarily due to severe winter weather in the month of February and economic uncertainty.” It said comparable same-store sales fell 4.5 per cent year over year.

Its net loss was $10-million or 20 cents per share compared to a loss of $1.5-million or 3 cents a year earlier. 

“Our disappointing financial results underscore the importance of implementing the five-year strategic plan we announced in April,” CEO Andrea Limbardi stated in a release. “This strategy is designed to drive long-term profitable growth and ultimately make our business more resilient.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $2.96 and a low of $1.80.

High Tide Inc. HITI-X reported higher revenue but swung to a loss for its second quarter ended April 30.

After markets closed on Monday, the Calgary-based cannabis company reported revenue of $137.8-million for the quarter compared to $124.3-million for the same period last year. The result was below expectations of $138.5-million.

Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1-million, which High Tide said represented the 21st consecutive positive quarter and compared to $10-million during the previous year. 

Its net loss of $2.8-million or 4 cents per share compared to net income of $171,000 or nil per share a year ago. The expectation was for a loss of 3 cents per share in the most recent quarter.

Ventum Capital Markets analyst Andrew Semple maintained his “buy” rating and $8.50 target after the earnings report. 

High Tide remains our highest conviction idea in Canadian cannabis," he wrote in a June 18 note. "It is one of the few cannabis companies in Canada to sustainably grow EBITDA, generate sustainable positive FCF [free cash flow], and maintain clear growth drivers ahead.“

Mr. Semple added there's potential for additional upside to his forecast, “as High Tide could potentially utilize its growing cash position to support accelerated growth and make acquisitions that would be accretive to its current valuation.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $5.08 and a low of $2.30.

Lightspeed Commerce Inc. LSPD-T announced this week that it reached an agreement in principle to resolve a proposed class action proceeding filed in Quebec. The amount of the settlement is about $8.09 million, the company stated.

After markets closed on Monday, the Montreal-based point-of-sale software provider said the settlement follows the recent dismissal of a parallel U.S. securities class action against the company, “where the court found the plaintiff's allegations to have no adequate legal basis.”

The company said the settlement remains subject to the approval of the Superior Court of Quebec and “purports to definitely settle and discharge all claims put forward on behalf of the proposed class members against the company and the other defendants.”

It also said that the settlement states that the company and the other settling defendants “admit no liability and deny all allegations of wrongdoing whatsoever.”

CEO and founder Dax Dasilva stated that resolving the class action can help Lightspeed focus on its transformation, “concentrating on the markets where we have a proven right to win–and delivering exceptional experiences to our customers worldwide.”

**

Ballard Power Systems BLDP-T announced this week that its president and CEO Randy MacEwen will step down on July 7 and will be replaced by Marty Neese. 

Mr. Neese has served on Ballard's board for the past 10 years and has been CEO of Verdagy, an electrolysis and green hydrogen company, for the past four years. Earlier in his career, he served as the chief operating officer of SunPower and Flex, the company stated.

**

Sprott Inc. SII-T, on behalf of the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U-UN-T announced a US$100-million bought-deal financing this week.

Before markets opened on Monday, the company said it had an agreement with Canaccord Genuity Corp to buy 5.8 million units of the trust for US$17.25 per unit. It said the net proceeds will be used by the trust to acquire physical uranium in the form of uranium oxide in concentrates and uranium hexaflouride and related fees and expenses.

Aimia Inc. AIM-T announced the resolution of a tax dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and anticipates a refund of approximately $27-million. The tax dispute relates to a 2013 income tax audit of Aimia's former subsidiary, Aeroplan Inc., the company said in a release before markets opened on Monday. 

Aimia said it expects to use the proceeds from the CRA refund to support its 2025-2026 normal course issuer bid and for general working capital purposes.

Following the sale of Aeroplan Inc. to Air Canada in January, 2019, Aimia said it agreed to indemnify Air Canada for pre-closing income tax liabilities and put $100-million from the sale proceeds into an escrow account. In 2019, Aimia said it remitted $32.9-million from the escrow account to the CRA and Revenu Québec after receiving a notice of reassessment for the 2013 tax audit. In July, 2020, the balance of the escrow account, $67.1-million, was released to Aimia.

Now that the CRA dispute is resolved, Aimia said it will seek recourse from Revenu Québec for the remaining $6-million portion of the 2013 tax audit. “Aimia anticipates that a similar resolution is likely,” it stated.

“Shots fired!” shouted Gen Michael Kurilla moments before charging towards the sound of gunfire to save two junior officers.

Weaving through the rubble-strewn alleyways of war-torn Mosul, Iraq, the then-lieutenant colonel was pursuing a group of terrorist suspects when three more shots rang out.

Taking bullets to the arm and both legs, one snapping his femur in half, he “performed a judo roll” and carried on firing his rifle, witnesses say. As the gunfire continued, he covered his troops and reeled off orders while bleeding on the concrete floor.

Nearly 20 years later, Gen Kurilla, who was awarded a Bronze Star for valour and now heads the US military Central Command (Centcom), is once again leading the fight in the Middle East – this time against Iran.

Known to be Israel's favourite general and nicknamed “The Gorilla”, Gen Kurilla is understood to have been given unusual levels of authority by Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, to determine the American response to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict.

The 59-year-old has apparently overruled other top Pentagon officials in managing the crisis and has had nearly all his requests approved for more weapons and air defences for the region, multiple sources told Politico and Axios.

More than six feet tall, the “jacked” (muscular) general certainly looks the part and is known for his abrasive approach. He was investigated by the army last year for allegedly shoving a military crew member, although the outcome is not clear.

According to one former official, his tough-guy persona and commanding physical presence give Gen Kurilla powerful influence over the US defence secretary.

“He's a big dude, he's jacked, he's exactly this ‘lethality' look [Donald Trump and Mr Hegseth are] going for,” the ex-official told Politico. “If the senior military guys come across as tough and war fighters, Hegseth is easily persuaded to their point of view.”

The general is said to have had more face time with the US president than most other generals, according to Politico.

Where Gen Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon policy chief, have repeatedly urged against overcommitting to the Middle East, Gen Kurilla is said to be pushing for a strong military response to Iran.

As the department of defence (DoD) moves aircraft carriers and a large formation of refuelling planes to the region and the president mulls over a direct military strike on Iran, there is speculation that Gen Kurilla is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

“Hegseth has sided with him time and again,” a diplomat told the website.

Hailed by Israeli news outlet Ynet as “the US general Israel doesn't want to strike Iran without”, Gen Kurilla is a long-time Iran hawk who is expected to retire from the military this summer.

A veteran of Panama, the Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Kurilla is seen as “one of Israel's staunchest allies in the American defence establishment”, according to Ynet, and has travelled to the country dozens of times since he first visited as a young officer in his 20s.

“He knows the type of every munition launched at Israel that night, and where each interceptor was positioned,” an Israeli official told the news outlet last year. “Wake him in the middle of the night, and he'd ace a pop quiz better than some of our own officers.”

According to The New York Times, the general had been open to US involvement in an Israeli strike plan to attack Iran earlier this spring, combining a bombing campaign with commando raids on nuclear sites, but was blocked by Mr Trump, who favoured a diplomatic approach.

“He has been pushing for war with Iran and away from diplomacy since before Trump took office in ways that run over civilian officials,” Justin Logan, director of foreign policy and defence studies at the Cato Institute, told Responsible Statecraft.

Since taking over as head of Centcom in 2022, Gen Kurilla has pursued a strategy of military integration with Israel and regional partners to deter Iranian aggression, known as “Kurilla's umbrella”.

The system has enabled US radar systems in the UAE and Qatar to aid Israeli defence and has included co-operation with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to Ynet.

Explaining his approach to a US House congressional committee in March, Gen Kurilla said that Iran had taken a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the region to its advantage”, which could be halted by a “deep partnership” between Israel, the US and the Gulf States.

He is also thought to have played an instrumental role in pushing for sustained attacks on Houthi Rebels in Yemen in March, according to the New York Times, details of which were later made public in the infamous Signal group chat leak.

The 30-day operation cost more than $1 billion and was widely viewed as an ineffective use of resources, yet it enabled Mr Trump to strike a deal to end the fighting.

Deployed to Israel in April, Gen Kurilla is said to have passed on the news to government officials there that the US would not endorse strikes on Iran to curb its uranium enrichment programme.

He also is said to have released a statement in which he reiterated the two nations' “ironclad military-to-military relationship”, The Jerusalem Post reported.

Gen Kurilla may have also played a decisive role in determining Israel's decision to pull the trigger on operation “Rising Lion” last Friday, when it launched a devastating series of precision air strikes on Iranian military sites and personnel.

Although Israel acquiesced to Mr Trump's demands in April to hold off attacking Iran, military sources told The Jerusalem Post at the time that they hoped to strike before Gen Kurilla stepped down in July, recognising him as a key ally.

“I think it's been reported, and you know, based on my experience with him, that he takes a fundamentally different view of the importance of the Middle East than a lot of other people in the administration,” Dan Caldwell, former adviser to Mr Hegseth, told the Breaking Points podcast on Monday.

He added: “And he also, I think, believes that a military campaign against Iran will not be as costly as others.”

With time running out before Iran produces an atomic bomb and with Gen Kurilla's retirement looming, it may well be that Israel saw its window of opportunity closing.

Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said: “Secretary Hegseth empowers all of his combatant commanders the same way – by decentralising command and harnessing their real-world expertise regarding the defence of their respective areas of responsibility.

“The entire DoD leadership team – from the chairman of the joint chiefs to the undersecretary of defence for policy – similarly provide courses of action and counsel to the secretary based on their expertise. The secretary then makes a decision and final recommendation to the president. This is how the Pentagon does, and should, function. Our senior leaders are in lockstep and will continue to work in unison to deliver on President Trump's national security agenda.”

Representatives for Gen Kurilla and the White House were contacted for comment.

            A new coronavirus variant is spreading in many parts of the world.
    


            The variant, NB.1.8.1, has been identified as the cause of Covid-19 resurgence in China and several other Asian countries. Experts in Europe are predicting a possible increase in cases there.
    


            A summer wave also could occur in the United States. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NB.1.8.1 already represents about one-third of new Covid-19 cases as of June 7. This is a significant increase from just a month before, when the new variant represented just 5% of new Covid-19 cases.
    


            Could another summer wave really occur? Do current vaccines still work, and if so, who should consider getting another dose now? And what precautions should people take to reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19?
    


            To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner.
    


Marijuana use dramatically increases risk of dying from heart attacks and stroke, large study finds



CNN: What should people know about the new variant?



Wen: The SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly mutating, and it's entirely expected that there will be new variants. The more opportunities the virus is given to spread, the more opportunities it has to mutate.
    


            Every time a new variant arises that appears to be outcompeting previous strains, it's important to ask three questions: Is it causing more severe disease, is it more contagious, and do existing vaccines still work against it?
    


            This new variant, NB.1.8.1, also called Nimbus, is a descendant of the Omicron strain. The World Health Organization has deemed the new strain a “variant under monitoring.” However, WHO also reports that surveillance data do not show that it has increased severity compared with previously circulating variants. Given that this strain is outcompeting previous variants, it's possible that it could be more contagious, but there is nothing to suggest that it is being spread differently compared with past variants.
    


            As for whether existing vaccines work against this variant, the answer is not known. WHO cites laboratory data showing that it could have some immune escape, which means it may be less responsive to the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection and suggesting a possible reduction in vaccine efficacy. At the same time, NB.1.8.1 is a close descendant of other strains against which the vaccines have efficacy.
    


            I expect there will be more data available in the coming weeks, as federal health officials will soon decide the formulation of this fall's updated Covid-19 vaccine. Knowing that NB.1.8.1 constitutes a growing proportion of cases, they will most likely try to ensure that the formulation has efficacy again this variant.
    


CNN: What are symptoms of N.B.1.8.1 infection?



Wen: The symptoms appear to be similar to infection with other variants. There is a large range of symptoms and severity. Some patients may have allergy-like symptoms, such as stuffy and runny nose. Others may have cold- or flulike symptoms, with fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache and muscle or body aches. Some people may develop cough and difficulty breathing. Some may have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
    


            While most people will recover, some could become severely ill and require hospitalization. Some individuals who contract Covid-19 may also develop the post-viral condition known as long Covid.
    


CNN: Could another summer wave really happen again?



Wen: Yes. It could be triggered by a new variant that's more contagious and that has some degree of immune escape. A wave also could occur simply because of declining population immunity. Some experts believe that the emergence of this new strain combined with less recent Covid-19 activity could start a wave in the next couple of months.
    


            What we have seen from several years of experience with Covid-19 is that infections tend to come in waves. A surge in cases leads to many people falling ill, then recovering and developing short-term immunity to infection. Infection rates decline for several months, then they begin to increase again.
    


Summer waves of Covid-19 have occurred over the past few years. It's certainly possible that the pattern repeats this year.
    


When kids use screens, parents worry about the wrong thing, new study suggests



CNN: Who should consider getting the vaccine now instead of waiting for the fall formulation?



Wen: This is a difficult question to answer because the landscape around Covid-19 vaccination has been changing. Just last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. These shots appear to still be accessible for children; for instance, the CDC's guidance now reads that children can get the shots after consulting with their health care provider. However, there are already reports of pregnant women having more difficulty obtaining these vaccines.
    


            This and other guidance could soon change, as Kennedy has reconstituted the panel of external experts who advise the CDC on vaccine recommendations, and this new panel could make different decisions during their upcoming meeting in late June. Another uncertainty is when a new round of vaccines will be made available.
    


            One way to approach this decision is to consider your risk of severe outcomes if you were to contract Covid-19. Those who are 65 and over or who have chronic underlying medical conditions should consider getting another dose of the vaccine now, if they are eligible. That way, they have additional protection in case there is a summer wave, since the existing vaccine probably retains some efficacy against the new variant. And they can still get another dose in the fall when the new formulation will presumably be released.
    


            As for those who are younger and generally healthy, some who have not yet received the 2024-25 formulation also may consider getting the vaccine now before guidelines change and they may no longer be eligible. People should discuss their specific medical situations with their primary care physician.
    


These dads lost everything, and then they found each other



CNN: What precautions should people consider to reduce their risk of contracting this variant?



Wen: The same precautions we've been discussing throughout the Covid-19 pandemic still apply. This is a respiratory virus that could be airborne, so be on guard, particularly in crowded indoor settings.
    


            People who are especially vulnerable to severe disease should try to avoid these settings. If they need to go into, say, a crowded train station, they should consider wearing a well-fitting N95 or equivalent mask.
    


            Those people visiting vulnerable individuals may wish to avoid higher-risk settings in the days before the visit to reduce the chance of spreading not only Covid-19 but also other respiratory illnesses.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has received an official invitation to attend the G20 summit in South Africa, Russian Ambassador-at-Large Marat Berdyev said in an interview with state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti on June 19.

South Africa is a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and a signatory to the Rome Statute, meaning it is obliged to arrest Putin if he enters the country.

The ICC issued a warrant for the Russian leader's arrest in March 2023 over the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

"Last week, we received an official invitation. This is an appeal from the head of state, the president of South Africa (Cyril Ramaphosa), to his colleagues," Berdyev said.

The summit is scheduled to take place in Johannesburg from Nov. 22 to 23. Berdyev noted that Russia's final decision on Putin's participation will be made closer to the date. In recent years, Russia has been represented at G20 summits by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Despite the warrant, South Africa continues to deepen political and military ties with Moscow. In 2023, the country conducted joint naval drills with Russia and China, and maintains its membership in the BRICS bloc alongside both nations.

In November 2024, Putin skipped the G20 summit in Brazil, another ICC member state, and sent Lavrov instead. Russia's G20 participation has continued uninterrupted despite its war against Ukraine.

In September 2024, Putin made a rare visit to Mongolia, which is also a signatory of the ICC, prompting criticism over the non-enforcement of the warrant.

Keir Starmer is weighing up whether to back the US and – as a lawyer – will be aware of the legal landscape

Middle East crisis – live updates

UK politics live – latest updates

As Keir Starmer considers whether Britain should support the US if Donald Trump decides to bomb Iran, the attorney general, Richard Hermer, has reportedly warned him that UK involvement could be illegal. The prime minister was an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war when he was a human rights lawyer in 2003 and will be well aware of the thorny legal issues around engagement in strikes against Iran.

British officials have repeatedly emphasised that the UK is not expected to deploy its military forces in any attack on Iran. Instead, a key issue would probably be whether to give permission for the US to fly B-2 stealth bombers from the Diego Garcia airbase in the Indian Ocean. Diego Garcia, which is the subject of a new 99-year lease agreement with Mauritius that leaves the UK in full operational control, is mainly used by the US. But the fact it is ultimately a British base means that Starmer would have to approve its use for an attack. RAF Akrotiri, Britain's base in southern Cyprus, is also a potential launch site for US aircraft. Any use of the base by US forces would require the green light from the British government.

The UN's founding charter outlines the principles governing the use of military force. There are three possible justifications: self-defence (which may include collective self-defence); exceptionally, to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe; and authorisation by the security council acting under chapter VII of the charter. In the case of the bombing of Iran, the justification given by Israel – and one that would presumably be offered by the US and any of its allies – would be self-defence under article 51 of the charter. Force may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack. It must be the only means of averting an attack and the force used must be proportionate.

The US has taken a broad view of “imminence” in cases of threats of terrorism or mass destruction in the past but it could prove difficult to argue that a US attack against Iran's nuclear programme or leadership would constitute an act of self-defence against an imminent armed attack on the US. The White House would probably argue that it was acting in collective defence of Israel. The strength of this argument would rest on whether Israel has acted in accordance with international law in attacking Iran in the first place and then whether the US use of force was limited to protecting Israeli civilians and US interests from an Iranian attack.

Israel says its goal is to damage Iran's nuclear programme and prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. This is a broad interpretation of self-defence and its legality would depend on stressing the imminence of a nuclear attack. Israel would need to argue that it was the last window of opportunity to stop such an outcome. In 1981, Ronald Reagan's administration backed a security council resolution that condemned Israel for launching an attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Baghdad. The resolution stated that “diplomatic means available to Israel had not been exhausted”. Comments from some Israeli politicians also throw doubt on the self-defence rationale. Israel Katz, the defence minister, said on Tuesday that the purpose of the campaign was “to remove threats to the state of Israel and undermine the ayatollahs' regime”.

There is no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have “knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act”, according to the UN. In 2021, John Healey, the defence secretary, asked in the Commons for clarification from the then Conservative government over the ground rules on the use of British bases by US forces. He was told that a proposed military operation would need to be accordance with UK law and the UK's interpretation of relevant international law. The UK's position on pre-emptive strikes is well known. In the lead-up to the Iraq war, the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, argued that international law permitted force only in self-defence where there was an actual or imminent attack and that “the development of [weapons of mass destruction] was not in itself sufficient to indicate such imminence”. Goldsmith argued only later that a UN resolution relating to Iraq made it a legal war. Writing in the Guardian at the time, Starmer, then a human rights lawyer, said article 51 might authorise a pre-emptive strike “in a nuclear world” but that any threat to the UK or its allies would have to be imminent and any force used in response to that threat would have to be proportionate. “The mere fact that Iraq has a capacity to attack at some unspecified time in the future is not enough,” Starmer wrote.

A constitutional amendment, passed overwhelmingly by voters, removed language that had long allowed involuntary servitude to continue in state prisons — a holdover from the 13th Amendment's infamous “exception clause.” The 13th Amendment, though widely celebrated at the time for abolishing most forms of slavery, still allows for involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime, and has remained the legal backbone for the vast system of prison labor in the U.S., where incarcerated people can be compelled to work under threat of punishment.

In Alabama, that legal framework is now gone. The new constitution is clear: slavery and involuntary servitude are banned in all forms, period.

And yet, the practice continues.

Incarcerated people in Alabama are still being forced to work, in part through “work release” programs where refusal can mean being sent to solitary confinement, transferred to more dangerous prisons, or denied parole. Some are punished not for choosing not to work, but for being unable to work — because of disability, injury, or chronic illness. In some cases, people are removed from work release without explanation, and when they seek to be reassigned or evaluated medically, they are told they are “noncompliant” or “refusing.” The punishment is the same.

It's against this backdrop that a group of incarcerated workers filed an ongoing federal lawsuit in December 2023, challenging Alabama's continued use of forced prison labor. Their claims go far beyond the state's constitutional ban on slavery. The lawsuit also invokes the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which prohibits labor obtained through coercion, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 — a Reconstruction-era statute designed to combat racially motivated abuses by government officials. The suit further alleges that Alabama's overly harsh and racist parole policies trap Black people in prisons for years beyond when they have proven ready for release, as part of a plan to keep large numbers of workers enrolled in forced, off-site work release. Together, the claims argue that Alabama's prison labor system is not only unconstitutional, but part of a broader pattern of racial discrimination, corruption, and systemic violence.

The plaintiffs allege they are “entrapped in a system of ‘convict leasing' in which incarcerated people are forced to work, subject to threats of physical violence, deprivation of bare necessities, and threat of extended imprisonment, for little or no money, to the significant benefit of the numerous government entities and private businesses that ‘employ' them.”

The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry.

The lead plaintiff, who goes by Kinetik Justice, has faced years of retaliation for creating the Free Alabama Movement, through which he encourages incarcerated people to strike and engage in other nonviolent refusal to work. In the complaint, Justice alleges that after helping organize a 2014 strike, he faced retaliation, including “years of solitary confinement, torture, taking away his personal and legal documents and records, beatings and transfers to prevent him from speaking about Alabama's forced labor system.”

Another plaintiff, Lakiera Walker, who was incarcerated from 2007 to 2023, alleges that for years she was forced to work long, daily hours of unpaid physical labor in the prison, under threat of solitary confinement. She subsequently conducted road work for the county, for which she was paid $2 per day. When a work supervisor demanded sex, Walker refused and reported him to the prison. In response, she alleges prison officials issued her a disciplinary offense for purportedly refusing to work and sent her back to unpaid work in the prison.

During the final years of her incarceration — including after the 2022 state constitutional amendment banned forced labor — Walker was sent on work release to off-site, private companies, including one where she regularly worked 12-hour shifts inside freezers without adequate work clothes. The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry. Once, when Walker was so ill she had to be carried to the healthcare unit, she says a prison job placement officer told her to “get up and go make us our 40%.”

Last year, the judge initially dismissed the case without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. But the early ruling made something else clear: the court has yet to grasp the full extent of what is happening inside Alabama's prisons — the coercion masked as corrections, the public-private partnerships that treat incarcerated bodies as profit centers, and the near-constant threat of physical violence used to enforce compliance.

The defendants include the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, top officials in the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, and several private corporations that profit from this labor. One of those companies is Bama Budweiser, a distributor operating under the Budweiser name.

In its March 2024 legal response to the allegations, Bama Budweiser does not meaningfully address the constitutional issue — whether Alabama's prison labor system violates the state's explicit ban on slavery. Instead, the company's brief resorts to a series of dehumanizing attacks and dangerous arguments that seek to delegitimize the plaintiffs themselves.

Anheuser-Busch can't have it both ways. If they stand for justice, they must say so. If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone.

The brief opens by arguing that the plaintiffs “never worked for Bama Budweiser,” and therefore the claims should be dismissed. This, of course, ignores that the company has contracted with ADOC to knowingly obtain and benefit from the labor of incarcerated workers. But Bama Budweiser's response then quickly shifts into something much darker. In one of the most inflammatory passages, the company writes:

“What we have, then, are two murderers, an attempted murderer, multiple violent felons, robbers, burglars, and drug dealers. And they come into this Court complaining about having to work for a beer distributor.”

This is not a legal defense. It's a moral judgment — one that seeks to strip incarcerated people of constitutional protection by appealing to public fear and disgust. The clear implication is that some people do not deserve rights. That their labor can be taken. That their bodily autonomy is irrelevant.

Elsewhere in the brief, Bama Budweiser points back to the previous version of the Alabama Constitution that provided an exception legalizing slavery for people in prison, which seems to suggest that the amendment — passed in 2022 by 76 percent of Alabama voters — banning slavery and involuntary servitude for all, without exception, should never have passed. They dismiss media reports of inhumane prison conditions as unreliable “hearsay,” and mock the idea that enforcing labor rules against incarcerated people might ever rise to the level of coercion.

All of this is done under the brand name of Budweiser — a company that, in recent years, has styled itself as a champion of inclusion and human dignity. Its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has released national advertisements promoting LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant narratives, and “American values.” They have called themselves proud allies of “marginalized communities.”

But in this brief, filed in a federal court in Alabama, a place where marginalized communities are plentiful, a distributor making use of the company's name is sending an unambiguous message: people in prison are not worthy of dignity. Not worthy of labor protections. Not worthy of constitutional enforcement.

The dissonance is staggering.

That's why I'm calling on Anheuser-Busch InBev to go on the record. If they believe, as they say, in human dignity and freedom, they must disavow this brief. They must state clearly whether they support the position their distributor has taken — that the constitutional ban on slavery does not apply to people behind bars.

Because silence here is not neutrality. It's complicity.

This isn't a theoretical debate. I've been incarcerated in Alabama since 2006, and I've spent years in solitary confinement — not for violence or escape, but for speaking out against forced labor. Since 2016, I've helped organize work strikes, exposed illegal retaliation, and insisted that every person behind these walls deserves the right to refuse labor without facing abuse.

That's not “insubordination.” That's autonomy. That's freedom. Those in prison have lost nearly everything, but under the U.S. Constitution we still have the right to say no to bodily abuse and exploitation. And the fact that such basic assertions of bodily integrity are met with punishment shows just how far this system has strayed from anything resembling rehabilitation.

People in prison are disciplined for refusing to work even when they are mentally or physically unable to perform the assigned task. There are men here with untreated injuries, degenerative conditions, serious mental illness — and still, refusal is met with sanctions. Write-ups. Lost parole dates. Transfers to higher-security prisons. Extended time in cages.

That is not a job. That is coercion. That is slavery — rebranded for the 21st century.

The question before the court is whether this system is legal under Alabama's new constitution. But the question before the public is even more urgent: will we allow companies to profit from forced labor, while branding it “corrections”? Will we let corporate lawyers rewrite the meaning of abolition from inside federal courtrooms?

Alabama voters already made their decision. They banned slavery. Now it's time for the courts — and the corporations — to honor that decision.

Anheuser-Busch can't have it both ways. If they stand for justice, they must say so. If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone.

The stakes could not be clearer. And neither could the line that's been crossed.

On Juneteenth, I draw strength from the rich history of Black communities' struggles for environmental justice.

As an environmental justice worker, I've developed a deep appreciation for Juneteenth as an opportunity to celebrate Black freedom struggles and their connection to diverse ecologies. Today, I can't help but reflect on the often overlooked yet rich and complex relationships enslaved people had with their local environments as landscapes that both enforced captivity and provided opportunities for liberation. The harrowing realities of enslaved people cultivating cash crops in brutal plantations were also filled with spaces where enslaved people developed intimate knowledge of local ecologies to survive, assert their humanity, and establish cultural practices. Enslaved people did this every day: from foraging for food and gardening to fortify their meager diets, to developing herbal medicinal knowledge, and creating spiritualities tied to their local ecologies. Thousands of enslaved people used this critical knowledge of the environment to brave the wilderness, run away, and self-emancipate.

This complex relationship to the environment did not stop after emancipation. Descendants of enslaved people continue to face challenges from the legacy of slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed, and this has lasting impacts on their relationship to the environment. Persistent inequality in access to safe and healthy environments, gaps in environmental services such as access to clean, treated water, and the disproportionate effects of environmental disasters and climate change continue to impact Black communities in the U.S. However, Black communities also continue to assert their connection to the environment through the movement of environmental justice, which has made substantial breakthroughs in the past few decades in its quest for a just and sustainable world.

Now, the vibrant environmental justice movement is facing mounting attacks as Republicans gut federal funding, weaken enforcement of environmental policies, and empower corporations to deepen existing environmental inequality. It has been devastating to experience such swift government repression from the Trump administration. But this Juneteenth, I'm remembering that our relationship with the environment has always been complex, enduring, and profound, and caring for the Earth is a Black tradition that can't be easily erased.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Juneteenth has its roots in Galveston, Texas, where some of the last enslaved people were emancipated with the arrival of Union troops on June 19, 1865. Though some African American communities in Texas and across the South celebrated Juneteenth for centuries, it became a federal holiday in 2021 under President Joe Biden, in response to demands for racial justice following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. I myself only began celebrating this holiday recently, and like millions of Americans, I take the day to commemorate the liberation of enslaved people and their legacy of resistance and resilience. It serves as a reminder of the long history of Black environmental culture that my work in environmental justice hopes to protect and uplift.

We can't fully understand the devastating impact of settler colonialism on the environment without also understanding its interconnectedness with the enslavement of Black people.

Enslaved people had very complicated relationships with the diverse American environments they were forcibly relocated to. This aspect of enslavement is often overlooked because it is painfully obvious, yet hard to pinpoint how these new environments fundamentally shaped enslaved people's lives. Europeans violently displaced Native Americans from their traditional homelands beginning in the 16th century, and sought to extract the resources of their new colonies. Africans forced into slavery came from across central and western Africa, hailing from diverse ecologies, from bustling coasts and lush rainforests, to sprawling deserts and arid regions. Enslaved Africans were then shipped across the Americas to work mainly on plantations where they cultivated cash crops like cotton, indigo, sugar cane, coffee, and rice under brutal work regimes, stripped of their dignity and humanity. These agricultural practices and labor regimes imposed by European settlers degraded Southern ecologies and reduced biodiversity while also murdering and maiming enslaved people and denying them their humanity. We can't fully understand the devastating impact of settler colonialism on the environment without also understanding its interconnectedness with the enslavement of Black people. This painful history of forced labor, exploitation, and violence to people and planet fundamentally shapes contemporary Black communities' relationship with their American ecologies.

Joshua Jenkins, a fellow Black environmentalist working in the environmental justice space, highlights the deep interconnected links between environmental injustice and U.S. slavery in his work. Jenkins is the Alabama and Mississippi field representative, and former civil rights fellow, at the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), where he advocates for national park protection in the Deep South while also highlighting the region's rich environmental and cultural history. When asked about the links between Juneteenth and environmental justice, he reflects on the fact that the enslaved people who were forced to work the land generated an incredible amount of wealth that became the bedrock for the American economy. He concluded that “this country itself was built on environmental injustice.”

This legacy of environmental racism would go on to shape generations of African Americans. After emancipation, millions of enslaved people were forced to “pay off debts” to former enslavers, and many elements of slavery's exploitative labor continued under a new system of sharecropping. In the few cases where African Americans were able to purchase land as farmers and businesspeople, the fear of racial violence loomed over these new opportunities. Threats of retaliation, lynching, and capricious white officials who would extort and steal land robbed Black communities of land stewardship, environmental knowledge, wealth, and their very homes for generations throughout the post-Reconstruction South. During the early 20th century, millions of African Americans migrated from the South to the North, West, and Midwest as refugees from racial violence, political repression, and economic disparity, leaving behind their rural backgrounds for cities. But racism continued to shape their relationship with the environment in these bustling cities. Black communities were zoned through housing discrimination into neighborhoods surrounded by higher levels of pollution from factories, sewage systems, and landfills, as well as undesirable lands that were vulnerable to natural disasters.

Recognizing these persistent disparities in environmental access, exposure to pollution, and loss of land on the heels of the civil rights movement, Black communities across the country worked initially independently to address local and statewide inequalities. An early environmental justice action took place in Warren County, North Carolina, between 1978 and 1982, when locals in a majority-Black community organized for over four years against the creation of a toxic landfill with cancer-causing PCBs. As these efforts gained national traction, environmental justice organizing sprang up in Chicago, led by Hazel M. Johnson with the People for Community Recovery; in New York City, with WE ACT for Environmental Justice; and in Houston, Texas, with Robert Bullard and Linda McKeever Bullard of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice. These efforts highlighted the disproportionate number of toxic landfills, polluting factories and industries, and the numerous health impacts on predominantly Black and Brown communities.

In 1991, these once-fragmented campaigns, organizing efforts, legal efforts, and the advocates behind them would come together in the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. The summit connected the hundreds of groups and communities across the nation working on environmental justice, as they found common ground. Peggy Shepard, one of the co-founders of New York-based environmental justice organization WE ACT, recalled that the summit “was the first time I really understood that there were hundreds of groups like mine working on similar issues around the country.” This summit transformed the path of the environmental justice movement as the term itself was formalized, and the attendees established the 17 guiding principles of the movement. “[I]f you look at those principles, you'll see that all of them are just totally relevant today,” Shepard said on the 30th anniversary of the summit in 2021. “They're important values that we all hold dear and an important roadmap for the future.”

The principles that shape environmental justice were developed through a coalition of diverse stakeholders with a vision of collective liberation. Unlike the mainstream environmental movement of its time (and oftentimes still today), intersectional environmental justice connected the dots across multiple forms of oppression. The crafters of the movement's principles understood that a just and healthy planet was also one with reproductive rights, Native sovereignty, workers' rights, and community participation as central facets of policy. A radical movement with a commitment towards justice, sustainability, and liberation was born.

Now, more than three decades later, that movement has grown and seen numerous victories. In 2022, Congress passed Joe Biden's climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which funneled billions to clean energy, green jobs, and environmental justice efforts. With federal programs like the Justice40 Initiative — which ensured that 40 percent of new climate funding, jobs, and investments would go to historically marginalized communities — things were looking up. Hundreds of organizations, local community groups, state and municipal governments, and advocates applied for grants, loans, and investments for new and exciting projects and to build climate-resilient infrastructure, create green jobs, invest in clean energy, and address persistent issues of pollution and ecological degradation. I was energized in my work as exciting opportunities for funding, collaboration, and advancing environmental justice principles quickly grew. As the country charted a path to address climate change, I was optimistic that Black, Brown, poor, and rural communities wouldn't be left behind this time.

However, this billion-dollar beacon of hope was quickly derailed as the Trump administration ascended and targeted funding for the environment by pausing the government funding disbursement. This recent shift has devastated the environmental justice movement. Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has been used to discredit programs, funding, and opportunities that addressed inequality, and has also hit the movement hard. The administration took particular issue with the few environmental justice guardrails in government that safeguarded against persistent inequality, with polluting industries disproportionately placed in communities of color and low-income communities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was central to enforcing environmental justice policies, saw significant staff cuts as well, which will undoubtedly hamper — and in some cases, halt — environmental justice work. Routes for remedying environmental injustices through programs like the EPA Superfund, for example, are at risk for cuts.

New funding allocated through the IRA, passed by Congress, has also been a hotbed issue. Organizations, states, local governments, and companies with government contracts were shocked to see contracts quickly revoked, funds frozen, and programs terminated, with threats of legal action from the government. Though a recent court ruling demands that the government resume funding, it is unclear when and how this will happen — if it happens at all. The impact of such hostile policies is devastating. We can “no longer rely on the federal government to support EJ [environmental justice] work. It's now a divisive topic,” Jenkins says. “So, funding has dried up and larger organizations are less willing to take EJ stances for fear of reprisal from the federal government.”

This harsh reality has had a chilling impact on my own work supporting young climate leaders from historically marginalized backgrounds. I've seen firsthand the bleak and uncertain reality of reluctant funders and companies laying off or firing employees. This year alone, I've witnessed a number of the partner organizations that I've worked with on youth programming and environmental justice issues tighten their belts because of smaller budgets, hiring freezes, or just anxiety around environmental justice being framed as a “partisan issue.” In my programs that link young people to green jobs, I've had to email dozens of applicants to let them know the positions that were advertised just last November are no longer available. And this is only the tip of the iceberg; organizations that were dependent on federal funding are preparing to furlough employees as they scurry to secure new funding sources or close down. Even as I work in an organization that doesn't rely on federal funding, the influx of organizations with new funding gaps makes the limited private funding available even more competitive as we all struggle to stay afloat.

However, even with these bleak circumstances, hope is certainly not lost. The environmental justice movement has managed to avoid being totally defanged. Although some diluted elements of environmental justice have only recently penetrated the mainstream environmental movement, for the most part, the movement retains much of its core radical vision for justice.

“This is a really good time for us to put our heads together and think really hard about the world we want to live in. Really hard, like the most aspirational reality we can think of. Afrofuturism levels of imagination,” says Jenkins. “And then we should organize and build coalitions that will help us realize that dream. If we're the forest, it feels like these times are a massive wildfire. It is destructive and it's hard to breathe right now, but we know some seeds can't even germinate unless they're subjected to the heat.”

As some major environmental organizations back away from their commitments and scrub their websites of environmental justice language, others stand firm and push forward. In this moment of adversity, I'm witnessing many environmental justice advocates, organizations, and communities clarify their vision and deepen their intersectional liberatory aspirations. Amid the U.S.'s descent into fascism, the interconnectedness of reproductive rights, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, and Black and Brown communities is clearer now than ever as right-wingers mount attacks on us all.

Juneteenth is an opportunity to contemplate and learn from the resilience and ingenuity of enslaved people who formed rich environmental relations. As this current Trump administration rolls back critical policies, climate funding, and enforcement of environmental protection, the environmental justice movement has our work cut out for us. This is the time for us to strengthen coalitions, build upon ambitious visions for liberation, and continue demanding a just and sustainable future.

Israel's strikes against Iran amount to US military action despite official denials from Washington, US Senator Ted Cruz has suggested. Tehran has accused America of complicity in Israel's attacks on its nuclear infrastructure.

Israel launched a series of attacks on Iran last Friday, targeting sites linked to its nuclear program and killing scientists and senior military officials. The Israeli authorities described the campaign as “preemptive,” claiming it was aimed at stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, defended the strikes and called for regime change in Tehran during a tense interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson this week.

”We are bombing the crap out of them. Israel is,” the lawmaker said.

”Right now, this tiny little country the size of the state of New Jersey is fighting our enemies for us and taking out their military leadership, and trying to take out their nuclear capacity,” he added. “That makes America much safer.”

Iran denies having a military component to its nuclear program and maintains that it does not seek nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it sees no evidence to support Israel's allegations. US intelligence agencies have offered similar assessments, though President Donald Trump has dismissed these conclusions.

Carlson confronted Cruz over his failure to recall basic facts about the Iranian population, including its size and composition, raising concerns about the senator's support for regime change.

Cruz pushed back, accusing Carlson of being overly skeptical about allegations that Iran had plotted to assassinate Trump – a claim brought up by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during an appearance on Fox News last week.

”You don't believe they are trying to murder Trump because you are not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation,” Carlson argued.

”We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz replied.

Carlson noted that it was Israel conducting the attacks, to which Cruz responded: “Right, with our help. I've said ‘we.' Israel is leading them, but we are supporting them.”

Carlson highlighted the significance of Cruz's comments, pointing out that they contradict statements made by National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer, who has denied US military involvement.

Cruz went on to say he hopes Iran's government will fall to a popular uprising – a scenario Israeli leaders have endorsed during the conflict. He added, however, that he would not support sending US troops to occupy the country.

TEHRAN, June 19. /TASS/. Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has reported a combined strike on Israel, which involved strategic missiles and drones and targeted a military command post and intelligence facility.

"The fourteenth phase of Operation True Promise 3 began with a combined strike involving kamikaze drones and strategic missiles. During the attack, a precision strike was launched at a command and reconnaissance center of the [Israeli] regime's army, located near a hospital," the report reads.

According to the IRGC, the Israeli military has evacuated its bases and "deployed its ineffective missile and air defense systems in city centers, using residential buildings as shields."

"We have already warned that the entire sky over the occupied territories has been left defenseless and that there are no more safe places [in Israel]," the IRGC added.

Iran's IRNA news agency reported earlier that the headquarters of the Israeli army's cyber command, the C4I Corps, and a military reconnaissance center in Gav-Yam came under Iranian missile strikes on Thursday morning. According to the outlet, "thousands of troops" were stationed at the site, tasked with handling intelligence data and conducting cyber operations. IRNA stated that the Gav-Yam reconnaissance center was situated near Soroka Hospital in the city of Be'er Sheva in southern Israel. The hospital felt the impact of the shock wave but did not suffer significant damage, as the military site had been struck with high accuracy, the agency noted.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Iran carried out a retaliatory attack in less than 24 hours. Israel and Iran exchanged strikes again in the following days. Both parties reported casualties and admitted damage to a number of facilities. Iran and Israel continue to exchange strikes. Russia has condemned Israel's actions and expressed readiness to act as a mediator in resolving the conflict.

Israeli defence minister acknowledges goal of war is to attack ‘symbols of the regime'. Plus, only two years left to meet 1.5C warming target

Good morning.

Israel's defence minister has said he ordered increased attacks on government targets in Iran to “undermine the regime”, while an Iranian missile evaded Israeli air defences to hit a hospital in the country's south.

Other missiles landed around Tel Aviv, injuring at least 40 people, as Israeli planes bombed a heavy-water reactor and returned to strike the Natanz nuclear complex. The comments from Israel Katz were the first time that regime change had officially been claimed as a goal of the seven-day-old war.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump said he had not decided whether to take his country into Israel's new war, as Iran's supreme leader said the US would face “irreparable damage” if it deployed its military to attack.

How is Israel's military strategy shifting? When Israel launched its first strikes, Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered a strategic operation targeting Iran's nuclear programme, although the Israeli prime minister has made no secret of his hopes that the government in Tehran would fall. After the initial focus on military and nuclear sites, Israel recently attacked targets with no links to the nuclear project, but which Katz described as “symbols of the regime”, including the state broadcaster.

What is the latest on the conflict? Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy-water reactor early on Thursday, Iranian state television reported. In Israel, Soroka hospital in Beersheba was hit by a ballistic missile, Israeli officials said, after Iran launched its latest wave of retaliatory airstrikes. Read our live blog here.

A Tennessee state law banning gender-affirming care for minors can stand, the supreme court has ruled, a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.

The case, United States v Skrmetti, was filed last year by three families of trans children and a provider of gender-affirming care. In oral arguments, the plaintiffs, as well as the US government, then helmed by Joe Biden, argued that Tennessee's law constituted sex-based discrimination and thus violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.

Under Tennessee's law, someone assigned female at birth could not be prescribed testosterone, but someone assigned male at birth could receive those drugs.

The ruling is part of wider pushback on trans rights. In recent years, the question of transgender children and their rights has consumed an outsized amount of rightwing political discourse. Since 2021, 26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, affecting nearly 40% of trans youth in the US. Twenty-six states have also outlawed trans kids from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.

The sole survivor of the Air India crash has helped carry his brother's flower-heaped coffin to a crematorium in the western Indian coastal town of Diu, days after the plane plummeted into the ground shortly after takeoff.

Mental health problems and economic hardship are widespread among survivors of the Maui wildfire as access to food, stable housing, work and healthcare remains a struggle for many, according to a study tracking 2,000 survivors.

Seven men in southern California have been charged in connection with what federal authorities are calling the “largest jewelry heist in US history,” after allegedly stealing approximately $100m worth of goods.

The planet's remaining carbon budget to meet the international target of 1.5C has just two years left at the current rate of emissions, scientists have warned, showing how deep into the climate crisis the world has fallen. The latest assessment found that emissions from 2025 onwards must be limited to 80bn tonnes of CO2. That is 80% lower than it was in 2020.

When residents in a small Swedish town discovered their drinking water contained extremely high levels of Pfas, they began blood testing. They had no idea what it would mean for their health and their children's future. For the long read, Marta Zaraska followed the story.

As the world's attention moves to Iran, what are Israeli forces doing in Gaza? The Guardian's chief Middle East correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, tells Nosheen Iqbal that the killings in Gaza have by no means stopped.

The youth activists who put the Green New Deal on the political map are launching a campaign to “villainize big oil” which will push for the industry to pay for climate action so the costs do not fall on ordinary people. “[Donald Trump] takes his orders from big oil billionaires like the ones who funded his campaign,” said Stevie O'Hanlon, the co-founder and communications director of the Sunrise Movement.

After two years, Michigan wildlife experts finally were able to trap a black bear and remove a large lid that was stuck around his necks. “It's pretty incredible that the bear survived and was able to feed itself,” Cody Norton, a state bear specialist, said. “The neck was scarred and missing hair, but the bear was in much better condition than we expected it to be.”

A senior Russian official on June 19 inadvertently confirmed the staggering troop losses incurred by Moscow's forces during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In an interview with CNN, Russian Ambassador to the U.K. Andrey Kelin was asked about Moscow's maximalist intentions in Ukraine and its ability to recruit enough soldiers to fulfill them.

Despite ongoing U.S.-led peace efforts, Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraws from the four partially occupied regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia — as a precondition for negotiations.

Meanwhile, according to figures from Kyiv, Russia has suffered more than 1 million dead, wounded, and missing soldiers since the start of its full-scale invasion.

Kelin dismissed the 1 million casualties figure but did confirm that "about 600,000" Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, a number which tallies with Ukrainian estimates from January.

The number is actually lower than the 700,000 (Russian President Vladimir) Putin claimed in June 2024, and the 617,000 he claimed in December 2023.

Kelin was then asked about Russian army recruitment.

"I'm not a specialist in this area, but as I understand it we have 50-60,000 a month, those volunteers who are coming, recruiting, posting, and they would like to get engaged in this thing (in Ukraine)," he replied.

He did not explain why the size of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine has gone down despite what would amount to around 250,000 extra troops being recruited and sent to the front since the beginning of the year.

According to figures from Ukraine's General Staff, Russia has lost 217,440 troops since Jan. 1, 2025.

The discrepancy tallies with Western analysis of Russia's staggering losses. 

"They lose somewhere in the ballpark of 35,000 to 45,000 people per month, and perhaps they recruit a little bit north of that number," George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.

Given that Russia is having to pay people to sign up, the losses have potentially huge ramifications for the country's economy.

According to an analysis by economist Janis Kluge, Russia's daily bill just for sign-up bonuses is $24 million.

The ballooning bills come at a time when Russia's economy is already under huge strain from Western sanctions and falling oil and gas revenues.

"The implications for Russia are grave," energy security analyst Wojciech Jakobik wrote in an op-ed for the Kyiv Independent this week.

According to Barros, making any predictions about whether or not the Russian economy is going to collapse is "supremely difficult to do," but the signs for the Kremlin "don't bode well."

"If you look at the current Russian economic indicators, for example their inflation rate, their overnight lending interest rates, Russian monetary constraints… government spending is out of control — it's a very loose fiscal policy and so the economy is at risk of overheating," he said.

"I don't know to what extent the economy can continue to last."

Kelin also said Ukraine must accept Moscow's terms for ending the war or face further military advances and eventual "surrender" — you can read the full story here.

            Aboard Air Force One late Monday night, having hastily left the G7 meeting in Canada, President Donald Trump took questions from reporters about the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. In the back and forth, Trump was asked about Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress in March that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon — a direct contradiction of Israel's claims that Iran was racing toward a bomb.
    


            “I don't care what she said,” Trump replied. “I think they were very close to having it.”
    


            Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence official set off a firestorm among the MAGA faithful on right-wing media, long divided over the issue of Iran. It also raised serious questions about Gabbard's standing in the administration.
    


            Just a month ago, White House officials insisted that the president not only liked Gabbard but enjoyed her company.  Even as some in the administration believed that she was out of her depth, officials insisted that Trump and his team were giving Gabbard leeway to learn the ropes of her new job.
    


            But that tone has shifted, as multiple people inside the West Wing have grown disillusioned with Gabbard's performance, sources say.
    


            Though she's been among the most visible voices for the president's national security policy, behind the scenes Gabbard has struggled to carve out her own place in the Trump White House. Recently, Trump has come to see her as “off message” when it comes to the conflict in the Middle East, according to one senior White House adviser.
    


            Trump's annoyance with Gabbard peaked earlier this month, this person said, when she posted a 3-minute video warning that the world is “closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” and blaming “political elite and warmongers” for stoking “fear and tensions between nuclear powers.”
    


            Trump viewed the video as a thinly veiled criticism of his consideration to allow Israel to strike Iran, and many inside the White House agreed Gabbard was speaking out of turn, the person added.
    


            “When the president thinks you are off message, he doesn't want you in the room,” the senior White House adviser said.
    


            On Tuesday, the White House and Gabbard both sought to downplay the moment from Air Force One. Gabbard told reporters that she and the president were on “the same page” on Iran, and the White House rapid response team shared a post on X documenting her comments.
    


            An ODNI official called the president and Gabbard's statements on Iran “congruent,” noting “just because Iran is not building a nuclear weapon right now, doesn't mean they aren't ‘very close' as President Trump said.”
    


            “This is just a lazy regurgitation of a fake news story that BOTH the White House and Vice President have already debunked,” Office of the Director of National Intelligence Press Secretary Olivia Coleman said in a statement. “The Director remains focused on her mission: providing accurate and actionable intelligence to the President, cleaning up the Deep State, and keeping the American people safe, secure, and free.”

            Gabbard is among the newer members of Trump's orbit. A former Democratic congresswoman who forged common cause with the MAGA coalition in part because of its anti-interventionist posture, Gabbard was a frequent critic of Trump during his first term. She attacked him for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and even accused him of “an act of war” against Iran over his decision to kill a top Iranian general in 2020.
    


            Now, in near-weekly appearances on conservative cable news and in her regular social media feed, Gabbard exudes an image of the perfect MAGA warrior — physically fit, focused on weeding out “deep state” haters and absolutely loyal to Trump.
    


            But in the White House, some Trump officials have begun to question whether she has fully grasped what the job of DNI actually entails, with its oversight of the government's sprawling intelligence community, two administration officials told CNN.
    


            “It's an enormous job,” one administration official told CNN. “She is still very much learning the ropes — and all the various areas that DNI touches.”
    


            Two days before she posted her nuclear war video, Gabbard was absent from a last-minute Camp David gathering of Trump's top national security officials to discuss Israel's plans to attack Iran. Among those present were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.
    


            Gabbard was on National Guard duty, according to an administration official, who said that the meeting had originally not been slated to address foreign policy. But one person familiar with the session said she wasn't invited because officials didn't feel her presence was required.
    


            Gabbard was back in the White House the Monday after the Camp David meeting, an administration official said. And this week, the White House deliberately moved a meeting to accommodate her schedule, said one official familiar with the episode.
    


            “If they wanted her excluded, that's not what you do,” that person said. An ODNI official said that Gabbard has been at every Situation Room meeting since the conflict between Israel and Iran began last week.
    


            Gabbard maintains allies in the White House, in particular Vice President JD Vance, who issued a statement Tuesday calling her “an essential member” of the team.
    


            When asked if Gabbard was in danger of getting fired, one senior White House official said that the president was hesitant to fire anyone, given the optics.
    


            “He's not interested in firing her at this moment because she's not doing any harm,” the official said. “I think he's questioning her viewpoint as a value, especially after that video.”
    


            Since taking office in February, Gabbard has been fighting to clear a path inside the thorny bureaucracy of the intelligence community. An ODNI official claimed to CNN that Gabbard has identified savings totaling approximately $150 million in contracts, including roughly $20 million by cutting diversity programs and roles.
    


            The job is a tall order for anyone: The DNI has a notoriously fuzzy mandate.
    


            Created after 9/11 to facilitate information sharing and coordination across the now-18 agencies that make up the intelligence community, the office lacks budgetary and operational authority over the CIA and the other agencies it nominally oversees. Past directors have struggled to define its role in the US government, and Trump officials have considered disbanding it entirely in both his first and second terms.
    


            Gabbard has sought to wrest control of the President's Daily Brief from the CIA. The powerful document has long been under the authority of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, but it was produced at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
    


            Now, Gabbard has directed the document to be put together at ODNI, located a few miles down the beltway from CIA, as part of what an official said was a streamlining effort designed to get vital intelligence in Gabbard's hands faster.
    


            In a job that is explicitly supposed to be apolitical, Gabbard has been overt in her public focus on Trump's political objectives.

            She launched a high-profile effort called the Director's Initiatives Group designed to look into political priorities of the president, including what the administration has deemed the “weaponization” of the US intelligence community under the Biden administration. She's also fired top career officials she accused of leaking and participating in an office chat group devoted to trans support issues.
    


            Gabbard declassified documents about domestic terrorism in an effort to show the Biden administration targeted its political opponents, revoked security clearances for former intelligence officials critical of Trump, and made referrals to the Justice Department for criminal leak investigations.
    


            She also called for former FBI Director James Comey to be jailed after he posted an image of seashells that read “86 47” — a matter of domestic law enforcement, which the ODNI, as a foreign intelligence-focused organization, is not traditionally supposed to be involved in.
    


            Gabbard and her allies say she is working to restore trust in the US intelligence community by purging it of “rot” that she says “runs deep.”
    


            But inside the organization she leads, some career officials say Gabbard appears more focused on the image of leadership than actually leading. Like several others in the Trump administration, Gabbard has embraced an online persona that at times has more in common with a fitness influencer than the nation's spy chief. Her Instagram is punctuated with stylized photos of her working out. In one post in early May, she answered a comment from a follower who wanted to know what workout shoes she was wearing.
    


            There's also the sheer breadth of her media appearances. Gabbard is a regular guest on Fox News. On one occasion in late May, she appeared on the network for nearly half an hour.
    


            Multiple career officials who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said it's not clear to the rank-and-file what Gabbard is doing day-to-day beyond posting to social media and trying to root out intelligence officials she believes have become “politicized.” Her husband, a videographer named Abraham Williams, has appeared on campus and has been known to film Gabbard for her personal social media, according to two sources familiar with the pattern.
    


            Gabbard has surrounded herself with a small, insulated team that has largely cut senior career officials with experience running the agency out of the loop, sources familiar with the dynamic said. That has created a very small circle of people who have insight into her day-to-day running of the intelligence community.
    


            It's all made Gabbard somewhat of a Rorschach test: to her supporters, she's a MAGA warrior tackling entrenched corruption; to her opponents, she's a naive crusader, warping the ideal of apolitical intelligence in her zeal to support the president.
    


            Democrats say, far from depoliticizing the intelligence community, Gabbard is doing the opposite — wielding the office for Trump's own political advantage. By involving herself so directly in the politics of his administration, Gabbard risks compromising the objectivity and integrity of the intelligence analysis that national security leaders rely on to make decisions.
    


            The top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees last week sent a letter to Gabbard demanding information on her decision to fire the top lawyer to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and place a “senior advisor” in an office that is, under statute, supposed to conduct independent oversight of the intelligence community.
    


            And the firing of the top two officials on the National Intelligence Council — the senior most analytical group in the intelligence community, whose job it is to understand and assess the biggest threats facing the United States — has also drawn fierce scrutiny from Democrats and former intelligence officials.
    


            In April, one of Gabbard's top advisers, Joe Kent, demanded that the NIC “update” an assessment that undercut the president's rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations — an interference that former intelligence officials and Democratic members of Congress say was a disturbing example of a political leader inappropriately politicizing intelligence conclusions.
    


            “She believes she was hired to do the political aspect of this job,” one source close to Gabbard told CNN.

KANANASKIS, Canada — The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Summit ended on June 17 with no joint statement in support of Ukraine, no commitments to provide desperately needed U.S. weapons, and no meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Ukrainian delegation headed into the summit, held in the remote community of Kananaskis, Canada, with an air of cautious optimism and hopes of winning renewed international support.

Instead, Trump left, Russia slammed Kyiv with ballistic missiles, and optimism quickly turned to anxiety.

As Zelensky arrived in Kananaskis on June 17, Moscow hit Kyiv with one of the largest Russian attacks on the capital since the start of the war — a brutal strike that killed 28 people and injured 134.

Zelensky, who learned of the attack en route to Canada, hoped to once again rally world leaders around Ukraine's defense and convince them to mount pressure on Russia in light of the relentless attacks on civilians. But Trump — the man with the most power to impact the course of the war and prospects for peace — met the moment with indifference. 

Trump departed the summit just hours ahead of Zelensky's arrival, saying he was leaving to tend to a different conflict: "I have to be back (to the White House) as soon as I can ... because of what's going on in the Middle East," Trump told reporters, referring the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. "I have to be back early for obvious reasons," Trump said, without further elaborating.

Trump was expected to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the G7 summit on June 17, marking their third in-person meeting since the American president took office in January. After his sudden exit, the Ukrainian delegation was left with the impression that Trump had brushed off their concerns. 

While Kyiv managed to make progress and maintain unity among remaining world leaders at the summit, the bleak state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations casts a shadow over these gains. Zelensky left the summit early, with even more uncertainty about how Ukraine can win the war in the face of dwindling U.S. support.

After a disastrous first in-person meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office in February — during which Trump and Vice President JD Vance lambasted the Ukrainian president over what they described as "a lack of gratitude for U.S. support" — a second meeting in the Vatican helped smooth over tensions between the two leaders. 

Zelensky praised his brief but "most substantive" conversation with Trump following the funeral of Pope Francis in early May. 

"With all due respect to our teams, the one-on-one format, in my opinion, worked. We had the right atmosphere for the conversation," Zelensky said after the talk.

At the G7 summit, the Ukrainian delegation hoped to convince Trump to exert additional economic pressure on Moscow through sanctions — which the U.S. president has not followed through on implementing — during a third in-person meeting with Zelensky. 

Trump's exit put those hopes on hold and cost Ukraine an opportunity to improve relations with the White House. Sources familiar with the situation told the Kyiv Independent that there was resounding disappointment within the president's circle. 

Zelensky ended up leaving the summit early too, canceling a planned press conference and additional events in Calgary in the wake of the Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and changes to the G7 agenda.

"What is there (for Zelensky) to say?" a source familiar with the logistics of Zelensky's canceled press conference said following Trump's early departure.

Kyiv's hopes of winning over Washington have run up against Trump's indifference to a Ukrainian victory and his sympathies with the Kremlin. One expert told the Kyiv Independent that Trump "does not share (the) commitment" that other Western allies do to help put an end to the war.

"Trump seems to be walking away from an attempt to reach a ceasefire in the war, and is focused on the Israel-Iran conflict and U.S. domestic politics," said Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.

"Of course, Trump is unpredictable and could change his mind (about providing support for Ukraine), but it seems pretty clear that, for whatever reason, he sympathizes with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin," Taylor said. 

"It looks like President Trump is walking away from his erratic and half-hearted efforts to make a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine War."

Trump's lack of commitment has Ukraine questioning the value of participating in the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague. Zelensky is reconsidering his attendance at the June 24-25 summit amid questions over Trump's participation, the Guardian reported on June 17, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials.

One official told the Guardian that Ukraine is in a "permanent hazard" of becoming a victim of "Trump's short attention span," adding that Russia has exploited this uncertainty by fresh aerial attacks. The source said there had been "all sorts of promises for this summit," including U.S. arms.

Despite Trump's abrupt departure, Zelensky did come out of meetings with other world leaders with some positive results as well as additional support for Ukraine.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the host of the summit, announced a sweeping new support package for Ukraine during a bilateral meeting with Zelensky. The measures include two billion Canadian dollars ($1.5 billion) in military funding and new sanctions aimed at restricting Russia's energy revenues and evasion tactics.

"To be absolutely clear, this support will be unwavering until we get a just peace for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people," Carney said ahead of the bilateral, attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Additionally, the United Kingdom imposed new restrictions on Russia on June 17, adding 20 vessels from Russia's so-called "shadow fleet" and 10 individuals and entities to its sanctions list. Australia also joined the U.K. in targeting 60 vessels — its first-ever sanctions against the shadow fleet. 

Zelensky said he had told the G7 leaders that "diplomacy is now in a state of crisis" and urged allies to press Trump "to use his real influence" to force an end to the war.

Trump has not been very responsive to such appeals. During a G7 dinner discussion where world leaders reportedly attempted to convince Trump to impose tougher sanctions against Russia, Trump insisted sanctions were too costly for the U.S., according to Bloomberg.

The New York Times reported in May that Trump opposes sanctions because they may jeopardize future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

While Zelensky pushes for the support and sympathy of Western leaders, the U.S. pushes back — often with disappointing results for Ukraine. Canada reportedly dropped plans for the G7 to issue a joint statement on the war in Ukraine after the U.S. insisted on weakening the language. Instead of a unified call to action, Canada's Carney released a Chair's Summary on the event.

"I think the possibility of additional pressure on Russia from the United States, in the form of tougher sanctions and further military assistance for Ukraine, are low," Taylor said. "The good news for Ukraine from the G7 Summit is that the other six members of the G7 remain firmly behind Ukraine."

Ukraine's military has warned that Russian forces have intensified operations across the front line amid a renewed summer offensive — meaning Ukraine desperately needs external forces to exert economic pressure on Russia's war machine. 

"The key questions now are, first, will the U.S. Congress try to force Trump into further sanctions and, second, how much can Europe make up for the absence of U.S. support?" Taylor told the Kyiv Independent.

A U.S. sanctions bill, jointly introduced on April 1 by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials. The bill aims to tighten economic pressure and discourage third-party nations from enabling the Kremlin's energy profits.

Despite broad support for these efforts from his own party, Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to postpone a vote on the bill, according to Senator Roger Wicker. Semafor reported on June 17 that the bill has been further delayed until at least July as Congress grapples with domestic legislation as well as the conflict in the Middle East. 

While the European Union insists that its commitment to Ukraine remains unwavering, the bloc is also vulnerable to U.S. pressure and internal disagreements. 

In its 18th package of sanctions against Russia, the EU proposed lowering the oil price cap from $60 to $45 a barrel. While leaders were reportedly prepared to champion the proposal even without support from the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen appeared to walk back the price drop during the G7 summit.

"In the last days, we have seen the price has risen so the oil price cap does serve its function," von der Leyen said. "At the moment, there's little pressure on lowering the oil price cap."

EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, however, urged the EU to press forward with lowering the cap on Russian oil, even without U.S. support, warning that Middle East tensions could otherwise drive prices up and boost Russia's revenues.

The EU also requires unanimous support on punitive measures related to Russia, giving Ukraine-skeptic leaders in Slovakia and Hungary an opportunity to obstruct and delay the approval process. 

Prospects for peace in Ukraine will likely be determined by the amount of economic strain exerted on Russia. Kyiv now faces tough decisions as to how to publicly court support from Trump without relying too heavily on Washington's global leadership.

Kyiv may soon be forced to put all its efforts into winning more European support, becoming reliant on allies with more limited capabilities.

Israel's Defence Minister threatened Iran's Supreme Leader on Thursday after Iranian missiles crashed into a major hospital in southern Israel and hit residential buildings near Tel Aviv, wounding at least 240 people. As rescuers wheeled patients out of the smouldering hospital, Israeli warplanes launched their latest attack on the country's nuclear program.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz blamed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for Thursday's barrage and said the military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”

While it remained unclear whether U.S. President Donald Trump would task American forces to join Israel's sweeping campaign against Iran's military and nuclear program, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he trusted that Trump would “do what's best for America.”

“I can tell you that they're already helping a lot,” Netanyahu said from the rubble and shattered glass around the Soroka Medical Center in Israel's southern city of Beersheba.

U.S. officials said this week that President Donald Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei. Trump later said there were no plans to kill him “at least not for now.”

On Thursday morning, several Iranian missiles struck populated areas in Israel, including a hospital in the southern part of the country, according to an Israeli military official.

The U.S. has been weighing whether to join Israel's attack by striking Iran's well-defended Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and widely considered to be out of reach of all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs.

The conflict began last Friday with a surprise wave of Israeli air strikes targeting nuclear and military sites, senior officers and nuclear scientists. At least 639 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 1,300 wounded, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group.

Iran has retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles and drones, killing at least 24 people in Israel and wounding hundreds.

At least 240 people were wounded by the latest Iranian attack on Israel, among them 80 wounded in the strike on the Soroka Medical Center. The vast majority were lightly wounded, as much of the hospital building had been evacuated in recent days.

Israel's Home Front Command said that one of the Iranian ballistic missiles fired Thursday morning had been rigged with fragmenting cluster munitions. Rather than a conventional warhead, the missile carries dozens of submunitions that can explode on impact, showering small bomblets around a large geographic area and posing major safety risks on the ground.

The Israeli military did not say where the missile with the cluster munition warhead had been fired.

Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard insisted that it had not sought to strike the hospital and claimed the attack hit an Israeli military intelligence compound near the Gav-Yam Negev advanced technologies park, some three kilometres from the hospital. An elite technological unit of the Israeli military has a branch campus in the area, according to the tech park's website.

The Israeli army did not respond to a request for comment. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, acknowledged that there was no specific intelligence that Iran had planned to target the hospital.

Many hospitals in Israel, including Soroka, had activated emergency plans in the past week. They converted underground parking garages to wards and moved patients to them, especially those on ventilators or are difficult to move quickly.

Israel also has a fortified, subterranean blood bank that kicked into action after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.

Doctors at Soroka Medical Center said that the Iranian missile struck almost immediately after air raid sirens went off, causing a loud explosion that could be heard from a safe room. The strike inflicted the greatest damage on an old surgery building and affected key infrastructure, including gas, water and air-conditioning systems, the medical centre said.

The hospital, which provides services to around 1 million residents of Israel's south, had been caring for 700 patients at the time of the attack. Of the 80 lightly wounded in the strike, half were hospital staff, it said. Afterward, the hospital closed to all patients except for life-threatening cases.

Iran has fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, though most have been shot down by Israel's multitiered air defences.

The head of Russia's nuclear energy corporation warned on Thursday that an Israeli attack on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant could lead to a “Chernobyl-style catastrophe.”

An Israeli military spokesperson said Israel had struck the site, but an Israeli military official later called this statement “a mistake” and said he could neither confirm nor deny that the Bushehr site on the cost of the Gulf had been hit.

Bushehr is Iran's only operating nuclear power plant and was built by Russia.

An Iranian missile slammed into the main hospital in southern Israel early Thursday, wounding people and causing 'extensive damage,' according to a spokesperson. Israeli media aired footage of blown-out windows and heavy black smoke.

The Associated Press

Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, in addition to having a nuclear power plant, it also enriches uranium up to 60 per cent, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state to enrich at that level.

Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons – making it the only such state in the Middle East – but does not acknowledge having such arms.

Iran's Supreme Leader on Wednesday rejected U.S. calls for surrender and warned that any American military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.”

Already, Israel's campaign has targeted Iran's enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran, and a nuclear site in Isfahan. Its strikes have also killed top generals and nuclear scientists.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he would travel to Geneva for meetings with his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France and Germany, as well as the European Union's top diplomat, indicating a new diplomatic initiative might be under way.

Trump has said he wants something “much bigger” than a ceasefire and has not ruled out the U.S. joining in Israel's campaign.

Israel eyes the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions

Israel's military said Thursday its fighter jets targeted the Arak heavy water reactor, some 250 km southwest of Tehran, in order to prevent it from being used to produce plutonium.

Iranian state TV said there was “no radiation danger whatsoever” around the Arak site, which it said had been evacuated ahead of the strike.

Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon.

Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to alleviate proliferation concerns. That work was never completed.

The reactor became a point of contention after Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018. Ali Akbar Salehi, a high-ranking nuclear official in Iran, said in 2019 that Tehran bought extra parts to replace a portion of the reactor that it had poured concrete into under the deal.

Israel said strikes were carried out “in order to prevent the reactor from being restored and used for nuclear weapons development.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. IAEA inspectors reportedly last visited Arak on May 14.

Due to restrictions Iran imposed on inspectors, the IAEA has said it lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran's heavy water production – meaning it could not absolutely verify Tehran's production and stockpile.

ST. PETERSBURG, June 19. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he does not even want to discuss the possibility of Israel killing Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

"If I may, I hope this will be the most correct answer to your question: ‘I do not even wish to discuss such a possibility'," he said at a meeting with the heads of the world's leading news agencies organized by TASS, when asked what Russia's reaction would be if Israel were to assassinate the ayatollah.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said there are currently no plans to eliminate Iran's supreme leader, adding that Khamenei is an easy target.

MOSCOW, June 19. /TASS/. Russia has offered Iran projects in the field of air defense systems, but Tehran showed little interest, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with the heads of the world's leading news agencies organized by TASS.

"You know, we once offered our Iranian friends to work on an air defense system. At the time, our partners did not show much interest. As for the treaty about our strategic partnership that you mentioned, there are no defense-related articles in it. This is the second thing. Third, our Iranian friends are not asking for it. There is practically nothing to discuss," the Russian leader said.

Overnight into June 13, Israel kicked off Operation Rising Lion aimed against Iran's nuclear program. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a retaliatory attack. In the following days, Tel Aviv and Tehran exchanged strikes again. Both sides reported casualties resulting from these attacks and acknowledged hits on several targets within their territories, though they claimed the damage was limited.

President Donald Trump said that political commentator Tucker Carlson called him to apologize for some of the critical comments he made on the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict.

“Tucker's a good guy, he called and apologized the other day because he thought he said things that were too strong, and I appreciated that,” Trump said.

The Supreme Court has issued a major decision upholding Tennessee's ban on so-called gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, for minors. Its decision on June 18 will likely influence how states craft legislation and how other gender-related cases unfold in the legal system.

In the case United States v. Skrmetti, a majority of the justices disagreed with the Biden administration's argument that Tennessee's law should undergo more rigorous scrutiny in the courts. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that courts should apply a less rigorous standard known as rational basis, under which states have to show that their law is rationally related to a state interest.

Paul Pierce responds to LeBron James' comments pushing back on "ring culture" and disagrees, posing the question of "What do we play for?".

Memphis Grizzlies center Zach Edey was reportedly stopped in Indiana for allegedly speeding through a 55-mph zone earlier this month.

The 7-foot-4 basketball player was charged with reckless driving and will make a court appearance in Tippecanoe County next week, according to online records.

Edey was clocked going around 101 mph on Indiana 25 on May 1, the Journal & Courier reported, citing a police affidavit.

Edey reportedly said he was trying to pass another vehicle, which was his reasoning for speeding.

Edey, who stands at 7'4", was the ninth pick of last year's NBA Draft after winning the Naismith Player of the Year in his final two seasons as a Boilermaker. He was named to the All-Rookie First Team, putting up 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per contest.

He recently underwent ankle surgery that could result in his missing the start of the 2025-26 season. Edey needed the procedure to repair and restabilize his ankle after spraining it again during offseason training last week. 

The Grizzlies said the 7-foot-4 Canadian would be evaluated again in four months, which is less than two weeks before the 2025-26 season opens Oct. 21.

Edey missed 12 games early in the season because of a sprained left ankle. He went on to play in 66 games, making 55 starts.

Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid. 

The Independent Restaurant Coalition, which represents nearly 100,000 restaurant and bars, has appealed to Congress to reconsider the proposal, which is part of the president's spending bill. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible. 

“I think there's a huge hole in this concept of ‘no tax on tips' because a lot of restaurant workers aren't receiving tips in the first place,” said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. “It's not helping most kitchen workers, and oftentimes those are the people who are being paid the least.”

For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept.

The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025.

The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. Eligibility would be based on earnings as of Dec. 31, 2024. 

Both the House and Senate committee measures would apply through the 2028 tax year. The Finance Committee specified that “cash tips” qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement. 

Wary of wading into politics, many restaurant chains contacted by The Associated Press about tax-free tips didn't respond or referred questions to the National Restaurant Association, including Waffle House, The Cheesecake Factory, First Watch and the parent companies of Olive Garden, Applebee's and Chili's.

The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. The association estimates the measure would benefit more than 2 million servers and bartenders.

But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The Independent Restaurant Coalition says the “no tax on tips” proposal leaves out too many of those workers.

The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Around 15% of U.S. restaurants add some form of service charge to customers' bills, according to the National Restaurant Association.

George Skandalos, a pizza restaurant owner in Moscow, Idaho, was tired of seeing servers count out hundreds of dollars of tips at the end of the night while people in the kitchen scrubbed the floor on their hands and knees. So he started experimenting with different compensation models.

Skandalos tried pooling servers' tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn't understand and kept tipping.

Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. The vast majority of customers appreciate the effort, he said.

Skandalos said “no tax on tips” doesn't acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes.

“This bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people's pocketbooks, but now let's finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,” he said.

But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips.

“'No tax on tips' is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to deliver something to working class folks,” he said.

Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. In 43 states, restaurants are currently allowed to pay tipped workers as little as $2.13 per hour.

Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford's bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty.

“It would help me get more groceries. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,” Garcia said.

Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they're inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it.

For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay.

“I think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,” she said.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a briefing as the world awaits President Donald Trump's decision on whether or not to strike Iran.

The press conference is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.

THE US IS DEBATING USING ITS ‘BUNKER-BUSTER' BOMB ON IRAN: HOW THE WEAPON WORKS

Trump has been under heavy pressure from all sides since the beginning of the Israel-Iran war to intervene or stay out of the conflict. Israel needs the U.S.'s 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs to hit Iran's Fordow underground nuclear enrichment facility.

Reports suggest that Trump has approved the strikes, but is holding off on the final call to see if Tehran will come to the negotiating table.

Live Updates


• Conflict rages: A new wave of Iranian missiles hit Israel today, with a major hospital in the south sustaining “extensive damage,” according to officials. Iran says it targeted a nearby technology park it claims was used by the Israeli military. Israel also attacked Iran's “inactive” Arak nuclear facility, with no major damage reported.
    


• Israel threatens Iran's top leader: Israel's defense minister said Iran's supreme leader cannot be allowed to “continue to exist.” He has instructed the Israeli military to “intensify strikes” against Iranian targets.
    


• US weighs options: President Donald Trump has reviewed attack plans for Iran but is waiting to see whether Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a source told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the US for “helping a lot” in the conflict.
    


• On the ground: CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, where the streets are nearly empty amid the sounds of sporadic thuds and outgoing anti-aircraft fire.
    


            The southern Israeli hospital that was damaged in Iranian strikes today has been closed to new admissions, with the exception of “urgent and life-threatening cases,” the hospital spokesperson's office said.
    


            Around 400 patients who were at the hospital in Beer Sheva before it was hit have been discharged or transferred to other hospitals, the spokesperson's office for the Soroka Medical Center said in a statement, with approximately 300 patients remaining at the hospital.
    


            “Approximately 80 people were injured in the incident, about half are hospital staff,” the spokesperson's office said. “All injuries were classified as mild or stress-related.”
    


            The Iranian attack that damaged the hospital was “the most severe incident of its kind in the history of Israel's healthcare system,” according to the statement, adding that the hospital's gas, water, and air-conditioning systems were affected by the blast.
    


                    “All Soroka staff – across all sectors – are operating with a strong sense of responsibility and dedication, ensuring the continued care of the wounded and the maintenance of essential medical services,” the hospital said.
                





            Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Turkey this weekend, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported Thursday.
    


            Araghchi will attend a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an intergovernmental group that largely comprises Muslim-majority countries, Tasnim reported. The meeting will take place Saturday and Sunday in Istanbul, it said.
    


            A special session to address the conflict between Iran and Israel will also take place at the summit, according to Tasnim.
    


            Israeli strikes in Gaza killed more than 70 people on Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said, as Israel continues its military campaign in the besieged enclave amid the escalating conflict with Iran.
    


            Among Thursday's dead are multiple children, Gaza health officials said, including two who were killed after several homes in Jabalia al-Balad, in northern Gaza, came under Israeli fire. In the Al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, three children sheltering in a tent were killed by the bombardment, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza.
    


            Video from after the attacks showed adults bringing injured children, screaming in pain, to Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Other children appeared lifeless as they were carried into the ward.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
    


More context: The latest strikes come as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. The United Nations repeated its warnings Thursday that famine is growing increasingly likely and that there are few areas left in the territory where Palestinians are safe from bombardment.
    


            Attacks on civilians attempting to access food supplies continue, hospitals are overstretched and 55,000 pregnant women are facing growing health risks, according to the most recent report from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
    


            More than 55,160 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war with Hamas began on October 7, 2023, according to the health ministry, including more than 17,000 children.
    


            Satellite images show that Israeli strikes on Iran's Arak Nuclear Facility breached the containment dome of the “inactive” heavy water reactor's containment dome and damaged heavy water distillation towers.
    


See before-and-after images of the Arak nuclear facility: 



            CNN's Jeremy Diamond gained access to a residential and commercial building destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile in Ramat Gan, just to the east of Tel Aviv.
    


            The impact damaged buildings and cars in nearly every direction around the blast radius. The missile, which struck the location just east of Tel Aviv shortly after 7 a.m. local time, shredded the facades of buildings and blew out windows in high-rise blocks.
    


Take a look here:



            Iran has issued a new threat to any “third party” thinking about getting involved in its conflict with Israel, threatening an “immediate” response.
    


            Iran's Supreme National Security Council issued a statement on Thursday afternoon, announcing that the “confrontation with the enemy will continue, until the compensation is paid.”
    


            As the conflict between Iran and Israel stretches to a week, the council said that Iran has plans in place for various scenarios.
    


            Without naming the US or any other country, the council said: “In the event of a third party's intervention in this aggression, they will be confronted immediately according to a specific plan.”
    


            US President Donald Trump is considering entering the conflict but has signaled he's yet to make a decision.
    


            He has reviewed attack plans but is holding off to see if Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The US military has taken several steps to protect its assets and equipment in the Middle East as the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, including evacuating all non-sheltered planes from its sprawling base in Qatar and moving US Navy ships stationed in Bahrain, two defense officials told CNN.
    


            US Central Command has also pre-positioned additional supplies of blood in the region, the officials and a source familiar said, which is standard operating procedure any time there is a possibility of an attack on US forces.
    


            One of the officials described the changes as prudent, precautionary planning amid threats by Iran that it will attack US troops and bases in the Middle East if the US decides to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            The non-sheltered American planes were moved out of Al Udeid airbase in Qatar earlier this week, an official confirmed after satellite imagery showed that the area had been emptied. Additionally, all of the US Navy ships that had been forward-deployed at Naval Support Activity Bahrain — the US Navy's base in the island country — left port earlier this week. It's not clear where the planes and ships have been moved to during the heightened tensions.
    


Remember: President Donald Trump has not yet decided whether to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CNN has reported. But if he does, Tehran has threatened to retaliate directly against the US. Iran has dozens of proxy groups in the region that can launch ballistic missiles and drones at US forces and bases. In January 2024, three US service members were killed and dozens were wounded after an Iran-backed Shia militia launched a drone attack at Tower 22, a US base on the border of Syria and Iraq.
    


            US President Donald Trump's national security team is convening at the White House on Thursday ahead of a scheduled meeting with the president in the Situation Room.
    


            Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and special envoy Steve Witkoff were all seen arriving to the West Wing in the hour ahead of the 11:30 a.m. ET meeting.
    


            Witkoff was seen in the driveway speaking on the phone using AirPods before going inside. Others could have arrived through a different entrance.
    


            The meeting was listed on Trump's schedule as an “intelligence briefing,” but the Situation Room location suggested the talks would be more sensitive than the typical daily intelligence update that is often conducted in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump has met with his team in the Situation Room each of the last two days.
    


            Iran's foreign minister asked Israelis to avoid being near “military and intelligence sites” as his country continues to carry out strikes.
    


            Abbas Araghchi said on X that Iran's military “accurately” eliminated an Israeli command, control and intelligence headquarters, “and another vital target,” but he did not identify the location.
    


            He said the “blast wave” caused “superficial damage” to the nearby Soroka Medical Center, which he claims was treating Israeli soldiers injured in Gaza.
    


            Israel says Iran directly targeted the hospital, while Iran says it was targeting the command center near the medical center.
    


                    “Hundreds of innocent Iranians have been murdered in cold blood since Israel launched its illegal war against the Iranian people last week,” Araghchi said.
                





            “Our powerful Armed Forces will continue to pummel the criminals who target our people until they cease and pay for their criminal aggression against our nation,” he added.
    


            The Iranian foreign minister is set to travel to Geneva in Switzerland to meet European counterparts for talks tomorrow. A diplomat told CNN the talks were exploratory, to “feel the room” as to what could be achieved.
    


            US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to attend the meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy at the White House Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CNN.
    


            The meeting, which was originally scheduled for last week, comes amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and as President Donald Trump mulls US military involvement.
    


            Lammy is expected to travel from the US to Geneva for a meeting Friday between the Iranian foreign minister and British, French, German and EU foreign ministers. As of Thursday morning, Witkoff was not expected to attend that meeting.
    


            Civilians can now leave protected spaces after sirens stopped sounding in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and its surroundings on Thursday.
    


                    “Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces. The public is requested to continue to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command,” the Israeli military said.
                





            CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Beer Sheva, Israel, where a hospital was struck during an Iranian attack.
    


            Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.” There have been dozens of injuries but no reported deaths from the strike.
    


            If Iran's Fordow nuclear facility were damaged or destroyed in a strike by the US, it would likely lead to a limited radiation leak in the immediate area, but it would not pose the same catastrophic consequences as bombing a nuclear reactor, experts told CNN.
    


            Kelsey Davenport, the Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, said that if bombs were able to penetrate Fordow, it would likely lead to “some limited radiation from the uranium enriched and stored at the facility,” but “it's unlikely to cause significant, widespread environmental health contamination.”
    


            She explained that attacking a site where uranium hexafluoride gas — the material fed into the facility's centrifuges — is stored “is going to create chemical toxicities” and “low level alpha radiation,” which would likely be localized to the site.
    


            Davenport said that it would likely be “manageable if people are wearing the right protective equipment.”
    


            Behnam Ben Taleblu, the Iran program senior director and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), also described the potential damage as being a chemical hazard.
    


            “There isn't a major radiation dispersal risk at Fordow because that enriched uranium is fresh,” explained Scott Roecker, the Vice President for Nuclear Materials Security at NTI.
    


            “It'd be localized around the site, and because it's buried underground too, I don't know you know how much of that would even be released,” he said.
    


            “Bombing a reactor is a whole different ball game,” Davenport explained.
    


            Davenport said she believes it's “extremely unlikely” Israel would bomb a nuclear reactor — a move that “would be a clear violation of international law.”
    


            “You risk a reactor meltdown, widespread radiation and environmental contamination, devastating to the region,” she said.
    


            On a visit to the Soroka Medical Center in the city of Beer Sheva, which was damaged in Iranian strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the United States is “already helping a lot” in his country's conflict with Iran.
    


                    “They're participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities,” Netanyahu told CNN among a group of reporters. “I think it's a remarkable cooperation.”
                





            The prime minister also said that he is being asked whether Israel is targeting the downfall of the Iranian regime. “That may be the result,” he said. “But it's up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap.”
    


            “We may create conditions that may help them do it,” Netanyahu said.
    


            As Israel continues its push against Iran's nuclear ambitions, here's what we know about its own program.
    


How long has Israel had nuclear weapons?



            Israel has never acknowledged its nuclear weapons program and American presidents, certainly aware of Israel's nuclear capabilities, have helped keep secret the closely held details of the program.
    


            But Israel is one of nine countries known to have nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel began exploring nuclear weapons development before its establishment in 1948, then at a secret development site in 1958, near the southern town of Dimona.
    


            It is widely thought that Israel first assembled its first nuclear weapon around 1966 or 1967. In 1968, the CIA issued a report that said Israel had successfully started production of nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel is believed to have conducted a clandestine atmospheric nuclear test in 1979, which it denies.
    


            Its program has been expanding for years, experts say.
    


How big is Israel's nuclear arsenal?



            Israel now possesses around 90 nuclear warheads and is believed to have enough nuclear material to produce up to 300 nuclear weapons, according to the Washington, DC-based NGO, Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI).
    


            It is continuing to modernize its stockpile, according to SIPRI, who said that Israel conducted a test of a missile propulsion system in 2024 that could be related to its Jericho family of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles.
    


            Israel also appears to be upgrading its plutonium production reactor site at Dimona, SIPRI said.
    


What has Netanyahu said?



            In an interview with CNN in May 2018 – shortly after Israel stole Iran's nuclear archive from Tehran – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked if he was ready to acknowledge Israel's own program.
    


            “We've always said that we won't be the first to introduce (a nuclear weapon), so we haven't introduced it,” he said.
    


            Israel has not signed the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and opposes diplomatic efforts to establish a WMD Free Zone in the Middle East.
    


            Israel has signed and ratified the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which obligates signatories not to explode a nuclear device in the atmosphere or oceans.
    


            Iran fired more missiles at Israel today, the Israeli military said, adding that “defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.”
    


            Sirens sounded in the northern city of Haifa and its surroundings.
    


            “The public is requested to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command. At this time, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) is operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat,” the Israeli military said.
    


            It comes after Israel was hit by a new wave of Iranian missiles earlier.
    


            Israel's health ministry says at least 271 people were admitted to hospital this morning following Iranian strikes across the country.
    


            The ministry said four of those sustained severe injuries, while 16 were moderately injured, 24 were hospitalized for anxiety and the remainder were either mildly injured or are still being assessed.
    


            In Soroka, where a hospital was hit by an Iranian missile, 71 people were mildly injured, according to the ministry. Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.”
    


            Since Israel started its operation “Rising Lion” on Friday, more than 2,300 people in Israel have been hospitalized but most have been discharged, the ministry says.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “all of Israel is paying a price” amid the country's conflict with Iran, as he visited the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beer Sheva that was damaged in Iranian strikes
    


                    “All of Israel is paying a price,” Netanyahu said today, adding that, “it is really reminiscent of the Blitz spirit of the British people.”
                





            The prime minister claimed that while Israel is hitting military sites only, Iran “targets and hit a hospital.”
    


            “They hit a hospital where people can't even get up and run away,” he told reporters at the scene, adding that Iran “hit not far from here where there's a ward for children and babies.”
    


            Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that it had targeted an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.”
    


            Israel was hit by a new wave of Iranian missiles on Thursday, which hit multiple cities.
    


            The Israeli military confirmed that its fighter jets struck dozens of military targets in Iran overnight, including the “inactive” Arak nuclear facility.
    


            Tehran is very empty.
    


            The roads are almost empty of traffic and there are few people on the streets.
    


            While many shops remain shut, most supermarkets and banks are still open and still frequented by the people who have remained in the city. And basic services are still very much in operation.
    


            Sporadic thuds can be heard around the city — and the sound of outgoing anti-aircraft fire — but there is no panic. The people who remain here are trying to go about their business.
    


            Following scenes of large lines of cars leaving Tehran — after US President Donald Trump this week warned residents of the city to evacuate — queues at gas stations have dramatically shortened, perhaps because so many people have fled.
    


            On our drive from the Turkish border and in Tehran, there was no sign of any shortage of fuel.
    


            Talks between Iran, the UK, Germany, France and the European Union planned for tomorrow in Switzerland are happening in consultation with the Trump administration, a diplomat from a western European country told CNN.
    


            The official described the talks as exploratory, to “feel the room” as to what could be achieved.

Follow:


            He might do it. But he might not. And you've got no idea whether he will. Then again, neither does he.
    


            Donald Trump's riffing ahead of the most wrenching national security decision in either of his presidencies is nothing like the complex war-gaming and careful tilling of public opinion that most commanders in chief require before they send Americans off to fight.
    


            Trump's vague soliloquies and ambiguous comments, on camera and online, seem glib and even negligent given the grave potential consequences of a US attack on Iran's nuclear sites.
    


            But it's how he rolls. He wants to keep friends and foes guessing. He's shown that he believes unpredictability and volatility — factors that most presidents seek to avoid in national security crises — offer him a key advantage.
    


            Trump loves to be the center of attention with the world hanging on his every word. His equivocating creates space for him to postpone the moment of decision and to avoid locking in definitive courses of action he can't reverse. His fans say it's genius. But there's not much evidence that strategy transfers from a real estate magnate's boardroom to complex geopolitical showdowns and global peacemaking.
    


            Iran's ayatollahs, Israel, US allies, members of Congress, pundits, reporters and Americans watching at home can never be certain what Trump might do next. And no modern president has ever managed the run-up to a possible war as though he is sketching a series of cliffhangers to compel viewers to watch the next episode. Trump is no JFK calmly averting nuclear war with high-pressure diplomatic chess during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
    


            Trump's critics have dreaded the moment when he'd face the kind of international crisis he largely avoided during his first term. And his style has serious drawbacks.
    


            His administration has yet to take the American people into its confidence and explain why it has suddenly changed its view that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. Now, Trump says it's weeks away from one. There's no sign the administration intends to seek authorization from Congress for a possible new act of war against Iran — as the Constitution requires. And it's refusing to say whether it's gamed out how an attack on Iran's nuclear plant at Fordow could reverberate through a treacherous region and whether it has any kind of exit strategy.
    


            This would be troubling in isolation. But following Washington's disastrous history of plunging into quagmires caused by paltry planning for the day after shock-and-awe beginnings, it's tempting fate. And Trump's serial dishonesty and scorched-earth leadership style mean millions of Americans will need a lot more than his word to trust any decision to wage military action.
    


            The president's plans might be a mystery. But his calculation is a simple one.
    


            He must decide whether US interests are served by joining Israel's assault on Iran to try to destroy the Islamic Republic's nuclear program with unique bunker-busting capabilities that only the United States possesses.
    


            It's a tough call because of the potential consequences: Iranian attacks on US bases in the Middle East, potential terrorist attacks on US targets, and a shockwave that could destabilize the world if the regime in Tehran collapses.
    


            The latest developments are ominous. A third US aircraft carrier group is moving toward the Middle East. A fierce war of words between Trump and Iran's clerical leaders is heating up. And the president is huddling in daily Situation Room meetings with his top national security aides.
    


            CNN reported on Wednesday that the president is preoccupied with finding a way to strike key targets of Iran's nuclear program without being dragged into a full-scale war. Sources familiar with the matter said he wants to avoid the kind of open-ended conflict like those in Iraq and Afghanistan that he's vowed to avoid and that he used as a catalyst for his rise among MAGA voters skeptical of war.
    


            These revelations might offer Americans some comfort since they suggest that the president is weighing the implications of his decisions with greater diligence than his offhand patter suggests.
    


            There's some logic to his position. No one expects Trump to put US troops on the ground — they could be a sitting target in Iran or in any post-war failed state insurgency, as happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump's first-term assassination raid that killed Iranian intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani didn't unleash fury against US targets that many analysts expected. And US bases in the region are heavily defended against missile attacks. There's also some question about how much Iran's degraded military can now throw at the US and Israel.
    


            But US foreign policy of the last 25 years is haunted by false assumptions about the behavior of adversaries when they are attacked. As Trump said himself last month in Saudi Arabia, US officials were often meddling in societies they didn't understand.
    


            So, it's fair to ask whether Trump has any idea what he's getting into.
    


            A watching world is no wiser after the president's public appearances Wednesday.
    


            “I mean, you don't know that I'm going to even do it. You don't know. I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,” Trump told reporters who asked him about his plans for Iran as he unveiled two massive flagpoles at the White House. “Nothing's finished until it's finished. You know, war is very complex. A lot of bad things can happen. A lot of turns are made.”
    


            Later, in the Oval Office, Trump told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that he hadn't made a final decision on what to do as he's besieged by pressure for action by Israelis and warnings from his own MAGA base to stay out of foreign wars. “I have ideas as to what to do, but I haven't made a final — I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things change.”
    


            Trump's lack of precision worries Democrats.
    


            “It's obviously unclear where his head is at right now. I think he was pretty indecisive on the subject of Iran, which I can understand,” California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said on “The Situation Room.”
    


            “This is a difficult call. But I don't think we got much guidance as to whether he is optimistic about talks with Iran leaning in towards a potential strike on Iran,” Schiff said, reacting to one of Trump's meandering press availabilities. “It was pretty nebulous, the kind of usual stream-of-consciousness.”
    


            There's confusion about conflicting intelligence assessments in the US and Israel about Iran's nuclear progress. Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is part of a group of senior lawmakers who are given access to the most sensitive classified information. But he's as much in the dark as anyone about what's next.
    


            “I'm a member … of the Gang of Eight. We're supposed to know,” Warner told CNN's Kasie Hunt. “I have no foggy idea what this administration's plans are or what the foreign policy is vis-a-vis Iran.”
    


            The question of the administration's contingency planning is also coming into focus. But don't expect any details.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confronted by Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin during a hearing on Wednesday. Slotkin speaks from experience: She was a CIA officer who completed combat tours in Baghdad after the George W. Bush administration's disastrous lack of forethought for how to win peace in Iraq.
    


            “Have you commissioned any day-after planning?” Slotkin asked. “Any force protection, any use of ground troops, in Iran; any cost assessments, because I don't think we doubt what we can do as a country, and in the attack. It's the day after with Iraq and Afghanistan that so many of us have learned to be so deeply concerned about.
    


            Hegseth reacted with disdain. “We have plans for everything, Senator,” he said.
    


            Trump showed similar hubris.  “I have a plan for everything, but we'll see what happens,” he told reporters on the Oval Office.
    


            The president also says he's open to diplomacy. But there's no sign of a James Baker-style peace shuttle.
    


            Far from offering his adversary a face-saving off-ramp. Trump is demanding total surrender at the outset. While this may match Israel's goals, it's a nonstarter for Iran's revolutionary corps of leaders in Tehran, who've founded their regime on more than 45 years of defying successive American presidents.
    


            Trump often seems to be operating in a parallel universe. He for instance insists Iranian leaders wanted to meet and “to come to the White House.”
    


            Iran strongly denied any such aspirations.
    


            “We are not begging for anything,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. “As long as the aggression continues, as long as this brutality continues, we cannot think of engaging.”
    


            This points to one of the liabilities of Trump's diplomacy, which also helps explained his failed Ukraine peace drive. His administration shows little skill in creating openings and multilayered negotiating scenarios that can loosen entrenched positions. Trump makes maximalist demands. When interlocutors demur, the process grinds to a halt.
    


            So, for now, the country seems on a path to another venture in the Middle East, with uncertain consequences.
    


            But Trump had one more cliffhanger.
    


            “Anything could happen,” he said, when asked if the regime in Iran could fall in a response which exemplifies his entire presidency.

The Mexican resort of Acapulco awoke on Thursday under dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach. It appeared the town had dodged the worst at least in terms of strong winds.

PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Powerful Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The hurricane's center was located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Punta Maldonado. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 125 mph (205 kph). It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center said.




The storm was downgraded slightly before making landfall, from a powerful Category 4 to a Category 3. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 129 mph (210 kph). 

The storm threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero states. Agricultural fields blanket the low-lying coastal area between small fishing villages. 

Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it crashes into the coastal mountains of southern Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane center said.

The storm threatened to unleash destructive winds near where the eye crashes ashore, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge, forecasters said. 




At first light Thursday, Acapulco awoke under ominous dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach.

However, the storm was forecast to move northwest just inland up the coast through midday, bringing heavy rain to the resort and the mountains that tower dramatically above it. 

Still, it appeared Acapulco had dodged the worst at least in terms of Erick's strong winds. 

Late Wednesday, Erick's projected path had crept south, closer to the resort city of Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state with Acapulco up the coast to the northwest. 

President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video message Wednesday night that all activities in the region were suspended and she urged people to stay in their homes or to move to shelters if they lived in low-lying areas.

Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. The beach disappeared under pounding waves and the rising tide had already reached the interiors of some waterfront restaurants.

Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied.

Earlier in the day, fishermen in Puerto Escondido pulled their boats out of the water ahead of the storm's arrival. Some surfers continued to ride waves at the Zicatela beach, even with red flags up to warn people to stay out of the water.

Acapulco residents had braced for Erick's arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Otis two years earlier.

The city of nearly 1 million was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.

Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday.

Carlos Ozuna Romero, 51, lost his restaurant at the edge of an Acapulco beach when Otis slammed the resort with devastating winds. On Wednesday, he directed workers storing tables and chairs.

“Authorities' warnings fill us with fear and obviously make us remember everything we've already been through,” Ozuna Romero said in reference to Otis.

Elsewhere, workers nailed sheets of plywood over shop windows and stacked sandbags outside doorways. Cars lined up to fill their tanks and shoppers made last-minute purchases before rushing home.

Verónica Gómez struggled through the streets of Acapulco with a large jug of water. “We're all afraid because we think the same thing could happen,” said the 40-year-old employee of a shipping company.

But she said she and others learned a lot from Otis. “Now it's not going to catch us by surprise,” she said, holding out a bag of canned food as evidence.

In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.

Forecasters expected Erick to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.

Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes across Guerrero.

Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick churned through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification — when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours — which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.

Vanessa Hernández, known by her stage name Nezza, sang a Spanish rendition of the United States' national anthem at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, and she claimed the team wished she did not. 

Now, the singer is saying she has since received death threats for her performance.

Nezza, wearing a Dominican Republic shirt while performing, posted a video on TikTok of a team employee telling her, "We are going to do the song in English today."

Nezza decided to sing the Spanish version anyway, saying in a later TikTok video that it was in response to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence in Los Angeles that has led to protests and unrest in the city.

She said the backlash she has received has been harmful.

"That's just the internet. That's going to come with something like that. Anything that involves politics is going to include a death threat here and there," Nezza said to TMZ Sports. 

"The main thing I've seen seeing is that it's disrespectful. I don't think it's disrespectful, because the lyrics are still the same exact lyrics as the English version. If both songs were made into a music video, it'd be the exact music video.

"I'm a proud American. I was born here, raised here, my dreams came true here in L.A. I think being a proud American and still wanting better for your country can still be the same truth, and I think people are forgetting that."

Nezza said she has also received support from celebrities in the Latin community, which "outweighs" the hate.

"It's been really sweet to see people you idolize be on the right side of history…" she said. "I already knew in my heart what I did was right, but this just triple-confirms it."

In the aforementioned TikTok, Nezza said she "just felt like I needed to" sing the Spanish version - but now she does "not feel welcome back" at Dodger Stadium.

Other Los Angeles-based professional sports teams have taken a stance, including the NWSL's Angely City F.C., which gave fans "Immigrant City Football Club" T-shirts at their game on Saturday. Players were also seen warming up with the t-shirts on before their match to show support for those protesting.

Nezza's Spanish rendition of the anthem came on the day of numerous "No Kings" protests, which were against the military parade in Washington, D.C., that coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday, across the country. 

Trump's birthday was also the 250th birthday celebration of the United States Army.

As Iran remains undeterred by President Donald Trump's calls for surrender in its conflict with Israel, the president is considering using a “bunker-buster” bomb to take out a critical Iranian nuclear facility.

Fordow, a key nuclear enrichment site in Iran, was found to have 60% enriched uranium last month, according to the Washington Post. Once uranium reaches 90% enrichment, it can be used to fuel a nuclear weapon.

While Israel has already damaged Natanz, one of Iran's nuclear facilities, Fordow remains untouched. Left unchecked, there is concern that the Iranians could use this facility to build a nuclear weapon quickly, prompting Trump to consider hitting the facility with a “bunker-buster” bomb as a proactive measure to cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Here is everything you need to know about the United States's “bunker-buster” bomb.

The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, also known as the “bunker-buster” bomb, is a GPS-guided bomb measuring 20 feet long and weighing 30,000 pounds, according to the Aviationist.

Trump approved Iran attack plans on Tuesday but still not ready to pull trigger

The bomb is transported using B-2 Spirit planes. According to Air Force Global Strike Command, their stealth and ability to carry significant weight make them the only planes capable of successfully delivering the GBU-57. Typically, each plane can carry two bombs at a time.

Trump has received repeated requests from Israel to come alongside its forces to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, namely its Fordow nuclear enrichment site, Axios reported.

The Fordow facility is buried deep underground in the city of Qom. It is believed to be roughly 262 to 360 feet below the surface, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies. While Israel does not possess the weapons necessary to penetrate that deep, the U.S. does.

The “bunker-buster” bomb is described as having the ability to breach 200 feet before detonating, according to the Aviationist. If the bomb is successful and destroys the Fordow nuclear enrichment site, it will cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities for the foreseeable future.

It is unclear whether the weapon would successfully destroy Iran's key nuclear facilities.

“So even with bunker-busters, when you're talking about sites like Fordow that are half a mile under mountains, there's no certainty that the U.S. can actually completely destroy the stuff,” Rosemary Kelanic, the director of the Middle East program at Defense Priorities, told the Washington Examiner.

“And so, where does that lead you?” she continued. “Well, if the U.S. bombs them, and we're not certain whether or not it will actually destroy its sites, or we're not certain that we've gotten all the stockpiles. … If we leave it only partly disabled, that gives Iran every incentive to run for a bomb.”

An Iranian official said Wednesday that any U.S. military intervention on behalf of Israel, including bombing Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, would risk “all-out war,” CBS News reported.

One way the Iranians could retaliate against the U.S. for getting involved is by attacking military bases in the region. An Iranian missile has already damaged the U.S. Embassy in Israel, though no military bases have been hit and no U.S. lives have been lost.

Trump has reportedly approved attack plans on Iran but, as of Wednesday night, had not made a call on whether to proceed. U.S. support may be necessary to take out Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Israel's defense minister has since hinted at an intention to kill what he deemed the “modern Hitler.”

Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei but has since taunted the supreme leader, suggesting the U.S. could assassinate him in the future.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump said of Khamenei in a Tuesday post on Truth Social. “He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Paul Pierce responds to LeBron James' comments pushing back on "ring culture" and disagrees, posing the question of "What do we play for?".

The viral confrontation between LeBron James and Stephen A. Smith seems to have everlasting effects.

After a Los Angeles Lakers game against the New York Knicks back in March, the two had what Smith called an "unexpected" incident in which the NBA's all-time leading scorer voiced his concerns about Smith's remarks about his son, Bronny.

Smith had been critical of the Lakers' use of Bronny and his father's apparent handling of the situation, but Smith said on Wednesday's "First Take" that there was a further reason for the courtside interaction.

"I have nothing to say about that. I don't like him, and he don't like me…" he said, via Awful Announcing. "He hid behind his son, tried to make something out of nothing, as if I was dogging his son, which I was not. The real issue was we don't like each other. And he used that as an excuse to confront me. I got it."

Smith, though, said he is keeping his personal feelings about James away from his analysis of him.

"He's one of the greatest players who's ever lived. I'm going to show him that respect, and I'm going to cover him objectively. When he does great, I'm gonna applaud. When he doesn't do great, I'm not gonna applaud."

At the time of the incident, Smith suggested the interaction had been between a pair of fathers, more than an exchange between a basketball player and a sports television star.

Smith also said that he would be open to having further discussions with James privately, saying the Lakers star "knows how to get in contact with (him) if he wanted to."

Smith added that if a one-on-one discussion had happened with James, the sports commentator would have told the four-time NBA MVP that he would "never speak negatively" about Bronny, who split time in the NBA and G-League throughout the 2024-25 season.

Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports on a law put in place by former President Joe Biden that protected an El Salvadoran accused murderer from deportation.

EXCLUSIVE: A Biden-era decision could potentially keep a convicted murderer from being deported from the United States, at least while a key legal battle plays out in court.

Fox News rode along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles, the center of recent anti-ICE civil unrest, and the agency arrested Salvadoran national Alexander Alfredo Palacios Guevara, who not only has the murder conviction, but also two counts of attempted murder dating back to 1994, an HSI source said.

The man told Fox News, "I have CAT, I have CAT," which turned out to be a Convention against Torture he was granted by the Biden-era Board of Immigration Appeals on Dec. 18, according to DHS sources.

Specifically, he was given DCAT – Deferral of Removal under the Convention Against Torture, meaning that he believes there's a risk of him getting tortured if he is sent back to El Salvador.

"This criminal alien should never have been roaming the streets of Los Angeles. Not only is he a member of the ruthless Surenos gang, but he also has multiple convictions for murder, assault and rape or sexual abuse of a minor," an ICE spokesperson told Fox News.  

"A highly unusual Biden-era legal decision from December allowed this dangerous criminal to live in American communities. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are removing public safety threats as it always should have been," the statement continued.

The order resulted in him being briefly released by ICE but then taken back into custody the next day because of the massive public safety risk. 

Guevara remains in federal custody amid the possibility of sending him to a third country, something the United States has attempted before with convicted criminals, like sending them to South Sudan.

When Fox News asked if he was a convicted murderer, Guevara responded, "I'm free."

Fox News reached out to his immigration attorney asking about who he's concerned will torture him in El Salvador and for more details about his case, but there has been no response yet. The nation's eyes turned onto Los Angeles earlier this month as ICE narrowed in on operations in the region, which led to protests and riots in the city and throughout the country.

Caitlin Clark was fouled hard during the Indiana Fever's 88-71 victory over the Connecticut Sun. Colin Cowherd says this is great for the WNBA and Caitlin Clark's career and he discusses how she's impacted the league. 

ESPN star Stephen A. Smith suggested on Wednesday that Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was responsible for some of the resentment toward her in the WNBA.

Smith and "First Take" panelists Monica McNutt and Christopher "Mad Dog" Russo broke down the skirmishes between Fever and Connecticut Sun players. Clark was on the receiving end of an eye poke from Sun guard Jacy Sheldon and was then bumped to the floor by Marina Mabrey.

Clark and Sun players were talking trash throughout the game as tensions began to rise early and eventually boil over. Fever guard Sophie Cunningham also got into the fray with a hard foul on Sheldon late in the game. Both players were ejected.

Smith reiterated his stance that he believed there was "resentment" toward Clark but said he had no problem with the frenzy that took place at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse, noting the highly competitive nature of all the athletes on the court.

"Now, here's the thing about, because I want to make sure everyone understands what I'm about to say," Smith began. "Caitlin Clark being that ‘golden goose' per se, that ‘rising tide that's lifting all boats,' I stand by my past proclamations that there's resentment toward her because of that. But I want to take it a step further. There's also resentment toward her because she instigates resentment toward her sometimes. Oh, Caitlin can clap at ya now, Caitlin can antagonize ya now.

"Remember, in college, the whole Angel Reese thing started because when Caitlin was giving it to everybody else, she was the one waving in their face and that's why when Angel Reese and LSU got a whole of her, Angel Reese was like (waves hand in front of face), ‘Yeah, it's your turn.' That's where it came from. It was instigated by Caitlin Clark. She got a comeuppance and she was big enough to embrace it and accept it and say, ‘Yo, I deserve it, it was my turn because they got me good."

Smith pointed out that Clark does her fair share of trash talking and can dish it out as well as anyone.

He then compared her to Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird.

"On top of the fact that she could play … but she's kinda like what Larry Bird was when Larry Bird was shooting the lights out and stuff like that but Larry Bird also talked junk," he said. "Dr. J was one of the nicest, sweetest people on the planet. People were saying he was making house calls, helping invite the NBA into America's living room, and Dr. J swung on Larry Bird. Why? Because Larry Bird says, ‘I'm gonna hit this jumper right here on you,' Bam! ‘I'm gonna hit this 3 right here on you,' Bam! … Caitlin Clark is that person as well. The vitriol that she gets, some of it is self-induced, I just happen to love it because that's sports."

The WNBA gave an additional fine to Cunningham for her involvement in the fracas after the Sheldon foul. She received a standard fine automatically for the Flagrant-2 foul. Mabrey's technical foul was upgraded to a Flagrant-2 foul, and she received a standard fine for that.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa was under a declared state of national disaster on Thursday as the death toll from floods caused by severe rains in the Eastern Cape region rose to 92.

The Eastern Cape government honoured the victims of last week's floods with a provincial Day of Mourning and a memorial service at King Sabatha Dalindyebo Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College in Mthatha, one of the few schools whose infrastructure remained intact.

Speaking at the public memorial service, Zolile Williams, a member of the executive council, said the people of the coastal province have not been the same since the disaster hit, and many are now faced with the challenging task of rebuilding.

“Since June 9, this province has been hit hard by unprecedented, catastrophic and unimaginable disasters, where in the whole of the province, about 92 people have perished,” said Williams.

“Since that day, the Eastern Cape has not been the same. It is the first time we have experienced so many dead bodies, some of whom have not yet been found.”

An extreme weather front brought heavy rain, strong winds and snow to parts of the province caused flooding in one of South Africa's poorest provinces last week, leaving dozens dead and roads, houses, schools and other infrastructure damaged.

At least two school children who were washed away in a bus are among the unverified number of missing persons according to local media reports, while thousands have since been displaced.




Authorities have appealed for residents to report missing people so rescuers could better understand how many people they were still looking for.

Religious leaders from different Christian religions were among the hundreds of mourners who attended the memorial ceremony, lighting candles as a symbolic expression of remembering the 92 people who died in the floods.

In a government notice on Wednesday, Elias Sithole, director of the National Disaster Management Centre, said severe weather had caused property damage. and the disruption of vital services in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, the Western Cape, and the Free State, which prompted South Africa to declare a national state of disaster.

The declaration allows the government to release funding for relief and rehabilitation and will remain in place until it lapses or until the conditions can no longer be categorised as such and is revoked by the head of the centre.

President Cyril Ramaphosa recently visited the town of Mthatha, in Eastern Cape province, where the floods hit hardest.

Many of the Eastern Cape flood victims lived on floodplains close to rivers. Government officials said poor neighbourhoods with informal dwellings were most severely impacted. Authorities have been criticized for the rescue response but also for the state of the infrastructure in the area.

Former Acting I.C.E. Director Ron Vitiello applauds President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for enforcing the administration's immigration policies on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

All Elite Wrestling star Brody King wore an "Abolish ICE" T-shirt as the company held "Grand Slam Mexico" in Mexico City on Wednesday night.

King was a part of a 14-person tag-team match with Adam Cole, Atlantis, Atlantis Jr., Bandido Daniel Garcia and Templario. The pro wrestling stars defeated the team of Dax Harwood, Hechicero, Josh Alexander, Konosuke Takeshita, Kyle Fletcher, Lance Archer and Volador Jr.

The event took place in Arena México and featured wrestlers from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) – one of the top promotions in Mexico.

King's apparent call to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came as he showed support for protestors in Los Angeles who were against the raids that took place in the city. The protesters took a violent turn at several points during the week, with law enforcement officers being injured, autonomous vehicles being set on fire and stores being looted.

He shared a post from Mexican makeup artist Jose Corella, which started "Let me be clear."

"What's happening in Los Angeles right now is not only morally reprehensible – it's legally indefensible. This is a sanctuary city, a designation that was democratically voted on and enacted into law by the residents of this city – not by political opportunists grandstanding from a golf course in Florida," the message read.

"Let me be clear: being undocumented in the United States is not a criminal offense. It is a civil violation. That means it holds the same legal weight as running a stop sign on a bicycle, setting off a firework after a drink, or selling unlicensed fan merch on Etsy. It is subject to civil penalties – typically a fine – not imprisonment, not detention, and certainly not extrajudicial abduction.

"Dragging someone off the street at gunpoint, without a warrant or due process, and forcing them into an unmarked vehicle operated by armed, plainclothed agents is not law enforcement – it is armed kidnapping. And armed kidnapping is a felony – a real one.

"So, if you're going to obsess over who is *illegal,* start by looking at the heavily armed individuals violating constitutional protections under the guise of enforcing the law. Because what they're doing is criminal, not the people they're targeting."

Since then, similar messages have been shared by Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Enrique Hernandez and the National Women's Soccer League's Angel City FC.

President Donald Trump has since doubled down on his support of ICE in Los Angeles and called on ICE officers to expand their efforts to other cities.

“I should have thought of this 10 years ago,” Yoshua Bengio says.

The science fiction author Isaac Asimov once came up with a set of laws that we humans should program into our robots. In addition to a first, second, and third law, he also introduced a “zeroth law,” which is so important that it precedes all the others: “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”

This month, the computer scientist Yoshua Bengio — known as the “godfather of AI” because of his pioneering work in the field — launched a new organization called LawZero. As you can probably guess, its core mission is to make sure AI won't harm humanity. 

Even though he helped lay the foundation for today's advanced AI, Bengio is increasingly worried about the technology over the past few years. In 2023, he signed an open letter urging AI companies to press pause on state-of-the-art AI development. Both because of AI's present harms (like bias against marginalized groups) and AI's future risks (like engineered bioweapons), there are very strong reasons to think that slowing down would have been a good thing.

But companies are companies. They did not slow down. In fact, they created autonomous AIs known as AI agents, which can view your computer screen, select buttons, and perform tasks — just like you can. Whereas ChatGPT needs to be prompted by a human every step of the way, an agent can accomplish multistep goals with very minimal prompting, similar to a personal assistant. Right now, those goals are simple — create a website, say — and the agents don't work that well yet. But Bengio worries that giving AIs agency is an inherently risky move: Eventually, they could escape human control and go “rogue.”

So now, Bengio is pivoting to a backup plan. If he can't get companies to stop trying to build AI that matches human smarts (artificial general intelligence, or AGI) or even surpasses human smarts (artificial superintelligence, or ASI), then he wants to build something that will block those AIs from harming humanity. He calls it “Scientist AI.”

Scientist AI won't be like an AI agent — it'll have no autonomy and no goals of its own. Instead, its main job will be to calculate the probability that some other AI's action would cause harm — and, if the action is too risky, block it. AI companies could overlay Scientist AI onto their models to stop them from doing something dangerous, akin to how we put guardrails along highways to stop cars from veering off course.

I talked to Bengio about why he's so disturbed by today's AI systems, whether he regrets doing the research that led to their creation, and whether he thinks throwing yet more AI at the problem will be enough to solve it. A transcript of our unusually candid conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. 

Sigal Samuel

When people express worry about AI, they often express it as a worry about artificial general intelligence or superintelligence. Do you think that's the wrong thing to be worrying about? Should we only worry about AGI or ASI insofar as it includes agency? 

Yoshua Bengio

Yes. You could have a superintelligent AI that doesn't “want” anything, and it's totally not dangerous because it doesn't have its own goals. It's just like a very smart encyclopedia.

Sigal Samuel

Researchers have been warning for years about the risks of AI systems, especially systems with their own goals and general intelligence. Can you explain what's making the situation increasingly scary to you now? 

Yoshua Bengio

In the last six months, we've gotten evidence of AIs that are so misaligned that they would go against our moral instructions. They would plan and do these bad things — lying, cheating, trying to persuade us with deceptions, and — worst of all — trying to escape our control and not wanting to be shut down, and doing anything [to avoid shutdown], including blackmail. These are not an immediate danger because they're all controlled experiments...but we don't know how to really deal with this.

Sigal Samuel 

And these bad behaviors increase the more agency the AI system has?

Yoshua Bengio

Yes. The systems we had last year, before we got into reasoning models, were much less prone to this. It's just getting worse and worse. That makes sense because we see that their planning ability is improving exponentially. And [the AIs] need good planning to strategize about things like “How am I going to convince these people to do what I want?” or “How do I escape their control?” So if we don't fix these problems quickly, we may end up with, initially, funny accidents, and later, not-funny accidents. 

That's motivating what we're trying to do at LawZero. We're trying to think about how we design AI more precisely, so that, by construction, it's not even going to have any incentive or reason to do such things. In fact, it's not going to want anything. 

Sigal Samuel 

Tell me about how Scientist AI could be used as a guardrail against the bad actions of an AI agent. I'm imagining Scientist AI as the babysitter of the agentic AI, double-checking what it's doing.

Yoshua Bengio

So, in order to do the job of a guardrail, you don't need to be an agent yourself. The only thing you need to do is make a good prediction. And the prediction is this: Is this action that my agent wants to do acceptable, morally speaking? Does it satisfy the safety specifications that humans have provided? Or is it going to harm somebody? And if the answer is yes, with some probability that's not very small, then the guardrail says: No, this is a bad action. And the agent has to [try a different] action. 

Sigal Samuel 

But even if we build Scientist AI, the domain of “What is moral or immoral?” is famously contentious. There's just no consensus. So how would Scientist AI learn what to classify as a bad action?

Yoshua Bengio

It's not for any kind of AI to decide what is right or wrong. We should establish that using democracy. Law should be about trying to be clear about what is acceptable or not. 

Now, of course, there could be ambiguity in the law. Hence you can get a corporate lawyer who is able to find loopholes in the law. But there's a way around this: Scientist AI is planned so that it will see the ambiguity. It will see that there are different interpretations, say, of a particular rule. And then it can be conservative about the interpretation — as in, if any of the plausible interpretations would judge this action as really bad, then the action is rejected. 

Sigal Samuel 

I think a problem there would be that almost any moral choice arguably has ambiguity. We've got some of the most contentious moral issues — think about gun control or abortion in the US — where, even democratically, you might get a significant proportion of the population that says they're opposed. How do you propose to deal with that?

Yoshua Bengio

I don't. Except by having the strongest possible honesty and rationality in the answers, which, in my opinion, would already be a big gain compared to the sort of democratic discussions that are happening. One of the features of the Scientist AI, like a good human scientist, is that you can ask: Why are you saying this? And he would come up with — not “he,” sorry! — it would come up with a justification. 

The AI would be involved in the dialogue to try to help us rationalize what are the pros and cons and so on. So I actually think that these sorts of machines could be turned into tools to help democratic debates. It's a little bit more than fact-checking — it's also like reasoning-checking.

Sigal Samuel 

This idea of developing Scientist AI stems from your disillusionment with the AI we've been developing so far. And your research was very foundational in laying the groundwork for that kind of AI. On a personal level, do you feel some sense of inner conflict or regret about having done the research that laid that groundwork? 

Yoshua Bengio 

I should have thought of this 10 years ago. In fact, I could have, because I read some of the early works in AI safety. But I think there are very strong psychological defenses that I had, and that most of the AI researchers have. You want to feel good about your work, and you want to feel like you're the good guy, not doing something that could cause in the future lots of harm and death. So we kind of look the other way. 

And for myself, I was thinking: This is so far into the future! Before we get to the science-fiction-sounding things, we're going to have AI that can help us with medicine and climate and education, and it's going to be great. So let's worry about these things when we get there. 

But that was before ChatGPT came. When ChatGPT came, I couldn't continue living with this internal lie, because, well, we are getting very close to human-level.

Sigal Samuel 

The reason I ask this is because it struck me when reading your plan for Scientist AI that you say it's modeled after the platonic idea of a scientist — a selfless, ideal person who's just trying to understand the world. I thought: Are you in some way trying to build the ideal version of yourself, this “he” that you mentioned, the ideal scientist? Is it like what you wish you could have been?

Yoshua Bengio 

You should do psychotherapy instead of journalism! Yeah, you're pretty close to the mark. In a way, it's an ideal that I have been looking toward for myself. I think that's an ideal that scientists should be looking toward as a model. Because, for the most part in science, we need to step back from our emotions so that we avoid biases and preconceived ideas and ego. 

Sigal Samuel 

A couple of years ago you were one of the signatories of the letter urging AI companies to pause cutting-edge work. Obviously, the pause did not happen. For me, one of the takeaways from that moment was that we're at a point where this is not predominantly a technological problem. It's political. It's really about power and who gets the power to shape the incentive structure. 

We know the incentives in the AI industry are horribly misaligned. There's massive commercial pressure to build cutting-edge AI. To do that, you need a ton of compute so you need billions of dollars, so you're practically forced to get in bed with a Microsoft or an Amazon. How do you propose to avoid that fate? 

Yoshua Bengio 

That's why we're doing this as a nonprofit. We want to avoid the market pressure that would force us into the capability race and, instead, focus on the scientific aspects of safety. 

I think we could do a lot of good without having to train frontier models ourselves. If we come up with a methodology for training AI that is convincingly safer, at least on some aspects like loss of control, and we hand it over almost for free to companies that are building AI — well, no one in these companies actually wants to see a rogue AI. It's just that they don't have the incentive to do the work! So I think just knowing how to fix the problem would reduce the risks considerably.

I also think that governments will hopefully take these questions more and more seriously. I know right now it doesn't look like it, but when we start seeing more evidence of the kind we've seen in the last six months, but stronger and more scary, public opinion might push sufficiently that we'll see regulation or some way to incentivize companies to behave better. It might even happen just for market reasons — like, [AI companies] could be sued. So, at some point, they might reason that they should be willing to pay some money to reduce the risks of accidents. 

Sigal Samuel

I was happy to see that LawZero isn't only talking about reducing the risks of accidents but is also talking about “protecting human joy and endeavor.” A lot of people fear that if AI gets better than them at things, well, what is the meaning of their life? How would you advise people to think about the meaning of their human life if we enter an era where machines have both agency and extreme intelligence? 

Yoshua Bengio 

I understand it would be easy to be discouraged and to feel powerless. But the decisions that human beings are going to make in the coming years as AI becomes more powerful — these decisions are incredibly consequential. So there's a sense in which it's hard to get more meaning than that! If you want to do something about it, be part of the thinking, be part of the democratic debate. 

I would advise us all to remind ourselves that we have agency. And we have an amazing task in front of us: to shape the future.

Washington Commanders managing partner Josh Harris discusses plans to transform the RFK Stadium site by 2030 on 'Special Report.'

The Washington Commanders will eventually return to the nation's capital and play at the old RFK Stadium site in a state-of-the-art stadium.

One of the keys to earning federal lawmakers' support in building the stadium there was to have "good-faith negotiations" about honoring the franchise's legacy as the Redskins and the Native American family that created the original logo the team used for decades before switching names. 

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., made it clear in November on Fox News Channel's "America Reports."

While Commanders team owner Josh Harris has made clear that the Commanders nickname is here to stay, Super Bowl champion Joe Theismann expressed optimism that the franchise will find a way to honor the logo and the family behind it.

"I think Josh Harris and his group are certainly well aware of what the Redskins were – obviously being a big fan growing up in this area, it's a dream come true I'm sure for him and some of the people that are a part of the ownership group," Theismann told Fox News Digital. "In some way, shape or form they possibly will honor it.

"I don't know whether people realize but the Redskin logo that was on our helmets was designed by a Native American, and it would be a great honor to be able to continue to honor the Native Americans and the tribes that are a part of that going forward. I mean, that's the way I felt when I put that uniform on. It was an honor for me to be able to represent the Washington Redskins, the Native Americans of this country. We won a Super Bowl, and I was given a chief's headdress. It would be nice again to sort of connect the old with the new."

Theismann was adamant that the new faces of the franchise should establish their own path forward as the Commanders like the Redskins of his day established theirs.

"Let this group of guys called the Commanders establish their own legacy," he said. "We had one, now it's their turn to establish theirs."

Blackie Wetzel was credited with creating the portrait of John Two Guns White Calf in 1971, which the Washington Redskins used in 1972, Fox News Digital previously reported. The descendants of Two Guns White Calf also called for the image to be back in the NFL.

Theismann spoke to Fox News Digital ahead of his appearance at the American Century Championship golf tournament at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Club.

The Arkansas Razorbacks, needing a win to stay alive in the NCAA College World Series, were one out away from forcing a rematch with the LSU Tigers on Wednesday night. 

However, left fielder Charles Davalan had a brutal blunder in the outfield in what could have been the end of the game. Instead, it helped LSU earn themselves a spot in the championship series. 

Tigers right-handed hitter Luis Hernandez roped a pitch to left field that went 104 mph off the bat, but it was hit directly at Davalan. However, it appeared the left fielder slipped and misjudged the ball, and it bounced off his shoulder and went toward the wall.

If that was not enough of a problem, there were runners on first and second for LSU, and they both scored to tie things up at five apiece. 

The Razorbacks had just taken the lead in the top of the ninth inning thanks to a Justin Thomas two-RBI single to left field, but it was all for naught in the end.

The Tigers celebrated their trip to the championship series, while Arkansas could not believe they did not force a rematch.

While LSU celebrated, Davalan was understandably emotional after the game. His Razorbacks teammates were seen consoling him as he let his emotions pour out on the field.

As The Atlantic continues a major expansion of its editorial staff, today editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg is announcing the hires of Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef as staff writers.  Nancy is joining from The Wall Street Journal where she was a national security correspondent; Toluse joins from The Washington Post, where he was a national political reporter and previously served as White House bureau chief; and Quinta has been a contributing writer for The Atlantic and senior editor at Lawfare.  Below is the staff announcement about Nancy, Toluse, and Quinta:

Dear everyone,  I'm writing to share the news that three excellent journalists are joining our team as staff writers: Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef. The Atlantic continues to be the premier destination for the most talented journalists in America, and the addition of these three extraordinarily talented writers simply underscores this point.  First, Quinta: Quinta's byline is actually a familiar one to you and to our readers; as a contributing writer here for the past several years, she's produced some of the most incisive coverage of the Trump years of anyone in journalism. Quinta was one of the people I looked to in the early days of the first Trump term to try to make sense of it all, and she delivered, time and time again. (Her Atlantic archive is a rich source of analysis and wisdom for those seeking to understand our political moment.)  Quinta is sharp, quick, and extremely adept at translating difficult concepts of law and governance into illuminating stories for the general reader. She is currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a senior editor at Lawfare, for which she previously served as managing editor. Quinta will be joining us at the Wharf.  Next, Tolu, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter known for his thoughtfulness, brilliant writing, and years of experience covering politics at the highest level. He is equally at home questioning presidents in the Oval Office as he is documenting the impact of their decision-making on the people they ostensibly serve. He joins us from The Washington Post, where he has been a national political reporter and the paper's White House bureau chief. Before joining the Post, Tolu did stints at Bloomberg News and The Miami Herald.  Tolu is the co-author of His Name is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, and was a finalist for the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. Tolu will be based at the Wharf.  And now, Nancy: Nancy is a fearless and experienced reporter with a great knowledge of the Middle East. She was based in Baghdad during the Iraq War and later in Cairo, where she covered the broader Muslim world. Her reporting from Iraq focused on the everyday experience of Iraqis and how the U.S.'s military presence reshaped the country's social and political dynamics.  Nancy comes to us from The Wall Street Journal, where she developed a reputation both as a scoop artist and as a tenacious leader among Pentagon and national security reporters. Before joining the Journal, she was a reporter at Buzzfeed News, the Daily Beast, McClatchy Newspapers, the Detroit Free Press, and the Baltimore Sun. Nancy will also be based at the Wharf.  Please join me in welcoming them to The Atlantic.  Best wishes,  Jeff

Alex Zverev continued his Wimbledon preparations with a dominant 6-2, 6-1 win over the US' Marcos Giron to reach the second round in Halle, despite his attention being temporarily diverted to help an injured fan in the stands.
    


            Play was halted in the first set with Zverev leading 5-2, 15-30 after a crash was heard inside the arena, with video footage showing that a piece of an advertising hoarding had fallen and struck a female spectator sitting in the tier below.

            The world No. 3 quickly went over and handed an ice pack to the fan, who held it against the back of her neck.
    


            “There has never been anything like this in our 32-year tournament history. We deeply regret the incident,” tournament director Ralf Weber said in a statement.
    


            The woman didn't suffer any “major injuries,” the statement added, but was taken to hospital “for safety reasons.”
    


            Weber also offered the spectator a season ticket for next year.
    


            Event managers Dr. Udo Kleine and Uwe Greipel-Dominik said in a joint statement that they suspect “drumming against the boards caused screws to come loose.”
    


            “This must not happen and we apologise. We will also check all the other boards and their fixings immediately after the Zverev match,” they added.
    


            Zverev, who is still searching for his first career grass title after defeat to Taylor Fritz in Sunday's Stuttgart Open final, will play Italy's Lorenzo Sonego in the second round.
    


            The German has twice previously reached the final in Halle, in 2016 and 2017, and is aiming for his seventh career title on home soil.

            After Supreme Court oral arguments last December, it was clear conservative justices had the votes to uphold state bans on gender care for trans youths under age 18. The question was how far the decision would sweep to affect trans individuals in other situations.
    


            In the end, Chief Justice John Roberts used the power of his office to keep the opinion for himself. He penned a decision that affirmed state restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but he declined to adopt the reasoning of some conservatives that could have made transgender people even more vulnerable to discrimination.
    


            Roberts, by virtue of his position as chief, assigns opinions when he is in the majority. He regularly keeps the most significant cases for himself, as he did in the controversy over President Donald Trump's assertion of immunity from prosecution last year. Yet Roberts, now in his 20th year in the center chair, also strategically assigns cases to restrain or otherwise influence the court's holding.
    


            On Wednesday, he fended off the more aggressive right-wing sentiment. In his seven-minute statement from the mahogany bench and in his written opinion, Roberts adopted a cut-and-dried tone. He eschewed the heat of the three liberal dissenters, as well as the conservatives who broke off to write their own statements. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, insisted medical experts “have surreptitiously compromised their medical recommendations to achieve political ends,” and Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised concerns about boys' and girls' sports teams.

            All told, Roberts appeared to try to lower the temperature on the combustible issue of trans rights – which Trump promised to curtail during his 2024 reelection bid. Since taking office again in January, multiple executive orders have targeted trans people, including servicemembers in the US military.
    


            The chief justice's 24-page opinion, to be sure, thoroughly rejected the challenge to a Tennessee law that forbids healthcare providers from providing hormones and other treatment for children under age 18 to transition or, as the law states, to “identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's biological sex.”
    


            He said the classification related to age and medical use, rather than to sex, which would have meant it was more likely to violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantee.
    


            The disputed Tennessee law permits puberty blockers and hormones for minors to treat some conditions, such as a congenital defect or precocious puberty, but not to treat gender dysphoria – that is, the incongruence between one's gender identity and sex assigned at birth.
    


            Roberts referred to evolving medical assessment of potential harms associated with such treatment, primarily in European countries, as he emphasized that the Tennessee legislature had sufficient grounds for the regulation of medical treatment for minors.
    


            Advocates for the children and families in the high court case argued that hormone treatment can be crucial to the health and wellbeing of transgender adolescents. They contended the Tennessee law amounted to a type of sex discrimination that would have warranted a tougher standard of judicial review.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the three liberal dissenters, lamented Roberts' approach. “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”
    


            Roberts declined to address whether transgender individuals would specifically merit heightened protection under the Constitution. Yet, Barrett and Thomas, along with Justice Samuel Alito, would have taken on that question, disfavoring trans individuals. (The remaining two conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, signed Roberts' opinion and wrote nothing more.)
    


            Barrett opened her separate statement by asserting that she would have ruled that transgender people do not constitute a class of people who deserve special protection in the law.
    


            “Beyond the treatment of gender dysphoria, transgender status implicates several other areas of legitimate regulatory policy—ranging from access to restrooms to eligibility for boys' and girls' sports teams,” she wrote, joined by Thomas, and adding that if laws singling out transgender people required heightened constitutional scrutiny, “then the courts will inevitably be in the business of closely scrutinizing legislative choices in all these domains.”
    


            In their own separate writings, Thomas and Alito reiterated their criticism of the court's 2020 case, Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that employees fired for being gay or transgender can sue under the prohibition on sex discrimination in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Roberts' opinion neither retrenched on Bostock nor extended it beyond the Title VII employment context to the case at hand.
    


            Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said of the court's Wednesday decision, “It's a devastating loss for trans youth and their families who have lost their essential medical care, but it's significant that the opinion is cabined both on the record and on doctrine. We live to fight another day on other laws discriminating against transgender Americans, including our cases challenging Trump's animus-fueled policies.
    


 During oral arguments in December, Roberts foreshadowed his concern that legislators should play the leading role on trans rights:
    


            “We might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else,” Roberts said at the time, “but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.”
    


            That statement recalled similar sentiment from 10 years ago when Roberts dissented as the five-justice majority declared a right to same-sex marriage.
    


            “Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law,” he wrote in that 2015 case of Obergefell v. Hodges. “Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept. … Just who do we think we are?”
    


            That was unusually strident for the chief. Roberts felt so strongly about the case that it marked the first and only time he had dissented aloud from the courtroom bench. (Justices take that rare step when they want to call particular attention to their dissenting view, as Sotomayor did on Wednesday.)
    


            As Roberts referred to legislative control of policy, he avoided the dramatic flourish of 2015.
    


            “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,” he wrote as he concluded his opinion in United States v. Skrmetti. “… (W)e leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
    


            For as much as Roberts confined the decision to medical treatment for trans minors, the Trump administration has already signaled that it would try to use the Skrmetti case to augment its actions against transgender servicemembers.
    


            For the liberal dissenters, the current Trump agenda was in the foreground.
    


            As Justice Barrett questioned whether trans individuals had faced government discrimination, Sotomayor wrote, “Transgender people have long been subject to discrimination in healthcare, employment, and housing, and to rampant harassment and physical violence.
    


            And directly citing Barrett's opinion, Sotomayor added, “(T)hose searching for more evidence of de jure discrimination against transgender individuals, need look no further than the present. The Federal Government, for example, has started expelling transgender servicemembers from the military and threatening to withdraw funding from schools and nonprofits that espouse support for transgender individuals.”
    


            Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, pointed to “the recent rise in discriminatory state and federal policies and the fact that transgender people are underrepresented in every branch of government,” and said the court majority had rendered “transgender Americans doubly vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination.”

The Israeli Defense Forces warned Iranians within the area of Iran's Arak heavy water reactor to evacuate on Wednesday.

The Farsi-language warning included a red circle around the reactor that indicated it would be targeted for a military strike. The reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran.

It noted that any presence within the area will endanger citizens' lives and that the move is a part of Israel's assault on Iran's military infrastructure.

Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns. Heavy water cools nuclear reactors but creates as a byproduct plutonium, which can be used in a nuclear weapon and could have given Iran a different path to a nuclear bomb instead of enriched uranium. 

In 2019, the country started up the heavy water reactor's secondary circuit, which at the time did not violate the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal meant the United Kingdom had to step in for America in helping Iran redesign the Arak reactor to limit the amount of plutonium it produces.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations's nuclear watchdog, urged Israel in the past not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. But the IAEA has said it lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran's heavy water production due to Iranian restrictions on its inspections.

Israel and Iran's recent conflict has been prompted by a lack of success in disarming Iran's nuclear program. Israel said it believed Iran would have nuclear weapons soon, and struck top generals, nuclear scientists, and nuclear sites to sink the country's nuclear effort.

Trump has adamantly said he doesn't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon and is reportedly considering involving the United States in the conflict to strike Iranian nuclear sites.

TRUMP DEMANDS IRAN'S ‘UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.' AND NOW WE WAIT.

“Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple — you don't have to go too deep into it. They just can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said on Tuesday.

The intelligence community has denied that Iran's nuclear program has changed since March, when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building a bomb.

ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Erick powered up into a Category 3 major hurricane Wednesday evening as it bore down on the southern Mexico coast, threatening to unleash destructive winds, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge on the region in coming hours, forecasters said. 

Swiftly strengthening from a Category 1 hurricane hours earlier, Erick had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (200 kph) by nightfall as it churned offshore about 55 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of Puerto Angel, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

Erick was also about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Punta Maldonado and moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph) toward an expected landfall sometime Thursday morning, according to the center's latest advisory. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph). Forecasters said further strengthening is expected and devastating wind damage is possible near where the eye crashes ashore. 




The projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.

In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.

Some beaches were already closed, but tourists continued to sunbathe on others hours earlier as the storm gained strength well offshore.

On a beach in Acapulco, a line of people waited for the help of a backhoe to pull their boats out of the water.

Adrián Acevedo Durantes, 52, hauls tourists around Acapulco's picturesque coastline in boats. Two of his boats sank in Hurricane Otis and a third was badly damaged.

“We're taking precautions because with Otis we never expected one of that magnitude to come and now with climate change the water is warmer and the hurricanes are more powerful,” Acevedo said.

This time the port administration ordered that no one ride out the storm aboard their boats. During Otis many lost their lives by staying on boats in the harbor, which had traditionally been how they ensured their safety during previous storms. He said knew some of those lost at sea.

He acknowledged that it was sunny and the water calm Wednesday afternoon, making it hard to imagine a major storm was on the way, but said “with Otis it was calm all day, sunny, then at midnight there were two hours of strong winds and we saw what had happened the next day.”

Francisco Casarubio, a 46-year-old choreographer, carried a carton of eggs as he did some last-minute shopping ahead of the storm. He planned to pick up rice, beans and some canned food as well.

His home flooded and lost power in Otis and said he was taking Erick more seriously, but hadn't had time to shop until Wednesday.

Forecasters said Erick was expected to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Ángel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane center advisory.

Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick's possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday.

Even though the wind had yet to pick up at the Zicatela beach, red flags were up to warn people to stay out of the water. But some surfers ignored them as they continued to ride waves.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said all schools were closed Wednesday and the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators to make their boats storm-ready. Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes.

President Claudia Sheinbaum warned in her daily briefing that those in the hurricane's path should heed government instructions and wait out the storm in their homes or designated shelters.

Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick was churning through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification — when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours — which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed lower Thursday as investors reacted to the Bank of England's monetary policy decision and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed down by 0.8%, with most sectors and major bourses in negative territory. The French CAC 40 index slumped 1.3% while Germany's DAX was off by 1.1%.

By sector, travel and leisure stocks were the biggest losers, declining 2.4%. Oil and gas shares were the standout gainers, climbing 0.7% on the back of rising crude prices.

CNBC's Jenni Reid reflects on this week's Paris Air Show, taking a look at the key themes and the one major player that kept a lower profile due to turmoil at its business — Boeing.

"Muted" was the word of the week, while defense made up nearly half of the show's content this year amid roiling Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and an upcoming NATO summit at which higher national security spending will be high on the agenda.

Airbus racked up nearly $21 billion in orders as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation.

Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate at 46% despite cooling inflation, in view of what it cited as geopolitical and trade tensions that threaten to spike prices again.

"The underlying inflation trend has declined in May" and "has continued to decline in June," the bank's monetary policy committee wrote in a statement alongside its decision announcement.

The committee noted that demand had slowed, and that "the potential effects of geopolitical developments and increasing protectionism in global trade on the disinflation process are being closely monitored."

"Inflation expectations and pricing behaviors continue to be risk factors for the disinflation process," the statement added. Inflation has been steadily declining in Turkey, and currently stands at 35.4%.

The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.25% as widely expected, after inflation appeared to be stickier than previously expected.

U.K. consumer prices rose by 3.4% in May on an annualized basis, 0.8 percentage points higher than in March. Economists have preferred to skip over a reading from April, due to a correction in the Office for National Statistics data.

Norway's central bank has cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25% for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Norges Bank had in March suggested it was expecting to cut its key sight deposit rate in June, and followed through.

"Inflation has declined since the monetary policy meeting in March, and the inflation outlook for the coming year indicates lower inflation than previously expected," said Ida Wolden Bache, the central bank's governor. "A cautious normalisation of the policy rate will pave the way for inflation to return to target without restricting the economy more than necessary."

The interest rate cuts were largely expected by economists. Goldman Sachs' Sven Jari Stehn cited the central bank's guidance from earlier in the year, along with "inflation and wage expectations appearing benign" to accurately forecast the cut earlier in the week.

Paris-listed shares of Teleperformance have rebounded more than 3% after a violent trading day in its stock, which saw hundreds of millions of euros wiped off the value of the company.

The company presented its "Future Forward" strategy on Wednesday to outline how it intends to use artificial intelligence in its business to grow revenue in the medium term. However, investors appeared to be unconvinced and drove down the stock over 13%, the most since July 2024.

Analysts said the company's management "must be feeling deflated" over the share price reaction despite their efforts to pivot their strategy.

Teleperformance's stock has been plagued by fears over how AI is expected to disrupt the company's business model. The firm provides outsourced customer care and back office services to large enterprises, which investors believe will be displaced by generative AI being deployed directly by its customers.

In February 2024, the stock price declined by nearly 15% in a single day after a report from an unrelated Swedish fintech firm, Klarna, suggested it had successfully replaced customer service roles at that company with AI.

Teleperformance shares have lost 78% of their value since their high in January 2022.

"After three tumultuous years, the market telling management that AI is going to render their business model obsolete, and a substantial amount of prep to showcase the group's AI capabilities at the [capital markets day], the market has baulked at the plans to future-proof the business - by European close, [more than] €700m had been wiped off the market cap of the company, greater than the entire executed and planned investments in AI-related partnerships (JVs) and M&A over the 2025-28 period," said RBC Capital Markets analysts Karl Green and Andrew Brooke in a note to clients on June 18.

"On this basis, we think TEP needs to just get its head down and quietly deliver, either in the public market domain, or behind closed doors in the private sphere," they added. "In the meantime, we continue to see the stock as a fundamentally mispriced asset, though recognise that high realized volatility poses a barrier to those with shorter investment horizons."

The Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points to 0% — adding to concerns over a potential return to negative rates.

The reduction was widely expected by markets ahead of the decision, after traders priced in an around 81% chance of a quarter-point cut and around a 19% chance of a bigger 50-basis-point cut.

While other nations continue to battle inflation, Switzerland faces deflation, with consumer prices falling by an annual 0.1% in May.

Low levels of inflation are not unusual for Switzerland — the country has seen several periods of deflation in the 2010s and 2020s. The strength of the country's currency, the Swiss franc, is a major contributor to this trend.

All major European stock markets had a negative start on Thursday, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.63% as global investors monitor tensions between Israel and Iran and the potential for U.S. involvement.

Most sectors are lower, though telecoms nudged slightly higher, with Vodafone up 1% after announcing Pilar López would join the company from Microsoft as its chief financial officer from October.

Energy stocks are also pushing higher, with the Stoxx Oil and Gas index up 0.8%, as crude prices continue to rise on Middle East uncertainty. ICE Brent Crude futures were last up 0.83% to $77.33 a barrel.

The Swiss National Bank on Thursday backed the Swiss government's proposals to strengthen the health of the country's financial system against eventual crises, including by imposing additional capital requirements on banking giant UBS.

Earlier this month, Swiss authorities proposed a new requirement for UBS — Switzerland's largest systemic lender — to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital to allay possible shocks to the Swiss financial system, in the event of the bank's collapse. UBS has been fighting such measures since its government-aided takeover of stricken domestic peer Credit Suisse in 2023, citing the erosion of its competitiveness.

In its Financial Stability Report 2025 out Thursday, the SNB acknowledged year-on-year improvements in the profitability of the Swiss banking sector led by UBS last year. It nevertheless noted integration costs linked to the Credit Suisse merger still weighed on the lender's profitability and that "standalone capital ratios of the parent bank overestimate its true resilience."

"It is important to address this regulatory weakness and introduce further policy measures as proposed by the Federal Council," the SNB said, "also because the loss potential for UBS under the various SNB stress scenarios remains substantial."

The central bank endorsed the Swiss government's proposal for a parent bank's participation in its foreign subsidiaries to be fully deducted from its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) capital, which is typically designed to cover losses immediately as they occur.

"From a financial stability perspective, this approach is the best solution to ensure full capital backing of the foreign participations and thus robust capitalisation of the parent bank," the SNB said, acknowledging that UBS already meets the "too big to fail" capital requirements applicable as of 2030.

The British pound is 0.22% lower against the U.S. dollar at $1.339 at 7:25 a.m. in London, and flat at a euro rate of around 0.855, ahead of the Bank of England rate decision at midday.

A rate hold is widely expected with figures on Wednesday confirming inflation remains well above the BOE's 2% target, coming in at 3.4% in May.

The Federal Reserve also kept rates on hold at its meeting yesterday, and trimmed its projection for reductions in the coming years. The greenback has been given an even bigger boost over the last week by a safe haven flight amid fears over escalating conflict in the Middle East.

ING FX Strategist Francesco Pesole, meanwhile, in a Tuesday note, pointed to signs of the euro strengthening against sterling, unless the BOE surprises with a more hawkish-than-expected message today. Higher interest rates tend to support a domestic currency.

"Geopolitical risks generally harm the pound more than the euro, and the data flow has been GBP-negative of late," Pesole said.

It's a big day for central bank action on Thursday, with monetary policy decisions coming from Turkey, Norway, Switzerland and Britain.

The central banks of the latter two countries will be closely watched, with the Swiss National Bank likely to lower its interest rate to zero this week. The Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates, but investors will be waiting to see how policymakers voted and for any guidance on the rate cut trajectory, with most analysts expecting a cut in August.

There are no other major earnings or data releases in Europe. U.S. markets are closed for the Juneteenth holiday on Thursday.

Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 22 points higher at 8,862, Germany's DAX down 88 points at 23,253, France's CAC 40 lower 32 points at 7,619 and Italy's FTSE MIB dropping 105 points to 39,321.

Global market sentiment is becoming more skittish over the conflict between Iran and Israel and the possibility of further U.S. involvement.

On Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump convened his national security advisors in the White House Situation Room for the second time in two days. Earlier, Trump said he had not yet decided whether to give the greenlight to a U.S. strike in support of Israel's ongoing bombardment of Iranian targets.

Investors are also weighing the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged in a 4.25%-4.5% range, where it has stood since December.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed committee will wait to see the impact of Trump's broad-spanning tariffs on inflation before considering any adjustments to monetary policy. Still, the central bank pointed to two interest rate cuts later this year.

President Donald Trump ripped into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "destructive," after the central bank kept interest rates steady on Wednesday.

Trump said "Too Late" Powell is costing the United States "hundreds of billions of dollars" by not cutting rates, leveling a familiar criticism against the Fed chair who has repeatedly ignored Trump's pressure campaign to cut rates.

"We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden's Short Term Debt," Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social.

Trump also criticized Powell late Wednesday, calling him a "real dummy" in a near-midnight Truth Social post.

Powell, whose term ends in May of 2026, said Wednesday that, "for the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies."

Trump's remarks were in response to the Federal Open Market Committee keeping its borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, which is on par with where it's been since December.

The criticisms were not surprising, as the president has long slammed Powell for not lowering interest rates.

As recently as Wednesday morning, hours before the Fed was set to release its decision on interest rates, Trump said: "So we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won't cut today."

"Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he's a political guy, I don't know. He's a political guy who's not a smart person, but he's costing the country a fortune," he said outside the White House.

Trump even mused about appointing himself to lead the Federal Reserve, saying, "I'd do a much better job than these people."

Trump has said that he intends to announce his pick for the next chair of the Federal Reserve "very soon."

Airbus orders and new models have taken center-stage at this year's Paris Air Show, as its U.S. rival Boeing spends yet another major industry event keeping a low profile due to turmoil at the business.

Airlines and manufacturers use air shows as an opportunity to make splashy aircraft purchase announcements following months of negotiations, some of which will be wrapped up at the event. Airbus had racked up nearly $21 billion as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation.

That included 132 firm orders on Monday, from customers including Saudi leasing firm AviLease, Japan's ANA and Poland's LOT, versus 41 for Boeing and 15 for Brazil's Embraer, according to a tally by aviation advisory IBA.

The following two days saw Boeing hold back from announcements completely, while Airbus splashed a 150-aircraft Memorandum of Understanding with VietJet Air focused on its single-aisle 100 A321neos, and orders with EgyptAir and Starlux Airlines for its wide-body A350s.

Air Asia chief Tony Fernandes told CNBC on Thursday that he was in discussions at Paris about expanding the firm's existing order for the Airbus XLR — the Toulouse-based planemaker's flagship new long-range, narrowbody aircraft — and expected an announcement within the next month or so. The model, which entered service last year, is set to allow airlines to offer medium- and long-haul routes at lower rates due to reduced fuel costs.

Embraer also secured a key win Wednesday with 60 firm orders for the E175, along with further options.

Boeing's relatively quiet presence in Paris isn't indicative of a wider demand crisis in the sector. The manufacturer sealed plenty of orders during U.S. President Donald Trump's May trip to the Middle East, including a 210-jet deal with Qatar Airways.

Both Boeing and Airbus meanwhile have aircraft backlogs of more than 5,000 and 8,000 aircraft, respectively, figures that have barely budged for nearly a decade as industry supply challenges — exacerbated in the wake of the pandemic — leave airlines struggling to renew their ageing fleets.

John Plueger, chief executive officer of Air Lease Corp, told CNBC earlier this week that the backlog meant it was always expected to be a subdued show in Paris compared to those past, including the post-pandemic boom year of 2023. "Both Airbus and Boeing are all sold out to 2031 and '32 anyway. So how many follow-on orders into the '33, '34, '35 time frame are you really going to see? ... But overall, the demand environment remains very robust," Plueger said.

However, this does mark yet another year in which Boeing has refrained from the aircraft flypasts or major promotional activities. Starting in 2019 in the wake of the two fatal crashes of its B737-Max model, followed by the pandemic which threw the industry into turmoil, and then with fresh crises delivered via an emergency exit door blowout, allegations of widespread quality control issues, and increasingly-disgruntled customers over delivery delays — Boeing has had a host of reasons to avoid the spotlight.

Just as 2025 appeared like it may represent a tentative turning point for the company, with CEO Kelly Ortberg due to attend Paris, the first-ever crash of a Boeing Dreamliner in last week's Air India disaster threw that into disarray. Ortberg pulled out of attending the event, and the firm has made few press announcements while it says it is focused on its customers and the investigation into the causes of the crash.

"Demand for new aircraft remains unprecedented, matched only by passenger demand for air travel," said Tony Payne, partner at law firm DLA Piper.

He added that orders remain strong despite a "sombre and reflective environment" in the wake of the Air India crash, as stakeholders are "well aware of the impact" any relaxation of standards can have.

"Orders for new aircraft and engines remains strong but alongside a sombre and reflective environment, where stakeholders are well aware of the impact of any relaxation of standards can have."

"Muted" has therefore become the word of the week in terms of commercial aviation, while defense — making up nearly half of the show's content this year — takes on a bigger-than-ever role amid roiling Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and an upcoming NATO summit at which higher national security spending will be high on the agenda. Deals in this space have included Thales' contract to build 48 of its new remote-operated artillery systems for the French government.

"The consequences, the impact of the accident of Air India" are hanging over Paris, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC on Monday. "Still, the momentum in the industry is very strong," he continued, noting particular demand for widebody aircraft which had more catching up to do following the pandemic than the narrowbody market.

Dan Taylor, head of consulting at IBA, told CNBC that the split between Boeing and Airbus this year was "more about context than competition."

"Boeing's recent orders in the Middle East, helped by U.S. diplomatic engagement, and its quiet stance post-Air India likely influenced its lower visibility at the Paris Air Show. This isn't a sign of weakening demand, but rather a deliberate pause amid a volatile geopolitical backdrop and possible tariff uncertainties," Taylor said.

"Airlines are likely busy reassessing fleet strategies given the latest crisis, but strong profitability, ageing fleets, easing debt levels, and continued GDP and travel demand growth across many regions all point to a sustained long-term appetite for new aircraft."

According to Columbia Business School professor Michael Chad Hoeppner, the popular idea that you have 7 seconds to make a first impression may be a tad too strict.

"I'm not going to give people quite that amount of scarcity, but the beginning really matters a lot," he says.

During a job interview, Hoeppner says, you have approximately 90 seconds to engage your interviewer's attention — and how you speak is key.

Clear communication isn't just about what you say, but how you say it, as Hoeppner attests in his latest book "Don't Say Um: How to Communicate Effectively to Live a Better Life."

The way someone delivers information "has a lot to do with how we hear each other, and whose ideas we take seriously or not seriously," he says.

Here are Hoeppner's tips to make the best first impression at job interviews.

Hoeppner, who also coaches political candidates, compares the beginning of an interview to the start of a presidential debate. Some debaters make the mistake of treating the first question as a "warm-up," but Hoeppner cautions that viewers often tune out after the first few minutes.

"People's attention spans are worse than they've ever been. They've been hijacked entirely, and so we tend to have less time to actually make an impression," he says.

The same goes for job interviews: "You may only get one answer at all that anyone actually pays attention to, so you have to make sure that one answer counts."

Even simple, open-ended prompts like "Tell me about yourself" provide crucial opportunities to make your case as a candidate.

"You have a tremendous amount of latitude with those questions, and you often can take them anywhere that you want to," he says.

Hoeppner recommends starting your responses with specific, vivid stories and anecdotes so that interviewers "remember what the heck you say and actually understand what you mean."

During interviews, Hoeppner notes that nervous job candidates often alter their natural tone and manner of speaking in an effort to seem professional.

Instead, they end up coming off as a robotic, "less interesting version" of themselves: "They speak in a more monotonous voice, they restrain their hand gestures and they anchor eye contact unblinkingly forward the entire time."

Hoeppner recommends relaxing your posture and body language, making meaningful (but not constant) eye contact, and speaking clearly and confidently.

These communication skills are crucial in all areas of work, Hoeppner says.

In the office, your communication skills can be just as important as the quality of your work. Even brilliant employees' careers can end up stagnating because they can't communicate their ideas in a dynamic way.

"What happens is then they don't get promotions to be in client-facing roles or in leadership roles," Hoeppner says.

The only way to get better at speaking is to practice, Hoeppner says.

To get ready for an interview, Hoeppner recommends a method he calls "loud drafting": giving yourself an open-ended prompt and repeatedly answering it out loud.

"The first time you do it, it will be bad," he says. "That's fine. Do it again, do it again, do it again."

The point of this exercise is to practice answering questions in a natural way, he says. Some job candidates prepare for interviews by jotting down prepared statements, but they frequently sound stiff and unnatural when said out loud.

"The way in which we speak is different than how we write," he says. "Often, people open their mouths in interviews and a bunch of polysyllabic pablum comes pouring out of their mouth."

In general, Hoeppner recommends "flexing your talking muscles" by chatting casually with people you meet and switching your phone calls to FaceTime.

According to Hoeppner, in-person communication skills will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology. With almost-limitless access to information, Hoeppner asks, "what determines whose ideas get paid more attention?

His answer: "Very likely how you say them."

Urgent international calls for restraint appear to be falling on deaf ears as the world braces for intensifying conflict in the Middle East.

All eyes are on the White House, as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs carrying out direct military strikes on Iran. Such an act would represent a dramatic deepening of U.S. involvement in what has thus far been limited to attacks between Iran and U.S. ally Israel.

The Kremlin warned Thursday that U.S. intervention in Iran would set off a "terrible spiral of escalation," while Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters that the world is "millimeters" away from nuclear catastrophe. Russia is currently mired in its own war in Ukraine, which also involves a fight over a major nuclear power plant.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired an emergency Cobra meeting — the country's national crisis management system — as his government works to withdraw the families of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv.

The high-level intelligence meeting followed Starmer's presence at the G7 summit in Canada, during which he joined other leaders of the group in reiterating their "commitment to peace and stability."

But chances at diplomacy are looking increasingly bleak as Iran and Israel continue to trade increasingly deadly blows and leaders of the countries involved show no sign of stepping back from the brink.

Trump remained noncommittal in his comments on whether the U.S. would attack Iran.

"I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate," he told reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday.

He added that "the next week is going to be big."

The president said later from the Oval Office that he likes to "make the final decision one second before it's due… because things change. Especially with war."

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stirred some controversy, saying in an interview Tuesday that Israel was doing the "dirty work" for other countries by carrying out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.

"I can only say I have the greatest respect for the fact that the Israeli army and the Israeli government had the courage to do this," Merz told a German broadcaster. The foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the U.K. are set to meet with their Iranian counterpart on Friday.

Meanwhile, China's Xinhua state media service cited Chinese Premier Xi Jinping saying that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is "an urgent priority" and that the use of force is not the right way to resolve the conflict.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi held a phone call Thursday, during which both men strongly condemned Israel, saying the country's actions in Iran "violated the UN Charter and other norms of international law," according to a Kremlin aide.

The leaders, both of whom are allies of Iran, said that military action would not resolve the issues Western and Israeli leaders have over Iran's nuclear program and that diplomacy was the only way forward.

It comes after Trump posted comments on his Truth Social platform earlier this week, demanding that Iran unconditionally surrender and warning that the U.S. has the capability to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Khamenei responded by saying that any American attack on Iran would be met with "irreparable damage" and spark a wider war.

Overnight, Israel and Iran traded missile barrages, with Israel striking Iran's Arak and Natanz nuclear facilities, while Iran said it hit a hospital in Israel's Negev region after aiming for a military site.

At least 30 people were injured in the strike on the hospital, authorities said, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz saying after the attack that Iran's leader "can no longer be allowed to exist."

Samsung will unveil a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone at a launch likely set to take place next month, as it battles Chinese rivals to deliver the slimmest devices to the market.

Folding phones, which have a single screen that can fold in half, came in focus when Samsung first launched such a device in 2019. But Chinese players, in particular Honor and Oppo, have since aggressively released foldables that are thinner and lighter than Samsung's offerings.

Why are slim foldables important?

"With foldables, thinness has become more critical than ever because people aren't prepared to accept the compromise for a thicker and heavier phone to get the real estate that a folding phone can deliver," Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC on Thursday.

Honor, Oppo and other Chinese players have used their slim designs to differentiate themselves from Samsung.

Let's look at a comparison: Samsung's last foldable from 2024, the Galaxy Z Fold6, is 12.1 millimeter ~(0.48 inches) thick when folded and weighs 239 grams (8.43 oz). Oppo's Find N5, which was released earlier this year, is 8.93 millimeters thick when closed and weighs 229 grams. The Honor Magic V3, which was launched last year, is 9.2 millimeters when folded and weighs 226 grams.

"Samsung needs to step up" in foldables, Wood said.

And that's what the South Korean tech giant is planning to do at its upcoming launch, which is likely to take place next month.

"The newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet – meticulously crafted and built to last," Samsung said in a preview blog post about the phone earlier this month.

But the competition is not letting up. Honor is planning a launch on July 2 in China for its latest folding phone, the Magic V5.

"The interesting thing for Samsung, if they can approach the thinness that Honor has achieved it is will be a significant step up from predecessor, it will be a tangible step up in design," Wood said.

Despite these advances by way of foldables, the market for the devices has not been as exciting as many had hoped.

CCS Insight said that foldables will account for just 2% of the overall smartphone market this year. Thinner phones may be one way to address the sluggish market, but consumer preferences would also need to change.

"There is a chance that by delivering much thinner foldables that are more akin to the traditional monoblock phone, it will provide an opportunity to turn consumer heads and get them to revisit the idea of having a folding device," Wood said.

"However, I would caution foldables do remain problematic because in many cases consumers struggle to see why they need a folding device."

Although the market remains small for foldables compared to traditional smartphones, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities on Wednesday said Apple  — which has been notably absent from this product line-up — plans to make a folding iPhone starting next year.

U.S.: Sunday-Thursday, 23:00-0000 ETAsia: Monday-Friday, 11:00-12:00 SIN/HK, 08:30-09:30 India Europe: Monday-Friday, 0500-06:00 CET

Twelve months ago, India's initial public offering market was booming, with tech startups from food and grocery delivery player Swiggy to electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ola Electric at the cusp of their debut.

Many companies wanted to go public in the South Asian powerhouse, riding on the coattails of India's growth story.

This year, however, there has been a pronounced change.

There have been just 99 listings so far, compared to 147 in the same period a year ago, according to FactSet data.

Several companies, including education loan provider Avanse Financial Services, contract drug manufacturer Anthem Biosciences and LG Electronics' India unit, have put their listing plans on hold given weak investor sentiment and the bleak macroeconomic outlook, despite having received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

To add to that, the debut of electric scooter maker Ather Energy on May 6 — which came after a two-month lull in mainboard listings — failed to alleviate market concerns. The stock is down more than 3%, after opening at 328 Indian rupees ($3.79) per share — a premium of around 2% to its issue price of 321 rupees.

"The IPO market was dismal, especially in the first quarter, because of a weak rupee and global volatility from the wars and constantly evolving tariff situation," Peeyush Mittal, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, told CNBC's Inside India.

Additionally, foreign portfolio investments fell 220% in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to the National Securities Depository.

A more pressing problem, however, has been the impact of slowing consumption levels on corporate earnings, Rishika Chandan, managing partner at Venturi Partners, said.

Many good private equity-backed consumer brands, which would have historically posted a 35% to 40% jump in their profitability per annum, only grew 15% to 20% in FY2025 ended March, no thanks to tighter consumer purse strings, Chandan added.

"That is not a great number to go to the market with," she said, adding that companies have now pushed back their listing plans, in part, to capitalize on higher sales during festive seasons later in the year.

While the Reserve Bank of India's recent rate cut and the government's measures to stimulate consumption may eventually translate into higher spending, Chandan says more time will still be needed for corporates to see stronger revenue and profit numbers.

"Anybody wanting to go public will likely stretch it out and wait for the valuation markup. That will also give them higher forward value, which will allow for an IPO underwriting based on the evaluation of profitability," Chandan added.

As the year stretches into the second half, there has been a subtle shift in the Indian markets, leading to hopes of a pickup in listing momentum.

For instance, $6.4 billion was raised from the Indian markets through share sales in May, making it the highest monthly total since December 2024. Block trades were the biggest contributor at $5.5 billion. The sales activity shows no signs of slowing down this month, with at least 10 blocks raising $1.2 billion in just the first week, per data compiled by Bloomberg.

India's "fundamentals are solid," Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, CEO of Wrise Wealth Management Middle East, says.

"With over $12 billion in SEBI-cleared IPOs and more than 130 companies in the wings, India's primary market is simply pausing before its next leap. The second half of the year will tell a very different story," he told CNBC's Inside India.

Sengupta foresees several listings, including that of Reliance Jio, Tata Capital and LG Electronics India.

The Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio is expected to go public later this year in an approximately 400 billion Indian rupee listing. Sengupta expects the company — which is the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries — to be "one of India's largest ever [listings], showcasing the ambition to monetize a digital ecosystem at scale."

Similarly, Tata Capital is reportedly slated to get regulatory approval to list for $2 billion soon. The listing of the Tata Sons subsidiary, which provides a range of personal finance and corporate loans, "signifies how even conservative conglomerates now view public capital as strategic, not just financial," Sengupta noted.

Elsewhere, the wealth manager considers LG Electronics India's listing a "game changer." If successful, it will indicate foreign multinationals' interest in Indian markets given its "domestic retail flows and regulatory stability," he added.

Among startups, Venturi's Chandan and Nicholas Cator are keeping a close eye on the listing of Lenskart, which is backed by Softbank, KKR and Temasek. The eyewear company is reportedly close to filing a draft of its preliminary proposal and may raise $1 billion from its listing.

Cator, founder and managing partner at Venturi, is curious about how much it can amass on the public market. "Lenskart has done well as a company, and its numbers are good. So, its listing will be a good indicator for private investors on how to value companies, especially in pre-IPO rounds."

Other listings Carter and Chandan are watching include that of cleaning and personal care services provider Urban Company, which filed its documents in April and jewelry player Bluestone, which is gunning for unicorn status ahead of its IPO.

The optimism of India's IPO market is sometimes marred by concerns over elevated valuations of its stock market.

Matthews Asia's Mittal foresees some marquee IPOs in India coming in at a 25% to 30% discount to the leading player in their space, unlike last year when many IPOs were priced at a premium.

"Everybody wanted to take the valuation higher, but our expectation is that valuations are already normalizing, largely because some of the IPOs in the tail end of 2024 haven't really performed well," he said, naming Swiggy and Ola Electric as such companies that are now trading below their debut price.

Going forward, Mittal and WRISE's Sengupta expect India's capital markets to be buoyant with new equity issuances and a potentially stronger listing pipeline as the country grows to soon become the fourth largest in the world.

"India today is reminiscent of the U.S. in the early 2000s and China in the post-2009 era — when IPO markets matured from speculative growth to strategic listings. India is no longer just an emerging market — it's becoming an IPO destination with depth, diversity, and discipline," Sengupta said.

Modi and Trump disagree on U.S.' role in Pakistan ceasefire. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday, in which he "clearly conveyed" that the South Asian nation "does not and will never accept mediation" in its conflict with Pakistan, according to a statement by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.

India is considering expanding its production of rare earth elements. As China imposes tighter restrictions on its export of rare earths — which are crucial in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and military equipment — Indian officials are evaluating the potential of Indian Rare Earths, a government-owned company, to fill the gap in the supply chain.

'No major safety concerns' on Air India's fleet. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India's aviation safety watchdog, said Tuesday it had inspected Air India's Boeing 787 fleet and did not find any major anomalies. The airline is cutting international flights on its widebody planes by 15% for the next few weeks. An Air India plane bound for London crashed on June 12 in Ahmedabad, India, killing all 242 passengers except one.

Indian stocks were trading flat Thursday as investors weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran crisis.

Since the start of the year, the 50-stock Nifty benchmark has risen 4.58%, while the BSE Sensex has gained 3.86%.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield was up at 6.291%.

On CNBC TV this week, Dave Ernsberger, co-president of S&P Global Commodity Insights, discussed the necessity for India to build up its energy reserves, especially in light of potential disruptions to global oil supply. However, that goal cannot be met solely by expanding oil and gas production. "The only way India will get energy independence, truly, is by building out domestically supplied renewable energy sources," Ernsberger said.

Meanwhile, Anand Gupta, managing director at Allianz Global Investors, said that although India's defense sector has a "longevity of growth" and will gain market share, stocks are not trading at a "reasonable price." There are better stock-picking opportunities in India's market, Gupta said, such as those in its consumer discretionary sector.

On Monday, the Purchasing Managers Index reports, which measure activity in India's manufacturing and services sectors, will be out. Multiple mainline companies will list publicly in the coming week, including recyclables company Aten Papers and Foam, solar pump manufacturer Oswal Pumps and construction supply company Arisinfra Solutions.

Google suffered a setback Thursday after an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended it dismiss the tech giant's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.7 billion) antitrust fine.

Juliane Kokott, advocate general at the European Court of Justice, advised the court to throw out Google's appeal and confirm the fine, which was reduced in 2022 to 4.125 billion euros from 4.34 billion euros previously by the EU's General Court.

"In her Opinion delivered today, Advocate General Kokott proposes that the Court of Justice dismiss Google's appeal and, therefore, uphold the judgment of the General Court," the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a press release Thursday.

The fine relates to a long-running antitrust case surrounding Google's Android operating system.

In 2018, the European Commission slapped Google with the record-breaking penalty on the grounds that it abused Android's mobile dominance to give unfair advantage to its own apps via pre-installation deals with smartphone makers. The Commission is the executive body of the EU.

Google said it was "disappointed" with the ECJ advocate general's verdict, adding it "would discourage investment in open platforms and harm Android users, partners and app developers."

"Android has created more choice for everyone and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world," a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email.

Though the advocate general's proposal is non-binding, judges tend to follow four out of five such non-binding opinions. The ECJ is expected to deliver a final ruling in the coming months.

BEIJING — Avatars generated by artificial intelligence are now able to sell more than real people can, according to a collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and a popular livestreamer.

Luo Yonghao, one of China's earliest and most popular livestreamers, and his co-host Xiao Mu both used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers in real time for well over six hours on Sunday on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform "Youxuan", the Chinese tech company said. The session raked in 55 million yuan ($7.65 million).

In comparison, Luo's first livestream attempt on Youxuan last month, which lasted just over four hours, saw fewer orders for consumer electronics, food and other key products, Baidu said.

Luo said that it was his first time using virtual human technology to sell products through livestreaming.

"The digital human effect has scared me ... I'm a bit dazed," he told his 1.7 million followers on social media platform Weibo, according to a CNBC translation.

Luo started livestreaming in April 2020 on ByteDance's short video app Douyin, in an attempt to pay off debts racked up by his struggling smartphone company Smartisan. His "Be Friends" Douyin livestream account has nearly 24.7 million followers.

Luo's and his co-host's avatars were built using Baidu's generative AI model, which learned from five years' worth of videos to mimic their jokes and style, Wu Jialu, head of research at Luo's other company, Be Friends Holding, told CNBC on Wednesday.

"This is a DeepSeek moment for China's entire livestreaming and digital human industry," Wu said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. DeepSeek, China's version of OpenAI, rattled global investors in January with its claims of rivaling ChatGPT at far lower costs and using an open-source approach.

AI avatars can sharply reduce costs since companies don't need to hire a large production team or a studio to livestream. The digital avatars can also stream nonstop without needing breaks.

"We have always been skeptical about digital people livestreaming," Wu said, noting the company had tried out various kinds of digital humans over the years.

But he said that Baidu now offers the best digital human product currently available, compared to the early days of livestreaming e-commerce five or six years ago.

Livestream shopping took off in China after the pandemic forced businesses to find alternative sales channels. More people are turning to livestreaming to earn money from commissions and virtual gifts amid slower economic growth.

Livestreaming generated so many sales on Douyin last year that the app surpassed traditional e-commerce company JD.com to become China's second-largest e-commerce platform — and ate into the market share of lead player Alibaba, according to a report from Worldpanel and Bain & Company last week. Both JD.com and Alibaba's Taobao also offer livestreaming sales portals.

Meanwhile, other Chinese companies, including tech giant Tencent, have developed tools to create digital people that can be used as news anchors. In late 2023, several businesses started trying out virtual human livestreamers during the Singles Day shopping holiday.

But analysts have cautioned that products sold via livestreams tend to have a high return rate as they are often impulse purchases.

The biggest challenge for using virtual humans to livestream is no longer the technology, but compliance and platform requirements, Wu said. Digital humans need to be trained to adhere to regulations about product advertising, while major livestreaming platforms may have different rules about allowing virtual people to host the sessions, he said.

For example, Douyin has rolled out restrictions on using the technology, especially if the virtual people do not interact with viewers.

While Luo's next virtual human appearance hasn't been set yet, Wu said he expects it will be very soon. And in the future, he said, digital humans could easily livestream in multiple languages to reach users outside China.

Israel and Iran's escalating conflict has significantly driven up the cost of insurance for ships sailing through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.

Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of the value of a ship for journeys into the Gulf, according to data from the world's largest insurance broker Marsh McLennan, up from 0.125% prior to Israel's surprise attack on Iran last week.

There has also been an uptick in war risk insurance rates for the Red Sea, Marsh said, while cover relating to ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%.

The length of time quotes are valid for has been cut to 24 hours from most leaders, Marsh said, down from 48 hours previously.

The scramble to reassess shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, with Israel and Iran continuing to exchange fresh air attacks over recent days.

The conflict between the two powers has ratcheted up concerns of a broader conflict, with many closely monitoring the prospect of U.S. intervention.

"Given that the situation is currently contained within the region, risks are still being placed to enable cargo to flow through these areas," Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo and logistics at Marsh, told CNBC by email.

Some shipowners have recently opted to steer clear of the strategically important Strait of Hormuz, reaffirming a sense of industry unease amid the conflict.

Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said earlier this week that the escalating conflict was causing concerns in the shipowner community and prompting a "modest drop" in the number of ships sailing through the area.

Situated between Iran and Oman, the Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. It is recognized as one of the world's most important oil chokepoints.

The inability of oil to traverse through the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led declines in Asia-Pacific markets Thursday, falling over 2%, as investors weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, while the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dent sentiment.

Meanwhile, mainland China's CSI 300 was down 0.82%.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.02% to close at 38,488.34, while the Topix declined 0.58% to end the trading day at 2,792.08. South Korea's Kospi added 0.19% to close at 2,977.74.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended the day flat at 8,523.7.

U.S. President Donald Trump is convening his national security advisors in the White House Situation Room for the second time in two days, as he weighs a potential military strike on Iran amid its conflict with Israel. The meeting started shortly before 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official told NBC News.

The U.S. Federal Reserve expectedly held interest rates steady on Wednesday, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5%, where it has stood since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed committee will wait to see the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on inflation before considering any adjustments to monetary policies.

However, the Fed still pointed to two rate cuts later this year.

Overnight on Wall Street, the three major averages ended the trading day mixed. The 30-stock Dow lost 44.14 points, or 0.10%, and ended at 42,171.66. The S&P 500 slipped 0.03% to close at 5,980.87, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.13% to settle at 19,546.27.

The Vietnamese dong weakened 0.13% to 26,127 against the greenback as of 11.15 a.m. local time, marking a record low.

The move also comes on the back of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent days. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 1% since June 17.

Other Southeast Asian currencies also weakened. The Thai baht depreciated as much as 0.6% to 32.845 against the dollar, the lowest since June 2, according to data from LSEG. The Indonesian rupiah fell 0.49% to 16,375 against the dollar.

Australia's unemployment rate came in at 4.1% in May, unchanged from the month before and in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters.

This is the fifth straight month that the unemployment rate has remained steady at 4.1%.

Back in May, Australia's central bank estimated that the unemployment rate would increase "a little" this year, putting their forecast at "a bit below 4.5%."

Aberdeen Investments said it favored China and Europe equity markets for their "strong" policy tools that can offset the negative impact from tariffs, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep policy rates steady.

"China's equity market is also further supported by a multi-pronged equity market program," said the asset manager's Ray Sharma-Ong, head of multi-asset investment solutions, Southeast Asia.

Sharma-Ong also highlighted that South Korea's equity markets present "attractive opportunities" fueled by growth-oriented reforms and improving corporate governance.

Shares of Japan's Nippon Steel rose 1.33% after it completed its acquisition of U.S. Steel.

U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted for weeks that the companies would form a "partnership" in which U.S. Steel would remain American-owned.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday after Nippon completed its acquisition, according to a notice from the NYSE.

Trump opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election but he changed his stance after he took office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. Former President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's acquisition in January, citing national security concerns.

The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as was expected. However, the central bank kept its outlook for two cuts this year as the threat of stagflation has risen.

"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate," the Fed's policymaking committee said in a note. The Fed also lowered its GDP outlook and increased its inflation forecast.

— Fred Imbert

DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said Wednesday that gold could hit $4,000 soon as institutions step up their buying amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty. 

"It's a clear beneficiary of everything that's been going on. And it's the one asset class that's really doing well this year," Gundlach said on CNBC's "Closing Bell." "I think the demand for gold is for real."

Spot gold traded around $3,392.08 an ounce Wednesday, while U.S. gold futures rose slightly to $3,412.5.

The three leading indexes finished little changed on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 44.14 points, or 0.1%, to settle at 42,171.66. The S&P 500 ticked 0.03% lower to end at 5,980.87, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13%, closing at 19,546.27.

The US State Department said on Wednesday that it's resuming its process for approving student visas and that applicants have to make their social media accounts public for review.

"Our overseas posts will resume scheduling F, M, and J nonimmigrant visa applications soon," the department wrote in a notice, asking applicants to look out for interview appointment slots.

F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are for full-time academic and vocational students, as well as those entering the US on exchange.

"To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas will be instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to 'public,'" the government notice added.

This notice neither specified what platforms the US government would vet nor how the checks would be carried out.

But the State Department wrote that the social media reviews would be part of "a comprehensive and thorough vetting, including online presence."

"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision," the department wrote.

The decision follows State Secretary Marco Rubio's initial announcement in late May that his department was pausing all student visa applications as it determined new rules for social media checks.

The department's spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, said at the time that Rubio and President Donald Trump were looking to only accept visitors who "understand what the law is, that they don't have any criminal intent, that they are going to be contributors to the experience here, however short or long their status."

The May suspension came just a little over two months before most universities start the academic year in the US, the country that issues the most foreign student visas out of any the world.

State Department data shows that over 1.12 million foreign students enrolled in US colleges in the 2023 to 2024 academic year, when the figures were last reported in November.

Rubio's initial decision had also come as the Trump administration barred Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. While a temporary court order has allowed current Harvard students to continue schooling, the university is legally challenging the ban.

Much of the White House's tension with Harvard and other top US universities stems from the protests and rhetoric that spread on campus as violence and tensions flared in the Middle East after October 2023.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

At U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, the topic of tariffs — specifically, their impact on prices — was a recurring one.

"Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs," Powell said. "And some of it will fall on the end consumer."

Granted, recent economic data has been upbeat, suggesting the U.S. economy has been able to — and could still — escape from tariffs mostly unscathed.

In May, a better-than-expected 139,000 jobs were added and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%. Consumer sentiment in early June was much more optimistic than forecast, according to a University of Michigan survey. And, most crucially, inflation in May — based on the consumer price index — ticked up just 0.1% for the month, lower than estimated.

But that string of positive data might have to thank the slow process by which tariffs move through the economy.

"It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed. So we're beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over the coming months," Powell said.

And even though Fed officials, at present, "don't see signs" of the U.S. economy weakening, Powell acknowledged growth will slow "eventually." In other words, stagflation — the toxic mix of higher prices and slower growth — could be a possibility in the months ahead.

The song "I Got Summer on My Mind" went viral in 2022. "I Got Stagflation on My Mind" could be the Fed's — and market watchers' — earworm this summer.

U.S. central bank holds rates, sees two cutsThe U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. Along with the rate decision, the committee indicated, through its closely watched "dot plot," that two cuts by the end of 2025 are still on the table. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the fed funds rate should be at least 2 percentage points lower, and again slammed Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "stupid."

Fed hikes inflation and lowers growth forecastsInflation in the U.S., measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will rise beyond 3% in 2025, according to an updated Fed forecast. The central bank had in March expected the PCE to hit 2.8%. The PCE came in at just 2.1% in April. The Fed also sees economic growth slowing to 1.4% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. In combination, both forecasts point to early signs of stagflation.

Markets flat in U.S. but fall in AsiaU.S. stocks hovered around the flatline Wednesday. The S&P 500 slipped 0.03%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1% down, but the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.13%. Oil prices, likewise, were little changed. Asia-Pacific markets fell Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost as much as 2%, leading declines in the region. In Japan, shares of Nippon Steel popped more than 3% after the firm completed its acquisition of U.S. Steel.

Iran regime change 'not an official objective': HerzogIsraeli President Isaac Herzog told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Wednesday that a regime change in Iran was "not an official objective of ours," and the goal was "to remove the Iranian nuclear program." Herzog, who accused Tehran of "rushing to the bomb," added that a "change in [regime] can also bring peace in the region." When asked if there was a diplomatic ramp off available to de-escalate the situation, he said "there is actually a lot of back channel."

Trump says he hasn't decided on Iran strikesFor the second time in two days, Trump on Wednesday met his national security team in the White House amid the Israel-Iran conflict. The closed-door gathering took place as Trump insisted he had not yet decided whether to order a U.S. strike on Iran. The same day, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said evacuation flights and cruise ship departures were being arranged for American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

[PRO] Investor interest in emerging marketsTrump hit developing economies, such as Vietnam and India, especially hard with his "reciprocal" tariffs. The clock is ticking down on Trump's 90-day pause on those tariffs — but institutional investors are actually growing more enthusiastic about emerging markets, according to Bank of America's most recent Fund Manager Survey.

Trump and India's Modi split over U.S. role in Pakistan ceasefire

During a Tuesday phone call between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump, the former expressed his frustration with the U.S. President's repeated claims that he had played a significant role in brokering a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed countries.

"Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India does not and will never accept mediation. There is complete political consensus in India on this matter," Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a statement.

Modi "clearly conveyed" to Trump that the U.S. played no role in the mediation between India and Pakistan and denied any discussion of a trade deal, said Misri.

The 35-minute call was initiated by Trump, he added.

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Wednesday that his country was not pursuing regime change in Iran, and its attack on Tehran was aimed at eliminating its nuclear capabilities.

Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy, Herzog said that regime change was "not an official objective of ours," and the goal was "to remove the Iranian nuclear program."

Herzog, who accused Tehran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," added that a "change in [regime] can also bring peace in the region."

The International Atomic Energy Agency in a statement on June 9 urged Iran to "fully cooperate" with the agency, or else it would "not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful."

On June 13, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations it said were related to the country's nuclear program. Both sides have since been trading strikes.

"One has to be tough sometimes in order to remove imminent threats. That's exactly what we're doing," Herzog told CNBC, adding that the strikes on Iran have had a genuine impact on its nuclear program.

U.S. president Donald Trump reportedly said on Wednesday that Iran was "very close" to having a nuclear bomb, putting him at odds with the testimony of his National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard gave to the U.S. Congress in March. "The IC [intelligence community] continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003," Gabbard said.

Earlier this week, the Group of Seven countries expressed support for Israel, while condemning Iran as "the principal source of regional instability and terror," and reiterated that "Iran can never have a nuclear weapon."

This was in contrast to China's stance. In the aftermath of the Israeli attack, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Beijing "explicitly condemns Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty," and said that it supports Iran in "safeguarding its national sovereignty and defending its legitimate rights and interests."

When asked if there was a diplomatic ramp off available to de-escalate the situation, Herzog said "there is actually a lot of back channel. National talks and dialogue with world leaders is actually quite intensive."

The crypto market finds itself at a crossroads as geopolitical tensions rattle global financial markets. The crypto majors have barely budged today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and all the rest down the line staying flat—for crypto standards anyway,

Total cryptocurrency market capitalization sits at $3.58 trillion, right around where it was yesterday. Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $104,000 mark, again, right around where it was yesterday. XRP is trading for $2.14, and Ethereum is just above $2,500—both in the green, but only barely.

In the macro picture, the Israel-Iran conflict has sent oil prices surging 7%, with Brent crude touching $78, while traditional safe havens like gold see renewed interest. The S&P 500 hovers just below 6,000 points, reflecting broader market uncertainty as investors juggle inflation concerns, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and escalating Middle East tensions.

But there's at least two coins making big moves today: one to the moon, the other into the earth.

Fartcoin has become a bit of a favored token among meme coin traders. For one, because it's funny and memes trade on vibes. But for another, the Solana-based token had been on a seemingly unstoppable journey upwards as “hot air rises.” Today, though, the vibes are down.

Fartcoin's 9.7% tumble today exemplifies the volatile nature of meme coin trading. The Binance.US listing helped spark the euphoria among degens, driving volume up 66% to $373 million, but reality quickly set in as profit-takers emerged. This "sell the news" pattern is a textbook reaction that experienced traders often anticipate.

The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Fartcoin sits at 42, nearing oversold territory—this metric measures momentum by comparing recent gains to losses, with readings below 50 suggesting bearish pressure is building. When RSI drops below 50, it often signals that sellers are gaining control, making short-term rebounds less likely.

The token's Average Directional Index, or ADX, reads 16, indicating that the previous long-term bullish trend is losing its strength and is now weak. ADX measures how strong a price trend is regardless of direction—readings below 25 suggest the market lacks conviction, meaning traders should expect choppy, directionless action rather than sustained moves.

The Exponential Moving Averages for Fartcoin paint a bearish picture: the token is trading below the 50-day EMA ($1.21) and approaching the 200-day EMA ($1.02). When price falls below these key moving averages, it typically indicates that the short-term trend has turned negative, and traders often use these levels as dynamic resistance points to sell rallies. However, the short-term EMA is well over the long term EMA, which is still a good sign for long-term traders as a death cross (when the EMA 50 is below the EMA 200, meaning the average price of the coin a long time ago was much higher than buying it at recent prices) is not yet looking like a strong possibility.

Key Levels:

But if Fartcoin is making degens cry of financial pain, OKB's impressive 13.5% surge is making its holders cry out of pure joy. Crypto exchange OKX's token climbed all the way up to $54.70 before a minor correction to its current price of $52.87—still enough for a 9.87% price jump on the day.

OKX's 28th token burn removed 42.4 million OKB from circulation, representing 20% of the circulating supply—a move that typically creates immediate scarcity and drives prices higher as remaining tokens become more valuable.

OKB's RSI reading at 55.26 actually shows neutral-to-bullish momentum rather than oversold conditions. This suggests OKB has already recovered from oversold levels and is now in healthier territory above 50, which typically indicates bullish momentum when combined with price above key EMAs. However, this was likely an event-based move, so traders will want to wait and see if the trend continues after everyone sold the news.

The ADX at 17 shows the previous downtrend is losing steam. Combined with the oversold bounce, this suggests a potential trend reversal is underway, though experienced traders with an eye for technicals will wait for ADX to rise above 25 to confirm a new uptrend is established.

Price action shows OKB reclaiming the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $52.81—these levels act as natural support and resistance based on mathematical ratios traders widely monitor. Breaking above this level with volume suggests buyers are regaining control. It also broke past the EMA 50, which confirms this thesis.

As always, though, it's impossible to say with certainty whether the move is just a reaction to big news or a natural correction that will maintain momentum over time.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are holding steady after plunging earlier this week — but traders aren't breathing easy just yet.

Since the conflict between Israel and Iran erupted on June 3, Bitcoin has dropped 3% to about $104,000, while Ethereum has shed nearly 10%, falling to $2,500.

But in the past 24 hours, both cryptocurrencies have traded sideways, stuck in a tense wait-and-see scenario as investors sideline themselves.

“Markets will be swayed by rising Middle East conflict updates and any shifts in Bitcoin ETF flows over the coming week,” Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, a crypto research firm, told DL News. 

“Macroeconomic uncertainty could fuel fresh volatility across crypto and drive investor sentiment.”

This week, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have taken in nearly 10,000 Bitcoin or about $1 billion, according to Coinglass. That brings their total holdings up to about $131 billion. 

Options traders aren't betting on a speedy recovery for crypto prices.

Deribit data shows that Bitcoin put options — bearish bets — are gaining ground, especially around the $100,000 price tag.

Now, it's not that traders see a long-term collapse, Liu said, but rather that they're hedging for short-term swings.

“Puts act as a hedge, especially for spot holders. It's more risk management in the short term,” said Liu. “As news shifts sentiment between fear and greed, uncertainty grows.” 

XRP traders are also hedging their bets for a price drop. 

Geopolitical tensions have gripped global markets.

US President Donald Trump hinted this week that the US could soon intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict, warning Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei that “our patience is wearing thin.”

In fact, Trump cut short a G7 summit and ordered the National Security Council to convene. 

Meanwhile, prediction platform Polymarket shows odds of a US military strike against Iran before July at 61%, down from 70% earlier this week. 

That saber-rattling has jolted assets. 

US stocks dipped, oil prices jumped, while gold slid. Crypto also got caught in the crossfire. Shares of Strategy, Coinbase and Circle fell as much as 4%. 

Coinbase and Circle's shares surged after the Genius Act, a stablecoin bill, passed the US Senate. 

Data from the Federal Reserve doesn't offer much optimism, either.

The money printer isn't coming back anytime soon, said Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. 

Inflation, meanwhile, remains stubborn, and interest rates will stay high — a situation that doesn't help risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. 

Moreover, Iran produces 4% of the world's oil, and the country is at the footsteps of the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 30% of the world's seaborne oil and 20% of global liquified natural gas passes. 

For now, capital markets remain on edge.

When most healthcare companies discuss digital transformation, they typically mean electronic medical records or telemedicine platforms.

But for Prenetics Global Limited, a publicly-traded health sciences firm, going digital meant something entirely next level: a $20 million Bitcoin treasury strategy that adds its name to a growing list of companies adopting a Bitcoin acquisition strategy. 

The Nasdaq-listed genomics and digital health company disclosed Wednesday that it has acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 using Kraken's custody platform. The purchase represents the beginning of what Prenetics calls a "comprehensive" Bitcoin strategy approved by its board, with plans for substantial future expansion.

In a statement, the firm said the investment forms part of a plan for "the dawn of a new era" in which domains such as genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will "will intersect in ways that could revolutionize" how we think about health, wealth, and longevity, Prenetics CEO Danny Yeung said in a statement.

Beyond its treasury strategy, Prenetics plans to explore yield generation through crypto lending and structured products using institutional-grade tools. The company will also accept Bitcoin payments across its consumer health brands, creating an integrated ecosystem from treasury management to customer transactions.

The company recently raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $80-$100 million, projecting profitability by Q4. Its stock (NASDAQ : PRE) surged 23.3% on the day Wednesday trading at $9.26 after its announcement.

To guide the initiative, Prenetics recruited former OKEx chief operating officer Andy Cheung to its board. Cheung previously helped oversee billions in daily crypto trading volume at one of the world's largest exchanges.

Tracy Hoyos-López, chief of staff for strategic initiatives at Kraken, has joined the firm as an advisor, helping to guide Prenetics as it adopts the Bitcoin treasury playbook deployed by firms including Strategy and Metaplanet.

Hoyos-López was one of three people pivotal to making President Donald Trump "orange-pilled" by bringing him to speak at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville last year.

At the conference, Trump promised to establish a "strategic BTC stockpile." In March, the president signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve "capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government," according to a statement from AI and crypto czar David Sacks.

Hoyos-López fiercely advocated for Trump, who at the time faced Kamala Harris for the presidency. “Our industry as a whole will cease to exist if Trump doesn't win,” Hoyos-López said at the time, per a report from CNBC.

Decrypt reached out to Prenetics for comment on Hoyos-López' appointment.

A startup has raised $6 million in a seed round to protect Bitcoin from quantum computing. 

Project 11, which focuses on quantum computing's hypothetical threat to the leading crypto network, announced the raise Thursday, which was co-led by Variant and Quantonation, and included participation from venture capital firms Castle Island Ventures, Nebular, and Formation. 

The firm said that quantum computing is a threat to Bitcoin so "every wallet, every account holder, every smart contract key—all of it—must upgrade to new, quantum-safe cryptography."

Today we're announcing a $6 million seed round at Project Eleven, to build a quantum-ready future for digital assets. The seed round was co-led by @variantfund and @Quantonation with participation from @CastleIslandVC, @Nebularvc, and @formation_vc.

Why this matters: Quantum…

— Project 11 (@qdayclock) June 19, 2025



"A cryptographically relevant quantum computer will break the foundational security assumptions of Bitcoin and nearly every digital asset," Project 11 said in a statement.

"With rapid progress from companies like IBM and Google, that future is no longer hypothetical. It's coming fast and there isn't long to prepare."

Quantum computing is a new type of technology that uses quantum physics to process far larger amounts of information than classical machines.

Such computers aren't available to the public yet and top tech companies like Google and IBM are working on developing them. 

But some in the crypto space have raised concerns that as tech giants make bigger strides to releasing a quantum computer, Bitcoin's cryptography could be cracked. 

The Bitcoin network is currently the world's most secure computing network—and has never been hacked. 

In order to crack the network's cryptography, a bad actor would have to take control of more than 50% of the Bitcoin network, which would require a huge amount of computing power. 

Hardcore Bitcoiners like Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor have shrugged off concerns about quantum computing, saying that when such a threat exists, other computing networks—used by the likes of banking giants or the U.S. military—will face a bigger risk. 

"I don't worry about it," he said. "Microsoft and Google market their quantum projects, but they would never sell a quantum computer that cracked cryptography, because it would destroy their own companies."

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $104,250, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.

 Shrinking liquid supply, persistent ETF demand, and strong technical factors could push ETH price above $4,000. 

Key takeaways:

Spot ETH ETF net inflows totalled $861.3 million over the last two weeks.

Total ETH staked and accumulated are at all-time highs.

ETH price could rally toward the bull flag's target of $4,100 if a key trendline breaks. 

Ether's (ETH) price rose to a four-month high at $2,880 on June 11, before correcting to the current value at $2,550.

Several analysts said a key resistance remains at $2,800, and the price needs to flip this into support to trigger a “violent move upward.”

“Ethereum price price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level,” said popular crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades in a June 16 post on X 

The trader asserted that a decisive close above this level would be a “good setup” for a move higher. 

Fellow analyst Jelle shared a chart showing ETH price compressing a tight range below a key resistance level above $2,800 and said:

Several bullish signs suggest that ETH is well-positioned to break above $3,000 in the following days or weeks.

One factor supporting Ether's bullish argument is persistent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day inflow streak before it broke on June 13, but rebounded with three consecutive days of fresh inflows between June 16-18, including over $19 million on Wednesday. These investment products have seen net inflows totaling $861.3 million over the last two weeks, as per data from Farside Investors.

As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and reflect growing confidence among traditional finance players, despite initial market panic from the Israel-Iran conflict.

Ether staked increased by more than 500,000 ETH between June 1 and June 15, pushing the total locked amount to a new all-time high of over 35 million ETH.

This growth signals rising confidence and a continued drop in liquid supply. This creates scarcity that can drive prices up if demand holds or grows.

In a June 16 QuickTake, CryptoQuan's analyst OnChainSchool also pointed out that Ether's accumulation addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH worth approximately $58 billion at current rates.

This signals strong investor confidence and minimal selling pressure, often a precursor to price rallies.

The analyst said:

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that ETH price is stuck between two key levels: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,600 acting as resistance and the 50-day SMA at $2,450 as support.

ETH bulls were required to reclaim the 200-day SMA to ensure a sustained recovery toward $3,000 and beyond.

The last time the BTC price broke above this trendline, it rallied 40% from $3,130 on Nov. 9, 2024, to its multi-year high of $4,100 on Dec. 15, 2024.

The bull flag pattern, on the other hand, indicates a potential breakout toward $3,900, as shown in the chart below.  

As Cointelegraph reported, Ether's breakout from a cup-and-handle chart pattern could result in 51% gains to $4,200.

 A similar OBV divergence in March–April 2025 triggered a 57% Bitcoin rally, reinforcing strong accumulation signals for the current setup. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's OBV is rising despite price consolidation, signaling hidden accumulation.

A similar OBV divergence in March–April preceded a 57% BTC price rally.

A confirmed bull flag breakout could send Bitcoin toward $130,000-135,000 by Q3 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a range between $102,000 and $112,000 since May, but its on-balance volume (OBV) continues to trend upward, hinting at more gains ahead.

The price-OBV divergence is signaling growing “buying pressure,” according to market analyst Cas Abbé, who expects a rising OBV will assist in sending BTC's price toward the $130,000–$135,000 area by Q3 2025. 

The OBV indicator tracks volume to determine whether buyers or sellers are in control. It adds volume on days when the price closes higher and subtracts it on down days. So, a rising OBV means that total buying volume outpaces selling volume. 

In Bitcoin's case, the OBV has continued to make higher highs since early May, even as price has largely consolidated sideways ever since. From a technical perspective, such a divergence suggests that demand is building under the surface.

Historical price action shows that Bitcoin tends to break out strongly when rising OBV confirms underlying buying pressure during periods of price consolidation.

Between March and April 2025, BTC was trading sideways between $76,000 and $84,000, when OBV started forming higher lows. The divergence was followed by a 57% rally, with BTC hitting over $110,000 by May.

The fractal could validate analyst Cas Abbé's view that a move toward $130,000–$135,000 may occur in Q3 2025 if it plays out as intended.

Bitcoin appears to be forming a classic bull flag pattern, a continuation setup that typically appears after strong upward moves, followed by a period of consolidation.

On the daily chart, BTC's surge to nearly $112,000 in May from around $93,670 established the “flagpole.” Since then, price has been consolidating downward inside a parallel channel, forming the “flag.”

This structure suggests that BTC may be gearing up for another leg higher. That would place Bitcoin's breakout target around $130,000, aligning closely with Cas Abbé's forecast for Q3 2025.

The bull flag target aligns with the predictions of several market analysts, including Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz, who sees Bitcoin hitting $130,000-150,000 owing to strong institutional flows and a weaker dollar.

Analyst Stockmoney Lizards, among other analysts, anticipate the Bitcoin price to rise even higher, eyeing a year-end target of $200,000.

Iranian cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex was hacked for around $90 million on Wednesday, on the surface of it an almost routine exploit in an industry that already dealt with a $223 million exchange exploit earlier this month.

Below the surface, it was anything but. Digging a little deeper reveals this was not simply a cash grab, in fact, not a cash grab at all, but a political message that could end up being a hammer blow to one of the primary combatants in the escalating conflict in the Middle East. 

The hackers, the pro-Israel activist group Gonjeshke Darande, demonstrated their indifference to monetary gain by transferring the stolen funds to a series of inaccessible "vanity" wallets ladened with the words like "terrorist," essentially burning those tokens forever.

"This appears to be an act of politically motivated sabotage rather than a financially motivated hack," Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an interview. "The use of vanity addresses seems to be motivated by wanting to send a message to Nobitex and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps."

The group, whose Farsi name means Predatory Sparrow, the following day leaked the exchange's source code, leaving any remaining tokens on the platform vulnerable to theft.

"Bypassing sanctions doesn't pay." Gonjeshke Darande wrote on X alongside screenshots of the "vanity" wallets storing the stolen funds.

The regime has been under sanctions for years as due to international concerns over its human rights record and attempts to develop nuclear weapons. The European Union introduced sanctions in 2011 and has renewed them every year since, even strengthening them in the meantime. U.S. sanctions date back as far as 1979, to the Iranian Revolution.

Israel said Iran, which has has vowed to eliminate the Jewish state numerous times over the years, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Iran says its program is purely peaceful. Last week, immediately before Israel's air strikes, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had violated its non-proliferation commitments.

Gonjeshke Darande's tweet refers to allegations about Iran's use of cryptocurrency to evade the sanctions, echoing concerns Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King raised to former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2024.

Without Nobitex, Iran, a nation already hamstrung by oil and financial sanctions, may struggle to move capital around in a time of intense conflict. That could weaken its efforts to mobilize and launch attacks into Israel,.

There has been some discussion about the vanity wallets. Does the group have access to the filched tokens, or have they been burned forever?

There is "practically zero chance attackers control these addresses," Yehor Rudytsia, a security researcher at Hacken, told CoinDesk. 

Creating the vanity addresses with a private key to unlock them "is computationally trivial task and might be done in micro/milliseconds," Rudytsia said. But finding the 26-character private key would require as many as ~ 2¹⁵² trials. "It is practically infeasible to find the private key which maps to such a public address." 

Which means the money has gone.

Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

The crypto world is electric with the recent surge of momentum for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

The landmark legislation, which cleared the Senate with a decisive 68-30 vote and is now headed for House approval, has been lauded as a transformative step for the digital asset landscape.

President Trump himself has publicly thrown his support behind the bill, urging the House to approve it ‘ASAP – NO DELAYS' and directly to his office.

The powerful endorsement, coupled with the bipartisan Senate approval, could be interpreted by the market as a bullish signal for the entire crypto industry, catalyzing a possible rally.

The immediate aftermath of the GENIUS Act's Senate passage saw a significant uptick in the valuations of crypto companies. Coinbase, listed on the Nasdaq, closed the trading day up an impressive 16.32% to $295.29.

Even more striking was the performance of Circle, listed on the NYSE, which soared 33.82% to close at $199.59. The rapid surge has led some in the crypto community to declare the arrival of ‘Stablecoin Summer', as regulatory clarity is poised to unlock substantial institutional investment and wider adoption.

The general impression is that GENIUS will be unequivocally good for the crypto market as a whole. The stage is set for a period of accelerated growth, with many investors now looking at the best altcoins that could rally 100X as Trump praises the GENIUS stablecoin bill and the ecosystem matures.

The broader market optimism caused by the GENIUS Act is perfect for projects like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which introduce significant technological innovation and address a market need. It's well-positioned to thrive in this new era of crypto clarity.

The $85B+ content subscription industry is ripe for disruption, and $SUBBD could lead the charge. The innovative AI creator platform is designed to empower both creators and fans by integrating cutting-edge AI creation tools and token-powered experiences.

With an impressive combined following of over 250M across its ecosystem and ambassadors, and substantial benefits for token holders, $SUBBD is poised for mass adoption.



As the first AI-integrated crypto creator/subscription platform, SUBBD offers a unique value proposition. Creators can leverage an AI assistant to automate tasks like chat, editing, and monetization, freeing them to focus on content.

Meanwhile, users can generate realistic photos and short-form videos, approved by the original creator, fostering a deeper engagement.

In a market characterized by volatility and rapid movements, Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) offers a refreshing, laid-back alternative.

This meme-inspired token gains traction by fostering a community around the viral ‘Chill Guy' meme – a nonchalant character unfazed by life's challenges.



$CHILL aims to embody this ethos, providing a cool and engaging space for crypto enthusiasts. While many coins prioritize short-term hype, $CHILL distinguishes itself by focusing on strong community engagement and long-term potential, making it an appealing option for those seeking a more relaxed crypto journey.

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the best meme coins will seek to carve out their niche by leveraging the widespread appeal of their underlying memes and cultivating a loyal following.

If you're confident in Bitcoin's inevitable climb to $1M and beyond, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an exciting and accessible entry point.

Bitcoin remains the most talked-about crypto asset when it comes to market adoption, making headlines in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve back in March of this year.

The institutional confidence and broader adoption bolstered by the GENIUS Act will see it gain even more attention, creating an even more favourable environment for Bitcoin-linked assets.

$BTCBULL, a community-driven token built on the Ethereum network, is designed to let holders earn free $BTC and $BTCBULL tokens as $BTC surges.

Unlike traditional $BTC investments, $BTCBULL allows anyone to benefit from $BTC's rise without needing to own an entire coin. It's the only altcoin that rewards holders and presale buyers with real $BTC, making it a standout.

$BTCBULL's unique mechanics are engineered for maximum holder benefit. As Bitcoin hits the $150K and $200K landmarks, $BTCBULL holders receive direct $BTC airdrops seamlessly integrated through its partnership with Best Wallet, one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets.

Furthermore, the project operates a deflationary token burn mechanism, also at key $BTC landmarks, meaning the $BTCBULL supply is permanently reduced, increasing scarcity and value.

The GENIUS Act has undoubtedly stirred excitement in the crypto market, bringing a fresh wave of optimism and transforming investor sentiment to anticipation.

The evolving landscape offers fertile ground for innovative projects, making both $SUBBD and $BTCBULL compelling options for those wanting to capitalize on the next wave of altcoin rallies in what looks to be a vibrant ‘Stablecoin Summer' and beyond.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump's administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging.

Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment.

“The Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the undisputed leader in digital assets," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to the so-called Genius Act stablecoin bill and adding the U.S. is going to “show the world how to win” with bitcoin and crypto.

“Nobody will do it better, it is pure Genius! Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. We are talking about massive investment, and big innovation.”

The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world's biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.

This week, U.S. lawmakers in the Senate voted 68-30 to approve the bipartisan “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” known as the Genius Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians.

Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump's desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives.

House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate.

“The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean' Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.”

Meanwhile, Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.

“The float is expected to grow from $250 billion to trillions of dollars," Sacks said, adding he expects “blockchain-based infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system,” calling it the “payments system of the future.”

Attention is now shifting to the crypto market structure legislation known as the Clarity Act, which has been described by senator Cynthia Lummis as step two in the Trump administration's three-step plan for crypto legislation, with step three getting the bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law.

The Genius Act's passage through the Senate "brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let's finish the job and pass market structure legislation to fulfil [Trump's] vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world," Lummis posted to X.

By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Bitcoin BTC$104,322.65 remains stable around $105,000 after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, as expected. It hasn't traded below the psychological threshold of $100,000 since May 8, a full 42 days ago, even though the Israel-Iran conflict — now coming up for a week — would have been expected to weigh on risky investments, crypto among them.

Alongside the interest-rate decision, the Fed also signaled slower economic growth, with GDP now expected to rise just 1.4% this year, down from 1.7%, and higher inflation. The much-watched dot plot showed policymakers see fewer rate cuts through 2027 than they did in March.

What seems to be underpinning the largest cryptocurrency, and crypto markets in general, is the bitcoin treasury narrative. A notable rotation appears to be underway, with an ever growing number of companies committing to buying it as a treasury asset.

The total number of known publicly traded holders has increased to 129, and when private companies and sovereign entities are included, the total has reached 235. That's an increase of 27 entities in just 30 days. 

Geopolitical tensions remain elevated in the Middle East. Israel said it launched airstrikes on nuclear-weapons related targets near Arak and Natanz and an Iranian missile attack scored a direct hit on the Soroka Hospital in southern Israel early this morning. In response, Israel's defense minister pledged further escalation of hostilities. 

Brent crude rose 1% to $77.45, its highest level since January, adding upward pressure on global energy and food prices. European stock indexes and U.S. equity index futures fell.

While U.S. markets are closed today for the Juneteenth holiday, crypto markets remain open 24/7. Stay alert!

Ford and Iagon's PoC on Cardano aims to revolutionize legal data storage through decentralized blockchain solutions.

Ford Motor Company, a Fortune 500 company, has joined forces with Iagon and Cloud Court to launch a proof-of-concept (PoC) focused on decentralized legal data storage, according to a June 18 announcement.

The project, built on the Cardano blockchain, will test decentralized solutions for managing sensitive legal records across large organizations.

Following the news, Iagon's IAG token climbed over 11% to $0.1664 at press time. According to CryptoSlate's data, Cardano's ADA token dropped 3% to $0.59843.

The collaborators noted that law firms and corporate legal departments handle massive volumes of material, from depositions and court transcripts to confidential filings.

These records are often spread across multiple teams and platforms, leading to inefficiencies, lost insights, and serious data security concerns.

As a result, this pilot scheme focuses on helping legal teams and enterprises gain control over litigation data.

According to the statement, the proposed system will use a hybrid infrastructure.

Legal data will be encrypted and stored off-chain, while Cardano's blockchain will handle permission controls, access logs, and data verification.

This setup is designed to reduce data fragmentation while providing clear audit trails, stronger security, and smoother internal collaboration.

Meanwhile, the initiative will showcase Cardano's evolving utility in enterprise environments. If successful, the project could be a model for integrating blockchain and AI in law, healthcare, finance, and public administration.

Ford will serve as an advisor for the exploratory project. The car manufacturer will stress-test the solution for large-scale enterprise use and lend credibility to blockchain-backed LegalTech.

Moreover, the company's participation is also expected to encourage other corporations to explore similar tools, especially as demand for secure and transparent data management grows.

Iagon said on X:

“Ford is interested in exploring whether blockchain-based distributed storage could address persistent challenges in legal data infrastructure. In particular, Ford sees merit in exploring how blockchain technology might deliver economically efficient storage and audit solutions for legal data management.”

Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) told investors it is in talks with two companies to port its AI technologies onto aftermarket control boards for bitcoin miners.

The technologies, Method A and Method B, were recently demonstrated at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

“The live and off-line demonstrations of QBT's technology in Las Vegas proved to be essential in convincing some of the major players that the ability to make predictions on the behavior of SHA-256 using AI learning models is indeed, real, as it provides a practical solution to improve the quality hashing power of a miner,” chief executive Francesco Gardin said.

He highlighted the pace of progress, with the company now “finally entering into the on-site third-party assessment phase with potential customers and partners”.

Gardin added: "We are now moving fast from the single ASIC implementations of Method A and Method B to the mining rig versions in order to deploy to potential customers and partners QBT technology, while for Method C we are working hard to integrate our product into the new versions of the ASIC chips of two Bitcoin mining manufacturers."

Aftermarket boards are used to replace original control boards in crypto mining machines, to boost hash rate and lower energy and temperature costs.

QBT plans to release Methods A and B immediately through partnerships with board providers. It will maintain a live connection to servers that run its AI models.

The company noted that it will focus on rigs by leading Chinese manufacturers and new US producers.

QBT said it is also engaged with two ASIC chip manufacturers to begin an in-depth assessment of Method C for integration into new ASIC designs.

Last week South Korea published the Basic Digital Asset Act legislative bill, which gave significant powers of approval over stablecoin issuers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC) rather than the Bank of Korea (BOK). That was despite recent lobbying by the central bank for a key supervisory role. Yesterday the Democratic Party of Korea, which won this month's Presidential election, introduced complementary legislation that adjusts this regulatory framework, the Digital Asset Innovation Growth Act. 

While the newer bill is meant to supplement the Basic Digital Asset Act, there's considerable overlap, especially regarding stablecoin issuance. For example, the minimum capital requirement for an issuer was doubled from won 500 million ($360,000) to won 1 billion ($720,000). The new legislation also addresses some of the central bank's earlier concerns about regulatory oversight by providing a role for BOK.

While issuer supervision still falls to the FSC, the central bank can express an opinion on any won stablecoin issuer and the FSC is obliged to comply unless it has a good reason. The Bank of Korea can also ask for stablecoin data from the issuer at any time and request that the Financial Services Commission perform an inspection, Korea Economic Daily reported. There's a lighter touch regulation for small issuers, which have not exceeded a billion won over the past year. The bill also states that won stablecoins are neither securities nor electronic money. 

When the first bill was released last week, Yonhap News described the central bank's reaction as “panic”. Yesterday BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong said, “I think a won-based stablecoin is necessary, and I don't oppose its issuance.” 

However, he has some reservations. “If a won-based stablecoin is issued, it will be easier to exchange for dollar-based stablecoins and make it difficult to manage foreign exchange,” he said according to Nate News. This foreign exchange concern reflects broader worries about monetary policy control. South Korea has capital controls that aim to regulate the inflow and outflow of foreign currencies, especially the dollar. 

News reports regarding both sets of regulations only mentioned the issuance of won-based stablecoins, not dollar ones which already circulate freely in the country. Tether recently announced plans to launch its USDT on the local Kaia public blockchain. USDC issuer Circle reportedly met with the central bank and National Assembly with plans to visit the FSC, triggering speculation that it might want to issue a Korean won stablecoin.

Meanwhile, the BOK Governor's concerns extend from foreign exchange to the health of local banks. “If payment settlement business is transferred from banks to non-banks, we need to draw a big picture regarding the profitability of banks and changes in business structure.” This leans into long held concerns that if deposits migrate away from banks, it will inhibit their lending ability or loans will become more expensive.

The Governor concluded, “Once the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Financial Services Commission and other relevant ministries are in place,  we plan to refine policies through inter-ministerial consultations.”

GenLayer, a startup building decentralized legal infrastructure for AI and machine agents, has launched its first incentivized testnet, dubbed Asimov. 

This marks the initial rollout of its multi-phase validator onboarding and technology validation initiative as the company moves closer to mainnet deployment. 

The testnet introduces what GenLayer calls the first Intelligent Blockchain, powered by AI models and designed to resolve subjective decisions typically outside the scope of traditional deterministic blockchains.

“Our narrative is that as we enter a world of AI agents—fast and smart—we need a new legal system because the current one is fragmented, slow, and expensive,” said GenLayer CEO and co-founder Albert Castellana, adding that GenLayer “offers a synthetic jurisdiction: a legal system for machines.”

Asimov is the first of three sequential testnets in GenLayer's roadmap, to be followed by Bradbury and Clark. 

The company aims to progressively test and scale its “Optimistic Democracy” consensus mechanism. Unlike conventional blockchain validators that simply execute code, GenLayer validators are paired with large language models (LLMs), enabling them to evaluate off-chain data and make subjective decisions—such as determining whether submitted content meets campaign requirements or whether a smart contract's conditions have been fairly fulfilled.

GenLayer positions this model as essential infrastructure for the coming age of AI agents and machine-to-machine transactions. 

According to Castellana, Asimov's launch is both a stress test and a signal of technical maturity to developers and partners.

The validator program for Asimov targets seasoned blockchain infrastructure operators. Selected participants will earn rewards for testing consensus logic, transaction handling, and model coordination. GenLayer has already onboarded dozens of validators, with more in the pipeline. Participation requires a full-time commitment during test phases.

To support builders, GenLayer is releasing a comprehensive developer stack, including the GenLayer Studio, Wallet, Blockchain Explorer, and GS Library (a Python toolkit). The testnet is also paired with a grant program to encourage early development and experimentation ahead of mainnet launch.

Coinciding with Asimov is the beta release of Rally, a decentralized marketing protocol that automates influencer and community incentive campaigns. Using AI-powered validators, Rally evaluates submitted content — such as social media posts — against campaign rules embedded in smart contracts.

“Rally is our first protocol built on GenLayer,” Castellana told VentureBeat. “It autonomously evaluates community-created content and determines compensation, opening participation beyond influencers to anyone.”

Brands define guidelines (e.g., hashtags, tone, originality), deposit funds, and let the protocol autonomously determine payouts. 

This setup avoids manual negotiation and performance disputes common in traditional influencer programs. Content creators, in turn, receive transparent, on-chain compensation if their submissions meet preset criteria.

“In the future, many influencers will be AI agents seeking opportunities to earn—this system accommodates that evolution,” Castellana added. 

Rally operates independently of GenLayer's core team and will eventually be governed by a DAO. From each campaign pool, 1% goes to the Rally DAO, while 10% of protocol fees are allocated to the developers of participating applications.

“The way I see GenLayer is like a toy factory—creating new tools and mechanisms you can't find anywhere else,” the CEO added. “Rally is just one example of what's possible.”

For technical decision makers — including brand managers, growth marketers, and digital campaign leads— GenLayer and Rally offer the ability to automate and decentralize campaign execution and quality control. Instead of manually managing influencer relationships, approving content, and disputing post-campaign performance, teams can deploy smart contracts that use LLMs to judge submissions against predefined standards.

This approach significantly reduces operational overhead, enables real-time feedback and rewards, and ensures fairness and transparency throughout the campaign lifecycle. Additionally, the use of AI agents allows for scalable campaign management across thousands of potential content contributors—human or automated—without additional headcount or vendor friction.

For enterprises that regularly invest in brand visibility, product launches, or community engagement, Rally could streamline marketing operations while offering auditable proof of campaign performance. Combined with GenLayer's broader infrastructure, brands also gain access to AI-driven decision systems for everything from grants disbursement to smart contract enforcement, potentially transforming legal and operational workflows in Web3 contexts.

GenLayer's architecture is supported by technical partners including ZKSync (for rollup-based scalability), Heurist (for decentralized model hosting), Atoma Network (for privacy-preserving execution), and Caldera. These integrations ensure that the platform remains performant, secure, and aligned with broader Ethereum-based ecosystems.

The company has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors such as North Island Ventures, Arrington Capital, ZK Ventures, and Arthur Hayes' Maelstrom. GenLayer sees its protocol as the foundation of a synthetic, global jurisdiction—an autonomous legal layer for the AI economy, capable of settling disputes at machine speed with greater accessibility than traditional legal systems.

Following Asimov, the Bradbury and Clark testnets will introduce validator-level LLM configuration, production-grade inference tuning, and autonomous network operations. Each phase is designed to validate system components ahead of a mainnet launch planned for later this year.

GenLayer is actively seeking professional validators and developers to participate in the testnet. Those interested can apply via the company's website. 

With applications like Rally already live in beta, GenLayer presents a new category of intelligent blockchain infrastructure — combining AI decision-making with decentralized governance to unlock more autonomous, transparent, and scalable systems for enterprise and community users alike

A COVID-era feature that characterized the bull run in all corners of financial markets, including bitcoin BTC$104,322.65, has made a comeback in Switzerland, one of the most financial powerhouses of the world.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) cut its interest rate to zero on Thursday, to counter falling inflation, appreciating Swiss franc (CHF) and economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade war.

The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China.

The latest rate cut is bank's sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024.

The SNB's return to zero may be a sign of things to come across Europe and other advanced nations. A broad based return to zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) may bode well for bitcoin.

Altcoins are lagging as Bitcoin holds above $100,000, with key trading data showing sustained sell pressure across the broader market, analyst Burak Kesmci argues.

The 1-year cumulative buy/sell quote volume difference for altcoins — excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) — has plunged to -$36 billion as of June 2025. The figure reflects the net difference between buy and sell orders on centralized exchanges.

A negative reading signals sustained sell pressure across the altcoin market.

The last time this metric turned positive was in December 2024, coinciding with a local top in altcoins. Since then, it's been downhill, even as Bitcoin broke above six figures.

In effect, altcoin investors have disappeared, or as the data suggests, they're “MIA.”

“Even though Bitcoin is enjoying a bull run, altcoins are behaving like it's still winter,” wrote Kesmci, adding:

“Unless this metric starts rising again, expecting a full-blown altseason or altcoin FOMO might just be wishful thinking.”

Historically, strong altcoin performance has followed sharp recoveries in this metric, when net buying returns and confidence build across the market. Without that shift, expectations for an imminent altseason may be premature.

Part of the reason could be investor risk appetite.

With global economic uncertainty lingering and regulatory clarity limited in many regions, traders appear to be rotating capital into Bitcoin as a safer, more liquid asset, while sidelining altcoins with higher volatility and lower trust.

Altcoin-focused ETFs have the potential to drive renewed investor interest by offering exposure to digital assets via regulated funds. US spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum have each drawn billions in inflows and set a strong precedent.

According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SEC now assigns 90% approval odds to Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) spot ETF filings, with XRP at 85%, Dogecoin (DOGE) at 80%, and Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polkadot (DOT) each sitting at 75%.

Key decision timelines include:

July 2, 2025: Basket-style crypto/index ETF filings are due, with Bloomberg assigning them a 90% chance of approval

Late Q4 2025: Final windows for single-asset approvals—SOL, LTC (October), XRP (November), DOGE (December), ADA, DOT, AVAX (November)

Seyffart emphasizes that while early approvals may happen in late June or early July, the more realistic time frame is Q4 2025

ETFs may increase demand for select altcoins, but may not meaningfully shift the overall altcoin market if smaller-cap tokens remain excluded. Additionally, since the CryptoQuant metric reflects spot exchange activity, ETF-driven demand must translate into real buying pressure on those platforms to have a measurable effect.

There was a time, not so long ago, when Donald Trump thundered: any country daring to build a future without the dollar would be punished by an avalanche of tariffs. Tax, sanction, isolate: that was the warning to anyone deviating from the green axis. But within the BRICS, the threat rings hollow. China, however, does not respond with bombs or missiles. It draws another weapon: its digital currency, the digital yuan or e-CNY. Not a currency war, but another map of global finance.

In Shanghai, the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, set the tone. Against the backdrop of trade tensions with the USA, he wants to build a multipolar monetary system. Less dollar, more balance. At the Lujiazui Forum, he stated: 

Developing a multipolar international monetary system will help strengthen global financial stability.

The core of the system: an international management center for the e-CNY, backed by the CIPS system, an alternative to the SWIFT network. Banks like Standard Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank have already joined.

Pan also denounces current flaws: “Cross-border payment infrastructures can be politicized and used as tools for unilateral sanctions.” Finance is no longer neutral; it becomes a battlefield.

The e-CNY allows China to secure its transactions while avoiding the dollar. It is an economic maneuver, but also a diplomatic one. Because where the United States isolates, Beijing weaves ties: Russia, Iran, Persian Gulf. The digital currency becomes an alternative to hegemony.

In the streets of China, the e-CNY is already a reality. More than 261 million users use it, with a cumulative volume exceeding 7.3 trillion dollars (Blockhead). Daily life is converting: transportation, salaries, taxes. No need for a bank account. A QR code is enough, even offline.

In Jiangsu, officials are paid in digital yuan. In Chengdu, it is used at the market. It is no longer an experiment. It is a digital reflex. Even tourists have access via a simple mobile app.

But Beijing's ambition goes beyond its borders. UnionPay, supported by the PBoC, is rolling out QR payments in Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos: the ecosystem is exported. Thanks to mBridge, transactions between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi settle in 7 seconds, with a 98% reduced cost (Blockhead).

On X, Josh Ryan-Collins writes: 

Central bank digital currencies could increase public profits derived from seigniorage. 

More than just a technology, the digital yuan becomes a fiscal and political lever.

The digital yuan is not just a monetary gadget. It is a strategic instrument that redraws balances in regions seeking emancipation from the dollar. Beijing does not claim this. It proves it:

But the road remains winding. Capital controls still hinder the free circulation of the yuan abroad. And even if the RMB climbs, it still only represents 4% of global reserves, compared to 60% for the dollar.

China moves forward, with a discreet method but deep impact. It does not seek to dominate, but to offer an alternative. And this alternative entices Moscow, Tehran, or partners of the Belt and Road Initiative. The bet? A parallel finance, less vulnerable to sanctions, more suited to 21st-century alliances.

In the United States, Donald Trump killed any project for a digital dollar in the bud. For him, a CBDC threatens individual freedom. “We will ban all forms of central bank digital currency,” he declared as soon as he returned to power. Result: American digital finance stagnates while China builds.

The new owners of Nexus Mods have officially responded to fans' concerns about a change in the video games site's direction, after some unsettling details about the company and its plans to use tactics like microtransactions and NFTs in its business ventures.

For the first time since its inception, Nexus Mods has changed owners, with founder Robin Scott announcing that the site had been sold. What was strange about the announcement was that Scott didn't name the new owners; fans discovered that it was a company called Chosen.

 As reported by PC Gamer, it was discovered that one of Chosen's founders' LinkedIn pages mentioned a “Gaming Startup Monetization Cheat Sheet,” listing the things most gamers despise when it comes to monetization, such as NFTs.

The response to this discovery was so vitriolic that one of the new founders, nicknamed Foledinho on Nexus Mods, responded to PC Gamer and outlined the changes intended for the site. There's no intention to sell the mods, nor will players be forced to upgrade to premium accounts. However, no details were given about how the site could be monetized.

Online multiplayer games like Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Fortnite, and Final Fantasy XIV let players from different consoles and PC play together.

 The problem with monetizing a site like Nexus Mods is that game mods already exist in a strange legal area. For the most part, developers and publishers don't care about hobbyist fans tinkering with games, and will usually only step in if there's some controversy involved.

Where it becomes iffy is when money is involved. The second people start charging for mods is when companies will start cracking down on them. This leaves the new owners of Nexus Mods in an odd situation, as selling the content would be a legal doomsday, leaving ads and premium memberships as the main way to make money without incurring the wrath of the industry at large.

Perhaps if the former Nexus Mods owner had spoken about the buyers more openly, then fans wouldn't have been so quick to dig into their history. But the secret is out now, and the fate of the world's biggest mod site is more unsure than it has ever been.

 Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano says Coinbase's stock surge indicates that “Wall Street wants Bitcoin and crypto assets.” 

Coinbase and Circle shares surged Wednesday after US lawmakers signaled support for clearer stablecoin regulation by pushing through the GENIUS Act for House approval.

On Wednesday, Coinbase (COIN), listed on the Nasdaq, closed the trading day up 16.32% to $295.29, while Circle (CRCL), listed on the NYSE, rose 33.82% to close at $199.59, according to Google Finance data.

The rally followed Tuesday's 68-30 Senate vote in favor of the GENIUS Act, passed just six weeks after it was introduced by Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty. 

Many in the crypto market see this as a bullish sign for the industry, marking a significant step toward creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday to get the GENIUS Act to his desk “ASAP — NO DELAYS,” while White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks thanked Trump for delivering on his “promise to make the USA the crypto capital of the planet.”

Circle, the issuer of USDC (USDC) — the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization — is set to benefit from the bill, as most of its revenue comes from interest earned on the reserves backing USDC, which it co-founded in partnership with Coinbase in October 2018.

Following the stock surge, crypto trader Genco said that the market is “slowly discovering that Coinbase gets 50% of $CRCL revenue generated from USDC [and] 100% of revenue from USDC on Coinbase platform [and] an equity stake.”

“It's a Stablecoin Summer,” Genco said, acknowledging the Genius Act being passed by the Senate. “This will be the most obvious play in retrospect. ” Crypto analyst TylerD added, “CRCL is the talk of the town.”

Meanwhile, crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano pointed to Coinbase's stock surge as a signal that “Wall Street wants Bitcoin and crypto assets.”

Coinbase stock's all-time high is $357, reached in November 2021 amid a broader crypto market rally that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hit new highs of $69,000. 

At the time of publication, Bitcoin's current high is $111,970, which it reached on May 22.

While Coinbase has been publicly listed since April 2021, Circle has only been public for a few weeks.

On June 5, Circle made a strong entry onto the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares climbing 167% in its first trading session.

Some crypto market participants think this could be the start of more stablecoin companies going public, but others aren't so sure it will go well.

On Monday, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes warned that most new public stablecoin companies will be overvalued and fail. Hayes also claimed that Circle's stock price is “insanely overvalued.”

Experts believe the modified stalagmites are evidence of a planned occupation of the caves by ancient societies.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Prehistoric humans intentionally modified stalagmites in the Cova Dones cave in Spain, forming over 100 structures—known as speleofacts—as a result. The recent archaeological find becomes one of the most significant prehistoric underground discoveries in the world, according to the team behind the discovery. 

“This finding shows the adaptation of the environment by the prehistoric communities and places the site as the second most important in the world in this category, only behind the French cave of Saint-Marcel,” the discovery team from the universities of Alicante and Zaragoza wrote in a translated statement.

Located in Millares, Cova Dones may have just jumped to the forefront of prehistoric underground discussions, but answers may be hard to come by. The archaeological team identified more than 100 speleofacts coming from the fracture, displacement, or regrouping of stalagmites to form structures. Experts believe this is “convincing evidence of the planned occupation of the underground environment by prehistoric societies.” 

Still, some of the patterning of the recreated forms leaves questions as to their purpose, whether ritual or instead related to site planning by forming boundaries. 

The team was able to start dating the speleofacts thanks to calcium regrowth on the fractures, allowing them to “attribute, at least partially, these interventions to prehistoric periods.” The researchers plan to continue to study the speleofacts to better date the timing of the underground work and “accurately determine the scope and chronology of these structures.” 

This isn't the first time the prehistoric nature of Cova Dones has surfaced. In 2023, Antiquity published a study classifying the cave as home to the largest set of Paleolithic rock art on the eastern Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula, with more than 100 paintings and engravings dated around 24,000 years old. The paintings included at least 19 animal representation in three different zones in the cave, some roughly 1,300 feet from the entrance. The study noted that all the zones were easily accessible without any climbing required. 

Key animals shown in the graphics included horses, deer, aurochs, and a stag. The researchers were able to date the cave art because of an overlap with cave bear claw marks and the artwork.  Cave bears went extinct roughly 24,000 years ago. 

Shortly after the rock art finding, the existence of a 1,900-year-old Roman sanctuary was revealed in a room roughly 650 feet from the entrance of the cave, with a set of inscriptions and a coin of Emperor Claudius. 

The 2023 study noted that much of the cave system was yet unexplored by modern archaeologists, opening the possibility for additional finds.

Humpback Whales Are Blowing ‘Bubble Rings' at Boats. Are They Trying to Communicate?

Researchers bring a SETI approach to the question of what—if anything—humpbacks' underwater smoke rings might be trying to “say”

Humpback whales are known for their extensive use of bubbles—from powerful, aggressive bursts that prove their prowess during courtship to the bubble-net “curtains” they produce to round up prey in a spectacle that often draws tourists from around the world.

Now a new study published in Marine Mammal Science explores rare instances when humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae) create dramatic, doughnut-shaped vortex bubbles that look like a rolling underwater smoke ring.

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, and their colleagues at other institutions—including the SETI Institute, which is known for focusing on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) but is also interested in nonhuman intelligences on Earth—were looking for examples of whales' general bubble behavior when they uncovered a striking video taken by videographer Dan Knaub in 1988. In the footage, a humpback called “Thorn” blows 19 bubble structures—including 11 rings—over a 10-minute period.

“We were just gobsmacked—like, ‘What the hell is going on?'” says Fred Sharpe, a whale biologist at U.C. Davis. “For a team that's interested in assisting astrobiologists parse unusual signals coming from deep space, it just fell real neatly into our paradigm.... It's so bizarre.”

Sharpe and his colleagues soon found more examples on social media and from other researchers. Study co-author Jodi Frediani, a wildlife photographer who is also at U.C. Davis, even noticed a telltale circle in a photograph a friend showed during a presentation about humpback whales. With this phenomenon on her mind, she says, “I went, ‘Gee, there's a bubble ring!'”

For the study, the team recorded 12 events across the North and South Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans in which 11 individual humpbacks were seen blowing bubble rings. The researchers described 39 rings in total. “It's not a lot in the world of whales but enough—and in multiple oceans,” Frediani says.

“It's a really fun paper,” says Syracuse University biologist Susan E. Parks, who studies bubble-net feeding in humpbacks and wasn't involved in the new study. “It reads like a detective story that's trying to piece together information about something that's not widely studied and happens rarely.” Parks hasn't observed any bubble rings herself—as far as she knows, she says, “I may have seen them before and never really thought anything of them.”

Despite compiling so many examples of the rings, Sharpe still doesn't know what to think about their purpose. “My guess is that this is what it's going to feel like when we first make contact with aliens,” he says.

The researchers speculate that the behavior could be playful. One whale would blow a bubble ring and then swim through it or “do a spy hop right through the middle of it,” Frediani says—when performing such a spy hop, the whale would peep its head vertically above the surface, right through the bubble ring. Or perhaps the animals' behavior could respresent curiosity toward humans: of the 12 recorded events, nine involved whales that approached the human observers more closely before they blew rings.

“We need the entire human brain trust's help deciphering this. It's almost like [the whales'] blowhole is a mouth, and the symbols coming out are bubbles, as opposed to sounds.” —Fred Sharpe University of California, Davis

Could the whales be trying to communicate with us? Sharpe doesn't rule this out as a possibility. He posits that the presence of humans seems to trigger bubble blowing and that humpbacks improve with practice. “This may be a species-atypical signal that's crafted for people,” he says, “whales reaching out to humans ... using their own parlance, their own form of communication.”

Parks thinks it's plausible that the animals are putting on a display for humans, but she adds that it's too soon to tell with such a small sample size. “They'd want a lot more [observations] before they could say with certainty,” she says. Because most of the observations were made by people, this could skew the data, she notes, although there were “two observations from planes, so we know [the whales] do produce them [bubble rings] when people aren't present, too.”

Now that more researchers know to look for these bubble rings, Parks says, reported sightings may greatly increase. With more data, Sharpe and his colleagues hope to figure out what the purpose of these swirling doughnuts of air is—and whether the rings could possibly contain information. “We need the entire human brain trust's help deciphering this,” Sharpe says. “It's almost like [the whales'] blowhole is a mouth, and the symbols coming out are bubbles, as opposed to sounds.”

Sharpe hopes footage from the study will help people feel connected with whales and make them want to protect the animals from human threats such as ship strikes, entanglement, noise and chemical pollution, habitat loss and disruption of the food web. He says that he also wants to find a way to let the whales “know that they've been heard.” For him, trying to decipher potential messages and find a way to respond puts the team “in the same place you would be if you were trying to communicate with aliens—and you got a message.”

Findings from clinical trials and other studies are summarized in systematic reviews, which guide policy decisions.Credit: Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty

Scientists say they have used artificial intelligence (AI) to reproduce 12 systematic reviews in two days — slashing the time it takes to produce these ‘gold-standard' studies, which bring together the results of multiple publications and normally take many months to do.

The new system, described in a preprint posted on medRxiv last week1, could help to accelerate the production of influential reviews used by doctors and policymakers, its developers say. Using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate two laborious steps in the systematic-review process allowed the team to rapidly reproduce a dozen Cochrane reviews — a particularly rigorous type of study — and even to update a review in just 20 minutes, says co-author Christian Cao, a medical student at the University of Toronto, Canada.

Can AI review the scientific literature — and figure out what it all means?

“It's crazy to see that in the time I get a coffee, a systematic review would be done,” says Cao. He and two of his collaborators have started a spin-off company called otto review to turn their methods into a commercial software platform.

But other researchers are sceptical that the technology can accelerate the process as much as its creators suggest. They point out that the team has not yet automated some major tasks, and that the system needs to be tested independently — which would require more details of the study to be released. “For a scientific paper, its claims need to be verifiable — and I can't verify it,” says James Thomas, a systematic-review specialist at University College London.

Systematic reviews are important because they can make sense of many academic studies such as clinical trials by combining their results. They underlie the guidelines used in medical practice worldwide and are increasingly used to guide decisions in policy, education and elsewhere.

But doing a systematic review is a chore. It involves searching academic databases to find potentially thousands of relevant studies, screening them to pull out the handful of most pertinent ones, assessing if they could be biased or untrustworthy, and extracting and analysing the data, often using a statistical technique called a metanalysis. The process takes months — sometimes years — and costs well over $100,000 per review, according to one estimate, which is why many systematic reviews are not kept up to date.

Researchers have long used software to help, but the last few years has seen a surge of interest in using LLMs to automate parts of the task. “This field is awash with hypey claims from companies,” says Justin Clark, who builds automated review tools at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia.

A team of cognitive psychologists from the Michigan State University Department of Psychology have received a $860,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research to develop assessments for identifying people who are good at performing complex procedural tasks, even under challenging conditions like sleep deprivation and frequent interruptions.

"If we develop the right tools, we can identify people who are going to be better at performing a wide range of procedures. This is important because Navy personnel are increasingly called upon to do lots of different tasks as military systems become more complex," said Erik Altmann, lead investigator of the study and professor in MSU's psychology department. "The goal is to get the right person in the right job at the right time."

This multiyear study will look at individual differences in placekeeping, which is the cognitive ability to remember what step you are on in a procedural sequence. The researchers will also test whether incorporating task interruptions during training can help personnel develop cognitive strategies for placekeeping during deployment, when personnel may be sleep-deprived.

"We know that under conditions of sleep deprivation, people make more procedural errors, especially when they're interrupted in the middle of a task. Procedural errors can be catastrophic, so the Navy is interested in reducing them," said Altmann.

The research team, which also includes cognitive psychologists Kimberly Fenn and Zach Hambrick, has been funded since 2016 by the Office of Naval Research, with past studies looking at multitasking and the effect of sleep on cognitive performance.

The results of this study could improve personnel selection and classification in the Navy and in other fields where procedural accuracy is critical; results also could suggest approaches to training that make people more resilient to effects of stressors like sleep deprivation and task interruption.

A new study provides empirical evidence for a rule explored by biogeographers for centuries.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Earth is home to incredibly remarkable and diverse biomes that host millions of species worldwide. (George Lucas managed to create an entire galaxy far, far away for Star Wars using just the natural wonders mostly found in the state of California.) Although life appears relatively well-distributed across countries and continents—barring Antarctica, of course—a new study suggests that biodiversity isn't so much an evenly distributed blanket across the planet as it is a “core-to-transition” organization. 

This is the insight gleaned from a new article—published earlier this month in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution—analyzing how organisms are divided into biogeographical regions, or bioregions, across the planet's surface. An international team of scientists from Sweden, Spain, and the U.K. examined the global distribution maps of species across a variety of limbs on the tree of life, including amphibians, birds, dragonflies, mammals, marine rays, reptiles, and even trees. Because of this vast swath of differing types of life, the researchers expected that species distribution would vary wildly due to environmental and historical factors. 

However, what they discovered is that life all around the world proliferates through a very similar process. First, there is a core area where life appears to flourish, and from there, species tend to radiate outward—hence “core-to-transition” organization. 

“In every bioregion, there is always a core area where most species live,” Rubén Bernardo-Madrid, a co-author of the study from Umeå University, said in a press statement. “From that core, species expand into surrounding areas, but only a subset manages to persist. It seems these cores provide optimal conditions for species survival and diversification, acting as a source from which biodiversity radiates outward.”

These “core” regions are immensely important, as they only cover about 30 percent of the world's surface but contain more biodiversity than the other 70 percent. These regions likely evolved because they were originally refuges from the devistation brought on by past climatic events, such as the Last Glacial Maximum. The study also shows that overall species must be well adapted for heat and drought to colonize new areas beyond these core bioregions. 

“The predictability of the pattern and its association with environmental filters can help to better understand how biodiversity may respond to global change,” Joaquín Calatayud, co-author of the study from  Rey Juan Carlos University, said in a press statement.

Of course, this core-to-transition organization idea isn't a new one. Biogeographers have largely illustrated this phenomenon over the centuries, but this is the first time that empirical evidence has confirmed these long-standing suspicions. Understanding the relationship between life and these bioregions can help inform conservation decisions while predicting how certain species may respond to a new type of climatic uncertainty—anthropogenic climate change. 

“Our core-to-transition hypothesis and results,” the authors wrote, “show that global variations in species richness can be better understood by unravelling the genesis of regional hotspots and the subsequent filtering of species to the rest of the biogeographical region.”

Natural cement found in industrial waste reacts with ocean water to form rocks in just 35 years, instead of millions.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Fossils are amazing; not only can they spark inspiration for iconic movie franchises (I'm looking at you, Jurassic Park), but they more importantly also provide accurate timestamps that help researchers piece together history from across millennia. Incredibly, scientists are starting to find examples of a new kind of fossil—well, sort of. Researchers from the University of Glasgow found modern society's detritus, including things like soda tabs, cemented inside a new form of rock. Published in the journal Geology, the study reconsiders everything we know about the rock cycle and how humans affect it. 

Typically, rocks take thousands to millions of years to form, with processes like heating, compaction, and melting producing different types of rock over long periods of time. The recent study, however, found that the anthropoclastic rock cycle is forming rocks in just 35 years rather than hundreds. Researchers realized this when they were studying slag deposits—or byproducts from industrial production—at Derwent Howe in West Cumbria. 

The region was formerly home to steel and iron-making plants, and scientists noticed irregular formations in the coastal cliffs, leading them to investigate 13 different sites in the area. Using methods including electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy (chemical analysis), the team determined the slag is made of “natural cements” like calcite, goethite, and brucite. They explain in the study that the rapid cementation is likely a reaction between the waste and the sea water. 

Researchers were able to pinpoint just how rapid this new rock formation is by using the “anthropogenic material”—or, more simply put, modern junk—they found hiding inside the rock.

“We found both a King George V coin from 1934 and an aluminium can tab with a design that we realised couldn't have been manufactured before 1989 embedded in the material,” John MacDonald, co-author of the study, explained in a press release. “This gives us a maximum time frame of 35 years for this rock formation, well within the course of a single human lifetime.”

Other discoveries include a zipper, copper wire, and even a tire. 

 “This is an example in microcosm of how all the activity we're undertaking at the Earth's surface will eventually end up in the geological record as rock,” MacDonald continued, “but this process is happening with remarkable, unprecedented speed.”

Researchers also expressed the environmental concerns the new rock form poses. The study suggests that we don't have as much time to dispose of loose waste material as we previously believed—and it only gets worse after it hardens. According to experts, excess anthropoclastic rocks could affect life both above and below the water's surface, especially as coastal ecosystems change with rising sea levels. 

“What's remarkable here is that we've found these human-made materials being incorporated into natural systems and becoming lithified—essentially turning into rock—over the course of decades instead,” co-author Amanda Owen said in the release. “It challenges our understanding of how a rock is formed, and suggests that the waste material we've produced in creating the modern world is going to have an irreversible impact on our future.”

While this isn't the first time the anthropoclastic rock cycle was recorded, it is the first time researchers could put a definitive timeline on the process. The team explained in the release that the effects of anthropoclastic rock aren't currently included in models of erosion and land management, which are crucial parts of combating climate change. In the future, the researchers hope to study more deposits throughout Europe and further understand the rapid anthropoclastic rock cycle.

The AI-assisted, plug-in hybrid system will improve efficiency to extend the usage of both the engine and the battery pack.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Humans are currently attempting to leverage the power of AI for everything from tracking the bathroom habits or our cats to enhancing the United States Air Force's mission effectiveness. And recently, it has been used in an attempt to optimize the engine under the hood of your car. Geely, a Chinese automaker, claims that the use of AI algorithms in its hybrid system could extend their battery pack's lifespan by up to 15 percent. 

Somewhat unsurprisingly, Geely is pretty tight-lipped about how its Leishen AI Hybrid 2.0 system leverages AI to produce such a significant increase in efficiency. Parsing through press materials from as early as 2021 only reveals that AI tech helped to extend the maintenance intervals for both the internal-combustion engine and the battery pack.

Thankfully, many other components contribute to Geely's astronomical thermal efficiency figure, including seven friction-reduction technologies, a variable displacement oil pump, and optimized intelligent thermal management. (Thermal efficiency is a way to measure how effectively a device converts thermal energy into useful work—horsepower, in this case.) The end result is a system that produces a quoted efficiency of 2.67 L/100 km, which translates to just above 88 mpg.

BYD, one of Geely's biggest competitors in the Chinese automotive industry, is currently only able to reach 46.06% efficiency with its DM-i system. For context, this thermal efficiency number means that BYD's system can only manage to eke out 6.4 L/100 km of  fuel consumption—just under 36.7 mpg. It's clear that Geely is on top when it comes to overall efficiency, but obviously, there are a number of other metrics we could use to compare the two automakers. We also have to look at factors like charge times and the list prices of the vehicles that both automakers bring to the table.

BYD's Han DM plug-in hybrid starts at just above $31,400 USD, while Geely's Galaxy A7—potentially its first production car to feature the new technology—is expected to have a much more reasonable MSRP of around $14,000. Other competitors in the Chinese automotive industry include NIO, XPeng, Li Auto, and even Tesla.

Geely's Galaxy M9 SUV will be another of the brand's vehicles to use their latest and greatest hybrid system. Along with its new AI-powered underpinnings, the M9 will also lean on AI tech to improve power delivery, allowing the hybrid SUV to sprint to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds. Pretty impressive.

In the more distant future, Geely is also planning to adapt the Leishein AI Hybrid 2.0 to run on hydrogen. While hydrogen is much less accessible than gasoline, it could potentially boost the engine's thermal efficiency from 47.26 % to 48.15 %. Car News China reports that we could potentially see the hydrogen powertrain in use as early as Q4 2025.

Metrics details

Solution-processed metal oxide (MO) thin-film transistors present substantial promise for next-generation large-area, low-cost electronics. However, challenges like prolonged high-temperature annealing (at >400 °C) and a lack of universal, high-resolution printing technology hinder their widespread applications. Here we report a processing technology, termed ‘plasmonic printing', for fabricating high-performance, solution-processed all-MO thin-film electronics under room temperature and ambient conditions. This process leverages femtosecond-laser-excited silver nanowires to induce plasmonic local heating, facilitating rapid (<0.3 s) and localized conversion of MO precursors into high-quality MO thin films, including conductor, dielectric and semiconductor. Remarkably, these MO thin films exhibit superior electrical performance without the requirement of special gases or high-temperature treatment, thereby enhancing the fabrication efficiency. Furthermore, precise pattern control is demonstrated, enabling the fabrication of high-density, solution-processed all-MO transistor arrays (48,400 transistors per square centimetre) and integrated logic gates with uniformity and precision. This technology presents a promising pathway for the cost-effective and high-throughput printing of high-density, complex, multilayered solution-processed MO electronics, delivering performance on par with vacuum-based counterparts.

Metrics details

Many countries worldwide are transitioning from fossil fuel-dependent economies to carbon neutrality, driven by the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement. However, without considering the regional distribution of essential services like water and energy, this transition could inadvertently maintain or increase inequities, threatening sustainable development. Here, we argue that spatial equity of benefits should be considered in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector interdependencies and high service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan for regionally equitable climate-compatible futures. The multisector design framework combines integrated river basin-power system simulation with artificial intelligence design tools. The utility of the framework is demonstrated for Ghana by identifying the most efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios and their implied trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance. Case-study results show that an equitable low-carbon energy transition will require increased investments in renewable energy and transmission alongside more informed infrastructure system planning. With low renewable investments, equity can be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and electricity supply curtailments.

Reducing socio-economic inequalities is integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1,2. For instance, SDG 10 aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries1, and other goals stress equitable development globally1,2. However, more than 70% of the global population is experiencing growing socio-economic inequalities3, hindering progress towards sustainable development. Nearly 650 million people in the world still live in extreme poverty4, and around 30% of the global population is food insecure5. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, and the rising cost of living disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable people, who often have limited or no access to essential services3,4,6.

Several countries are transitioning from fossil fuel-driven economies to carbon neutrality to deliver on the SDGs1 and the Paris Agreement7, intending to limit global mean temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, meeting the SDGs and mitigating climate change without considering broader socio-economic implications of interventions could exacerbate inequalities8. For instance, climate mitigation actions are expected to yield long-term benefits across multiple SDGs9,10 but might have short-term trade-offs with other goals, like poverty reduction and inequality10,11. Inadequate planning for energy transitions could increase inequalities12,13,14,15,16,17, for example in access to water and electricity. Realising the SDGs is challenged by the complexity of involving multiple disciplines, sectors, and actors in decision-making18,19. Policy decisions aimed at achieving individual SDGs could create trade-offs with other SDGs9, and thus, policymakers should aim for an energy transition that creates synergies and balances trade-offs between societal goals20,21.

Increased access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is required to achieve the SDGs1,20,22. Electrification improves the quality of life and enables human development through better-equipped facilities for healthcare, education, and business17,22,23. However, over 700 million people globally do not have access to electricity, of whom more than 75% live in sub-Saharan Africa4,24. A renewables-based energy transition can help increase access to affordable and clean energy to meet the fast-growing energy demand and mitigate climate change4,24,25,26. Most countries included renewable energy targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)27,28,29. The renewable share of electricity generation rose by almost 8% between 2011 and 2021, and reached an installed capacity of 3146 gigawatts (GW), which accounts for 28% of the world's energy generation27. However, recent reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and REN21 suggest that the share of renewables in electricity generation must increase to more than 60% to achieve energy and climate goals by 203026,27.

Energy transitions can produce regional disparities in renewable energy access and job creation in developed countries12,13,14,15,30. Strategic regional planning can help avoid these inequalities while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many developing countries (those eligible for Official Development Assistance under the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)31) currently have high levels of disparities in (water and electricity) service provision. Planning low-carbon energy transitions in developing countries offers an opportunity to reduce these inequalities. The aspiration to consider equity in energy transitions is reflected in the recovery packages for recent global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rising energy costs, and inflation28,32. The African Union Green Recovery Action Plan aims to build more equitable, greener, and sustainable economies33. The USA Inflation Reduction Act34 includes a US$ (US dollars) 370 billion fund for renewable energy, climate crisis, and equity, and the Build Back Better plan35,36 aims to invest US$ 2 trillion in green and inclusive growth, including US$ 400 billion for clean energy and 40% of investment benefits for communities that are marginalised and underserved by infrastructure services37.

Energy systems are typically embedded within complex water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) systems, in which actions in one part of the system impact the others. Jointly managing these resources allows consideration of their cross-sectoral interdependencies, trade-offs, and synergies, and subsequently, the development of more sustainable infrastructure development pathways. So far, research has assessed distributional equity in the context of individual sectors. For instance, in the power sector, power system models have been used to assess the trade-offs between least-cost and regionally equitable allocation of solar and wind power plants in Germany15 and that of decentralised renewable energy sources in Switzerland14. Others considered electrification inequality in planning national power systems in sub-Saharan Africa16,17. A few studies evaluated inequality in access to water resources38,39,40. However, despite frequently high levels of co-dependence between resource systems, to our knowledge, equity has not been considered in designing multisector infrastructure systems to reduce regional benefit distribution inequities and carbon emissions while improving overall system performance and alleviating inter-sectoral conflicts across multiple resource systems.

In this paper, we argue for considering spatial equity of water and energy services in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector linkages and service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan national-scale equitable climate-compatible futures. The framework combines interlinked water resource and power systems simulators with artificial intelligence design tools. We demonstrate the framework using a case study of planning Ghana's future water-energy system for 2030-2040, identifying infrastructure intervention portfolios with efficient trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance.

Classically, energy infrastructure planning considers goals such as minimising electricity supply curtailment, capital investment, and carbon emissions41,42. Other approaches extend the goals to include water resources and ecosystems, such as maximising hydropower generation and minimising damage to river ecosystems43,44. While such methods can design infrastructure plans that improve system performance at an aggregate level, equity in the regional distribution of water and energy services has not been considered to our knowledge. In this paper, we build on a water resource and power system simulation and design framework introduced by ref. 43 and extend it to include spatial equity of water and energy services as infrastructure planning goals. The resulting framework (Fig. 1) has three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective planning to design equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning.

The framework includes three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search for equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning.

In the first component of the design framework, equity in regional benefit distribution is added as a policy objective of infrastructure planning, alongside other goals. We use the Gini index to quantify and minimise water and electricity access inequities. The Gini index is typically used to measure inequalities – ranging from zero (perfect equality) to one (total inequality). Our application of the index is designed to account for equity. For water supply, we apply the Gini index to water supplied relative to demand. For electricity supply, since some areas have lower electricity demand due to regional disparities in economic development, if the ratio of supply to demand were used, it would easily be satisfied. Instead, we apply the Gini index to electricity supplied per capita. While this does not account for inevitable variations in regional economic activities and lifestyles, it makes the most of available model outputs and allows incorporating a spatial measure of energy service equity into the framework. Intervention options that can be used to achieve the identified equity, environmental, and system performance goals are also selected in the first component of the framework. These interventions include infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies. The selected interventions are used in the second component of the framework to generate a set of efficient multisector infrastructure and operation portfolios using a simulation-based artificial intelligence search design process.

In the second component of the framework, an integrated river basin-power system simulator is used to represent spatial WEFE nexus dynamics43. The river system is modelled using a water resource system model45,46. The river system model represents water resources infrastructure (e.g., dams) using a network structure driven by water supplies (hydrological inflows) and demands (e.g., municipal and irrigation water requirements and hydropower) and system operating rules. The power system is modelled using a direct current optimal power flow model47. The power system model simulates network connectivity, different power generation types including renewable energy generators, and high time resolution electricity demand profiles. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented simulation framework48. This framework integrates the simulators at the model run timestep and coordinates their inputs and outputs to form a single simulation. The integrated WEFE infrastructure system simulator simulates managed rivers (with river inflows, existing and planned water storage reservoirs, hydropower, municipal water supply abstractions, irrigation, and flood recession agriculture) and energy systems (solar power, combined solar and storage, wind power, bioenergy, thermal power generators, electricity transmission lines, and electricity demands). The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to identify efficient intervention portfolios43.

In the third component of the framework, machine learning models, trained based on the search outputs (i.e., values of decision variables and objectives), are combined with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)49 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity, environmental, and system performance indicators. The SHAP analysis of intervention options helps stakeholders explore how changing infrastructure and resource allocation policy options influences intervention portfolios. Further details on the analytical framework are given in the Methods.

We use Ghana as a case study to demonstrate the importance of considering the spatial equity of water and energy services in designing equitable low-carbon futures. We use the framework above to design efficient power system intervention portfolios, including bioenergy, intermittent renewables (solar and wind), solar storage, and transmission lines, using projected electricity demands for 2030-2040. Figure 2 shows the regions of Ghana defined based on equally sized population groups. These regions are used to quantify spatial equity in water and energy access and to locate the energy infrastructure expansion options currently listed in Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. The electricity mix of Ghana comes from hydro (47%), gas (30%), and oil (23%)51. The installed capacity for existing hydropower is 1,580 megawatts (MW). The Pwalugu multi-purpose dam is under construction and will add an electricity generation capacity of 59 MW. The country's total thermal power installed capacity is 4325 MW50. Ghana had an electricity access rate of around 85% in 202124. However, some challenges still exist, including power outages52 (called Dumsor in Ghana, which means “off and on”), low electricity access rates in the Northeast and Northwest regions50, high electrical transmission losses (approximately 20%50), and a high per capita energy-related carbon emission rate compared with other sub-Saharan African countries51. The government of Ghana aims to increase renewables in the power generation mix to 1363 MW53 and achieve a 45% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to business-as-usual levels54,55. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows Ghana's national power system transmission network and existing and planned water-energy infrastructure. Supplementary Table 1 provides the type and number of nodes in the Ghana multisector infrastructure system model.

a–c Ghana's power system infrastructure expansion is considered in the design process. d The regions of Ghana are defined based on equally sized populations (to quantify the electricity access Gini index). The irrigation and municipal water supply Gini indices are calculated between the northern (Northeast, Northwest, and Ashanti) and southern regions (Lower Southeast, Upper Southeast, and Southwest) due to the limited spatial data of nodes of irrigation and municipal water demands. The bar and segment colours in (a) and (b) correspond to the regions with the same colours in (d). GW stands for gigawatts. The map in (d) is based on data from Ghana Statistical Services (GSS). Source data are provided as a Source Data file via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14851474 (ref. 81).

The design formulation for Ghana includes minimising the electricity access Gini index, carbon emissions from generation, electricity supply curtailment, irrigation water supply Gini index, power system capital and operating costs, and maximising agriculture yields and flood recession agriculture benefits (eight objectives). The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including infrastructure expansion (solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines), operating rules for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and electricity and irrigation water allocation policies.

Figure 3a shows a parallel coordinates plot of the efficient infrastructure and operation portfolios produced for Ghana using the framework. Selected portfolios are indicated as thick coloured lines. The “baseline” portfolio (black line) reflects the performance of the infrastructure expansion proposed in the Ghana Power System Master Plan50. The “baseline” has high values of Gini coefficients for energy and irrigation water, carbon emissions, and load curtailment compared to the selected portfolios except for the “low energy Gini and high emissions” portfolio (magenta line). The selected portfolios (intervention bundles) show varying trade-offs between performance indicators. For instance, achieving low-carbon emissions (teal line) requires large investments in renewables and transmission lines, whereas less investment increases emissions (blue line). There is also a trade-off between power load curtailment and capital investment (teal and magenta lines). The “low energy Gini” portfolios (magenta and brown lines) improve equity by 7% compared to the “baseline” but alter emissions and curtailment depending on the level of investment. A reduction of US$ 180 million in investment compared to the “baseline” portfolio increases emissions by 7% (magenta line), whereas an increase of US$ 3,000 million results in a 5% reduction in emissions (brown line). Some Ghanaian regions have low use of electricity (e.g., Northwest and Northeast), resulting in a low electricity Gini index limit of 0.473. The “low emissions” portfolio (teal line) shows a 6% reduction in inequities in electricity access, a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, and a 1% increase in agricultural yield compared to the “baseline” while decreasing the load curtailment and irrigation water supply Gini index to zero, with an increase of US$ 7240 million investment in renewables and transmission lines. Except for a 9% increase in carbon emissions, the “low curtailment” portfolio (blue line) is comparable to the “low emissions” portfolio (teal line), with an increase of US$ 5280 million in investment compared to the “baseline”.

The upward direction on each axis in (a) is desirable and a straight line across the top would present an ideal plan; diagonal lines between axes indicate trade-offs, whereas horizontal lines represent synergies. The circle and bar colours in (b) and (c, d) correspond to the lines with the same colours in (a).

Figure 3b shows the distribution of infrastructure expansion (i.e., how much new intermittent renewables and solar storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines) in the selected portfolios of Fig. 3a, c, d show carbon emissions of thermal and bioenergy power plants of the Fig. 3a portfolios. The “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios include major investments in renewables (Fig. 3b). These portfolios improve system performance and decrease operating costs (by nearly 20%) compared to the “baseline”. The “low emissions” portfolio results in a high capacity of new transmission lines, whereas transmission line expansion is lower in the “baseline” and “low energy Gini” portfolios. The renewables are lower in the “low energy Gini” portfolios. Figure 3c, d show that thermal power plants are the major contributors to carbon emissions; the power system continues to partially rely on them to meet the growing electricity demand.

Results show how changes in electricity access equity are impacted by the spatial distribution of investments (i.e., prioritising underserved regions and moving resources from more developed to least developed regions to ensure equitable regional coverage of services - Fig. 4) and indicate the need for large investments in renewables to shift to a low-carbon future (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4). Figure 4 presents the infrastructure expansion by region of the selected portfolios from Fig. 3a. This figure shows how more informed infrastructure planning reduces inequities in electricity access (i.e., adding new generation and transmission capacity and changing electricity allocation priorities in regions with high existing disparities - the Northeast and Northwest regions) while maintaining the same level of emissions and investment cost (e.g., the “low energy Gini and low emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios - see Figs. 3a and 4). Results also show more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios, with higher intra-regional transmission line expansion than cross-regional transmission line expansion (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower reservoir re-operation, and better spatial planning could increase equity in the regional distribution of (water and energy) services and reduce carbon emissions while improving agricultural performance and meeting future energy service targets (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4). With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments (the “low energy Gini” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4).

The top set of figures (a–f) show the regional distribution of renewables, and the bottom set of figures (g–l) show the regional distribution of transmission line expansion of portfolios selected in the Pareto-efficient portfolios (highlighted coloured lines of Fig. 3a). Solar, wind, solar storage, and bioenergy expansion are higher and more diverse in the “low emissions”, “low energy Gini and low emissions”, and “low curtailment” portfolios, and lower in the “low energy Gini and high emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios. The figure also shows that there is more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios and that the intra-regional transmission line expansion (sum of first six coloured bars in (g–l)) is higher than cross-regional transmission line expansion (sum of last six coloured bars in (g–l)), see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 3b for the aggregated portfolios of infrastructure expansion. GW stands for gigawatts. Source data are provided as a Source Data file via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14851474 (ref. 81).

The investment and resource allocation priority options show varying degrees of influence on performance indicators (Fig. 5). Some intervention options are effective at bolstering specific performance indicators, whereas others impact multiple indicators (Fig. 5a–g). The most effective option for equity in electricity access and load curtailment is investing in bioenergy plants in the Northeast and Northwest regions of Ghana (Fig. 5a, c). In contrast, equity in irrigation water supply and agricultural yield are influenced the most by irrigation water allocation priorities (Fig. 5d, e). Results show the most effective choices for improving multiple performance indicators are changing the capacities of bioenergy generation plants in the Northwest and Northeast regions and investing in the Southwest's solar power and bioenergy and Southeast's wind power (Fig. 5h).

Considering regional benefit distribution equity in multisector infrastructure planning can help guide a country toward a more equitable transition from fossil fuels to lower-emission energy sources while reducing inter-sectoral conflicts across multi-resource systems. A more equitable energy transition will accelerate transformational SDG co-benefits20 and help reach the Paris Agreement7. This paper presents a WEFE artificial intelligence-assisted analytical framework that identifies trade-offs and synergies of multi-dimensionally efficient and more equitable low-carbon water-energy infrastructure and operation portfolios. The framework can help stakeholders identify infrastructure investments and resource allocation policies and evaluate the importance ranking and positive and negative influence of different interventions in achieving energy transition policy goals. Through iterative stakeholder deliberation processes, new or modified intervention options can be set and used to revise intervention portfolios to ensure they appropriately reflect stakeholder aspirations.

Our approach aims to lower national emissions in Ghana through a balanced energy infrastructure system expansion programme (bioenergy, solar, wind, solar storage, and transmission lines), and reservoir re-operation (of Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu dams). Ghana's resulting efficient and equitable low-carbon intervention strategies show how considering equity in energy transitions allows reducing both regional service disparities and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. We show how the spatial distribution of investments drives electricity access equity and that increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower re-operation, and better spatial planning enhance equity and reduce carbon emissions while improving food production and meeting future energy service goals. With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments. Ghana's power system continues to partially rely on thermal power plants to meet the growing electricity demand despite the expansion of renewable technologies, resulting in relatively high thermal-based carbon emissions. However, adding bioenergy generation (and transmission lines) helps displace thermal power and decreases emissions while increasing equity in service provision in the Ghanaian case. Bioenergy, which uses agricultural crop and forestry residues and municipal waste as an input50, is recognised as Ghana's leading spatially distributed and dispatchable renewable generation technology. Crop residues alone in Ghana have an estimated bioenergy potential of 75 terajoules (TJ)50,56. Other studies have also highlighted the potential of crop residues for bioenergy in Ghana57,58,59. However, increasing bioenergy could compete with food production for land resources if only relying on energy crops for bioenergy60,61. Bioenergy production, therefore, could be regulated to prevent a negative impact on food security.

The proposed WEFE infrastructure design approach help analysts and policymakers plan for equitable low-carbon futures. The proposed approach considers the spatial equity of water and energy services alongside emission reduction and other aggregated national infrastructure planning goals to identify efficient, equitable, climate-compatible intervention portfolios for multisector WEFE systems. Pareto-optimal portfolios (Figs. 3 and 4 for Ghana) help identify infrastructure interventions that reduce service inequities and emissions and improve sectoral complementarities. Stakeholders can deliberate the pros and cons of a large set of efficient intervention options to help find a compromise portfolio that manages trade-offs and leverages synergies across multiple competing interests. The machine learning technique helps stakeholders understand how different interventions drive equity, emission, and other system performance targets, as shown for Ghana (Fig. 5). This allows choosing portfolios or revising intervention choices and repeating the process if no consensus can be attained. The proposed approach could be adapted for other countries planning an equitable transition to lower-emission energy sources, especially those with service inequities and interdependent WEFE challenges.

This study did not consider the potential effects of climate change and uncertainties with future projections in the equity-informed planning of WEFE systems. Climate change could impact energy generation, the demand for water and energy, and water resources management. These changes and future uncertainties could have repercussions on the equity of providing water and energy services and inter-sectoral conflicts among multiple resource systems. Addressing these limitations in future research would help identify robust infrastructure strategies for adapting to climate change.

In this paper, we argue for considering equity in shaping future multisector resource systems to reduce service inequities and emissions and better balance regional sectoral benefits. The approach can support countries in phasing out fossil-fuel electricity sources and the transition to carbon neutrality fairly and transparently. As such, it is a relevant approach for developing countries seeking to transition towards lower carbon emissions while at the same time improving services. Realising an equitable low-carbon future requires considering multiple sectors, their interactions, and the equity implications of adopting different investment and policy intervention packages. Adding equity considerations alongside goals like climate mitigation could help achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement.

The river system is modelled using Python Water Resources (Pywr)45. Pywr is an open-source Python repository that simulates resource system networks. It allows representing water resources infrastructure using a network structure driven by water supplies and demands and system operating rules. Pywr uses a linear programme to solve water allocations at every simulation time step (weekly in this study) by minimising allocation penalties subject to constraints imposed by operating rules. The Ghana river system model includes existing and planned infrastructure in Ghana. More details on the model can be obtained in the previous publications on the model43,46.

The power system model uses a direct current optimal power flow linear programme47 to minimise power system costs at each simulation time step (i.e., hourly) subject to equality constraints (power balance at each node) and inequality constraints (power generation and line limits). The power system model is an interconnected network of different energy sources, transmission lines, substations, distribution networks, and electricity demand locations. Energy generators can be represented as nodes in the network, each with their defined constraints, such as maximum power capacity and associated costs. The Ghana power system model simulates the existing and planned hydro, solar, combined solar and storage, wind, bioenergy, and thermal generators50. Electricity demand projections, generating resources, capital and operating costs of power plants and transmission lines, and hourly profiles of renewables were taken from Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. Hourly electricity demand profiles and transmission data were collected from the Ghanaian national grid operator, the Ghana Grid Company. The long-term annual peak load projections for 2030-2040 from the Ghana Power System Master Plan50 were used to scale the hourly load profile of 2018 to consider the projected growth in the electricity demand in the country (a twofold increase in the peak demand by 2030 compared to 2018). Capital costs consist of engineering, procurement, construction, start-up, and owner costs (for items like land, cooling infrastructure, administration and associated building, site works, project management, and licenses)50. The operating costs of variable renewables (solar and wind) and combined solar and storage are lower than the costs of hydropower, bioenergy, and thermal power plants50. The operating costs of thermal generators also differ depending on the technology and fuel types. Hourly power system simulations help capture the variability of intermittent renewables (solar and wind) and energy demand, as well as improve the use of hydropower based on the changing availability of renewables and other energy sources. The power system model dispatches the system's generators based on cost-merit prioritisation where solar, wind, combined solar and storage generators are dispatched first, then hydropower, bioenergy, and lastly, thermal generators. This balances energy production to align with variable energy demand and shares of different energy technologies.

The river and power systems simulators are linked to represent multisector nexus dynamics43. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented Python Network Simulation framework (Pynsim)48. The simulators run sequentially with feedback across the simulators (at hydropower generation nodes). The river system simulator runs its first simulation time step and generates the weekly average hydropower, which is then passed to the power system simulator by Pynsim as a constraint on the maximum power generation capacity for that week. The power system simulator runs for the same week at an hourly simulation time step, constrained by the information provided by the river system simulator. This process is repeated time step by time step until the simulation is completed. The integrated simulation model runs for a period of 10 years, from 2030 to 2040.

The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search algorithm (MOEA) to search for efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios43. MOEAs seek the approximately Pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimisation problems by mimicking the natural biological evolution process62,63. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the interaction between the integrated river and power system simulators and the MOEA. The MOEA generates an infrastructure intervention portfolio (i.e., a set of decision variables) and passes it to the integrated water-energy simulator. The integrated simulation model then performs a multi-year simulation to evaluate performance indicators (e.g., regarding energy transition goals) that are used as objectives to be minimised or maximised in the search process. The portfolio and values of the objectives are then stored before the next iteration, when the algorithm generates a new set of variables (a new portfolio) for the simulation model. The search algorithm learns at each iteration from the multi-objective performance of the previous iteration. The iteration between the search algorithm and the integrated simulation model continues until a stopping criterion is met. We allow up to 1.5 million iterations in this design process. Once the stopping criterion is met, a non-dominated sorting process is performed to find a set of best-performing (i.e., Pareto-optimal) intervention portfolios. Pareto-optimal solutions are efficient because they provide the best-achievable compromise among multiple performance objectives that coexist in multi-objective problems. These solutions are non-dominated, indicating no other solutions can outperform or equal them in all objectives at the same time. Stakeholders can consider these optimised solutions to find a compromise that efficiently balances trade-offs among multiple competing interests and leverages synergies. After the search, we used a machine learning method (details provided below) to assess the effectiveness of interventions in achieving performance objectives. Machine learning and interactive data visualisation tools help stakeholders understand, evaluate, and choose a preferred portfolio or iteratively revise the intervention options and repeat the process to obtain alternative, potentially better, intervention portfolios.

We used the Borg MOEA62,63 to perform the WEFE multi-objective optimisation. Borg can tackle complex nonlinear and nonconcave optimisation problems63,64. It integrates various elements from different MOEAs and introduces several new features. It uses ϵ-dominance archives and ϵ-progress to maintain a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions and monitor convergence speed62,63. It employs randomised restarts when convergence slows to revive search through self-adaptive population sizing (of solutions) and dynamically adapts the use of different recombination operators62,63 to generate new candidate solutions. The evolution process in Borg involves evolving a population of candidate solutions over generations of iterative selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The selection step uses the “survival of the fittest” principle and chooses the best population of solutions based on their performance across the optimisation objectives. The crossover step then combines the characteristics of the selected solutions (“parents”) to produce new solutions (“children”) by imitating the natural reproduction process. Random mutations are then added to the children to improve variability and adaptability in the new population of solutions. These newly candidate individuals are then evaluated, and the process continues iteratively, as explained above and in Supplementary Fig. 3.

The convergence of the multi-objective search to the approximately Pareto-optimal solutions was determined by tracking the evolution of the hypervolume65 for each of four random seeds. Each random seed uses a different starting point for the MOEA search process. The hypervolume measures the volume of the objective space above the non-dominated approximation set. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows that the hypervolume stabilises before the stopping criterion of 1.5 million iterations for all four seeds, thereby indicating convergence.

The design formulation for Ghana includes eight objectives: minimising the electricity access Gini index (Eq. (1)), minimising the carbon emissions from generation (Eq. (2)), minimising the power system load curtailment (Eq. (3)), minimising the irrigation water supply Gini index (Eq. (4)), maximising the agriculture yields (Eqs. (5–8)), minimising the power system capital costs (Eq. (9)), minimising the power system operating costs (Eq. (10)), and maximising the flood recession agriculture benefits (Eqs. (11–13)). The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including the vector of the power system infrastructure expansion, including solar, wind, combined solar and storage, and bioenergy (biomass and biogas) generators, and transmission lines, the vector of operating rules parameters (Eq. (14)) for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and the vector of the electricity and irrigation water allocation priority parameters.

where, \({{\rm{FRA}}}\) is the flood recession agriculture benefits in US$ depending on the flooding of the floodplain during the rainy peak period (July to September for northern Ghana), \({\beta }_{{{\rm{FRA}}}}\) is the average crop market price at US$ 1222 per tonne68, \({Y}_{n}\) is the total FRA yield in tonnes per year, \({A}_{n}^{f}\) is the flooded area in ha, \({q}_{n}^{{{\rm{FRA}}}}\) is the average flow in August or September in the model simulation time, \({f}_{{{\rm{FRA}}}}\) is the suitability factor69, \({C}_{y}\) is the crop yield in tonnes per ha assuming a typical crop mix of beans, maize, soya, bambara beans, millet, and groundnuts70, and \({q}_{t,n}\) is the average flow in August and September.

We used Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) to model reservoir operating rules. The use of RBFs in representing infrastructure operating rules, including reservoir storage and release decisions, have shown good performance71,72,73. The Gaussian RBF (\(\varphi\)) is defined by Eq. (14).

where, m is the number of input variables x (reservoir storage and time), n is the number of RBFs (four), wi is the weight of the ith RBF, and ci,j and bi,j are the m-dimensional centres and radius vectors of the ith RBF, respectively. The centres and radius take values in ci,jϵ[−1,1] and bi,jϵ[0, 1], and \({w}_{i}{{\rm{\epsilon }}}\left[0,1\right]\) with \(\mathop{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{w}_{i}=1\). More details can be found in the ref. 71. The time of year and storage in the reservoir are mapped to the release rule at each time step of the simulation period. This allows to dynamic adaptation of releases based on changing reservoir volumes. The multi-objective search process (MOEA) optimises the monthly storage volumes and releases (24 decision variables) for each reservoir to determine the most efficient (Pareto-optimal) operating rules. The MOEA iteratively optimises the release rules alongside infrastructure expansion, such as solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines, and energy and water allocation priorities. Hydropower reservoirs can provide flexibility and stability for power grids, and their improved operations can support the transition to clean energy43,74,75,76. The MOEA explores a range of different infrastructure interventions while also adjusting reservoir release decisions to find the best-achievable compromise among equity, emissions, and other water-energy system performance objectives. This way MOEA solutions adapt to the changing shares of different energy technologies and allocate resources to improve overall system performance (see Supplementary Fig. 3 for a description of the interaction between the integrated system model and the MOEA search).

We used the Random Forest Regression machine learning model77 from the Scikit-learn Python library78 and the SHAP49,79,80 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity and other water-energy system performance indicators. The MOEA typically yields a large set (up to thousands) of optimal solutions for large problems like the Ghana case study. While common patterns can potentially be identified from directly exploring Pareto-optimal solutions or via cluster analysis, the SHAP analysis of tree-based machine learning models49,79 helps explain the relationships between intervention decisions and the MOEA performance measures. It provides the importance ranking of different interventions and also the direction and magnitude of their influence in achieving performance objectives. The outcomes of the MOEA are used to train a Random Forest model for each performance objective. The features of each Random Forest model are the decision variables representing different investment and resource allocation priority options, and the target is each of the optimisation objectives. We divide the data into the training set (80% of the data) and the testing set (20% of the data). The training dataset is used to train 100 tree estimators, and the testing dataset is used to test the performance of the Random Forest models. We also test the performance of each model for different maximum tree depths ranging from 1 to 70 to select the best-fit tree depth for each model to avoid overfitting or underfitting models. Supplementary Fig. 5 depicts the performance of the machine learning models for the training and testing sets with different maximum tree depths and the selected maximum tree depth for each model.

Astronomers have discovered a huge filament of hot gas bridging four galaxy clusters. At 10 times as massive as our galaxy, the thread could contain some of the Universe's 'missing' matter, addressing a decades-long mystery.

The astronomers used the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and JAXA's Suzaku X-ray space telescopes to make the discovery.

Over one-third of the 'normal' matter in the local Universe - the visible stuff making up stars, planets, galaxies, life - is missing. It hasn't yet been seen, but it's needed to make our models of the cosmos work properly.

Said models suggest that this elusive matter might exist in long strings of gas, or filaments, bridging the densest pockets of space. While we've spotted filaments before, it's tricky to make out their properties; they're typically faint, making it difficult to isolate their light from that of any galaxies, black holes, and other objects lying nearby.

New research is now one ofthe first to do just this, finding and accurately characterizing a single filament of hot gas stretching between four clusters of galaxies in the nearby Universe.

"For the first time, our results closely match what we see in our leading model of the cosmos - something that's not happened before," says lead researcher Konstantinos Migkas of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. "It seems that the simulations were right all along."

XMM-Newton on the case

Clocking in at over 10 million degrees, the filament contains around 10 times the mass of the Milky Way and connects four galaxy clusters: two on one end, two on the other. All are part of the Shapley Supercluster, a collection of more than 8000 galaxies that forms one of the most massive structures in the nearby Universe.

The filament stretches diagonally away from us through the supercluster for 23 million light-years, the equivalent of traversing the Milky Way end to end around 230 times.

Konstantinos and colleagues characterized the filament by combining X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Suzaku, and digging into optical data from several others.

The two X-ray telescopes were ideal partners. Suzaku mapped the filament's faint X-ray light over a wide region of space, while XMM-Newton pinpointed very precisely contaminating sources of X-rays - namely, supermassive black holes - lying within the filament.

"Thanks to XMM-Newton we could identify and remove these cosmic contaminants, so we knew we were looking at the gas in the filament and nothing else," adds co-author Florian Pacaud of the University of Bonn, Germany. "Our approach was really successful, and reveals that the filament is exactly as we'd expect from our best large-scale simulations of the Universe."

Not truly missing

As well as revealing a huge and previously unseen thread of matter running through the nearby cosmos, the finding shows how some of the densest and most extreme structures in the Universe - galaxy clusters - are connected over colossal distances.

It also sheds light on the very nature of the 'cosmic web', the vast, invisible cobweb of filaments that underpins the structure of everything we see around us.

"This research is a great example of collaboration between telescopes, and creates a new benchmark for how to spot the light coming from the faint filaments of the cosmic web," adds Norbert Schartel, ESA XMM-Newton Project Scientist.

"More fundamentally, it reinforces our standard model of the cosmos and validates decades of simulations: it seems that the 'missing' matter may truly be lurking in hard-to-see threads woven across the Universe."

Piecing together an accurate picture of the cosmic web is the domain of ESA's Euclid mission. Launched in 2023, Euclid is exploring this web's structure and history. The mission is also digging deep into the nature of dark matter and energy - neither of which have ever been observed, despite accounting for a whopping 95% of the Universe - and working with other dark Universe detectives to solve some of the biggest and longest-standing cosmic mysteries.

Astronomers have created a galactic masterpiece: an ultra-detailed image that reveals previously unseen features in the Sculptor Galaxy. Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), they observed this nearby galaxy in thousands of colors simultaneously. By capturing vast amounts of data at every single location, they created a galaxy-wide snapshot of the lives of stars within Sculptor.

"Galaxies are incredibly complex systems that we are still struggling to understand," says ESO researcher Enrico Congiu, who led a new Astronomy & Astrophysics study on Sculptor. Reaching hundreds of thousands of light-years across, galaxies are extremely large, but their evolution depends on what's happening at much smaller scales. "The Sculptor Galaxy is in a sweet spot," says Congiu. "It is close enough that we can resolve its internal structure and study its building blocks with incredible detail, but at the same time, big enough that we can still see it as a whole system."

A galaxy's building blocks  -- stars, gas and dust  -- emit light at different colors. Therefore, the more shades of color there are in an image of a galaxy, the more we can learn about its inner workings. While conventional images contain only a handful of colors, this new Sculptor map comprises thousands. This tells astronomers everything they need to know about the stars, gas and dust within, such as their age, composition, and motion.

To create this map of the Sculptor Galaxy, which is 11 million light-years away and is also known as NGC 253, the researchers observed it for over 50 hours with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on ESO's VLT. The team had to stitch together over 100 exposures to cover an area of the galaxy about 65,000 light-years wide.

According to co-author Kathryn Kreckel from Heidelberg University, Germany, this makes the map a potent tool: "We can zoom in to study individual regions where stars form at nearly the scale of individual stars, but we can also zoom out to study the galaxy as a whole."

In their first analysis of the data, the team uncovered around 500 planetary nebulae, regions of gas and dust cast off from dying Sun-like stars, in the Sculptor Galaxy. Co-author Fabian Scheuermann, a doctoral student at Heidelberg University, puts this number into context: "Beyond our galactic neighborhood, we usually deal with fewer than 100 detections per galaxy."

Because of the properties of planetary nebulae, they can be used as distance markers to their host galaxies. "Finding the planetary nebulae allows us to verify the distance to the galaxy -- a critical piece of information on which the rest of the studies of the galaxy depend," says Adam Leroy, a professor at The Ohio State University, USA, and study co-author.

Future projects using the map will explore how gas flows, changes its composition, and forms stars all across this galaxy. "How such small processes can have such a big impact on a galaxy whose entire size is thousands of times bigger is still a mystery," says Congiu.

The European Southern Observatory (ESO) enables scientists worldwide to discover the secrets of the Universe for the benefit of all. We design, build and operate world-class observatories on the ground -- which astronomers use to tackle exciting questions and spread the fascination of astronomy -- and promote international collaboration for astronomy. Established as an intergovernmental organisation in 1962, today ESO is supported by 16 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), along with the host state of Chile and with Australia as a Strategic Partner. ESO's headquarters and its visitor centre and planetarium, the ESO Supernova, are located close to Munich in Germany, while the Chilean Atacama Desert, a marvelous place with unique conditions to observe the sky, hosts our telescopes. ESO operates three observing sites: La Silla, Paranal and Chajnantor. At Paranal, ESO operates the Very Large Telescope and its Very Large Telescope Interferometer, as well as survey telescopes such as VISTA. Also at Paranal ESO will host and operate the Cherenkov Telescope Array South, the world's largest and most sensitive gamma-ray observatory. Together with international partners, ESO operates ALMA on Chajnantor, a facility that observes the skies in the millimeter and submillimeter range. At Cerro Armazones, near Paranal, we are building "the world's biggest eye on the sky" -- ESO's Extremely Large Telescope. From our offices in Santiago, Chile we support our operations in the country and engage with Chilean partners and society.

SpaceX's upper stage prototype, designated Ship 36, exploded in southeast Texas shortly before midnight local time on June 18 during routine preparations for an upcoming test flight.

SpaceX is in the midst of preparing for Starship's next fully integrated test, known as Flight 10. The last several tests haven't gone well, but this prototype never even left the ground. The explosion—as shown in spectacular footage from NASASpaceFlight.com—occurred at SpaceX's Massey facility, a test site located several miles from the launch mount at Starbase, Texas.

The 171-foot-tall (52-meter) Starship upper stage “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,” SpaceX said in a statement on X. “A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for.” The Starbase team is coordinating with local authorities to manage the aftermath of the incident, SpaceX said, adding that, while the company reported no threat to nearby communities, it urged the public to steer clear of the area as safety measures are carried out.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in a few hours after the incident on X, brushing off the incident as “Just a scratch.” He elaborated further this morning, saying the early data “suggests a nitrogen COPV [composite overwrapped pressure vessel] in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,” and that if this proves to be the case, it's the “first time ever for this design.” A COPV is a lightweight tank made of composite fibers wrapped around a thin liner to store high-pressure fluids, according to NASA. No further details are known, but as SpaceNews points out, Starship was being prepared for a static fire test, and the explosion happened before the rocket had a chance to fire its Raptor engines.

A June 18 advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration pointed to June 29 as a potential date for Flight 10, but that seems unlikely now. SpaceX is in a bit of a slump, with this incident adding to the pile of recent setbacks. Flight 7 in January 2024 experienced a propellant leak and fire triggered by unexpected vibrations in the propulsion system. In March, Flight 8 was cut short by a hardware failure in one of the Raptor engines, while Flight 9 in May successfully reached space, but a leak led to loss of control and the vehicle broke apart during reentry.

SpaceX's Starship megarocket is built to carry people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations around the solar system. It's a key part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the Moon by 2027, and is central to Elon Musk's stated goal of colonizing Mars.

While major data breaches of this scale are typically full of billions of previously leaked credentials, today's megaleak is made of almost entirely previously unreported databases.

Cybernews, the team responsible for IDing and cataloging a significant number of previous major leaks, assembled the datasets making up this most recent 16B leak. Only one dataset in the breach, a 184 million-record batch reported by Wired, had been previously reported. The rest are all new from all over the world, including three distinct batches that held over 1 billion credentials each.

The datasets that make up the 16B breach are largely unconnected and have been uncovered by security researchers since January. The largest batch, sourced from Portuguese-speaking populations, contains 3.5 billion credentials, with other major batches named after Russian logins, Telegram logins, and a host of largely generic names.

Concerningly, it is not yet known who originally owned most of the data batches making up the breach. This means that clear action items to wipe your data from these collections cannot be issued, nor can researchers tell what attacks were being considered for the data.

As with all mega security breaches, the 16B mystery leak serves as a loud reminder to practice clean internet hygiene by choosing secure passwords that are changed semi-regularly. The breach has not yet hit the same notoriety as other, snappier-named breaches like the RockYou2024 breach or the 26-billion-logins MOAB breach, meaning data brokers may not have exploited the logins.

It also means that databases that serve to warn users about their compromised data have not yet been populated with the leaked accounts. Internet browsers like Firefox or Chrome that warn users of compromised credentials or third-party tools like Cybernews' data leak checker haven't yet been updated with the newly revealed stolen credentials.

Large collections of stolen credentials like the ones making up this megaleak are often used in major digital offensives like phishing scams or other attacks that scale up well. So ,beyond ensuring your passwords are safe and haven't gone unchanged in 10+ years, being wary of phishing and other likely scams is also good internet safety that should always be practiced, especially in the wake of cybersecurity events like this one.

In an era where K-pop music groups have undeniably become a dominant force in the global music scene, Sony Pictures Animation‘s latest film, KPop Demon Hunters, does more than ride the wave of this craze. It cleverly presents the phenomenon in an action-packed animated film that serves as a gateway for parents who are curious about why their kids are so enamored with synchronized choreography. What's more, the movie demystifies the idols, portraying them as regular people, and weaves a touching story about acceptance while incorporating tons of flashy dance and fight breaks along the way.

KPop Demon Hunters, co-directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, is a movie that could be summed up very easily by its title. Thankfully, the film has more to offer than what it lampshades on its proverbial tin. It follows follows Huntrix, a girl group built around the friendship of its three members: Mira (May Hong), the sardonic punk-girl lead dancer; Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), the bubbly, little sister-coded rapper; and Rumi (Arden Cho), the workaholic lead singer who is the heart of the group. While the trio top the charts to their army of adoring fans, Huntrix moonlights as demon hunters, protecting their adoring public from things that go bump in the night.

In concert with films of its ilk that came before it, like Turning Red and, surprisingly, Sinners, KPop Demon Hunters explores music as both a haven and a form of emotional expression through its musical elements. But unlike those films, KPop Demon Hunters leans heavily into the magical girl anime aesthetic—think Sailor Moon (or, for real ones out there, Winx Club and Totally Spies!) meets Twice—where the members aren't just deified performers; they moonlight as warriors protecting humanity from demonic threats as the latest iteration on a generations-long line of singers who protect humanity with the power of song.

All the while, their dazzling stage presence and catchy tunes manifest in a healing shield they magically enmesh the world in; the more popular and resonant their songs are with fans, the more they serve to create the legendary golden honmoon. This golden, shimmering shield keeps demons under the command of a dark entity called Gwi-Ma (Squid Game‘s Lee Byun-hun) from opening rifts in the world forever.

While all of the above is a lot to take in conceptually, KPop Demon Hunters doesn't get bogged down in a year-one-esque tale of their heroic exploits, exposing the ins and outs of their heroic mission. The moment the film opens, the girls are established as both a veteran K-pop group and demon hunters, confidently handling the hijacking of their private plane by shapeshifting demons en route to their big concert.  What's more, Huntrix kick ass while serving a live performance about how much ass they're kicking with the same kinetic energy and sonic flair as a Riot Games' K/DA—catchy, visually dazzling, and undeniably stylish—before they skydive into the stadium below to regale their adoring fans with the opener for their show.

With the girls on the precipice of achieving a golden honmoon, Gwi-Ma concocts a plan to undo the girl group's meteoric rise in popularity: Saja Boys, a rival demon boy group led by Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), who plan on taking down Huntrix by hitting them where it hurts the most, by poaching their fans.

The obvious bar that KPop Demon Hunters sets for itself is to deliver a film worthy of its distinction as the follow-up to Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Verse success, where both its songs and action are exceptional. The animation team at Sony Pictures Animation didn't skimp, delivering yet another visual treat with decadent and vibrant animation. Most notably, KPop Demon Hunters' character designs are bold and expressive, filled with off-model gags and chibi-like moments that add texture to its idol protagonists, allowing them to shed their near-mythic personas and become the kind of approachable girls with gremlin-like tendencies that anyone would want to hang out with.

Alongside the phenomenal voice work of its main cast, who display an uncanny sense of comedic timing that matches the film's fluid action, KPop Demon Hunters adds another layer of authenticity to its musicality. This is showcased by the girl group's diss track, “Takedown,” performed by Jeongyon, Jihyo, and Chaeyoung of Twice. This song, along with other catchy tracks from Huntrix and Saja Boys, demonstrates that the musical efforts are not just standard fare. In conjunction with the attention to detail in the rival group's stunning sequences, wardrobe, and rhythmic choreography, the film's musicality ensures that the songs are so catchy that even the most reluctant K-pop critic would find themselves bobbing their head and humming along to the chorus.

While the main crux of the film sees Saja Boys and Huntrix battle over the affection of fans, KPop Demon Hunters sidesteps a basic “battle of the bands” set up by introducing an intriguing early twist. Rather than facing their rivals one on one, Huntrix finds itself embroiled in a deeper struggle beyond the grueling media tours. The film's emotional core, like with the group itself, centers on Rumi whose journey to superstardom takes an unexpected turn when she loses her voice. What could have been a predictable obstacle turns into the film's most compelling arc, forcing her to confront her own identity beyond her talent as a songstress and demon hunter.

While the film does bring its conflicts and big ideas to a resolution, its ending feels overly convenient, so neatly tied up that it loses some of the depth that its setup promised. There's a twinge of missed potential here, as intriguing plot threads, particularly those tied to Rumi's journey of self-discovery and Juni's backstory, are prematurely trimmed rather than fully explored. The film could have benefited from a longer runtime, allowing for a more layered conclusion instead of opting for a simplistic “day is saved” wrap-up. The film cheekily has its cake and eats it too by calling attention to this with quips from Mira and Zoey. As a result, KPop Demon Hunters‘ final act, while functional, rings a bit hollow.

Putting aside any complaints about its somewhat rush-job wrap-up finale, KPop Demon Hunters is an animated film that boldly embraces its over-the-top premise and approaches a powerful message of acceptance. With high-energy fight sequences and moments of genuine hilarity, KPop Demon Hunters never loses sight of the magic that makes animation and idol culture so irresistibly fun. 

Sony Pictures Animation continues to establish itself as a leader in Western animation. Much like Tsuburaya Productions and Industrial Light & Magic's 3D CG animated film, Ultraman Rising, which elevates a familiar premise while celebrating Asian heritage at its core, KPop Demon Hunters reinforces Sony Animation Studio's reputation for creating visually stunning, genre-blending spectacles.

KPop Demon Hunters will be released on Netflix June 20.

But it's a start.

A high-tech tinkerer has managed to get Apple's iOS to run on the Nintendo Switch. Don't get too excited, though, as PatRyk on X wryly admits they have created “the world's slowest ‘iPhone'.” Booting this Nintendo ‘iPhone' currently takes 20 minutes, and all the apps they tried crash – but it's a start.

While the gaming tech world is all a flutter with the recently launched Switch 2, PatRyk spent two days attempting to shoehorn Apple's mobile OS onto the best-selling hybrid console. This enthusiast's modesty seems to be matched by their patience, as the new Nintendo ‘iPhone' takes 20 minutes to boot. We wonder how many times they waited that length of time, or even longer, for the boot process to hang or otherwise fail?

Using the mobile OS also sounds like an incredible life-sapping chore, with this ‘iPhone' in its current state. PatRyk says that the system “kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash).”

I've lost my mind (and 2 days of my life to install this)Behold: the world's slowest “iPhone” 🎉🎉Takes over 20 minutes to boot, kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash) 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/r3B3JPDUDVJune 17, 2025

At this stage, the project might sound dire, but it shows that running iOS on the original Switch is possible – it just needs optimization. But you aren't going to be ditching your real Apple iPhone for a Switch any time soon.

PatRyk reveals that their Nintendo ‘iPhone' project was only possible thanks to a version of QEMU created for the Apple iPhone 11 by ChefKissInc. QEMUAppleSilicon is a version of the open-source machine emulator and virtualizer tailored for emulating Apple Silicon devices, as per its name.

Over two days of mind-numbing hacking, PatRyk wrangled this GitHub code and the heavily locked-down Apple iOS. Eventually, the tinkering tour de force paid dividends, as PatRyk managed to coax iOS on Nintendo Switch to get out of bed and wash its face on a completely alien system powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1.

To wrap up, PatRyk doesn't indicate whether more hours or days will be devoted to this crazy sounding project. But they say to their followers that they will be back to share further adventures in code, more frequently, so stay tuned.

Putting aside their exorbitant cost, the trouble with prescription hearing aids is the prescription. Find a doctor. Get an appointment. Sit in a waiting room. Suffer through an hour of testing before getting the hard sell on a pair of hearing aids. Why, the indignity of it all is even worse than going deaf.

Telehealth offers a glimmer of a solution, but as everyone who's tried to show off a concerning mole to a doctor via a smartphone camera knows: Video technology can only get you so far. Audiological testing requires significant one-on-one interaction and plenty of technology to back that up. Every audiogram I've sat for has been inside a sophisticated, soundproof chamber.

Hear.com—a company that sells prescription hearing aids online and via traditional retail channels —has a workaround. It puts all the technology needed to perform a full-on hearing test in a box and mails it to you along with a set of prescription hearing aids, then walks you through the whole thing with an audiologist via a video call. I've taken Hear.com's virtual hearing test twice—this is what a tele-hearing exam looks like, should you decide to take one.

The process begins with a simple discussion. If you've never had hearing aids before, this is probably a good first step; veterans will likely skip it, especially if they know what model hearing aids they want (or how much they want to spend). A Hear.com salesperson will discuss your personal impressions of your hearing loss, any hearing aid devices you have tried, prior audiological testing, and your budget (along with any insurance you have). From there, they will suggest the best hearing aids (from their product line) to meet your needs, though you can also advocate for a specific product if you've already identified one.

Next, you'll set a time for your testing and hearing aid fitting, and a few days later, a box will arrive on your doorstep. Open it up, and the collection of hardware and the tangle of wires connecting it all may seem daunting, but rest assured, with even a modicum of technical knowledge, it all goes together quickly, and Hear.com professionals can guide you through any confusion over the phone.

Despite the significant amount of gear inside, the box is about as organized as it can get. On top, you'll find a Microsoft Surface tablet that has been stripped down to do just one thing: serve as the conduit for a video-based audiology session. After plugging the Surface into wall power, you'll find a USB breakout box to connect to the Surface's USB port. Assuming all the other devices are still properly plugged into that USB breakout box (which is far from assured; it's good to check everything is snug), you are effectively good to go. The Surface has no other functionality besides initiating the call with the audiology professional, and at the scheduled time you tap a button on the screen to get the session underway.

After greeting you, the audiologist will guide you through a series of tests. First is a physical exam of your ears, which is made possible thanks to the included USB-powered otoscope, which you probably know better as the lighted tool with the black, conical tip a doctor uses to look into your ear canal. There's no doctor to guide the tool by hand, so the audiologist will tell you how to position it in each ear so they can get a good look at your eardrum. And yes, you, too, can see what the doctor sees right on the Surface's screen. Spoiler: There is more wax inside your ear canal than you think.

Assuming you have no physical damage that would preclude hearing aid use, it's on to the traditional hearing exams. This series of tests will consume the bulk of the appointment time, and most involve wearing a pair of oversize, noise-isolating headsets like professional musicians use. The tests were very familiar to me, starting with tones played at varying frequencies and volume levels in each ear, during which you tap the Surface screen whenever you hear something.

The test is then repeated with a bone-conduction appliance that attaches to your forehead with a Velcro band for another look at the way you process sound. Lastly, a third test measures your ability to distinguish various consonant and vowel sounds—sh vs. ch, for example—which is performed by having you repeat the words you think you hear back to the audiologist multiple times.

From all of this data, an audiogram is synthesized and presented on the screen of the Surface. Quality-wise, my Hear.com audiogram was nearly identical to the last professional audiogram I received in 2023 in an office setting. Hear.com's audiogram was even more detailed, because it tested my hearing at nine different frequencies, one more than the in-person visit. After going over the audiogram with me to discuss the particulars of my hearing loss, Hear.com's audiologist moved on to the hearing aid fitting.

You'll have purchased the hearing aids you're about to put on already and will find them in the box, inside a charger that notes they are fully charged and ready to use. If for some reason these aids aren't appropriate for the hearing loss measured in the testing, Hear.com will recommend an alternative at that time, but most customers should have a set in hand that will meet their needs, based on the previous intake call.

The aids are programmed remotely and wirelessly via another device connected to the USB breakout box, and I was directed to put the hearing aids on and then put them back in the charging case repeatedly so we could tweak the sound profile to my liking. Again, this is a standard process identical to how things would be done in a doctor's office. The doctor will then train a hearing aid novice on how to insert, charge, and clean the aids and go over any lingering paperwork that needs to be dealt with.

Hear.com sells its own hearing aids under the Horizon brand, which are private-labeled Signia hearing aids in the Signia IX series. There's not an easy way to see exactly which models Hear.com offers on its website, but they range from the Horizon 1IX ($1,975) to the Horizon 7IX ($4,950), the latter of which is what I was sent to try. Monthly payment plans are available for everything, and all of its hearing aids come with a 45-day money-back guarantee.

When the hour-long session is up, you'll be directed to keep all the testing hardware for a while until you are certain the aids work for you. A follow-up call a few weeks later will check on your progress (there's a learning curve with all hearing aids) and, once you're satisfied, you'll be instructed to return the testing equipment via a prepaid shipping label in the box.

I'll need to continue testing for longer, but so far, the Horizon hearing aids work great. Even better is the way you go about getting them fitted.

Master pack picking mistake? Warehouse robot error? Overworked human? Viral marketing ploy? 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A lucky online shopper has taken to social media to boast how they received “a whole box of SSDs instead of one.” Redditor Ok-Middle-1360 bought one 2TB Samsung 990 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 SSD from Amazon, and was understandably surprised when a box of nine units arrived. Redditors were quick to congratulate/complain about the apparent Amazon packing error, and offer up theories as to how such obvious errors happen. It has even been suggested that Amazon randomly picks out buyers for such a ‘jackpot' as a viral marketing ploy.



Ok-Middle-1360 says they paid CAD $200 (USD $146) at checkout, but are now blissfully cradling CAD $1,800 (USD $1,313) worth of fast premium storage. Nine extra M.2 SSDs aren't going to find a home in a mainstream PC setup, though. Laptops usually top out at two M.2 storage connectors, and desktops with four or more are quite rare.

The Redditor could seek to sell-on spare drives, for a nice windfall, or perhaps buy a PCIe M.2 expansion card, or set up a NAS - if they have use for such quantities of storage/functionality. These Samsung 990 EVO Plus devices rival the best SSDs around. Perhaps wisely, though, they have decided to “ride it out” for a while, to see if Amazon reaches out regarding their obvious and expensive error.

It is interesting to pick through the comments on the Amazon jackpot being enjoyed by Ok-Middle-1360. Here you will find a range of well-reasoned theories, and others perhaps less so.

Some of the most credible explanations come from folks who seem to have background knowledge of the inner workings of Amazon's warehouses. For example, someone who currently works at Amazon indicates that this seems to be a warehouse newbie who picked a ‘masterbox' or ‘master pack' from a pallet, rather than an individual product.

Apparently, barcodes can be shared between master packs and single units. However, there should be a few other checks done after picking before a parcel is thrown in the back of a truck. One such check, of weight, would not be far out of its expected range, where tiny PC components get packed in oversized boxes in single/multiple quantities.

Redditors also offer up the hypothesis that AI-powered robotic pickers are sometimes getting things wrong. That wouldn't be such a big surprise, given the above pack nuances.

Plunging deeper into the conspiracy rabbit hole, there are several posts promoting the idea that stories like this NVMe SSD jackpot from Ok-Middle-1360 are just marketing stunts. They are “fake posts… advertisements… viral marketing,” according to some skeptics.

While the best SSD deal you can find right now would ned you an MSI 2TB SSD for 5 cents per gigabyte, this colossal Amazon gaff netted this lucky user 18TB for just $0.008/GB.

As protestors faced off against ICE agents and law enforcement in Los Angeles, game developers gathered just a few miles away for Summer Game Fest. They'd come to the annual show in early June to show off their games and make professional connections. The team at Outerloop Games was no different. But the studio, led and staffed by brown and Black developers, many of whom are immigrants themselves, had extra precautions to consider: “In case of an ICE raid,” says game director Chandana Ekanayake of the team's plan at the time, “we're gonna stay together.” Whether that meant at the event itself, or even dinner after, the team kept track of each other for the entire event.

Outerloop, creator of Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, were at the event to show off their newest project, a “spicy” narrative turn-based RPG called Dosa Divas due out in early 2026.

As the Trump administration carries out mass deportations, targets visas, disappears migrants into a foreign megaprison, and tweets “ASMR” videos of people being deported in chains from the official White House account, Outerloop is making games that find ways to connect people to different cultures through food. “That's the most accepted version of ourselves or of culture, is food,” Ekanayake says. “People are definitely willing to try food before they're willing to accept the people that make it.”

Outerloop's games have always featured food in some capacity, and Dosa Divas only ramps up its importance. Named for dosas, savory crepes popular in South India, the game stars two sisters fighting against an evil fast food empire, literally; characters in its turn-based combat have unique abilities associated with different “flavor profiles,” like sweet, spicy, or sour. To attack effectively, you need to match moves to the enemy's flavor craving.

Dosa Divas centers around three sisters—Samara, Amani, and fast food entrepreneur, Lina—the last of which has become estranged after their family restaurant closes down. Lina's quick cuisine has become so widespread that nobody really cooks anymore.

Ekanayake says that part of the game's story is about reconciliation and reconnection, especially through food. Collecting ingredients and cooking plays an important role in the game. By sharing meals with villagers, players can help repair communities and build their own reputation.

Much like Thirsty Suitors, Outerloop's previous game, Dosa Divas is set in a colorful, vibrant world that mixes fantastical elements with the everyday. In Thirsty Suitors, heroine Jala battled her exes in over-the-top fight sequences, skateboarded, and tried to make peace with her parents. Dosa Divas adds a giant mech to the mix who helps the sisters beat up lawyers.

Early reactions to the game are positive, with critics praising the game's humor, esthetics, and flavor-themed battles. Summer Game Fest had “many games set in spooky or dystopian locales that made for a weekend filled with lots of dark, shadowy worlds that felt largely devoid of color,” wrote ScreenRant. “After so much gray, to come across a bright color palette and such a visually-appealing art style in the game felt so inviting.” RPGFan said “its combat felt intuitive, its writing was witty.”

Ekanayake says he's already heard from one fan with a 10-year-old son; the family had just eaten dosas the night before, and his kid was thrilled to see a little part of his life on screen. “Food brings people together,” Ekanayake says. It's easily shared and introduced to people, even cultural neophytes, allowing anyone to easily experience life outside of their own. “Meal time and eating for a lot of cultures is also community bonding time,” he says. “There's a sense of cultural history and tradition brought down from generation to generation. There's some pride in that too.”

Outerloop's team includes people who come from regions like South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Palestine, so their games include a lot of what Ekanayake calls immigrant dishes. “In Seattle,” he says, “we still have an ethnic aisle in the grocery store—which is ridiculous to me because white people have ethnicity too.” Games, sometimes, can feel the same way. “I think there's still a stigma—that is a brown game, or a Black game,” he says. “You can make the best thing you can possibly make, but it still gets associated in the same way.”

Even well-meaning observers fall into comments that feel othering. “A lot of white folks that come up to me like, ‘oh, what you're doing is so brave,'” he says. “I cringe every time someone says that to me … I want the game to stand on its own. Yes, it has the cultural aspects, but also, is it a good game? Do you enjoy it? Tell me that.”

Ekanayake says that there's a commonality to immigrant experiences in the US, cultural aspects that Outerloop tries to get across in their games. Now, that goal is more important than ever. Growing hostility towards people of color under the Trump administration is making even an annual game event a place to be on guard. “We talk about different local laws and issues depending on where folks are, and how to stay safe,” Ekanayake says. “Especially since the start of 2025.”

Even as a naturalized citizen, he's not entirely comfortable with leaving and re-entering the US right now, whether it's to see family or attend gaming events like Gamescom in Germany. He says it's the first time since 9/11 where he's questioned, “Am I putting my family in danger, am I putting my employees in danger? Do I have to think about what I say or where I travel? That's definitely a concern right now.”

But coming back from LA, Ekanayake says he feels invigorated by the work he and his teammates do. “I feel even stronger about making sure that we keep telling stories and sharing experiences and trying to humanize Black and brown culture and experiences,” he says. “It's fucking weird and also the silliest thing to call it woke when this is who we are. It's our experiences. This nation is founded on immigration and immigrants.”

Margins or openness? Margins!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's recent move to partially open its NVLink interconnect through its NVLink Fusion program has triggered significant interest across the industry, as eight companies have expressed interest in developing CPUs and semi-custom silicon for Nvidia's ecosystem. However, as it turns out, Nvidia retained some of the key NVLink components closed from its partners and may even decide not to grant licenses to certain products and bar their entry into the ecosystem, reports DigiTimes.

Alchip Technologies, one of a few companies permitted to engage with the program, claims that while it can develop full-stack NVLink implementation, it warns that its customers may struggle to deploy their solutions if Nvidia denies their access to certain layers of NVLink protocols. This is because the green company keeps access to protocols (beyond certain levels) gated while controlling the whole software stack. Also, Nvidia mandates a special license from parties that want to use NVSwitches to connect to its GPUs, which further complicates adoption of the technology more or less widely.

Nvidia's NVLink Fusion program by no means makes NVLink an open industry standard. Only select companies among Nvidia's partners get access to it. For now, these are IP companies Cadence and Synopsys; contract chip designer Alchip Technologies; developer of purpose-built connectivity solutions Astera Labs; and CPU designers Fujitsu, Marvell, MediaTek, and Qualcomm. However, there is a catch: only the CPU designers seem to be able to implement NVLink both on hardware and software levels.

Technologies like Nvidia's NVLink typically use multiple protocols, including physical layer protocol (PHY), data link layer protocol, transport protocol, memory coherence protocol, atomic operation protocol, and NUMA protocol. While companies like Alchip can get access to everything related to hardware, the software layer that is responsible for initiating and configuring links is still controlled by Nvidia, and therefore, Alchip clients must get a license and approval from it.

In addition to limiting availability of NVLink Fusion IP to select partners (which is not bad per se, so to speak), Nvidia also require developers of actual platform to implement at least one Nvidia product (CPU, GPU, Switch) into their platform, which brings it additional revenue, but somewhat reduces flexibility of such inventions.

Such a heavily controlled access to the NVLink limits practical use of third-party hardware and restricts seamless interoperability that open standards tend to provide (though NVLink does not seem to be an open standard). Analysts questioned by DigiTimes argue that Nvidia's dominance in AI hardware and its vertical control over software, pricing, and supply create little incentive for genuine openness. Therefore, the NVLink Fusion program looks more like a calculated effort to maintain goodwill among select partners, expand NVLink ecosystem in a controlled manner, enable customers looking for sovereignty to build their own CPUs or special-purpose accelerators, and reduce appeal of competing platforms with UALink, which are expected to start gaining traction in late 2026 – 2027.

At the end of the day, the biggest competitive risk for Nvidia is not a single highly successful product from its rivals, but a competing ecosystem that features multiple competitive processors tailored for specific workloads. While Nvidia cannot stop such an ecosystem from emerging, it can either delay the moment it thrives, or somehow get prepared for its emergence with the help of select partners while preserving its record-high margins.

Nostalgia should not be enough to give any tech a passing grade. But let me come clean. I wouldn't have dropped $65 on the revitalized GameCube controller for Switch 2 if I hadn't spent my preteen years beholden to Nintendo's boxy console. With improved buttons, the new version is better than anything from 2001. After so many years, I've come to see the gamepad as a unique device that's enhanced by its limitations. Instead, it's constrained by Nintendo's own restrictions on where and how you can use it.

The Switch 2 GameCube controller is exclusive to Nintendo's online storefront, and its availability keeps fluctuating to the point we can't tell when or if it will be back in stock. You can find plenty of recreations that try to emulate the look and feel of the 24-year-old controller all the way down to the nubby, yellow “C” button. Nintendo still allows adapters to connect up to four GameCube controllers on Switch 2. So why would you want the official recreation? Because it works as seamlessly as a Joy-Con or Pro Controller, and compared to many third-party emulations, this is the most pitch-perfect accurate device in terms of raw feel. The big problem is, you can't use it for any other device but the Switch 2. Sorry, you won't be emulating GameCube games with Nintendo's own tech (at least until somebody inevitably hacks it).

Nintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2

It's an improved rendition of Nintendo's classic controller from 2001 with better buttons and wireless connectivity. I just wish I could use it on other devices.

Pros

Cons

I have hung onto the same original black GameCube and wireless WaveBird controller from my childhood—the joysticks so mangled with caustic adolescent fingers they were worn down to nubs. I'm amazed at how much attention Nintendo paid to improving the new controller while keeping the same feel as the original. I'm comparing a brand-new device to one that's nearly as old as I am, but it appears that Nintendo replaced the squishy rubber pads of the original controller's face buttons with something that's far more snappy and clicky. The switches on the D-pad are far better than on the 24-year-old controller. That directional pad is still small, so I won't be using it for a fighting game anytime soon, but it's a better option for some retro titles.

For launch, Nintendo released just three games for $50-per-year Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can't play them on the original Switch, and you can't use the new controller on the old handheld, either. Wind Waker is a classic in every sense of the word, but it's the only game on the list that takes advantage of the controller's unique design. I would love to see deep cuts of the GameCube library make their return, like Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and TimeSplitters 2, or other exclusives like Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Nintendo hasn't offered an idea of what will come out next, but I wouldn't advise that you buy this controller in the mere hope we see the return of Killer 7.

The GameCube controller was an odd duckling in 2001 at the release of Nintendo's boxy sixth-gen console. While Sony standardized the twin-stick layout of its DualShock, Nintendo—being Nintendo—crafted a controller that forced developers to design around its oddly shaped buttons and pressure-sensitive trigger buttons. Take Metroid Prime, for example. It was a first-person shooter where that secondary nipple-like C stick went unused in favor of tank controls with a lock-on mechanic.

The design lent itself to entire gaming subgenres. Super Smash Bros. Melee's controls emphasize the “A” and “B” buttons for attacks, while the C stick was geared for hitting quick directional “smash” attacks. In competitive Smash Bros. circles, the GameCube controller is still the gold standard. Nintendo's design ethos clearly hasn't changed much in the 24 years since the original GameCube's launch. Mario Kart World is made to be played with a single Joy-Con, which only requires one joystick, four face buttons, and triggers. The only issue playing the latest Mario Kart with the GameCube controller is that the game doesn't recognize the pressure-sensitive triggers. To drift, you need to press the R button fully until it clicks.

Still, I found I preferred the GameCube controller's thick primary joystick and its octagonal restrictor for precision in Mario Kart. For this plasticky, ultra-purple controller, $65 was a hard pill to swallow. I knew going into it I couldn't use the GameCube controller for every single new Switch 2 game. In place of a proper L1 button, it has a small, flat, square-shaped bumper button. Its top portion, which used to sport a power connector, now has a Home button and “C” switch for GameChat.

It has gyro controls that work for some Switch games, but it won't really work as a stand-in for the official Switch 2 Pro Controller or any other third-party gamepad complete with all the bumpers, triggers, and back buttons you need for modern games. Trying to play Split Fiction with a GameCube controller forced me to remap several buttons to get around the lack of click-in sticks. There's no way you can play a first-person shooter like Cyberpunk 2077 without access to those extra buttons.

The GameCube controller was full of small innovations we take for granted nowadays. In 2002, Nintendo introduced the WaveBird. It was a radio frequency-based wireless controller that required you to connect it on a specific channel. There was no need for line of sight like earlier wireless infrared-based controllers, and it was so good we all cried crocodile tears when it was discontinued in 2008. Nowadays, where Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity are standardized, the wireless connectivity isn't anywhere near unique, but it's far more convenient than plugging your controller into an adapter for every play session. The addition of a Home button adds the convenience of easy access to your in-game screenshots or sleep mode.

The GameCube controller wouldn't be enough if all you used it for were just three games and the hope you'll get to play more later. The significant restrictions Nintendo placed on its functionality with other devices are more than a little frustrating. It's far less versatile than most controllers, but in a way I appreciate it more because of that. If other controllers are a multi-tool, the GameCube controller is a scalpel made for specific use cases—like beating the ever-living snot out of friends in Smash.

New overlay also features an fps graph and monitors CPU usage, clock speeds, GPU temps, RAM usage, and more.

Valve is finally working on a full in-game overlay for Steam that provides significantly more information than just frames per second (fps). The June 17th Steam Client Beta introduced an upgraded overlay that monitors hardware usage and supports DLSS/FSR frame generation monitoring.

Valve's new overlay provides significantly more information than before — enough to compete with many third-party overlays. Valve's new overlay is also one of very few monitoring solutions that allows gamers to monitor both native frame rates and AI-generated frames, often referred to as 'fake frames,' simultaneously — a feature that will only become more useful as frame generation technologies become more mainstream.

The new overlay incorporates a more advanced fps monitoring system that includes an fps graph, as well as CPU usage/clock speed monitoring, GPU temperature monitoring, GPU memory usage monitoring, and RAM usage monitoring.



The fps monitoring portion now displays fps and frame rate fluctuations within one second of time. When turned on, the overlay will display the average fps, with two numbers to the right; one is associated with a down arrow and represents the minimum frame rate, and the other is next to an up arrow and represents the maximum frame rate (displayed over one second of time). It isn't quite the same as 1% and 0.1% lows, but Valve believes this is the best way to display potential micro stutter to gamers.

The frame rate graph displays average fps values over a 90-second window with a green line. A red line will appear if major frame rate dips occur, helping gamers detect micro stutter.

The fps section now supports AI-generated frame rate monitoring (as previously mentioned) when DLSS or FSR frame generation is enabled in a game. When active, the overlay will update itself automatically, displaying either "DLSS" or "FSR" in red and showcasing the number of generated frames next to the regular frame rate counter, allowing gamers to monitor both generated and native frame rates simultaneously.

CPU performance is monitored with the same "% process utility" method as it is in Windows. This method measures work done on the CPU based on the chip's base frequency. Microsoft introduced this method of monitoring CPU utilization in Windows 8 to provide a clearer monitoring solution on CPUs with turbo boosting technologies that constantly vary the CPU's clock speed.

Somewhat confusingly, Valve's utilization numbers will regularly exceed 100%, due to the limitations of the aforementioned "% process utility" method. The overlay will provide two numbers: the left number represents total processor utility encompassing all cores, while the right number represents the processor utility of a CPU's most-utilized core. Unlike Microsoft's implementation, Valve's CPU monitoring system will take into account turbo boosting, and so utilization percentages will go above 100% regularly on virtually all modern CPUs.

I've heard a decent amount about sex toy brand Hot Octopuss from my male friends, but it wasn't until the Pulse Duo arrived on my doorstep that I had my first experience with its products. I was excited to give it a try because I love penis toys that both partners can enjoy.

The Pulse Duo isn't a cock ring—at least not in the traditional sense—it does help produce longer and stronger erections. More of a sleeve than a ring, the person with the penis wears the Pulse Duo while dry humping or gyrating up against a partner with the vulva. In other words, this isn't a device to be worn during penetration, nor would the size and shape allow for such a possibility. Instead, it's to be used in a way that gives both partners another avenue of sexual pleasure to explore: frottage.

The inside of the Pulse Duo doesn't just contain vibrations (there are seven patterns to choose from) and texture, but there's also an oscillating plate that stimulates the frenulum of the penis. On the outside of the Pulse Duo, there's a grinding hump that exudes strong vibrations. It's here that the person with the vulva rubs their body, or more specifically their clitoris, against the Pulse Duo. In doing this, it not only arouses the person with the vulva, increasing natural lubrication in some cases, but also brings them closer to an orgasm—if that's their sexual goal.

I found the Pulse Duo to be hard, uncomfortable, and not a device I'll likely use again. But while that's my personal experience, Pulse Duo is an essential sexual aid device. As someone who has many friends with vulvas who struggle to enjoy penetrative sex because of pain, the Pulse Duo offers a level of intimacy without penetration that other products don't.

As much as it's not talked about or, even worse, sometimes dismissed when brought up, painful intercourse for those with vulvas isn't uncommon. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as many as 75 percent of people with vulvas will have painful intercourse at some point in their lives. For some, this may be something that pops up from time to time, while others may have medical conditions that prevent them from having pain-free intercourse.

It's for these people that a device like the Pulse Duo comes into play. It offers the illusion of penetrative sex, as well as the eye contact and the intimacy, while giving both partners what they need: a stimulated clitoris and a stimulated penis. Water-based lube, both on the vulva and on the Pulse Duo, intensifies this feeling for both partners. I should also point out that the remote control for Pulse Duo is excellent. It's not just easy to use but also extremely tactical, so even if you're not looking directly at it, your fingers can scope out what each of the four buttons is for.

The device is also waterproof, made from a mixture of silicone and ABS plastic, and can be recharged via a USB-A cable. Unfortunately, the other end of the cable is proprietary. You can buy spares from Hot Octopuss, but there's always a risk the company will stop making the cable in a few years. Speaking of charging, you'll need to do it quite often, as the battery in the Pulse Duo lasts around an hour, which is way too short.

I was confused by the Pulse Duo from the get-go. Although Hot Octopuss was kind enough to send along an explanatory video, which I watched three times, there was still a disconnect in my brain. I thought this device was to be used during penetrative sex. It wasn't until I spoke to a friend who had used another version of the Hot Octopuss Pulse that reality set in. After trying the Pulse Duo as it's meant to be used, I realized it wasn't a fit for me or my partner.

Where the Pulse Duo excelled was during mutual masturbation. My partner loves—with a capital L—Pulse Duo for masturbatory endeavors. While he has his hands full with that, I can lie beside him while getting up close and personal with my favorite vibrator.

The Hot Octopuss Pulse Duo is an extraordinary sexual device I've already recommended to a couple of friends. But its pleasantness is very much dependent upon your needs and wants. Since painful intercourse is so common among those of us with vulvas, I'm glad I have it in my drawer should that become an issue for me.

Like it or not, large language models have quickly become embedded into our lives. And due to their intense energy and water needs, they might also be causing us to spiral even faster into climate chaos. Some LLMs, though, might be releasing more planet-warming pollution than others, a new study finds.

Queries made to some models generate up to 50 times more carbon emissions than others, according to a new study published in Frontiers in Communication. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, models that are more accurate tend to have the biggest energy costs.

It's hard to estimate just how bad LLMs are for the environment, but some studies have suggested that training ChatGPT used up to 30 times more energy than the average American uses in a year. What isn't known is whether some models have steeper energy costs than their peers as they're answering questions.

Researchers from the Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences in Germany evaluated 14 LLMs ranging from 7 to 72 billion parameters—the levers and dials that fine-tune a model's understanding and language generation—on 1,000 benchmark questions about various subjects.

LLMs convert each word or parts of words in a prompt into a string of numbers called a token. Some LLMs, particularly reasoning LLMs, also insert special “thinking tokens” into the input sequence to allow for additional internal computation and reasoning before generating output. This conversion and the subsequent computations that the LLM performs on the tokens use energy and releases CO2.

The scientists compared the number of tokens generated by each of the models they tested. Reasoning models, on average, created 543.5 thinking tokens per question, whereas concise models required just 37.7 tokens per question, the study found. In the ChatGPT world, for example, GPT-3.5 is a concise model, whereas GPT-4o is a reasoning model.

This reasoning process drives up energy needs, the authors found. “The environmental impact of questioning trained LLMs is strongly determined by their reasoning approach,” study author Maximilian Dauner, a researcher at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences, said in a statement. “We found that reasoning-enabled models produced up to 50 times more CO2 emissions than concise response models.”

The more accurate the models were, the more carbon emissions they produced, the study found. The reasoning model Cogito, which has 70 billion parameters, reached up to 84.9% accuracy—but it also produced three times more CO2 emissions than similarly sized models that generate more concise answers.

“Currently, we see a clear accuracy-sustainability trade-off inherent in LLM technologies,” said Dauner. “None of the models that kept emissions below 500 grams of CO2 equivalent achieved higher than 80% accuracy on answering the 1,000 questions correctly.” CO2 equivalent is the unit used to measure the climate impact of various greenhouse gases.

Another factor was subject matter. Questions that required detailed or complex reasoning, for example abstract algebra or philosophy, led to up to six times higher emissions than more straightforward subjects, according to the study.

There are some caveats, though. Emissions are very dependent on how local energy grids are structured and the models that you examine, so it's unclear how generalizable these findings are. Still, the study authors said they hope that the work will encourage people to be “selective and thoughtful” about the LLM use.

“Users can significantly reduce emissions by prompting AI to generate concise answers or limiting the use of high-capacity models to tasks that genuinely require that power,” Dauner said in a statement.

Knee braces, water therapy and exercise are the most promising non-drug therapies for treating knee osteoarthritis, according to a new meta-analysis publishing June 18, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Yuan Luo of the First People's Hospital of Neijiang, China.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common and often debilitating condition that affects millions of older adults, causing pain and stiffening of the knee joint. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory drugs, which are linked to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events.

In the new study, researchers examined the current evidence on non-drug therapies for treating KOA. They looked at data from 139 clinical trials involving nearly 10,000 people to compare 12 different non-drug treatments. These included laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, kinesiology tape, water-based therapy, exercise, and ultrasound. By combining results from all these studies into a powerful network meta-analysis, the team could rank the therapies based on how well they worked.

Knee braces came out on top across most categories, including reducing pain, improving function, and relieving stiffness. Hydrotherapy-exercises or treatments performed in warm water-was particularly effective at easing pain and general exercise was also consistently effective, improving both pain and physical function. High-intensity laser therapy and shock wave therapy showed some benefits, while ultrasound consistently scored the lowest in effectiveness.

The authors caution that differences in study design, small sample sizes, and variability in treatment duration between the 139 included studies may limit the precision of the rankings. However, they conclude that physical therapy has promising effects on KOA, offering potential treatments without the risks of anti-inflammatory drugs. Future studies should examine the clinical efficacy of combined therapies, as well as their cost-effectiveness.

The authors add: "Knee braces, hydrotherapy, and exercise are the most effective non-drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis. They reduce pain and improve mobility without the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks linked to common pain medications. Patients and clinicians should prioritize these evidence-based options."

"Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions."

Critical Path Institute's® (C-Path) Translational Therapeutics Accelerator (TRxA) proudly announced today a $250,000 grant award aimed at developing a novel treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Kyle Apley, Ph.D., Cory Berkland, Ph.D., and Peggy Kendall M.D., at Washington University in St. Louis, have received this TRxA award to advance their work on a CD22 bidentate therapeutic designed for patients at risk of developing T1D.

We are honored to receive this support from TRxA, which will enable us to accelerate the translation of our research into meaningful therapies for patients with type 1 diabetes. This grant and the drug discovery expertise at C-Path provide critical resources to push our work forward and bring us closer to improving the lives of those affected by this condition."

Dr. Kyle Apley, Ph.D., Washington University in St. Louis

T1D affects 1.6 million Americans and 8.4 million people globally, and requires lifelong, daily interventions and lifestyle changes by those affected in order to manage symptoms and avoid acute and chronic complications. This project focuses on advancing a promising therapeutic pathway that has the potential to address key challenges in T1D treatment, including beta-cell preservation and immune system modulation. 

The funding will facilitate synthesis and formulation of the new therapeutic, followed by critical preclinical studies with a particular focus on its immunological aspects. The project underscores C-Path's mission to catalyze drug development by supporting translational science initiatives that bring promising treatments closer to patients.

"C-Path is committed to fostering innovative biomedical research that has real-world impact," said TRxA Executive Director Maaike Everts, Ph.D. "TRxA's support for Drs. Apley, Berkland and Kendall's research highlights C-Path's dedication to advancing novel solutions that accelerate the development of therapies that can improve medical outcomes for individuals living with T1D."

This grant complements C-Path's broader commitment to foster collaboration among scientists and stakeholders by expediting the development of safe and effective therapies through its T1D Consortium (T1DC). Founded in 2017, T1DC is working to achieve regulatory endorsement of clinical trial simulation tools in both new-onset and prevention of T1D to improve clinical trial design, accelerate development of new therapies, and positively impact the entire T1D community.

Intermittent fasting diets appear to have similar benefits to traditional calorie-restricted diets for weight loss, suggests an analysis of trial evidence published by The BMJ today.

Alternate day fasting also demonstrates greater benefits compared with both calorie restriction and other intermittent fasting approaches, but the researchers say longer trials are needed to substantiate these findings.

According to the World Health Organization in 2022, approximately 2.5 billion adults, 43% of the global adult population, were overweight, and about 890 million (16%) lived with obesity. 

Weight loss can reduce cardiometabolic risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and consequently lower the burden of serious chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting on a regular schedule and is becoming a popular alternative to traditional calorie-restricted diets, which are often unsustainable in the long term.

While no clear definition exists for intermittent fasting, its various methods can fall under three broad categories: time restricted eating (eg, the 16:8 diet involving a 16 hour fasting period followed by an 8 hour eating window), alternate day fasting (a 24 hour fast on alternate days), and whole day fasting (eg, a 5:2 diet involving five days of unrestricted eating and two days of fasting).

But the health effects of intermittent fasting compared with continuous caloric restriction or an unrestricted (ad-libitum) diet remain unclear.

To address this, researchers analysed the results of 99 randomised clinical trials involving 6,582 adults (average age 45; 66% female) to compare the effect of intermittent fasting diets with continuous energy restriction or unrestricted diets on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors.

Participants had an average body mass index (BMI) of 31 and almost 90% had existing health conditions.

The trials ranged from 3-52 weeks (average 12 weeks) and were of varying quality, but the researchers were able to assess their risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using recognised tools.

All intermittent fasting strategies and continuous energy restriction diets may lead to small reductions in body weight when compared with an unrestricted diet. 

Alternate day fasting was the only intermittent fasting diet strategy to show a small benefit in body weight reduction compared with continuous energy restriction (mean difference -1.29 kg).

Alternate day fasting also showed a small reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg and -1.05 kg respectively).

However, these differences did not reach the minimally important clinical threshold of at least 2 kg weight loss for individuals with obesity, as defined by the study authors.

Alternate day fasting was also linked to lower levels of total and "bad" cholesterol compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in cholesterol levels. No benefit was found for blood sugar or "good" cholesterol levels in any diet strategy comparison.

Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up. But longer trials of 24 weeks or more only showed weight loss benefits in diet strategies compared with an unrestricted diet.

The researchers point to several limitations, such as high variation (heterogeneity) among the diet strategy comparisons, small sample sizes of many included trials, and low to moderate certainty of evidence in most of the investigated outcomes.

Even so, this is highlighted as one of the first systematic reviews to combine direct and indirect comparisons across all dietary strategies, allowing for more precise estimates.

As such, they conclude: "The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings."

The value of this study is not in establishing a universally superior strategy but in positioning alternate day fasting as an additional option within the therapeutic repertoire, say researchers from Colombia in a linked editorial.

They point out that any structured intervention - including continuous energy restriction - could show benefits derived not only from the dietary pattern but also from professional support, planning, and nutritional education, while diet quality during free eating days could also affect alternate day fasting outcomes.

The focus should be on fostering sustainable changes over time, they say. "Intermittent fasting does not aim to replace other dietary strategies but to integrate and complement them within a comprehensive, patient centred nutritional care model."

How do living things evolve? What is the myriad of processes by which generic variations in a population affect organisms' survival and allow reproduction in an ever-changing environment? Why do these processes often crawl over millennia and yet, sometimes, rapid and substantial evolutionary changes occur?

Utah State University evolutionary biologist Zachariah Gompert explores chromosomal arrangements, where large chunks of chromosomes are inverted, moved, deleted or duplicated as a possible source of large-scale macromutations.

Adaptive evolution is driven by natural selection, which generates populations better adapted for survival and reproduction. A current focus of debate is whether adaptive evolution relies on many mutations with small and roughly equal effects or if it is driven by one or a few mutations that cause major changes in traits and Darwinian fitness."

Zachariah Gompert, associate department head and professor in USU's Department of Biology and the USU Ecology Center

To pursue this question, Gompert was awarded a five-year, $1.85 million Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.

Gompert, who has long studied fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including pursuing case studies of the genetic basis of adaption in stick insects (Timematidae) and butterflies (Lycaenidae), will continue study of these organisms, along with seed beetles (Chrysomelidae).

He says the NIH funding will create multiple opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students to receive thorough education in basic research experimentation while exploring genomics research, and developing skills and experience in such areas as molecular biology and whole genome sequencing.

"We'll generate whole genomes and identify chromosomal variations that tie into evolution and trait variation," Gompert says. "Through this research, participants will gain skills that are transferrable across diverse scientific disciplines. This expertise has application to biomedical research on the role of genomics in health sciences, as well as application to applied research in agricultural genetics - both of which are rapidly growing fields."

In addition, he says, student researchers will develop knowledge of computational data analysis, ranging from traditional computational approaches to innovative methods in machine learning.

"As an affiliated faculty member in USU's new Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, I anticipate collaborations with scholars beyond the Department of Biology who wish to pursue varied data science projects data generated from our efforts," Gompert says. "The NIH award opens great opportunities for our research here at Utah State and for our students and community partners."

Humans have tens of thousands of genes, many of which produce proteins essential to basic bodily functions. The KCNT1 gene, for example, codes for a protein that maintains normal electrical activity in the brain and helps neurons communicate.

But genes don't always function perfectly.

For many people, a mutation of the KCNT1 gene causes no symptoms. For others, it can lead to dysfunction of neuronal activity causing learning disabilities, difficulty communicating, and a lifetime of treatment-resistant seizures.

Epileptic disorders caused by mutations in KCNT1 affect an estimated 3,000 children in the United States. Associate Professor Matthew Weston and his team with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC want to bring that number to zero.

With a grant from Actio Biosciences, Weston is testing whether an Actio KCNT1 inhibitor that modulates potassium levels can reduce seizures. If successful, the inhibitor could offer a treatment for an aggressive form of epilepsy that significantly reduces life expectancy.

The mutations cause abnormal amounts of potassium to flow through the ion channel. So the idea is: If you give people a blocker that will limit that potassium flow, could you improve the disease?"

Matthew Weston, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech

The research is in its early stages, but initial results indicate that the KCNT1 inhibitor reduces seizures in mice.

Given favorable pre-clinical data, Weston said the best-case scenario is that "the drug enters clinical trials and works not just to stop seizures, but maybe even improve some of the other symptoms."

The inhibitor is on track to enter clinical trials, which would allow patients to receive the investigational drug as early as 2026.

Actio Biosciences is a San Diego-based precision medicine company focused on drug development for genetic and rare diseases.

Weston is a scientific advisor to the KCNT1 Epilepsy Foundation, which seeks to advance research that could lead to cures for KCNT1-related epilepsy.

With a few days of fun, high-level play already in the books, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off to a fantastic start.

Group play is already in full swing as clubs battle for position to advance to the knockout rounds. That stage of the tourney begins later this month, shrinking the event's field down from 32 teams to just 16, with the winner and runner-up of each group advancing.

From there on, it's pure chaos, just like the World Cup, only this time, instead of representing each player's native country, they're representing their club, which can sometimes lead to even higher-level play as these athletes are more used to playing alongside one another.

The U.S. is hosting every game of the tournament in venues around the country, giving fans across the nation a chance to catch a game.

After definitively ending its four-game losing streak with a big 5-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the US men's national team will look to book a spot in the Gold Cup quarterfinals when it takes on the invited guest team, Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia squeaked out a 1-0 win against Haiti in its first game and it is expected to be one of the better teams in the tournament.

The game is at Q2 Stadium in Austin Thursday where the US is 3-0 in competitive matches all-time, all sold out.

The United States plays its second group-stage game, against Saudi Arabia, at 7:15 p.m. Mountain/8:15 p.m. Central on Thursday, June 19 at Q2 Stadium in Austin.

The 7:15 p.m. MT/8:15 p.m. CT match between the United States and Saudi Arabia will be televised on FS1 in English and on TUDN and Univision.

America won its opener against Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 and now leads Group D. Saudi Arabia won its opener against Haiti 1-0. The winner of this match will likely clinch a spot in the quarterfinals.

It writes: "Both teams will be boosted by their opening day victories, but given USA's particularly impressive performance, we believe Pochettino's side will win this one."

It writes: "Saudi Arabia are a much better side than many of the CONCACAF opponents the U.S. are used to facing in the early stages of the Gold Cup. However, on home soil, the U.S. should manage to win this match, especially considering how Saudi Arabia were challenged quite hard by Haiti in their opener. There's a chance this match ends in a draw, which both sides will benefit from, but a win is on the table for the U.S. if they play well enough to snatch it."

The site predicts the United States will beat Saudi Arabia 4-1.

The site predicts the United States will beat Saudi Arabia 2-0.

The US is heavily favored to win, according to odds on BetMGM.com.

    Lionel Messi and co go in search of their first win as they face Portuguese heavyweights at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
  

Two teams who kicked off their FIFA Club World Cup campaigns with a point meet in Atlanta today, as Lionel Messi's Inter Miami face Portugal's Porto.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full match list. 

Miami fans will be hoping for a livelier showing from their team today after Javier Mascherano's men played out a drab goalless stalemate against Al Ahly in their opening fixture of the tournament, despite a huge, mainly partisan attendance of 60,927 at Hard Rock Stadium.

Porto also played out a 0-0 tie in their first game of the competition, in a far more entertaining encounter with Brazil's Palmeiras, in a match which saw young striker Samu Aghehowa impress despite not getting on the scoresheet. 

Inter Miami takes on Porto on Thursday, June 19, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT. That makes it an 8 p.m. BST start in the UK and a 5 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Friday morning. 

Despite concerns over an apparent injury in training, head coach Javier Mascherano has confirmed that Lionel Messi is fit to play for Inter Miami in today's game. 

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds. It can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN that works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100, you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Australia has a second option for watching the tournament live. Alongside DAZN's free coverage, pay TV broadcaster Foxtel and its sister streaming service Kayo will also be showing all 63 games. 

A Kayo Sports subscription starts at AU$25 a month and lets you stream on one screen, while its Premium tier costs AU$40 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices.

The service gives you access to a wide range of sports, including F1, NRL, NFL, NHL and MLB, and there are no lock-in contracts. 

Better still, if you're a new customer, you can take advantage of a one-week Kayo Sports free trial.

City breached rules in nine league matches last season

CEO Soriano excited by global impact of Club World Cup

Manchester City have been fined more than £1m by the Premier League over delayed kick-offs or restarts related to nine matches last season. The league entered into a sanction agreement with the club over the breaches of its rules, which occurred between October and February.

The longest delay was two minutes and 24 seconds before the resumption of the Manchester derby last December. The league said City had accepted and apologised for the breaches, with the fines totalling £1.08m. The club have 14 days to make payment from the execution of the sanction agreement.

A league statement said: “Rules relating to kick-offs and restarts help ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard and provides certainty to fans and participating clubs. It also ensures the broadcast of every Premier League match is kept to schedule.”

City, who were fined more than £2m last summer for 22 breaches of the kick-off and restart rules, are playing at the Club World Cup and their chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has said he is excited by the way the revamped 32-team tournament is driving football's globalisation. The Spaniard believing City can embrace the expanded format and still be relevant to their domestic fanbase.

Pep Guardiola's side beat Morocco's Wydad 2-0 on Wednesday in Philadelphia in their opening group game as they began their defence of a title claimed two years ago in the competition's last seven-club iteration.

Soriano said of the new format: “We are very excited by it. It's something that was very much needed. Soccer is a global sport and we have to make it global. You have to have teams like Manchester City playing teams from Morocco, Korea or wherever. That's part of the globalisation of the No 1 sport in the world. It's a great initiative and we are very happy to be here.

“It's very important to be here because we are a global football club. We have our roots and we are proud of them. But you can be local and relevant and faithful to the history of the club and the fans that support you, but you can also be global and show what we do – which we believe is beautiful football – to the world. It's a combination that works very well and we are proud.”

Goals from Phil Foden and Jérémy Doku secured the defeat of Wydad as Guardiola gave debuts to Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, two of his eight new recruits in the past two windows.

Soriano said: “I'm happy with the work that we did. This is part of multi-annual planning. Last summer we only bought one new player [Savinho, while Ilkay Gündogan returned on a free transfer] but this year between the winter and the summer it will be eight new ones.

“It's part of the annual cycle, the renewal of the squad. We accelerated some of it and now we are very happy with the squad we have. It's part of the game [to refresh]. We look for stability, the fact that Pep is going to be with us for 10 years shows that we are a stable club.

“But the squad needs to be renewed. It's something that happens naturally. We've had fantastic players like Kevin De Bruyne who spent a decade with us. That's a testament to his quality but also our stability.”

PALMEIRAS' Club World Cup clash with Al-Ahly was suspended due to lightning in the area.

The Brazilians led 2-0 on 62 minutes, when English referee Anthony Taylor was forced to stop the game in New Jersey.

Fans at MetLife Stadium, where next year's World Cup final is set to take place, were subsequently instructed to "take shelter" inside the concourse.

While even the DAZN commentators on site were forced to hand back to the studio as they too had to return to the concourse.

A message displayed to fans on big screens read: "Your attention please.

"For your safety, we are going to have everyone leave the Seating Bowl area and take shelter inside the stadium because of severe weather in the area.

SOME of the world's biggest clubs are heading Stateside for a MAMMOTH Club World Cup.

Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Man City, and Inter Miami are among the 32 teams taking part in the tournament, which runs from June 14 to July 13.

Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland, Ousmane Dembele, Cole Palmer and Harry Kane will be showing their skills to packed crowds across the US.

Los Blancos are favourites to lift the trophy in New York but will face stiff competition from around the globe.

When the U.S. Soccer Federation turned to Mauricio Pochettino in 2025, it wasn't just hiring a tactician—it was making a statement. A marquee name for a program with rising ambitions and unfinished business.

Fresh off stints at PSG and Chelsea, the Argentine manager arrived with pedigree, pressure and a paycheck to match. The deal marked a shift in how the soccer federation values international leadership and what it's willing to pay for it.

His salary has drawn attention both at home and abroad, sparking comparisons with past USMNT coaches and global heavyweights. But beyond the numbers, it's the expectations that truly define the contract.

Mauricio Pochettino inked a two‑year contract when he took charge of the U.S. Men's National Team back in September 2024, with his term running through the 2026 World Cup on home soil. So, he still has a little more than a year left.

The deal was carefully structured: FIFA's build‑up schedule around the World Cup gives him just enough time to implement his high‑intensity style while leaving room for renewal if he delivers on expectations.

Behind the scenes, U.S. Soccer inserted a sizeable buy‑out clause to protect against poaching by a major European club, signaling their intent to keep him through the tournament cycle.

Mauricio Pochettino earns a reported $6 million per year, making him the highest‑paid head coach in USMNT history—nearly triple the $2.3 million earned annually by predecessor Gregg Berhalter, according to ESPN.

This hefty sum is underpinned by the Federation and donors: hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin and partner Scott Goodwin funded much of the package as part of a “philanthropic leadership gift” earmarked for elite-level coaching.

The investment marks a sharp turn for U.S. Soccer, reflecting a strategic commitment to elite leadership and signaling that they're willing to pay top dollar for international pedigree.

MIAMI — Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club said Thursday.

World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever.

Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday. But his hospitalization casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States.

Madrid said Mbappe would “undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment.”

Mbappe's absence is a blow to the tournament, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino hopes will be one of the elite events in soccer and rival competitions like the Champions League and Premier League in popularity and value.

After Lionel Messi, Mbappe is arguably the biggest star in the show, with Madrid one of the favorites to lift the trophy in the inaugural edition of the tournament.

But a crowd of more than 62,000 at Hard Rock Stadium missed out on a rare chance to see him in person in the U.S. when he was unavailable for Madrid's surprise 1-1 draw by Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Gastroenteritis is also known as stomach flu and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea.

Mbappe's hospitalization comes almost exactly one year after he sustained a broken nose at the European Championship and had to wear a face mask to continue playing in the tournament.

AUSTIN, Texas — Weeks after the U.S. men's national team named its initial summer roster, the dominant conversation was not about who made the squad — but who didn't. Most of the core group was absent due to injuries, Club World Cup duties, or, in Christian Pulisic's case, a hotly debated need for rest.

In their place, head coach Mauricio Pochettino refreshed the roster not just to evaluate fresh faces, but to ignite more competition in his player pool. A 4-0 loss to Switzerland in the team's final Gold Cup warm-up suggested Pochettino's omissions — the “football decisions,” in his words — had backfired. But a commanding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago to open the tournament paused early doubts.

Pochettino's project, however, runs deeper than scorelines. After March's deflating Nations League defeats to Panama and Canada, Pochettino began challenging the team's internal standards.

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come, desperate to perform,” he said. “To perform means follow the rules, create [a] good atmosphere, be part of the team, be able, in every single aspect, [to meet] our [federation's] demand and understand that it's possible (for it to) be the last [opportunity] to be with us.”

Then he made his point clearer.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend — is that the culture that we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused. And spend all my focus and energy on the national team. Because we need to create this culture about winning.”

Pochettino insisted he wasn't punishing individual players for the Nations League losses. But collectively, he clearly sought to adjust their approach to camp. It was always going to be a tricky balance after he inherited a veteran-heavy squad from Gregg Berhalter, one with a European pedigree that is unprecedented in USMNT history. And for players who spend most of their year abroad, coming back to U.S. soil — and U.S. camps — often means carving out time for family and friends.

“When we speak about the mentality of the national team, and you look at the most successful teams in the world, a lot of them go in to camp, and they stay at one place the entire time and travel to games,” midfielder Tyler Adams said the day before a friendly against Türkiye in Hartford, Connecticut, just 90 miles from his hometown in New York. “Based off the geography of the country, we're traveling all over the place. We're obviously playing abroad, and we come back home and it is nice to see your families. But we have to find the right balance.”

Adams, who captained the squad at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, will again be central to building that culture over the next year. So will center back Chris Richards, who has emerged as a leader this cycle and wore the armband against Türkiye.

“There's a line that we kind of need to teeter-totter,” Richards said in Nashville, a few hours from his hometown in Alabama. “Sometimes in our off time, we'd want to go hang out with family a lot more than the guys are at the camp. But again, I think if you need to make this new culture with new guys, that you have to spend time with each other outside of the pitch. … It's finding the line between friends and family, but also blending both of them, so that we have a good culture both on and off the pitch.”

Walker Zimmerman, a Georgia native and Nashville SC center back, echoed that view after starting against Switzerland.

“He's just stressing the point that we need to be focused each and every day, especially in training,” Zimmerman said. “But I also think this staff is really good about, ‘Hey, when you have the day off, you can have the day off.' You gotta have a work-life balance and enjoy it.”

And to a certain extent, Pochettino agrees. Before the Switzerland friendly, he emphasized the point with a typically lengthy response.

“I am the first person with my coaching staff who likes the players to be able to have free time,” he said. “ … They're young boys, the young boys need to have different possibilities to be able to do things that are in this moment, when you are young. What I always say is when you have your work done, when your responsibilities are covered, after, yes, we can do all that we want. What we can't do is not have all those things covered and I go out for a walk. If I don't have my work done, I can't go for a walk in Nashville to see the city. I do my work, and then I go to see Nashville.”

The Argentine circled back to an earlier comment he had made that drew attention: his criticism of golf outings and dinner plans during camp. What he's really after, he stressed, is a fight-to-the-death level of intensity and energy on the field.

“I want 11 lions. Or wolves. Or the animal that you may like the most — the most aggressive. [I want players] on the field that may fight as if there had been death,” Pochettino explained. “But if we do all of that and enjoy life but after we don't fight like a team, a true team, we raise a lot of doubts. It means there's something that isn't well, that isn't balanced. The balance is the most important in all the soccer teams.”

Adams summed it up more succinctly:

“He talks about balance quite a lot, and mak[ing] sure that we understand that we need to be top professionals. That's the most important thing.”

Pochettino believes that there is a specific psychological uniqueness to soccer compared to other team sports in the U.S., and he is not trying to create an overly regimented environment.

“This isn't a closed system, it's not the navy, it's not a military camp,” he said. “It's a soccer team that has to prepare itself to compete against another soccer team.”

Zimmerman added: “It's not like we're locked down at a hotel or anything like that, but from a culture standpoint, yeah, we're focusing on the intensity in trainings, the intensity in the games and being competitive as a group.”

And when the Gold Cup began, the natural constraints of tournament life reinforced the shift.

“Everybody's been focused on maximizing rest,” center back Mark McKenzie said. “Preparing ourselves with the training sessions, preparing ourselves with little things you do after the training sessions. And then when we get back to the hotel, kick your feet up. We got a player's lounge and what not. So guys have time to laugh and joke and be together, continue to build on what we're doing, but most important is making sure we're ready for the next match.”

It won't be the same group traveling throughout the U.S. next summer during the World Cup. But there could be more players on this Gold Cup roster than expected who will crack the squad or have a substantial role, and they'll all have been part of a process Pochettino is prioritizing — calibrating a culture — that is definitely on a tight schedule.

“We're all professional,” midfielder Brenden Aaronson said ahead of Thursday's group stage match against Saudi Arabia. “We all know what we're gonna do and what's needed of us and how we're gonna approach every situation. So for us, it was like, we're gonna go out there and be really, really focused on the tournament. I think we always are, but for him to say that, and he had something to say about it, so for us it was just tunnel vision. Tunnel vision and just gonna come here and not do any of that type of stuff, and be really focused.”

This is Pochettino's only tournament prior to the World Cup, and if the U.S. makes a deep run next summer, the intangible progress toward a winning culture will be spun as its legacy.

City breached rules in nine league matches last season

CEO Soriano excited by global impact of Club World Cup

Manchester City have been fined more than £1m by the Premier League over delayed kick-offs or restarts related to nine matches last season. The league entered into a sanction agreement with the club over the breaches of its rules, which occurred between October and February.

The longest delay was two minutes and 24 seconds before the resumption of the Manchester derby last December. The league said City had accepted and apologised for the breaches, with the fines totalling £1.08m. The club have 14 days to make payment from the execution of the sanction agreement.

A league statement said: “Rules relating to kick-offs and restarts help ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard and provides certainty to fans and participating clubs. It also ensures the broadcast of every Premier League match is kept to schedule.”

City, who were fined more than £2m last summer for 22 breaches of the kick-off and restart rules, are playing at the Club World Cup and their chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has said he is excited by the way the revamped 32-team tournament is driving football's globalisation. The Spaniard believing City can embrace the expanded format and still be relevant to their domestic fanbase.

Pep Guardiola's side beat Morocco's Wydad 2-0 on Wednesday in Philadelphia in their opening group game as they began their defence of a title claimed two years ago in the competition's last seven-club iteration.

Soriano said of the new format: “We are very excited by it. It's something that was very much needed. Soccer is a global sport and we have to make it global. You have to have teams like Manchester City playing teams from Morocco, Korea or wherever. That's part of the globalisation of the No 1 sport in the world. It's a great initiative and we are very happy to be here.

“It's very important to be here because we are a global football club. We have our roots and we are proud of them. But you can be local and relevant and faithful to the history of the club and the fans that support you, but you can also be global and show what we do – which we believe is beautiful football – to the world. It's a combination that works very well and we are proud.”

Goals from Phil Foden and Jérémy Doku secured the defeat of Wydad as Guardiola gave debuts to Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, two of his eight new recruits in the past two windows.

Soriano said: “I'm happy with the work that we did. This is part of multi-annual planning. Last summer we only bought one new player [Savinho, while Ilkay Gündogan returned on a free transfer] but this year between the winter and the summer it will be eight new ones.

“It's part of the annual cycle, the renewal of the squad. We accelerated some of it and now we are very happy with the squad we have. It's part of the game [to refresh]. We look for stability, the fact that Pep is going to be with us for 10 years shows that we are a stable club.

“But the squad needs to be renewed. It's something that happens naturally. We've had fantastic players like Kevin De Bruyne who spent a decade with us. That's a testament to his quality but also our stability.”

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The videos keep rolling across your social feeds: Boca Juniors fans on the beach in Miami, while Palmeiras fans light up Times Square. You'll hear it in the stands and see it in the scenes, too: River Plate fans belting out songs in Seattle and Flamengo supporters roaring during the individual player introductions.

The FIFA Club World Cup may be a global tournament, but in the United States, it feels unmistakably South American.

All six CONMEBOL clubs -- the above quartet, plus Fluminense and Botafogo -- avoided defeat in their opening matches (three wins and three draws), but the South American fan bases have also been the most boisterous, showed up in the biggest numbers, and deservingly drawing all the attention.

It shouldn't be a huge surprise. Many of their UEFA counterparts shrug with apathy at the shiny new expanded tournament, noting its lack of history. Teams from other regions look happy to be there, intrigued by the massive prize pots and eager to find international legitimacy. But in South America, this tournament provides an opportunity to recapture some of the past glories.

Fans know the dates by heart. You see them on banners, hear them in chants, and read them in club publications.

Palmeiras in 1951 were crowned Copa Rio champions after beating Nice, Red Star Belgrade, and Juventus. It was the first intercontinental club tournament featuring teams from Europe and South America. In 1981, Flamengo dominated Liverpool 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup, a match featuring the champions of the Copa Libertadores and UEFA Champions League. River Plate did the same in 1986, overcoming Romania's Steaua București.

"In 1950, Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay, and it was a huge blow. 1951 brought that back up and was celebrated not just by Palmeiras but also supporters of other teams," said Paulo Roberto, the leader of the U.S. chapter of Palmeiras supporters' group Mancha Verde, to ESPN. "Up to today, it's something we value because it's history, and you cannot erase history."

Those international trophies are huge sources of pride for the teams in South America who have them. Similarly, participation in the tournament now known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup occurs, where the most recent champion of each confederation competes in a tournament. This year, Real Madrid topped Concacaf's Pachuca 3-0 in the final.

"This tournament brings together the elite of global football, and it's an honor to once again see the name of River among the leading figures," River Plate Secretary Stefano Di Carlo said. "It will be our third time participating in the Club World Cup in the last 10 years, which reaffirms our status as top representative in the region."

While the entire sextet of CONMEBOL teams would love to make history by once again winning -- and testing their rivals' openness to celebrating a title -- the likelihood is that the champion will come from UEFA, as it has in the last 11 times the tournament was conducted in its previous format.

The economic realities of the current ecosystem mean South American clubs often are parting ways with their talent early, transferring off top academy players to keep funding the club and watching as they go on to stardom for big European clubs.

"Players who used to play in our team are now playing in Liverpool, Manchester United, etc.," said Juan Pablo Pacheco, the leader of River Plate Texas. "We see them with the bright lights of playing in Europe, but kind of forget what it's like playing in South America. We're eager to play those teams and show that we still have it, even though our best players immigrate to Europe."

But the games don't always go according to script. Benfica's Argentine duo -- Ángel Di María and Nicolás Otamendi -- ended Boca's hopes of a win early with a pair of goals in a 2-2 draw in Miami. Di María, who scored from the penalty spot, clarified after the match that his hand gesture wasn't an apology to Boca fans, but a simple greeting to his family.

And family is a thread that runs through all of this, another reason the tournament matters so much to South American fans.

"It's very special, especially for me. I'm going with three generations, with my dad, who is a big Flamengo supporter, and also my oldest son. It's three generations of being Flamengo," said Renato Silva, a Flamengo fan who used to live in the U.S., but once again lives in Rio de Janeiro and is traveling for the tournament. "For us, it's very important. These are always part of conversations in society. I think it's much more important for us than European teams."

All those factors are important, but there's something else about the Club World Cup that shouldn't be underrated by those working to understand why these six clubs seem to care so much more than some of their fellow CWC hopefuls.

There are many South American fans living and working in the U.S. who still keep up with their team, perhaps track it even more closely for that feeling of home when they're far away. Seeing the team in your city? Having old friends come visit to go see matches in gleaming stadiums? It's a party.

"It means a lot for us who have been abroad for a long time," said Mariano Bossana, the president of the Boca Juniors Consulate in Washington, D.C. "It's not only a pleasure and an opportunity to see Boca Juniors playing nearby, but also a source of pride to compete with some of the most respected teams around the world. It brings Boca back to the international stage."

Of course, for the clubs, the tournament presents not just the chance for supporters to have a good time or for the team to seek on-field revenge. Being on the big international stage also is a huge opportunity to put their brand in front of fans all over the world, and crucially to do so in the U.S., where nearly every team -- Asian, European, African -- has put together activities to connect with existing fans and try to win over new ones. But South American clubs have stood out in both scale and passion.

That's partly because, traditionally, many have done little compared to their European counterparts to try to reach new markets. Botafogo has a space near Venice Beach called Venice House, where it hosts events, and supporters can drop by to hang out and meet fellow fans.

"Botafogo House will be a special place to honor everything we've built here," CEO Thairo Arruda said in a statement. "We want to share our essence and show everyone what it is to be Botafogo."

In addition to on-site activations, clubs are also trying to reach new supporters online. River launched their English-language social media channels under the River Plate Global umbrella just before heading to the U.S. for the tournament, which opened with a 3-1 win over Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday.

It's a key part of that club's strategy to continue converting new fans, as the club works through many of the financial issues that clubs in South America must deal with, ones that European teams backed by billionaires or private equity may not need to be concerned about.

"River's internationalization couldn't just be a goal, it had to be the result of an integral growth. Since 2013, the club has gone through a deep transformation. We've tripled our annual income, going from $50 million to more than $180 million," Di Carlo said. "The path is to keep making River grow in all dimensions, so that participating in the Club World Cup isn't an arrival point but rather another step in a sustained project to consolidate River among the great clubs of the world."

It's possible that these six CONMEBOL teams, already among the powers in the region, could use the prize money earned, the increased exposure and the experience on the field to even further accelerate their growth. Other clubs, surely, are fighting for the Libertadores for the eternal glory of being the tournament champion, but the potential trip to a Club World Cup and the cash influx it provides is a bonus of not insignificant amounts.

It's a motivation that will push many more South American teams forward. Although, as the fans of the teams qualified for the first expanded edition have shown, their team simply being here is more than enough for them to express their excitement and take over the tournament.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The videos keep rolling across your social feeds: Boca Juniors fans on the beach in Miami, while Palmeiras fans light up Times Square. You'll hear it in the stands and see it in the scenes, too: River Plate fans belting out songs in Seattle and Flamengo supporters roaring during the individual player introductions.

The FIFA Club World Cup may be a global tournament, but in the United States, it feels unmistakably South American.

All six CONMEBOL clubs -- the above quartet, plus Fluminense and Botafogo -- avoided defeat in their opening matches (three wins and three draws), but the South American fan bases have also been the most boisterous, showed up in the biggest numbers, and deservingly drawing all the attention.

It shouldn't be a huge surprise. Many of their UEFA counterparts shrug with apathy at the shiny new expanded tournament, noting its lack of history. Teams from other regions look happy to be there, intrigued by the massive prize pots and eager to find international legitimacy. But in South America, this tournament provides an opportunity to recapture some of the past glories.

Fans know the dates by heart. You see them on banners, hear them in chants, and read them in club publications.

Palmeiras in 1951 were crowned Copa Rio champions after beating Nice, Red Star Belgrade, and Juventus. It was the first intercontinental club tournament featuring teams from Europe and South America. In 1981, Flamengo dominated Liverpool 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup, a match featuring the champions of the Copa Libertadores and UEFA Champions League. River Plate did the same in 1986, overcoming Romania's Steaua București.

"In 1950, Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay, and it was a huge blow. 1951 brought that back up and was celebrated not just by Palmeiras but also supporters of other teams," said Paulo Roberto, the leader of the U.S. chapter of Palmeiras supporters' group Mancha Verde, to ESPN. "Up to today, it's something we value because it's history, and you cannot erase history."

Those international trophies are huge sources of pride for the teams in South America who have them. Similarly, participation in the tournament now known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup occurs, where the most recent champion of each confederation competes in a tournament. This year, Real Madrid topped Concacaf's Pachuca 3-0 in the final.

"This tournament brings together the elite of global football, and it's an honor to once again see the name of River among the leading figures," River Plate Secretary Stefano Di Carlo said. "It will be our third time participating in the Club World Cup in the last 10 years, which reaffirms our status as top representative in the region."

While the entire sextet of CONMEBOL teams would love to make history by once again winning -- and testing their rivals' openness to celebrating a title -- the likelihood is that the champion will come from UEFA, as it has in the last 11 times the tournament was conducted in its previous format.

MIAMI — Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club said Thursday.

World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever.

Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday. But his hospitalization casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States.

Madrid said Mbappe would "undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment."

Mbappe's absence is a blow to the tournament, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino hopes will be one of the elite events in soccer and rival competitions like the Champions League and Premier League in popularity and value.

After Lionel Messi, Mbappe is arguably the biggest star in the show, with Madrid one of the favorites to lift the trophy in the inaugural edition of the tournament.

But a crowd of more than 62,000 at Hard Rock Stadium missed out on a rare chance to see him in person in the U.S. when he was unavailable for Madrid's surprise 1-1 draw by Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Gastroenteritis is also known as stomach flu and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea.

Mbappe's hospitalization comes almost exactly one year after he sustained a broken nose at the European Championship and had to wear a face mask to continue playing in the tournament.

After Alyssa Naeher wrapped up her international career, another Penn Stater's on the brink of stepping up.

The U.S. Women's National Team announced its training camp roster for June and July on Wednesday. It includes former Nittany Lions Kerry Abello and Sam Coffey.

Ireland also announced its roster and former Penn State midfielder Marissa Sheva is on it.

Abello, a defender for the Orlando Pride, was recently called up to the senior team in May. She spent five seasons at Penn State and accumulated 17 goals.

Coffey played for Penn State from 2019-21. She's currently a midfielder with Portland Thorns FC and has played 35 games on the national level, including five matches in the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Sheva played in 92 games at Penn State from 2015-18, scoring 13 goals. She has played 13 games for Ireland, and will have the chance to face Abello and Coffey on June 26 and 29.

Frenchman is in the US with the Real Madrid squad at the Club World Cup; Mbappe missed Real Madrid's opening match against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Thursday 19 June 2025 15:06, UK

Kylian Mbappe is in hospital receiving treatment for gastroenteritis, Real Madrid have announced.

Mbappe missed Real Madrid's opening Club World Cup match against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal on Wednesday.

The statement read: "Our player Kylian Mbappé has acute gastroenteritis and has been hospitalized for various tests and treatment."

Mbappe has been instrumental for Real Madrid this season, scoring 31 LaLiga goals since his high-profile summer move from Paris St Germain.

Real Madrid enter the tournament as one of the favourites, having dominated European football over the last decade, winning five of the last 10 Champions League titles but did only draw 1-1 with Al Hilal without Mbappe.

According to the NHS website, gastroenteritis is a common mild stomach bug characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting, often related to food poisoning. It typically lasts less than a week.

Gotham FC vs. Bay FC

See you on Sat 6/21

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (June 19, 2025) - Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham has been named to the 20-player U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team roster for two upcoming friendlies against Japan.

The first match is set for Friday, June 28, at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, with kickoff scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The game will stream live on Max in English and in Spanish on Telemundo Deportes' Facebook and YouTube channels.

The second meeting between the two sides will take place on Monday, July 1, in a closed-door scrimmage at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center in Riverside, Missouri — the training facility of the Kansas City Current. The two-match series serves as preparation for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, set for this November.

Whitham is one of four NWSL players named to the U.S. roster.

A native of California, Whitham made her NWSL regular-season debut earlier this year, entering as a substitute in Gotham FC's season opener against Seattle Reign FC. At 14 years old, she became the youngest player to appear in an NWSL regular-season match.

This season, Whitham has made five regular-season appearances for Gotham FC, totaling 58 minutes.

AC Milan know Tijjani Reijnders' quality, but now others are seeing it in a more mainstream view, due to his move.

Since joining Milan, most knew that Reijnders had a bit of something special about him. This season, that feeling only increased, as he became a more complete midfielder. In fact, he was, for a while, the best goalscoring midfielder in Europe.

For this reason, many were frustrated by the manner of his exit and the fee that the Rossoneri received. However, we cannot reminisce too much. After all, the club have greater problems to solve.

The Dutchman has spoken heavily about his belief that Pep Guardiola can further him as a player; he has a track record when it comes to midfielders. However, the Spaniard utilised the former Diavolo last night in the Club World Cup, and despite not contributing, the manager was impressed, as he told Sky (via Milan News).

“Rayan [Cherki] has incredible skill near the penalty area, incredible vision and passing, he has many, many qualities. Today was just the first game in very difficult conditions, but I am really happy that he is here. Tijjani Reijnders also played very well.”

That is what mediocre management is good at. Now Milan look up to Man City and others in the Football Eco system. Selling your best player for cheap,in order to manage accounts. What a pity.

Where was ManCity before OilMoney took over?

Were you around when Berlusconi sold Kaka to Real Madrid to “balance the books”?

And Shevchenko before that. How do you sell the second best striker in club history for a mere 45M and our last Ballon D'Or winner for a mere 65M? We're also not under investigation for 100+ violations of league financial rules. Some people are completely mentally deficient.

Kaka was sold for Europe record then do your findings

Really happy we handed them Reinjders for 55mill. Maybe Napoli will pay the same for Musah….

in that game Cherki was a flop, and Tij show quality. and Tij not just played “very well” but he's an engine for the team like he did for us. i dont know if we can replace him with somebody with the same quality

Its like yesterday that all these same cry babies were saying oh no we sold Tonali yhis guy will never be able to replace him….. First time i saw him i knew not inly he will but will be better then Tonali. 

I yhink we should have asked at least 70+ for him, but oh well, Jashari can be better in long term.

The same people here who keep saying that the management is mediocre for seeling Rejnders are the same people who called the management mediocre when they bought him and kept saying he was average all last season before he moved to City. At that time they were saying he was a mediocre player, and that he was nowhere close to Tonali. Now all of a sudden they

The Cardinale Cucks out in full force defending the stupid decisions of this management. Where did we finish last year?

Premier League clubs are being urged to take a transfer “gamble” on Mason Greenwood despite the “baggage” that he brings.

One-cap England international Greenwood, who remains in the process of switching allegiance to Jamaica, severed ties with Manchester United in the summer of 2024. He registered 22 goals during his debut season at Marseille.

It has been suggested that the 23-year-old, who spent time on loan at La Liga side Getafe in the 2023-24 campaign, is feeling a little homesick and would like to return to his roots. It is claimed that “at least two Premier League teams are weighing up an approach”.

Any team making a move for Greenwood would be taking a calculated risk, given the headlines he has generated off the pitch, but there is no doubting his ability. With that in mind, ex-Three Lions star Gazza would like to see the winger back in the English top-flight.

Former Tottenham and Everton midfielder Gascoigne told Express Sport, courtesy of Esports Insider, when asked if Greenwood should form part of a Premier League transfer package in 2025: “If he went abroad and he's more comfortable coming back and with the goals he's scoring, then yeah, come back.

“I don't know if he brings quite a bit of baggage. [But] if you're going take a gamble on him, take a gamble on him. You have got to give him a chance, even if it's just half a game. Sometimes, with these friendlies, you can play 11 [players] in one half and then the other 11 in the second half. Give the guy a chance.”

Marseille have Greenwood tied to a contract through to 2029 and would be reluctant sellers as they prepare to grace the Champions League next season. If a deal were to be done, then Premier League giants United are due 50 per cent of any fee generated.

The U.S. men's national team will look to build on its opening win in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup when it takes to the field against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas, today in the second match of the group stage.

The Green Falcons are the lone non-Concacaf team in the championship and will serve as a crucial test for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT.

But this isn't an unprecedented move: non-member guests have long been a part of Concacaf's tournament, and Saudi Arabia is now the eighth invitee to have debuted in the event.

But why is Saudi Arabia traveling nearly 9,000 miles to Q2 Stadium to compete in the tournament?

Here's all you need to know…

The Concacaf Gold Cup is an international competition for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. But the competition has a history of inviting guests from around the world into the mix.

Guests to the tournament date back to 1996, when Brazil became the first non-Concacaf nation to enter the fray. Brazil (1996 and 2003) and Colombia (2000) reached the final, but no invited team has yet won the tournament.

There was a 16-year period during which the competition was exclusive to regional teams, but guests resumed participation in 2021. Last year, Concacaf tweaked its guest team policy for the Gold Cup, with the hope that invitees would help expand the competition even more.

In 2018, Concacaf established a partnership with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) — which Saudi Arabia is a member of — setting up “a framework to strengthen collaboration, encourage knowledge exchange and further develop football in their respective territories.” This was specifically intended to increase competitive opportunities between the confederations.

In 2021, Qatar became the AFC's first team to compete in the Gold Cup (and lost 1-0 to the USMNT in the semifinals; also in Austin, coincidentally). Last year, Saudi Arabia received an invitation to join the biannual Gold Cup this year and also in 2027.

Saudi Arabia is also a country with geopolitical pull in the world of sport, specifically soccer. It will host the men's World Cup in 2034, considered a controversial decision for various reasons. The country, through its Public Investment Fund (PIF), is also a visible sponsor of this summer's Club World Cup competition, which features Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal.

Last year, Saudi's PIF also signed a multi-year deal with Concacaf. That investment followed Aramco, one of the world's largest oil companies that is majority-owned by the Saudi government, becoming Concacaf's “official energy partner” for all its teams and competitions.

A match against Saudi Arabia might not be as easy as it sounds. Just ask Argentina, whose only loss in their run to World Cup glory in 2022 was in its opening game against Saudi Arabia (1-2).

Historically, the Saudi Arabian national team is considered one of the most successful national teams in Asia, having won the AFC Asian Cup three times. It has reached a joint record of six Asian Cup finals and become a regular in the men's World Cups since debuting in 1994. It is currently ranked 58th in the world by FIFA.

Led by head coach Herve Renard, the Saudis will be without some of their biggest stars, much like the Americans, thanks to the Club World Cup taking place simultaneously this summer in the U.S..

Several Saudi players are competing for Al Hilal, most notably Salem Al Dawsari, long established as one of the stars of Saudi soccer.

While the U.S. enjoyed a dominant 5-0 win against Trinidad & Tobago in its opening match of the tournament, the team was up against a poorer version of its regional rival. It means this match on Thursday could serve as more of a litmus test.

All teams, minus Saudi Arabia, have qualified for this year's Gold Cup through the latest edition of the Concacaf Nations League or the 2025 Gold Cup prelims.

The tradition of inviting non-Concacaf guests into the competition dates to 1996, when the confederation invited then-defending world champion Brazil as its inaugural “guest nation.” Brazil sent a U-23 squad, falling in the finals to Mexico. Brazil was a regular guest through 2005, even featuring a young Kaká in 2003.

The guest list for the Gold Cup has also featured Colombia, Peru, South Korea, Ecuador, South Africa and Qatar. These teams have regularly made deep runs in the tournament, which may have eventually led to the decision by Concacaf to make the 2007 competition exclusively a regional one to provide local teams with more opportunity to compete as the tournament expanded.

That was true until 2021, when, after a 16-year hiatus, Concacaf resumed inviting guests into the competition. The first guest to receive that invite was Qatar in 2021, ahead of the nation hosting the men's World Cup in 2022. Qatar reached the semifinals of the Gold Cup that year and returned to the competition in 2023, exiting in the quarterfinals 4-0 to Panama.

As successful as guests may have been in the competition, the Gold Cup still has only ever produced three champions: Mexico (nine titles), the United States (seven) and Canada (one).

In the same way that this Gold Cup is serving as a crucial test for the three regional hosts the U.S., Canada and Mexico ahead of next year's men's World Cup, the competition offers Saudi Arabia a meaningful bout of international experience ahead of 2026, too.

The team also has plenty to prepare for as hosts of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup and the 2034 World Cup. The more exposure to diversity in competition, the better, especially considering Saudi Arabia has already signed on as guests for the Gold Cup in 2027 as well.

It also gives Saudi Arabia, the nation, exposure to the American market at a crucial time when nearly every federation, league and sports promoter is hoping to profit from the exploding commercialization of soccer in the U.S.

The two have a brief history, most recently playing in September 2022 in Spain as a final tuneup before the 2022 World Cup (0-0 draw). Six players who featured for the U.S. that day are part of the current squad. It was the first meeting between the teams in 23 years.

Overall, the U.S. is 3-2-2 against Saudi Arabia.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is off and running.

The tournament got started this past weekend in the United States and continues with group stage play currently underway for all 16 teams involved.

Coming into the Gold Cup, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) was in rough shape. The team had a four-match losing streak and doesn't have key players in the lineup for this tournament such as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah.

During that brutal stretch, the USMNT were shutout twice and outscored, 8-3, in a pair of international friendlies earlier this month and in Concacaf Nations League games back in March.

The United States responded in a big way in their Gold Cup opener by taking care of business in a 5-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago last Sunday night in San Jose, California.

The shutout victory must be a sigh of relief for head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who's dealing with a lot of pressure of getting this team on the right track before the World Cup arrives in North America (United States, Mexico and Canada) next summer.

Saudi Arabia also won its opening match of the Gold Cup, earning a 1-0 victory over Haiti.

Here's everything you need to know about USMNT's group stage game against Saudi Arabia on Thursday night:

Organizers of major sporting events always have a lot to worry about — logistics, transportation, security and weather, to start. The organizers of two major events scheduled to take place in Los Angeles next year and in 2028 would be well advised to worry about one additional factor: Donald Trump.

Trump has made public statements endorsing the Olympics and identifying himself with their successful outcome. L.A. won the 2028 games in 2017, during his first term. In a 2020 meeting with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, he claimed to have played a role in securing the games: “From the day I took office,” he said, “I've done everything in my power to make sure that L.A. achieved the winning bid.”

As recently as January, just before his inauguration, he delivered another expression of support. “These are America's Olympics,” he told Casey Wasserman, the chair of the local organizing committee, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago reported by Axios. “These are more important than ever to L.A. and I'm going to be supportive in every way possible and make them the greatest games.”

The current U.S. administration's abusive immigration policies ... threaten the inclusivity and global nature of the World Cup.

— Amnesty international

But Trump has a habit of withdrawing his favors as abruptly as he bestows them — as onetime associates such as Elon Musk have discovered — and upending his own policies on a whim. 

Over just the last week, for example, he ordered immigration authorities to cease their raids on agricultural and hospitality sites, evidently on appeals from his own supporters who cited their need for immigrant laborers. But he reversed himself days later, ordering the raids to resume.

Two administration initiatives in particular could directly affect the World Cup and Olympics. The first is Trump's crackdown on immigration. Up to now, the policy has been haphazardly applied, through scattershot raids on locations such as Home Depot parking lots. 

Immigration agents have been acting as though they have carte blanche to detain people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, conducting raids that have sometimes  swept up American citizens. 

It's easy to see what a Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics has to offer the International Olympic Committee. 

Customs and Border Protection and other federal immigration authorities have been accused of detaining foreign visitors and refusing them admission to the U.S., without explanation. 

Immigration roundups across the U.S. have instilled fear in immigrant communities, prompting many to stay home from work or school.

The second initiative is Trump's travel ban, which bars individuals from 12 countries from entering the U.S. Those from seven other countries face restrictions, though not complete bans. 

According to a widely-reported memo, Trump is contemplating the addition of 36 more countries to the travel ban. Of those countries, 25 are in Africa, but countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific are also named. 

The memo, according to reports, asserts that the countries on the expanded list lack a credible “government authority to produce reliable identity documents,” keep unreliable criminal records or are beset by “widespread government fraud.” Countries could “mitigate” the U.S. concerns, the memo says, if they're willing to accept deportees from the U.S.

Although the international lineup for the 2028 Olympics has not been established, every country on both lists sent athletes to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

At a news conference last week, Wasserman said the White House understood the need to be “accommodating” on visa issues with those in the Olympic bubble — “It has been the case to date and it will certainly be the case going forward through the games.” He spoke confidently, but that he felt the need to speak about it at all tells the real story.

In 2018, when FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, was judging bids to host the 2026 World Cup, Trump assured FIFA that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” But concerns remain that family members of participating athletes might face restrictions on entering the U.S.

Those concerns could hardly be assuaged by a comment from Vice President JD Vance, chair of a government task force overseeing preparations for the World Cup, at a task force meeting attended by FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Vance said the U.S. wants foreign visitors “to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up, we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem.” 

The Special Olympics capitulated to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, dropping a vaccine mandate in hopes of escaping a $27.5-million fine.

He was referring to Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, whose agency has been conducting the immigration raids and border detentions.

Just last week, Customs and Border Protection, a subagency of Homeland Security, stated in a social media post that it would be “suited and booted, ready to provide security for the first round of games” of FIFA's Club World Cup preliminary tournament. The authority of immigration agents to provide security or conduct civil law enforcement activities is legally uncertain. Homeland Security later deleted the post.

“U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event,” a Homeland Security spokesperson told me by email. The White House didn't respond to my request for comment.

There already are signs that Trump's immigration crackdown is suppressing ticket sales for international soccer games in the U.S. That appears to be the case with an opening game of Club World Cup, scheduled for Saturday between Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer club featuring Lionel Messi as player-captain, and the Egyptian team Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium outside Miami.

The cheapest seats for the contest, which are priced according to demand, have fallen from $349 in December to less than $80 last week, the Associated Press reported.

Notwithstanding his statements of support for the Los Angeles Olympics, since taking office in January, Trump's feelings for L.A. have turned distinctly negative. On June 7, he called in the California National Guard and subsequently mobilized the Marines to quell street protests in downtown L.A. against immigration raids. 

Trump stepped up his battle with local authorities on Sunday, when he posted a statement on his Truth Social platform pledging to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.”

What Amnesty International labels “escalating attacks on human rights and civil freedoms” prompted the organization to urge FIFA to “exert its leverage and demand concrete, legally binding guarantees that human rights won't be further sacrificed for the sake of the game.” The organization said “the current U.S. administration's abusive immigration policies, including enforced disappearances under the Alien Enemies Act, travel bans, increased detention, and visa restrictions, threaten the inclusivity and global nature of the World Cup.” 

 Olympics 

We asked back in December whether the Sochi Winter Olympics, which formally begin Friday, were heading for disaster, what with terrorist threats, an uncooperative climate, cost overruns and corruption on a scale imaginable only in Russia. 

Los Angeles has a lot hanging on successful World Cup events and the Olympics, though it's hard to pinpoint how much, financially speaking. Projections of economic gains from major sporting events are typically optimistic, euphoric, chimerical or conjectural. The standing estimate for the economic impact for L.A. County from next year's Cup events is $594 million. That's based on expectations of 180,000 out-of-town visitors arriving for the eight matches, which include the opening match for the U.S. men's team.

That estimate, however, comes from the L.A. Sports and Entertainment Commission, which is responsible for attracting major sporting events to the county and might not be inclined to minimize the potential take. 

The Olympic gains are even tougher to estimate. My colleagues Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Dakota Smith reported recently that local Olympics organizers have expressed confidence that they'll reach their goal of $2.5 billion in sponsorship revenue and about as much coming from ticket sales and other commercial income. All told, the organizers say they'll be able to cover the estimated $7.1 billion in Olympic costs. 

The organizers also waved away concerns that foreign fans might be discouraged from coming to the U.S. for the games, since they expect most ticket sales to be domestic.

As my colleague Steve Henson reported in March, Wasserman has assured the International Olympic Committee that “irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics. L.A. is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.” He said he had made “significant strides” in getting assurances from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that obtaining visas shouldn't be a problem.

Are those assurances reliable? Trump's policymaking record is inauspicious. Whether the product of deliberate policymaking or whim, Trump's capacity for sabotaging the World Cup and Olympics is vast. 

Promoters of major international sporting events always maintain that the games are “nonpartisan” and nonpolitical. That's true up until the point that they're not, as was demonstrated when former President Jimmy Carter ordered a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics to protest Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Russia retaliated by boycotting the 1984 games (in Los Angeles). 

Will Trump's politics poison the upcoming soccer and Olympic events? It's not clear at this moment, but the organizers are undoubtedly crossing their fingers.

World Cup champion and National Women's Soccer League legend Meghan Klingenberg announced her retirement from professional soccer on Wednesday in a letter shared on social media. 

The post, which was a collaboration with the U.S. women's national team and U.S. Soccer, started, “This isn't a surprise. But it still feels big to say. It's time – I'm retiring from football.”

She also added a cheeky caption which read, “Now available for charity matches, Sunday brunches and pool parties… preferably all in the same day.”

Klingenberg, 36, most recently played with Portland Thorns FC, but elected to depart the club at the end of the 2024 season. She spent eight years there and won two NWSL championships as well as two NWSL Shields.

After winning two national championships at North Carolina, Klingenberg was selected by the Washington Freedom in the 2011 WPS Draft. She was traded to the Boston Breakers and later played for the Western New York Flash, as well. 

Klingenberg spent the 2012 and 2013 seasons with Tyresö FF in Sweden, then joined the Houston Dash of the upstart NWSL as a 2014 expansion draft selection. She played there until a 2015 trade sent her to Portland.

For country, Klingenberg represented the U.S. at the U-16, U-17, U-20 and U-23 levels. She retires with 75 caps earned between 2011 and 2018. She was a key fixture in the 2015 World Cup title run, playing every minute for the U.S.

Later in the day, Klingenberg sat down with former teammates Becky Sauerbrunn and Lindsey Horan to discuss her decision on the first episode of the new U.S. Soccer Podcast, which she will co-host alongside David Gass and Alejandro Bedoya.

In addition to joining the podcast, Klingenberg is also a founding partner in lifestyle brand and media company Re-inc., alongside Tobin Heath, Christen Press and Megan Rapinoe.

SEATTLE — As the Emerald City prepares to host thousands of soccer fans for the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup and the upcoming FIFA World Cup next summer, local leaders and community organizers are spearheading a city-wide initiative to beautify Seattle.

Outside Lumen Field this week, the influx of tourists is evident as fans from around the globe arrive to witness the FIFA Club World Cup matches. Business owners and local leaders are determined to ensure Seattle leaves a lasting impression on its visitors. To achieve this, they are organizing over 50 beautification events throughout the city next month.

Community leaders and members of the Seattle FIFA World Cup 2026 Organizing Committee are rallying volunteers for the "One Seattle Day of Service." This all-day event on Saturday, July 12, will feature 55 volunteer activities across the city aimed at beautifying Seattle.

"Many of the [volunteer events] are in the Chinatown-International District, South Seattle, North Seattle, West Seattle," said Mayor Bruce Harrell. He emphasized the importance of the cleanup efforts, stating, "The point of the cleanup efforts is to build community, and after we do the 'One Day of Service,' our crews and our community-based organizations do more. It's just keeping the momentum. We're going to keep that momentum up to the FIFA World Cup."

As excitement builds for the FIFA World Cup, the initiative is seen as beneficial for the local economy and hospitality sector. "It's great to have all this going on and the energy it brings. It's good for the economy, the hotels. It's exciting," said Boyd.



Sounders legend Steve Zakuani encouraged participation, saying, "Get out there, grow your sleeves up and get involved and help make our community as great as it already is - even better."

This marks the fourth consecutive year Seattle has organized this all-day volunteer effort, which includes not only trash collection but also graffiti removal, planting new flowers, and weeding out invasive vegetation.

Martina Navratilova is now the most successful player in Wimbledon history.

Navratilova won 18 Grand Slam singles titles in her career, with nine of them coming on the grass of Wimbledon.

The Czech-born American also won 41 major titles in both women's and mixed doubles.

For her compatriot, Madison Keys, winning the Australian Open for her first Grand Slam was a joyous moment, but Navratilova had mixed feelings when lifting her first major title in 1978.

Navratilova played Chris Evert in the 1978 Wimbledon final, the player that whom she had beaten only four times in their 25 previous meetings.

However, she was able to overcome this and came from a set down to beat Evert, 2-6 6-4 7-5, to win her first Grand Slam title.

When looking back on her first Grand Slam singles victory, Navratilova spoke to Amol Rajan in an interview with the BBC.

While it was the biggest moment of her career at the time, Navratilova admitted that people did not care as much as she expected them to.

Navratilova also explained how it felt bittersweet not to be able to celebrate with her family, who were unable to celebrate with her due to the political situation in Czechoslovakia at the time.

“Well, you know, I stayed at the Inn on the park, drove myself to the courts,” said Navratilova. “And afterwards…you know the hotel sent me all the newspapers, so I'm reading all the… and it was so sweet.

“And I'm like, oh, the world's going to come to a stop and say, ‘Wow, Martina Navratilova won Wimbledon!' Nobody gave a s***! (laughs)

“And most of all, I couldn't even celebrate it with my family. I mean, I found out after the match that they watched it on TV, but you know, that was very bittersweet because my dad spent thousands and thousands of hours on the court with me and then travelling to little tournaments here and there. 

“And then we couldn't share it here and there because he couldn't get out of the country, and not only… you know? So I didn't even know if they'd watched it, but they ended up having seen it. So it was bittersweet, but, you know, life didn't really change that much for me.”

Navratilova would go on to dominate Wimbledon from this point on, winning six consecutive titles between 1982 and 1987.

Her 1987 victory meant that she had equalled Helen Wills Moody with eight Wimbledon titles, needing just one more victory to stand alone in history.

Navratilova was close to achieving this in 1988 and 1989, but on both occasions lost in the final to Steffi Graf.

However, it was in 1990 when Navratilova was able to cross that hurdle and win a historic ninth Wimbledon title.

Having lost in the final in the two years prior, Navratilova did not care how she was able to get there.

“I had prepared for Wimbledon. The event overtakes any single person,” Navratilova told media at the time. “I didn't care if I scraped and scratched to get this. They don't put an asterisk next to your name saying you won but didn't play that well.” 

Navratilova did not need to scrape and scratch, beating compatriot Zina Garrison, 6-4 6-1, in the final.

This was the final Grand Slam singles title that she would ever play, with Navratilova playing her last Wimbledon Centre Court match in 1994.

She would win two more mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon after 1994, before Navratilova officially retired in 2006.

World No. 2 Coco Gauff followed up her French Open win with an early exit from the German Open.

Gauff suffered a 6-3, 6-3 upset loss in her second-round matchup with China's Xinyu Wang on Thursday.

The defeat took place in Gauff's first match since winning at Roland-Garros on June 7.

Wang was down 3-1 in the second set before she rallied to defeat Gauff. The World No. 49 will now advance to the quarterfinals in Berlin.

The victory marked the third top-10 victory of Wang's career. Last season she upset Jessica Pegula, who at the time was ranked No. 5 in the world, in the second round at Wimbledon.

"After I won the first set, I told myself, 'Let's take a minute and enjoy this… I won the first set against the French Open champion,'" Wang said in her post-match interview, per Olympics.com's Nick McCarvel.

Gauff's early exit will delay a potential rematch with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who finished as runner-up to Gauff at Roland Garros. Sabalenka also advanced to the quarterfinals on the opposite side of the German Open bracket. 

The 21-year-old has enjoyed a stellar clay season this spring, making the finals in both Madrid and Rome before her victory over Sabalenka in Paris.

Gauff has less experience on grass courts like those in Berlin. According to the Tennis Gazette, Gauff headed into the tournament with a 21-10 career record (68 percent win rate) on the surface.

That's a smaller sample size, but a lower win percentage than Gauff's 141-61 record on hard court (70 percent win rate) and 67-22 mark on clay (75 percent win rate.)

Gauff has never made it past the fourth round on the grass at Wimbledon. She was eliminated at that stage last year with a straight-set defeat by Emma Navarro.

She will look to build on her French Open success and bounce back from Thursday's early exit when Wimbledon starts on June 30.

Coming off the high of winning her second Grand Slam title—and first at Roland Garros, Coco Gauff was unable to make the seamless transition to grass.Wang Xinyu ousted the world No. 2, 5-3, 6-3, on Thursday in the second round of the Berlin Tennis Open.Debuting her second of three planned custom Miu Miu kits, Gauff struggled to locate her first serve and time her shots from the baseline against an opponent who already had three wins this week—including against now lucky loser Ons Jabeur—after successfully coming through two qualifying rounds.For Wang, this marked her best career victory by ranking. All three of her Top 10 wins have been against Americans ranked inside the Top 5, having twice defeated Jessica Pegula in 2024 that involved a second-round upset at Wimbledon. The 23-year-old Shenzhen native wiped away an early break deficit in the second set, before serving out the encounter at 15.

During her pre-tournament press conference on Wednesday, Gauff was asked about why she was yet to win a title on grass after a fourth-round showing as a 15-year-old at 2019 Wimbledon produced her breakout tour moment.“I don't think grass is my best surface, but I'm trying my best to get better each year. I would love to win either here or obviously Wimbledon, but I still have a lot to learn and every grass season I think I learned a little bit more,” she said.“I would like to say just because the season is short, but also I can't blame it on that because we all have the same amount of time to get ready.”Wang advances to face eighth seed Paula Badosa. The Spaniard overcame Emma Navarro in straight sets Wednesday.

Wang looked confident in her 6-3, 6-3 triumph over the world No.2, who was playing her first match of the grass-court swing in the lead-up to Wimbledon. 

Coco Gauff's French Open triumph caught up with her on Thursday (19 June).

The world No.2 fell in her first match of the grass-court swing in the second round of the Berlin Tennis Open, upset by world No.49 Wang Xinyu of the People's Republic of China, 6-3, 6-3.

It marks a career-best win for the 23-year-old Wang, and snaps the American superstar's seven-match win streak she accumulated in Paris.

Wang, a qualifier in Berlin at the WTA 500 event, next faces Spain's Paula Badosa in the quarter-finals. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka is also through to the quarters in Berlin on the opposite half of the draw.

"After I won the first set, I told myself, 'Let's take a minute and enjoy this... I won the first set against the French Open champion,'" a smiling Wang told Andrea Petkovic in the on-court interview following her upset.

"I was really happy with how I played today," she added. "I was serving good. I was putting pressure on her second serve with my return. It was a tough match, [but] I'm happy that I hung in there in the tough moments. I'm really happy to get through today."

Wang was down in her very first qualifying match of the week, needing three sets to advance before scoring wins over Ons Jabeur (to make the main draw) and Daria Kasatkina (in the first round).

"During my first match in qualifying, that was so tough... it just wasn't working," she reflected. "My team told me, 'Just fight for every point. And believe that you can do it.' So that's what I've tried to do."

Gauff served at just 38 percent of first serves in for the match (22 of 58) while hitting seven double faults in the one hour, 15-minute encounter. She led by a break in the first set, but relented that lead and never looked to re-settle.

The opening-match loss leaves Gauff in a lurch with Wimbledon set to start on 30 June. There are two WTA events for next week, though Gauff is not entered in either of them as of Thursday.

Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill has revealed how it was Novak Djokovic who helped turnaround Sinner's game in 2022 with his honest feedback. Djokovic had told Cahill that Sinner has “no variation”, “no height over the net”, “doesn't try to bring me to net” and “not attacking my serve”. 

It was Cahill who had sought out the Serbian star after Djokovic had beat Sinner in the quarter-finals of the 2022 Wimbledon, around the time he had joined Sinner's coaching team. Djokovic had beaten Sinner 5-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. 

Cahill decided to approach Djokovic for his views.

“Hits the ball great, but there's no variation. So you know, there's no shape on his shot. There's no height over the net. Doesn't come to the net. He's not trying to bring me in, I know that he returns well, but he's not attacking my serve on the return of serve,” Cahill recalled the feedback on the podcast ‘Served with Andy Roddick'. 

“Novak got used to his ball, got used to the shape, got used to the pace and then just locked in, like Novak does, and doesn't miss. And won the last three sets reasonably easily,” Cahill says about that 2022 match. “And I saw Novak, and he's always great with this, he's always been incredible when you tap him on the shoulder. And I said, ‘Hey listen, I've just started with Jannik, don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me, but can I ask what you were feeling out there?' And he was incredible.” 

Cahill then took the feedback to Sinner who was inspired to change his game. “So he went through his whole game and broke it down. It wasn't like it was revelations to what we didn't know about Jannik and what we were trying to change in his game.

“But when you take that conversation and sit down with a young man like Jannik Sinner and say,' Hey, listen, I just spoke to Novak and this is what he thinks', that leaves a big impression on a young player. So for Jannik it's: ‘Right, give it to me. Let's start doing these changes'.”

Sinner's ranking at the end of that year 2022 was 15; he is now world no.1.

The Czech returned to competition this year after a 15-month maternity break. The 35-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 and reached the Australian Open final in 2019, will compete at this year's Wimbledon and US Open for the last time.

Kvitova, who has won 31 titles over nearly two decades and reached a highest ranking of number two in the world, said the 2025 season would be her last.

Kvitova's career was marked by resilience, most notably her recovery from a serious injury sustained during a home robbery in 2016.

"I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me," she wrote in a statement.

"And while I am not entirely sure yet what my hardcourt swing in the US will look like, I am intending to finish my active playing career at the US Open in New York later this summer.

"I could not have asked or wished for anything more - tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love."

Since her return at the ATX Open in Austin, Kvitova has lost six of her seven matches, with her only win coming in the first round in Rome. She also competed in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, the French Open and the Queen's Club Championships in London.

The 2025 French Open will live long in the memory of French player Lois Boisson. 

The rank outsider was handed a wildcard for the event, 12 months on from a cruel ACL injury sustained just one week before the 2024 Roland Garros extravaganza. 

Boisson set about making amends for the year she missed by flying through the draw all the way to the semi-finals, where she eventually lost to Coco Gauff. 

The 22-year-old defeated Jessica Pegula, Mirra Andreeva and Elise Mertens en route to the last four, and it really was a fairytale tournament from her perspective. 

Any new fans she picked up at the French Open might have been hoping to see Boisson at Wimbledon, but now that prospect is firmly in the balance after she was overlooked for a wildcard. 

CoCo Vandeweghe is a former player who called time on her career back in 2023. 

This decision not to give Boisson a wildcard by the Wimbledon authorities has caused a stir, but the former world number nine doesn't agree. 

She believes the fact that her exploits on the clay in France shouldn't earn her an automatic wildcard pick for Wimbledon. 

She said on the Tennis Channel: “CoCo Vandeweghe: No. Because it was on clay and not on grass.

“This is a wonderful Cinderella story, but there has been no data that Lois Boisson would ever do anything on the grass courts.

“That is what I always enjoyed about Wimbledon. Usually, they would give a wildcard to somebody who did well in the weeks leading up to Wimbledon.

“I thought honestly that Victoria Mboko would get one, she is a youngster coming up, she has won and beaten a lot of players in a couple of tournaments.

“She went on a crazy 20-match win streak without losing a set, leading into Rome and then continued that on until she lost to Coco Gauff.

“I think there are plenty of deserving players, I just don't think Boisson is one of them.

The French star could head to qualifying next week to try and earn a place in the main draw. 

However, after producing the goods at the French Open, she might choose to skip the grass court season and instead prepare for the US Open. 

Boisson is now the world number 67 after rising through the ranks after her semi-final run in Paris, but the cut-off for Wimbledon came before the tournament. 

It would be a shame to see Boisson not even attempt to qualify for Wimbledon, but switching from clay to grass isn't easy even for the great players on the tour. 

After her run in France, Boisson's confidence must be sky high and it will be intriguing to see whether she decides to play or not.

Grass Season

Petra Kvitová, the two-time Wimbledon champion and former world No. 2, has announced she will retire after this year's U.S. Open.

Kvitová, 35, won the Billie Jean King Cup six times with the Czech Republic and has 31 singles titles to her name. She returned to the tour in February, after a 16-month break following the birth of her first child, Petr. Wimbledon has given her a wild card for this year, and with her ranking down at No. 572, she will be reliant on one for entry into the U.S. Open and the events leading up to it. She has won one match in seven events since coming back to tennis.

“While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment!” Kvitová wrote Thursday in a post published on X. “I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face — the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career. Through all these years, I am so incredibly thankful for the unwavering support of my family, my closest friends, my team, and all the incredible fans that have always supported me around the world over all these years.”

With her swinging leftie serve and ability to get forward, Kvitová's game is perfect for grass. She won her first Wimbledon title in 2011, aged 21 — beating Maria Sharapova in straight sets in the final. Three years later she thrashed Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 to win her second title, having only dropped one set throughout.

During matches like that, Kvitová appeared unbeatable — and the expectation was that she would win many more Grand Slams. But her career was cruelly halted in December 2016 after a home invasion apartment in Prostejov, Czech Republic. Kvitová needed an emergency four-hour operation to repair damage to tendons and nerves in her left, playing hand and there were fears that she would never play again.

She confounded expectations by returning five months later at the 2017 French Open, then reaching that year's U.S. Open quarterfinals as she worked her way back to the top of the sport. In January 2019, she lost a thrilling Australian Open final to Naomi Osaka, which was the closest she ever got to lifting a third Grand Slam title. Winning that match would also have made Kvitová the world No. 1, which eluded her during her peak.

Kvitová reached the semifinals at the following year's French Open, before going through a quieter period in which she didn't go beyond the fourth round of a major in three years. She went on hiatus in early 2024.

“Growing up in my hometown of Fulnek and hitting the first tennis balls with my father on the local courts, I never imagined becoming a professional tennis player, being able to travel the world, and playing in the most beautiful stadiums around the world,” Kvitová wrote Thursday.

“I could not have asked or wished for anything more — tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.”

She will be given a warm farewell at this year's Wimbledon, where she is the only multiple women's champion other than the Williams sisters since 1996. The main draw begins June 30.

Grass Season

Petra Kvitová, the two-time Wimbledon champion and former world No. 2, has announced she will retire after this year's U.S. Open.

Kvitová, 35, won the Billie Jean King Cup six times with the Czech Republic and has 31 singles titles to her name. She returned to the tour in February, after a 16-month break following the birth of her first child, Petr. Wimbledon has given her a wild card for this year, and with her ranking down at No. 572, she will be reliant on one for entry into the U.S. Open and the events leading up to it. She has won one match in seven events since coming back to tennis.

There is a stacked today of tennis action today with Carlos Alcaraz and Jacob Fearnley both in action at Queen's. Alcaraz faces an all-Spanish clash against Jaume Munar, while rising British star Fearnley is up against Corentin Moutet. Both matches will take place inside the Andy Murray Arena.

Fans will also be eagerly anticipating Arthur Rinderkneck's return to action. A lucky loser, the 29-year-old Frenchman stunned world No. 10 Ben Shelton in the last round and now faces Reilly Opelka for a shot at the quarter-finals. Whether or not Rinderkneck can pull of another surprise remains to be seen.

Jannik Sinner has been upset by Alexander Bublik and crashed out of the Halle Open.

The world No. 1 was defending champion but went down 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 as Bublik reached the quarter-finals.

Sinner had not lost to any player, aside from Carlos Alcaraz, since August before today.

Jacob Fearnley has spoken out after Corentin Moutet was left furious during their clash, which saw the Frenchman label the umpire as ‘crazy' in a fit of rage.

Moutet was left unhappy by how he was given a time violation and that the official had spoken throughout his match.

Asked about whether he felt it was difficult to keep his cool during Moutet's outbursts, Fearnley explained: “Yeah, no, I mean, it can be tricky, but I played Corentin before, and yeah, I kind of know that's what he's going to do. He's going to get angry. He's going to talk to the ref.

“So when he was doing it, it wasn't really a surprise. Yeah, I just expected it. And once it happened, I'd already kind of prepared for it and I could just move on from there.And also, it helps that I was kind of up in the score. Maybe if it was a little bit closer, it would have been a bit different.”

Carlos Alcaraz has booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a hard-fought victory over Jaume Munar at the Andy Murray Arena.

The 22-year-old was forced to dig very deep to secure the victory, but he ultimately prevailed with an impressive series of shots late on.

With Carlos Alcaraz's clash with Jaume Munar taking a while now at the Andy Murray Arena, there has been a schedule change.

Reilly Opelka will now face Arthur Rinderknech on Court 1, rather than after this clash of the Spaniards - which will therefore be the last match on the Andy Murray Arena today.

Katie Boulter admitted that she was not used to playing in British heat today in Nottingham.

She booked her place in the quarter-finals by defeating Sonay Kartal, then bemoaned the soaring temperatures across the UK.

“The heat was killing me today. I am definitely proper British because I can't handle the heat at all but I just kind of got over the line,” said Boulter.

“I always find the British heat completely different to anything else. I've played in Australia where it's 40 degrees, I've played in humidity in Thailand and Washington and I'm completely fine.

“When I come out here and it's 28 degrees I'm dying. I'm not entirely sure why that is. I was really pleased with myself today. It wasn't easy for sure.”

Coco Gauff has lost her first match since winning the French Open, going out of Berlin to Wang Xinyu.

The Chinese star, world No. 49, secured the best win of her career in a 6-3 6-3 victory. She has reached the quarter-finals of a grass tournament for the first time.

Jacob Fearnley could not hide his delight after reaching the quarter-finals at Queen's with a three-set victory over Corentin Moutet.

"I'm very happy to be in my first quarter-final, it's even better to do it here in the UK," he said.

"It's really special for me, I've dreamed of these moments since I was a young boy. To do it here in front of this crowd and on this court is unbelievable.

"I tried to stick to my game plan and be aggressive. I did that better in the third set and the result speaks for itself. It's really special to have everyone here and watch me play on this stage."

Carlos Alcaraz is sizzling in the British heat and has taken the first set 6-4 against Jaume Munar.

He is aiming to join the likes of Jack Draper and Jacob Fearnley in the quarter-finals today.



Katie Boulter is into the quarter-finals at Nottingham after defeating fellow Brit Sonay Kartal.

She held her nerve to win 6-4 1-6 7-5 to set up a tie with American star McCartney Kessler.

And after the match, Boulter had some very kind words to say about her opponent, insisting that Kartal has a bright future.

"She is such a tough competitor, she's gunna be back here playing many more matches" \ud83c\udfa4Nice words from @katiecboulter on Sonay Kartal after an epic in Nottingham pic.twitter.com/c9JkJJ161J

Jacob Fearnley is into the quarter-finals at Queen's after a 6-3 2-6 6-2 victory over Corentin Moutet.

His opponent launched into a fiery outburst in the final stages of the match, calling the umpire "crazy" after being given a time violation and losing his serve.

Moutet fumed that he was punished for talking, while alleging that the official was speaking throughout the contest, while Fearnley took applause from the British crowd.

Corentin Moutet was subjected to a chorus of boos at Queen's for his reaction to being broken by Jacob Fearnley.

After the Brit sent a forehand down the line past Moutet to break, the Frenchman fired a tennis ball into the stand as he exploded furiously.

The crowd, already on Fearnley's side, further showed their disdain towards Moutet and sent a barrage of boos in his direction.

Jacob Fearnley has been taken to a third set inside the Andy Murray Arena.

The British star won the first set 6-3 against Corentin Moutet.

However, the Frenchman fought back and won the second set 6-2.



Aryna Sabalenka has finally won her Berlin Open match - which started yesterday.

The Belarusian was furious that the match was halted due to slippery conditions with her leading 6-2.

Having returned to the court today, Sabalenka initially trailed 4-2 to Rebeka Masarova.

However, she went on to win 6-2 7-6.

Carlos Alcaraz has revealed that he has been ‘scared' by abusive social media messages.

Several stars have recently opened up on abuse they receive online, including British star Katie Boulter.

Boulter revealed that she had received threats after she lost at the French Open earlier this month.

And now Alcaraz has revealed: “I receive them too. There are some really wild messages.

“I'm not going to mention exactly some of the messages I've received, but they are very heavy and some even scare you.

Obviously, when you lose, you receive a lot of messages. Some are quite good; others, quite bad. I prefer not to think about it.”



A seamless victory for Jiri Lehecka.

The Czech star is into the Queen's quarter-finals after beating Gabriel Diallo 6-4 6-2.

Up next in the Andy Murray Arena is Jacob Fearnley vs Corentin Moutet.

Jiri Lehecka has taken the first set in his Queen's match against Gabriel Diallo.

Action at Queen's is close to commencing.

Jiri Lehecka vs Gabriel Diallo is the first match inside the Andy Murray Arena.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jacob Fearnley are due on court later today.

Jannik Sinner insists he does not take any notice of the rankings despite crossing a milestone.

The Italian is the fifth player to spend 52 weeks or more as the world No. 1 in their first stint at the top of the rankings.

“I don't look at the rankings so much myself, because I feel like World No. 1, No. 2 or No. 3 is the result of what you work on, on a yearly basis,” Sinner told the ATP Tour's media team.

“You have to be very consistent, and my results have been amazing since last year until now, so we will try to push in that direction as long as we can.

“On the other hand, the most important thing for me is to improve as a player. I think I made some good progress since last year. I feel like I'm a better player, which for me is the most important. Of course, the result matters, but it's quite relevant for me. I do enjoy being in this position.”

Carlos Alcaraz says Emma Raducanu will be his ‘boss' at the US Open.

The duo are set to team up in a high-profile mixed doubles competition.

"She's going be the boss," joked Alcaraz. "I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. I made that special request [but] she took a while. But obviously she had to ask [her team], and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute.

"I know Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have really good relationship with her. So it's just going be interesting. We are going to enjoy it, for sure. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun."



Andy Murray has joked that he's not sure whether he enjoyed coaching Novak Djokovic.

Their six-month partnership ended in May, a week before the start of the French Open.

Murray said in a Q&A with fans in Glasgow: “We had a chat on the phone and he asked me if I would consider coaching him, which I wasn't expecting. I think it was a pretty unique opportunity. I was really enjoying being at home but I thought I should give it a go and see whether I enjoyed it.”

He paused before jokingly adding: “I'm not sure if I did.”

Boris Becker has not been hired by Wimbledon's broadcast rights holders despite being allowed to return to the UK.

Becker was deported to Germany in December 2022 after serving time in prison for hiding millions in assets and loans to avoid paying debts.

Under the terms of his conviction, Becker could now apply to return to the UK.

The former Wimbledon champion was a major part of the BBC's coverage of the tournament before his sentence.

However, the corporation have decided against hiring him for this year's Wimbledon. TNT Sports, who also have broadcasting rights for the competition this year, have not selected him either.

Jack Draper overcame a series of errors to edge into the Queen's quarter-finals.

The British star came from a set down to beat Alexei Popyrin 2-6 6-2 7-6 in the Andy Murray Arena.

Draper will face American Brandon Nakashima in the last-eight tomorrow.



A man who was given a restraining order for stalking Emma Raducanu attempted to buy Wimbledon tickets, according to Sky News.

An application under the man's name was discovered in the public ballot.

His name had been black-listed and was red-flagged by the tournament's security system.

Raducanu had been aware of the man's presence during previous tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha before she spotted him “fixated” in the stands during her second-round match at the Dubai Championships.

A day earlier, the man handed Raducanu a letter and asked for a photo in a coffee shop.

She claims that she "couldn't see the ball through tears" and could "barely breathe".

A spectator at the Halle Open was taken to hospital last night.

The individual was struck by a falling advertising hoarding during Alexander Zverev's match against Marcus Giron.

In horrifying scenes, the banner fell from the upper tier of the stadium. However, the woman, said to be aged 62, did not suffer any major injuries.

"There has never been anything like this in our 32-year tournament history. We deeply regret the incident," said tournament director Ralf Weber.

Weber also promised the woman a free season ticket for next year's event.

"We suspect that the drumming against the boards caused screws to come loose," event managers Dr Udo Kleine and Uwe Greipel-Dominik said in a joint statement.

"This must not happen and we apologise. We will also check all the other boards and their fixings immediately after the Zverev match."

Jack Draper has responded to Emma Raducanu pairing up with Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open.

A reimagined doubles event will see tennis megastars partner up for a high-profile mixed doubles event.

Draper, who will play alongside Qinwen Zheng, said: “Yeah, I mean, a wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that.

“I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. He's obviously the best player in the world, probably right now, along with Jannik Sinner. Great at doubles, as well. Saw that with Rafa Nadal at the Olympics. She's gone about and chosen the best partner, for sure. Hopefully, they do well.”

Of playing alongside Zheng, Draper added: "I think it's a good format for the players to get prepared for the US Open, having a shot at playing with another top players. Qinwen I know from the tour. I have seen her around. Obviously a great player herself and has a really good game."

Aryna Sabalenka was furious to when her Berlin Open match was suspended last night.

After initial speculation that it was due to a lack of light, it later transpired that officials had called time on the day's play because of a slippery surface.

Sabalenka was leading Rebeka Masarova 6-2 inside the Steffi Graf Stadion.

After learning why the match was suspended, she was overheard telling the umpire: “You're stopping the match because she said that side is slippery? I just played two games on that side.”



Hello and welcome back to Express Sport's LIVE coverage of the day's tennis news.

We'll have everything from Queen's, Berlin and beyond as players ramp up their preparations for Wimbledon.

So stay tuned...

Holger Rune has booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a 2-6 6-1 6-1 victory over Mackenzie McDonald.

The Danish star was forced to dig deep to come from behind but found his rhythm in the second set to turn the game on its head, winning the final two sets in just 49 minutes – and hitting some incredible shots along the way.

Brandon Nakashima has spoken about his upcoming clash with Jack Draper in the quarter-finals at Queens.

Asked for his thoughts on the contest, he said: "Another tough one for sure. He's playing some of the best tennis of his career now.

"He's a good friend of mine so it's going to be a fun match I'm looking forward to it."



Although there were initial murmurings that play had been suspended in Berlin due to a lack of natural light, it now transpires that the reason for the suspension is actually the surface.

The court was ruled to be becoming too slippery to continue.

Aryna Sabalenka, who was leading 6-2 at the time, was seen protesting against the call, saying: “You're stopping the match because she said that side is slippery? I just played two games on that side” In contrast, Rebeka Masarova agreed with the decision.

Sabalenka and Masarova\u2019s match in Berlin is stopped due to the court getting slippery. Rebeka wanted to stop play. Aryna wanted to continue:\u201cYou\u2019re stopping the match because she said that side is slippery? I just played 2 games on that side\u201d pic.twitter.com/kUWf1WoML7

Play has been suspended at the Berlin WTA 500 during Aryna Sabalenka's clash with Rebeka Masarova due to slippery conditions.

Sabalenka led 6-2 at the time before the decision was made.

Dan Evans is out of Queens. The Brit has been comfortably beaten 5-7 6-7 (4-7) by Brandon Nakashima. Despite two tight sets, the American has prevailed in style to book his spot in the quarter-finals.

Dan Evans, playing the first of his two scheduled matches today, has lost the first set to Brandon Nakashima.

The American needed just one break to open a lead up against his British opponent, taking it 7-5 in a cagey opener.

Jack Draper insists he is still getting used to the surface, having reached the Queen's quarter-finals with a three-set win over Alexei Popyrin.

When asked if he was getting comfortable on British grass, he replied: "A little bit, not exactly in the first couple of sets it wasn't pretty at all.

"I still need some time to adjust to grass but I'm feeling better every time I get through these matches. One more under the belt and I'll be back on Friday."

Jack Draper has overcome a very tough test to reach the quarter-finals of Queen's.

He dropped the first set to Alexei Popyrin but held his nerve to win 3-6 6-2 7-6(5) in a thrilling decider.

Up next on Andy Murray Arena is Dan Evans against Brandon Nakashima, with Holger Rune versus Mackenzie McDonald to follow.

YESSSSSSS!!!!!!! @jackdraper0 \ud83d\udde3\ufe0fFighting back to reach the quarters at @QueensTennis \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/OCWPjTbJbL

Jack Draper leads Alexei Popyrin 5-4, with his opponent serving to stay in the match.

But this has been anything but easy, and it's anyone's guess as to who will end up on top.

Those on Andy Murray Arena today have certainly got value for their money, with two more matches still to come.



Jack Draper is a break up in the second set and appears to have settled into this contest on the Andy Murray Arena now.

He was muttering "come on" repeatedly at the change of ends in frustration, before converting his first break point.

And he has taken the second set 6-2. Alexei Popyrin has gone off for a break between sets.

Jack Draper's hopes of a top-four seeding at Wimbledon are hanging by a thread...

The British No. 1 has lost the first set in his Queen's last-16 clash against Alexei Popyrin 6-3, with the second currently poised at 2-2.

Draper must reach the semi-finals to leapfrog Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz into the world's top four.

But he has work to do on home turf...

Tobias Tappeiner, a friend of Jannik Sinner who once beat the world No. 1, has died after a tragic car crash.

The 24-year-old, from San Paolo in northern Italy, drove the wrong way onto the A22 motorway and crashed into a minivan carrying a family of five.

The family were injured in the incident as they headed for a seaside holiday on Sunday morning, and investigations into why Tappeiner entered the southbound carriageway are underway.

World No. 3 Alexander Zverev has cruised into the last 16 at Halle with a 6-2 6-1 victory against Marcos Giron.

Russia's Karen Khachanov has joined him, beating Zizou Bergs 7-5 6-3.



There's another shake-up in the men's doubles at Queen's!

Alex de Minaur has unfortunately dropped out of the main draw due to a hip injury, so Alexei Popyrin withdraws with him.

Lucky losers Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway will replace them, facing Taylor Fritz and Jiri Lehecka on Court 1 this afternoon.

There has been a change to the schedule at Queen's!

Lucky losers Daniel Evans and Henry Searle are in action against second seeds Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten this afternoon.

The British duo have replaced Matthew Ebden and Jordan Thompson in the doubles main draw after the latter's withdrawal.

That match will take place on Court 1 after Taylor Fritz and Jiri Lehecka vs Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur.

Jack Draper has been handed a huge boost ahead of the Wimbledon draw, with a top-four seeding in the men's draw now within his grasp.

World No. 5 Taylor Fritz's first-round exit at Queen's has opened the door for Draper, British No. 1 and sixth in the ATP rankings.

Draper will leapfrog the American and Novak Djokovic and earn the top-four seeding if he reaches the semi-finals at Queen's.

That outcome would mean he avoids a meeting with the world's three top-ranked stars, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, until the Wimbledon semi-finals.

There are also four matches at Halle to sink your teeth into, including a former world No. 1...

10.30am: Zizou Bergs vs Karen Khachanov

11.40am: Marcos Giron vs Alexander Zverev

12.50pm: Quentin Halys vs Daniil Medvedev

2pm: Alex Michelsen vs Stefanos Tsitsipas



Here is today's schedule at Queen's, with the action getting started at noon...

12pm: Roberto Bautista Agut vs Jakub Mensik

1.10pm: Alexei Popyrin vs Jack Draper

2.20pm: Dan Evans vs Bradon Nakashima

3.30pm: Holger Rune vs Mackenzie McDonald

Andy Roddick has backed Novak Djokovic to challenge for a 25th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz lead the odds, but Roddick believes the Serb will be closer matched to the young duo than in any other major.

"Listen, Novak at 6/1 odds? That's a great number for him. He was in the finals last year, let's not forget that," Roddick explained.

I think it's his best Slam to potentially get in a mix. I think he's closer to Sinner and Alcaraz, best-of-five format at Wimbledon as opposed to the other places."

Nick Kyrgios has added to the backlash surrounding the US Open's new mixed doubles format by joining forces with Naomi Osaka.

Carlos Alcaraz will team up with Emma Raducanu, while Aryna Sabalenka has paired with Grigor Dimitrov, and Novak Djokovic with Olga Danilovic

The shake-up has faced criticism from traditional doubles players, with Ellen Perez branding it "disrespectful".

And now Kyrgios and Osaka, both ranked low due to sporadic matches in 2025, have been granted wildcards.



Novak Djokovic has revealed that he indirectly linked up with Roger Federer as he learned how to challenge for Grand Slams.

When Djokovic lifted his first major at the 2008 Australian Open, Federer already boasted double digits.

Now, Djokovic has reached 24, surpassing Federer's 20, but he has hailed the Swiss icon's importance in his development.

"Not everyone is cut out to compete at the top, and that's normal. But there are ways. Federer helped me a lot in that regard, not directly but indirectly," Djokovic told the (Ne)uspjeh Prvaka podcast.

"I observed how he planned his schedule. He helped me understand how to manage my form, when to take a break, even if I didn't want to. I also made mistakes. I didn't take a break when I should have, but most of the time, I made the right decisions."

Good morning, tennis fans!

Tennis fans know all about the challenges of maintaining a grass court. But what about the lines?

Under normal circumstances, they are spray-painted on with chalk in perfect right angles to make the 78-foot long court we all know and love — 27 feet wide at the singles sidelines and 36 feet wide including the doubles alleys. Simple enough, right? But how about doing it with a blindfold on?



That was Jakub Mensik's task in the latest Lexus ATPHead2Head challenge, when he took on host Natalie Pike in London. The contest, in which both contestants took artistic liberties, was ultimately judged by ATP supervisor Gerry Armstrong.

Find out who measured up, and who was left behind to clean the mess in the video below.

With 31 titles, two Wimbledon trophies and six Fed Cup crowns, Petra Kvitova has built one of the most durable careers of her era. Now, after returning from maternity leave, she's confirmed this season will be her last.

For nearly two decades, Petra Kvitova has been a steady presence near the top of women's tennis, winning often, winning big and rarely drawing attention to herself while doing it. A two-time Wimbledon champion and the winner of 31 titles and more than 600 matches, she also spent 27 weeks ranked No. 2 in the world.

She's long stood as one of the game's most respected and formidable competitors. Now, she's begun the final stretch. After returning to competition this season following a 15-month maternity leave, Kvitova announced her intention to retire at the end of the 2025 season. She will play Wimbledon one final time, and plans to close out her career at the US Open later this summer.

"While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment!" Kvitova wrote in a statement Thursday. "I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face -- the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career.

"Through all these years, I am so incredibly thankful for the unwavering support of my family, my closest friends, my team, and all the incredible fans that have always supported me around the world over all these years.

One Czech lefty legend on another: Navratilova's tribute to Kvitova

Her comeback began in Austin, Texas back in February, where she was joined by her husband and coach, Jiri Vanek, and their seven-month-old son, Petr.

“I don't expect anything, basically,” Kvitova said at the time in Austin. “I'm here, that's already a big deal for me. Sometimes I'm really surprised by myself. Like, why I [came back]. But I think I would have regretted it if I didn't come back.”

Since returning, Kvitova is 1–6, with her lone win coming in the first round of Rome. She's traveling selectively and planning her schedule around family. Kvitova has accepted her best tennis may be behind her.

"I could not have asked or wished for anything more," Kvitova wrote. "Tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love."

Until then, her focus now is on the grass-court season -- the surface where she first made her name -- and closing out her career in a way that feels right. What she's already left behind, though, is a quietly dominant and enduring resume. Here are a few of the moments that defined it:

At just 21 years old, Kvitova won her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, defeating Maria Sharapova 6–3, 6–4 in the final. She became the first player born in the 1990s to win a major. Her ability to take time away from opponents with flat, early strikes set the tone not only for that match, but for the rest of her career.

That same year, Kvitova swept through the WTA Finals in her first appearance, winning all five of her matches, including a straight-sets victory over Victoria Azarenka in the final. It was the clearest statement that her Wimbledon title had not been a one-off, and that she belonged at the top of the sport.

Three years after her first Wimbledon title, Kvitova returned to the final and delivered one of the most dominant performances the tournament has seen in a championship match. She defeated Eugenie Bouchard 6–3, 6–0 in just 55 minutes, winning 82% of her first-serve points and losing only seven points on serve in the entire match. It was a display of precision and authority, sharp angles, clean winners and no let-up from the opening game to the last.

From 2011 to 2018, Kvitova helped lead the Czech Republic to six Fed Cup titles, serving as a dependable anchor in both performance and team culture. She posted a 30–10 singles record across 21 ties, often playing in high-stakes rubbers and setting the tone for one of the most dominant national runs in recent memory.

Despite often calling clay her least favorite surface, Kvitova found consistent success in Madrid's altitude-friendly conditions, winning the title three times -- in 2011, 2015 and 2018. No other woman had won the trophy there more often, until current World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka matched her with a third title earlier this year. In total, Kvitova captured nine career WTA 1000 titles.

Kvitova's 30th career title came at the Miami Open, where she beat Elena Rybakina in a tight high-level final to capture her first WTA 1000 title since 2018. It was a late-career milestone and a reminder that, even in her 30s, she could still hold her own against the game's best. She added one more title later that summer in Berlin, a straight-sets win over Donna Vekic on grass, bringing her career total to 31.

With 31 titles, two Wimbledon trophies and six Fed Cup crowns, Petra Kvitova has built one of the most durable careers of her era. Now, after returning from maternity leave, she's confirmed this season will be her last.

Andy Murray may not be swinging a racquet this week, but his legacy is present at the HSBC Championships in London. In a fitting tribute to the former World No. 1, the centre court at the historic Queen's Club has officially been renamed the Andy Murray Arena.

Murray made his debut at Queen's Club in 2005 and went on to etch his name in the history books by lifting the trophy a record five times. On two of those occasions, 2013 and 2016, he carried that momentum all the way to Wimbledon glory.

No one has had a closer seat to that journey than his brother, Jamie Murray, a 34-time tour-level doubles title and now the tournament director of the ATP 500 event. Jamie sat down with ATPTour.com in London to reflect on Andy's Queen's Club career.

“My biggest memory of Andy here was when he played [Thomas] Johansson. He cramped up, fell down, did that sort of swan dive thing. I remember sitting in the crowd behind the court, being genuinely concerned because I'd never seen that happen before,” Jamie recalled. “I also remember him beating [Milos] Raonic in the final one year. He probably shouldn't have won that, but he did, he often found a way.

“It's obviously been a successful tournament for him. He loved playing here. He really enjoyed grass and the crowd always gave him great support. It was also important for building confidence and getting matches after [Roland Garros], with the quick turnaround. He always seemed to find his footing on grass better than most.”



Alongside his singles exploits, Murray teamed with brother Jamie on two occasions in west London. The Scots defeated Scott Lipsky and Sam Querrey en route to the second round in 2010 before they lost their opening match in 2011.

“I remember one year we played on Centre Court on a Monday evening.  I remember we won a round and that was fun. I remember losing on Court 1 to Mardy Fish and Mark Knowles and then one year we got pumped by Ken Skupski and Xavier Malisse.”

Jamie is still very much active on Tour, highlighted by his semi-final showing at the ATP 500 event in Dubai alongside John Peers. This week, though, the 39-year-old is taking a break from the match court to run proceedings as Tournament Director.

“I still enjoy playing and competing. The tournaments keep getting better each year, better infrastructure, player services, overall experience,” Murray said. “We're looked after well and go to nice events, so my motivation's still there. As long as I'm enjoying it and my ranking's good enough to play these events, I'll keep going.

“Last year [being tournament director] was weird, suddenly showing up in a suit after spending 30 weeks a year with the same guys. Now I feel like I blend in more. I'll still have to wear a suit at some point this week, but I enjoy it.

“At Queen's, we try to say yes to players. If they need extra badges, tickets, we sort them. They've got food all week, so no stress about access. There's less stress in general. It's a smaller draw, lots of practice courts, and of course, it's grass, a short season. Players want to get in as many matches as possible.”

The HSBC Championships began on Monday, with the final on Sunday at 2p.m. BST. The grass-court event has been recognised as the ATP 500 Tournament of the Year for three consecutive years.

Legendary tennis player John McEnroe favoured Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner to come out on top in a hypothetical scenario against Rafael Nadal at the French Open. However, McEnroe's claim was bluntly rejected by Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

The 2025 Roland-Garros final was a long battle between Alcaraz and the Italian tennis sensation. Sinner came into the final after winning two major titles, the US Open 2024 and the Australian Open 2025. Alcaraz, on the other hand, was a long-time favourite who was looking to defend his Roland-Garros championship. While Alcaraz dropped the first two sets, he came back to beat Sinner 4-6,6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), and 7-6(2). Alcaraz won the French Open for the second time.

Mouratoglou rejected McEnroe's claim and shared why Nadal, who has won 14 French Open titles, will forever be at the top.

Rafael Nadal won his first Roland-Garros in his tournament debut at 19 and claimed his last win in 2022 at 36 years old.

Rafael Nadal shared a heartwarming message for fellow tennis player Richard Gasquet through an Instagram post.

After playing on the clay court of the French Open for 20 years, Nadal was honoured by the Roland-Garros at the 2025 French Open.

Andy Murray has hinted at a frosty split with Novak Djokovic as the tennis legend was asked about his brief spell coaching the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

Murray, who retired after the Olympic Games in Paris last year, was a shock appointment by Djokovic in November.

He worked with Djokovic through the Australian Open, where the Serbian star reached the semi-finals before being forced to retire injured against Alexander Zverev.

The 38-year-old, however, struggled for wins on the ATP tour under Murray's coaching and a split was announced in May.

Murray was asked about the experience as he began a four date theatre tour, which started at the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow on Wednesday.

‘We had a chat on the phone and he asked me if I would consider coaching him, which I wasn't expecting,' Murray said, as per The Times.

‘I think it was a pretty unique opportunity.

‘I was really enjoying being at home but I thought I should give it a go and see whether I enjoyed it.'

Murray reportedly paused before adding: 'I'm not sure if I did.'

The comment may have been another wry joke from Murray, who had broken the ice with his former on-court rival when they reunited for Rafael Nadal's farewell at the French Open.

Djokovic had revealed how Murray had congratulated him after winning the Geneva Open just days after their split.

‘He did congratulate me, and he said, Now that you have a proper coach, you're winning tournaments,' Djokovic said.

‘Of course he was joking, but, I think I have said enough but I will say it again: Andy is just an amazing person.

‘For him to join my team and for us to give a shot to this player/coach relationship was really an incredible thing for tennis and for both of us. I was very privileged and honoured. 

'I was enjoying myself very much regardless of the fact that we haven't had maybe the success we both wanted or people expected us to have.'

Despite his short time in Djokovic's camp, Murray revealed earlier this month he expects to coach again in the future.

'I would do it again at some stage, I don't think that will happen immediately,' Murray told the BBC.

'You also learn a lot about how to work with a team. As an individual athlete, you have a team of people around you, but you're the focal point whereas when you're coaching an individual, you're working with a physio, physical trainers, agents, and you need to know how to get your message across to the player and find out what makes them tick.

'That was the thing I learned and something I need to work on if I want to do it again in the future.

'It was a brilliant opportunity for me. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court. Results weren't as we wanted but we gave it a go.

'We'll see about coaching in the future but I don't think that will happen for a while.'

Naomi Broady has been keen to quash one story about the Queen's Club Championships which has proved plenty of people wrong.

Offering a round-up of the women's event earlier this week, the former world number 76 was delighted by their return to these grounds after nearly 40 years.

It marked a landmark moment for the event, who did take a risk in expanding it out over two weeks.

Arguably the biggest fear that arose from these plans was how the grass courts might have held up, especially heading into the latter stages of the second week during the men's tournament.

However, Broady has emerged to assuage those fears.

She sought to dispel this rumour though, speaking on Tennis Channel, instead suggesting that the women's tournament has only added to the preceding men's event.

Broady claimed: ‘It's not and actually I think a lot of people were maybe expecting the men to say that they weren't happy about it, but I can report back that they don't mind at all. In fact, they're quite pleased about it. 

‘We heard Dan Evans say earlier this week how, yes, and he was just saying how he really preferred the atmosphere. There was a real buzz around the tennis. Normally, when the men arrive here, the public aren't allowed in, so, it's a members' club. 

‘So he said for sort of the women's quarterfinals, semifinals and finals day, there was a real buzz around the centre, because so many people were here on grounds passes or with the centre court tickets to watch the women, so they pop out and watch the men warm up and get their practices in too. 

‘And also, they're actually preferring how the courts are playing, the baselines, which are usually really slippery the first few days of grass court tennis have already been worn in nicely. 

‘So whilst they're not kind of down to the dirt yet, they're not muddy, that top, fresh, slippery layer has been taken off, so the men are really happy to be here, in the atmosphere the women have brought in, and last week was a really successful tournament.'

Laura Robson even admitted she was surprised at how well the Queen's courts have held up.

Amidst growing claims that the grass-court season should have a Masters 1000 event, Queen's is doing a phenomenal job of reinforcing that case.

After all, adding the WTA to its roster only solidifies the stature of the tournament, proving that a two-week festival of tennis is more than possible without the standard of the surface deteriorating.

Already many saw Queen's as one of the best events on the entire calendar, with it routinely being voted as the best ATP 500-level event.

But with this year's addition of the women too, it only goes from strength to strength.

If people and players continue to lobby for a grass-court Masters tournament, surely this London-based one will be top of the list for a well-earned upgrade.

Tennis ace Sebastian Korda has released a statement after pulling out of Wimbledon. The American, who hails from a mega-successful sporting family, is ranked 26th in the world and once dubbed himself one of the “favourites” for the Wimbledon title despite only having two ATP Tour titles to his name.

But it was announced on Tuesday that the former Australian Open quarter-finalist won't be competing at this year's championship, having picked up an injury during a recent French Open clash against Frances Tiafoe. He managed to complete the match against his countryman, despite losing all three sets and has since taken to social media to issue an update on his situation.

Posting on Instagram, the tennis star said: “Unfortunately no Wimbledon for me this year. Stress fracture in my shin during the clay. Been a tough 12 months, but better days ahead.”

It means Korda will have to wait at least another year to fulfil his self-prophesied Wimbledon destiny, having previously claimed he was in contention for the title. Speaking back in 2023, Korda said: "I'm very confident in myself on a grass court. I move really well, I definitely have a game that not very many people have. I'm an aggressive player, like to come to the net, I have good hands. I definitely feel as if I'm one of the favourites at Wimbledon."

Korda struggled to make an impact at Wimbledon that year, losing his opening match against Jiri Vesely. Things didn't go any better for him last year, with Korda once again dumped out in the first round, this time losing to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

It means he's still waiting for that sweet taste of success, something his immediate family members know all too well about. The tennis star's dad is a former Grand Slam champion, with Petr Korda winning the 1998 Australian Open.

His mother, Regina, was also a tennis player, although she didn't achieve such success on a Grand Slam stage. Whereas his two sisters, Nelly and Jessica, are both professional golf players.

Such is the sporting ability in the Korda household that Sebastian has previously joked that he's the “worst athlete in the family.” Speaking earlier this year, he said: “I love playing in Australia, as does my family. My dad won the Australian Open 25 years ago, and my sister won the Australian Open in women's golf!

“I don't know what I'm going to be ranked [after victory], but my mum's career high was 26, my dad was two, my sister Nelly was No. 1, my elder sister Jessica was six... so I'm definitely the worst athlete in the family so far!"

Days go by and in the minds of many tennis fans, that historic final at Roland Garros between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner still lingers. The Spaniard saved three match points and came back from two sets down to claim his second Roland Garros title, his fifth Grand Slam, leaving behind one of the best finals in recent years. While all the joy was taken by the Murcian, sadness and pain fell on the side of the Italian and his team. The image of Alcaraz, celebrating with tears of emotion with his group contrasts with that of Sinner, standing lost and on the verge of tears on the bench. But that's tennis, and that's life.

It wasn't just the world number one who suffered a hard blow but also his team, among whom was Darren Cahill, his coach alongside Simone Vagnozzi. The Australian revealed on Andy Roddick's podcast how the moments after the final in Paris were experienced: "The disappointment was immense, absolute silence. Jannik sat for twenty minutes without saying a word, and each of us hugged him. As a coach, I couldn't ask for more. It was a brilliant and serious tennis match, with great respect between the two players. It was a true honor to be there," he stated in remarks published by Ubitennis.

Cahill delved into the feeling of disappointment that his pupil was experiencing and confessed that a defeat like that takes time to heal but can also be of help: "There was nothing to say. After all he had given on the court, it was right to leave him alone with his thoughts. He shed some tears, not just him. It was tough on everyone. I must say that even hours later, he still hadn't processed it, and he never will. You carry a match like that with you throughout your entire career, but it can become a turning point," he expressed.

Proud of how his player fought until the end

Both he and the rest of the team are very proud of the level shown by the world number one, who was a machine in the first two sets, and despite not converting the three match points, he didn't give up and stayed engaged in the match until the end: "After Roland Garros, I felt very proud of him. The entire team was incredibly proud, not only of how he played but also of how he conducted himself, how he fought in the deciding set. Even in the way he spoke after the match, he showed incredible maturity," Cahill mentioned.

But the defense of his player didn't end there: "Jannik has an incredible work ethic, great resilience in moments of pressure, and knows how to handle it. He always keeps calm on the court. He's a problem solver and likes to ask many questions. He's very curious about how he can improve, what he needs to grow, and isn't afraid to take risks. I think his awareness is truly special and is a fundamental quality for a great tennis player. He keeps his feet on the ground, knows who he is as a person, and is very humble. He doesn't get too excited after a win and accepts losses with great respect. His maturity is impressive, Italy is very lucky to have him!," he asserted.

Additionally, the Australian had no doubt that Sinner would turn the page and praised his ability to bounce back from defeats: "He has a great self-awareness. He understands the importance of a tennis match, knows that you have to face victories and defeats more or less the same way. And he does it well. He has an amazing work ethic, resilience, a well-defined purpose. He loves tennis, plans to play until he's 37-38 years old. He has a different perspective: he knows his career could last a long time and invests accordingly. And that resilience, after Paris, will be tested; it doesn't matter if he wins or loses in the upcoming tournaments: the key will be how he reacts, how he keeps pushing forward," Cahill remarked.

The former coach of Andre Agassi believes that the Italian will use the pain of the defeat against Alcaraz to turn it into strength and motivation: "I think it will help us improve. We will try to use that disappointment to take a step forward. Jannik has already started over. The next day, he had already changed his attitude. Of course, he hasn't forgotten it, and he won't: he has moved past it. He has a great ability to assign the right importance to everything and understands the value of a match compared to real life. There are much more important things that have happened and will happen than winning or losing a tennis match,” Cahill concluded.

It is worth mentioning that, despite the great level displayed in Rome and Paris, Sinner is coming off a three-month break due to the suspension agreement for his positive test for clostebol. His return on clay, his least favorite surface, and the lack of competition rhythm made Cahill and the rest of the team believe that getting back into the circuit would be much slower and gradual than expected: "In the initial training sessions before Rome, we weren't so optimistic. We thought: 'let's hope he wins at least a couple of matches'. Instead, he made it to the final. One of the amazing things about Jannik is that he always surprises us. By now, it has become the norm. He has accustomed us to it.”

He also disclosed the difficulties they faced in training during the suspension, which started on February 4th and ended on May 4th. "Finding courts and training partners during the suspension was very challenging. Everything had to be approved by the ITIA. In the end, we trained on a clay court provided by a sponsor, near Monte Carlo, but at that time, tennis was nearly secondary. The priority was physical preparation,” he explained.

During the interview with Roddick, one of the topics that worries Sinner the most was also addressed: Cahill's continuity. The Australian confirmed earlier this year that this would be his last season, but despite rumors placing Carlos Moyà in the world number one's team for the next season, the Italian persists, both publicly and privately, for his coach to continue. Cahill is leaving the door open to continue.

"He has 'persisted' quite a bit, let's say, but I enjoy it too much. This year I will turn 60. At the end of 2025, I may retire; we talked about it, he mentioned it by mistake in a press conference in Melbourne. If I retire, it will be for his own good. Sometimes, having a fresh voice, new energy, can be good. I think a new coach wouldn't hurt him, so the plan is still to part ways at the end of the year; we still have many months ahead, we'll see...,” Cahill concluded, who is now less certain about quitting coaching Sinner, who, along with Alcaraz, will feature in many finals like those of Roland Garros.

When Jodie Burrage arrived at Wimbledon in 2022, it seems unlikely that she expected to heroically provide some medical assistance.

The Brit was making her second appearance at the All England Club following her debut outing a year beforehand.

Burrage entered as one of seven wildcards alongside the legendary Serena Williams, a seven-time champion at Wimbledon.

A first round match against Ukrainian star Lesia Tsurenko awaited on Court 18 as the 135th edition of the tournament got underway.

Tsurenko won the first set 6-2 and started strongly in the second by leading 15-0 during her opponent's serve.

Burrage had the ball in hand ahead of her second serve but wasn't quick to resume the action in search of a comeback.

One of the ball boys positioned behind her didn't appear to feel too well and had to sit down on a nearby chair.

Whilst Tsurenko remained on the other side of the court, Burrage rushed over to the bottom of the umpire's chair for a sports drink.

She then grabbed something from her bag, which later appeared to be an energy gel that's commonly used by tennis players.

A tournament official seemingly explained the delay to Tsurenko as the ball boy remained sat and drank from the bottle given to him.

Soon enough, a member of the crowd also jumped to his aid with a bag of the popular Percy Pigs from Marks & Spencer.

Burrage held the packet open in her hand and offered them to the poorly ball boy.

Play was paused for around ten minutes as a result of the worrying scenes in SW19.

However, Burrage and two officials helped him rise from his chair and slowly walk alongside the court before being taken out to recover.

The crowd applauded and the Percy Pigs were returned to the owner following the selfless act of kindness at Wimbledon.

Burrage went on to lose 6-2 6-3 to Tsurenko but it's a match that will be remembered for her heroism.

Speaking afterwards, she said: "He just said he was feeling really faint, he actually couldn't really even talk."

"It was quite distressing to see so we went to get some Gatorade and gel," Burrage added.

"The gel's not the nicest thing so we managed to find some Percy Pigs somewhere along the line in the crowd which he got down and started to feel better. Hopefully he's feeling better now.

"It didn't affect me too much, I actually came out and hit a great serve, probably the best serve I hit in that match after that, so if anything it helped me.

"I've fainted a few times. I actually had a panic attack once in juniors here so I've been where he is. I kind of know how he was feeling and just tried to help as much as I could."

Val Shand was in the crowd for the match and gave a glowing review of Burrage's response to the ball boy falling ill.

"He was either too hot or he hadn't had enough to eat, he just looked like he needed sugar or water," she told the PA news agency.

"He wobbled. Jodie Burrage was really sweet, she went and got him water and sweets. She was really good, really nice to him.

"He sat for a while looking like he was about to pass out. If I was his mum I would have been over there, but fortunately for him I wasn't. I felt for him."

Her friend Laura Middleton also said: "He was wilting and his glasses were off as well. The game just stopped. 

"It was at the end of a point and he sort of just crumbled. Tsurenko handed over some sweets or gummies for him to eat as well. It seemed a little while before somebody came to get him.

"It felt like longer because we were distressed for him, because it didn't look like he was going to get back on his feet without help."

Burrage returned to Wimbledon in 2023 and beat Caty McNally to reach the second round, but didn't not feature last year.

A campaign group fighting plans to expand the home of Wimbledon tennis has raised £200,000 for an upcoming judicial review.

Plans were approved last September for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) - which runs the world-famous tournament - to build 39 tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on protected open land on Wimbledon Park.

AELTC, which owns the land, argues its development will open up a part of the park that it says was "inaccessible to the public for almost a century" however Save Wimbledon Park has concerns around the environmental impact. 

The judicial review, set to be held early in July, is to rule on if the way the decision was made was procedurally unfair or irrational.

AELTC leased the land to a private golf club until 2018. 

The tennis club wants to build the courts on land opposite its current site so that qualifying matches for the tournament can be played there. Currently, those matches take place about three-and-a-half miles (5.6km) away at Roehampton's Community Sports Centre. 

That site can cater for about 2,000 spectators a day, whereas the new development could host up to 10,000 meaning the grounds as a whole could see up to 50,000 visitors per day.

The other three Grand Slams - the Australian, French, and US Opens - all hold qualifying matches on site alongside the main courts.

The development would also represent an upgrade in facilities for the players.

Debbie Jevans, chair of the AELTC, said: "We are already very tight of space. 

"We want to be able to match what other Grand Slams do to maintain Wimbledon at the pinnacle of the sport."

She added: "We always talk about history and tradition with Wimbledon but we need to evolve and embrace this area, which was a private golf course, and deliver economic benefits both locally and nationally."

Plans to expand the site were first put forward in December 2018, when the AELTC – which already owned the land – paid £65m to buy out the remainder of Wimbledon Park Golf Club's lease which had been set to run until 2041.

In 2021, a planning application for the scheme was sent to both Merton and Wandsworth councils. It was refused by Wandsworth but accepted by Merton.

The case then went to the Greater London Authority (GLA), which approved it last September.

"We have massive public support, who really want us to fight this," said Christopher Coombe from Save Wimbledon Park.

"The Supreme Court has now made it clear that local authorities need to look after public land like this and do the right thing, in the right way. Merton failed to do that."

He added: "We all love the tennis. They do a great job across the road - they don't need to be here as well. We have had 22,000 petitioners, 1,100 separate donations to our fighting fund and serious local support from all the councillors and the MPs."

But Ms Jevans said she was confident with the plans it put to the GLA. 

"When the court assesses them, they'll be able to see the due diligence we've gone through," she said. 

AELTC said it recently conducted a survey of about 10,000 residents in Merton and Wandsworth which found support had increased from 50% to 62% in the last six months.

It said the strongest support was among residents aged under 44, with 74% in this group in favour of the plans. The strongest reasons cited for supporting the project was its "commitment to protecting and enhancing local green spaces", it added. 

 "The environmental impact is to the benefit, the biodiversity gain is 10%," she said. 

But many are concerned the project would cause an increase in flood risk as well as the loss of wildlife, trees and open spaces.

"If the plans go through, there is still the possibility this entire 73 acres would be dug up to a depth between one and nine metres, 300 trees would be felled, 500 further trees uprooted, releasing 500,000kg of carbon into the atmosphere," said Susan Cusack from Save Wimbledon Park.

"Every single grass tennis court takes 105 tonnes of concrete and eight millimeters of heavily pesticised grass on top. It's about 5% organic material, so the only "green" thing about a tennis court is the colour."

Simon Wright, also a member of Save Wimbledon Park, said: "We are looking at about 44,000 lorry movements over eight to 10 years. The results on air quality are going to be disastrous. 

"We've already done the work that shows the routes the lorries will take will be going past primary schools and nurseries at a time when we are much more aware of how air pollution affects young lungs."

But Ms Jevans said that they would be "bringing a lot of the equipment necessary on site, so there is less back and forth - there are more 493 buses going up and down the road than there will be lorries."

The AELTC made a covenant - a formal agreement - when they bought the land in Wimbledon Park in 1993 that they would not build on it.

Ms Jevans insists that covenant should not prevent their planned development.

"A covenant is fundamentally to protect the public interest and what we are now doing is very much in the public interest," said Ms Jevans. 

"We are able to demonstrate ably the benefits to the community and environment in repurposing the land."

Mr Wright disagrees.

"This case has huge significance. AELTC are trying to build on Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), that is the same as green belt. 

"If they are allowed to build, that sets a really bad precedent for the other 50 MOL sites in the London area."

Mr Wright added he had further concerns regarding the use of the park.

"AELTC are talking about creating a new park, but the majority of this land is going to be permissive access. It will only be open when AELTC permit it to be open.

"This is the only Grand Slam which is run by a private members' club. There is no public scrutiny, there is no governance. We think it's wrong that a private members' club is allowed to have such a negative effect on so many people's lives for two weeks a year."

Responding, Ms Jevans said: "Most of the park will be open in perpetuity to the public.

"There will be no hotel, no railway station, just a 23-acre public park."

She added: "I don't dismiss people's concerns and respect their point of view. I want to ensure the basis of their concerns is based on facts."

Aside from the judicial review, a separate court case is scheduled for January which will determine whether the land is protected by a statutory trust for public recreation.

The court action has been brought by AELTC which believes no such protection exists.

If the court finds against them it's unlikely they could proceed with their current plans.

Local news:

Australian Open champion Jan Zielinski has hit out at the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tournament after the initial entry list was revealed this week.

The tournament unveiled the new short-form event, that features nearly every top-10 male and female players.

Men's No.1 Jannik Sinner has paired with American women's world No.9 Emma Navarro and men's No.2 Carlos Alcaraz with former US Open winner Emma Raducanu. Women's No.1 Aryna Sabalenka has linked up with men's No.19 Grigor Dimitrov.

Nick Kyrgios has also been tempted by the controversial format, signing up with two-time singles champion Naomi Osaka.

Men's No.9 Holger Rune and women's No.2 Coco Gauff are the current top-10 players not to have entered so far, nor have Australian No.1s Alex de Minaur and Daria Kasatkina — the entry window closes on July 28.

Sixteen teams have signed up, with the top eight with the best combined singles ranking guaranteed a place along with eight wildcard entries.

But while all the big stars are seemingly confirmed to play, regular doubles players are set to miss out.

Polish doubles specialist Zielinski, who last year won the Australian Open and Wimbledon with Hsieh Su-wei, was left fuming after not getting an invite.

“I guess winning two grand slams in mixed doubles in one year is not enough to get an invitation to US Open ‘exhibition' event,” he tweeted.

“Thanks for taking away the opportunity to compete and making it fair to everyone.”

The revamped format was previously criticised by Australian doubles star Ellen Perez and defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, who have entered but will need a wildcard given their singles rankings.

“Tell us that you think doubles players are trash, that tradition is overrated and job opportunity is a thing of the past without actually saying it,” Perez, a players' council representative, posted on X at the time of announcement.

Errani and Vavassori said the changes were a “profound injustice” that disrespects doubles players, describing the new event as a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show”.

“Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,” they added.

The attraction for many singles players is the shortened format and the timing, the event being played in the “Fan Week” before the main draw.

Most matches will be best-of-three sets played to four games instead of six, with a deciding point played at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-4, while a first-to-10-points match tiebreaker would replace a third set.

The final would be played to six games but still with no-advantage scoring and a 10-point match tiebreaker.

This format, the selection criteria and the clash with singles qualifying, are reasons why established doubles players were unhappy.

“Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” US Tennis Association CEO Lew Sherr said.

“It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”

Wake Forest's Stefan Dostanic and Stanford's Valerie Glozman capped their standout NCAA tennis seasons by earning 2025 US Open wild cards Wednesday at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Fla. By winning the American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs without dropping a set in men's and women's singles, respectively, both champions booked their Grand Slam debuts in the New York main draw.

 

Graduate transfer Dostanic, the top seed in the men's singles playoff as the world No. 404, capped his college career by beating Michigan State's Ozan Baris and Columbia's Michael Zheng, the reigning NCAA singles champion, in the four-player shootout. World No. 944 Glozman, who just finished her freshman year, was seeded fourth and battled past UC Santa Barbara's Amelia Honer and Texas A&M's Mary Stoiana.

 

Zheng and Stoiana are also headed to New York, with the finalists receiving US Open qualifying wild cards for their efforts in Lake Nona.

For Dostanic, who won the NCAA team title with Wake Forest last month, the US Open wild card brings a close to what he called a "roller coaster college career" that began in 2019 at USC.

 

"It feels surreal," the 23-year-old said, looking ahead to his US Open debut. "This is definitely a dream and goal of mine I've had for a long time. Everyone wants to play in the US Open as an American. To go through college and to get a wild card, I couldn't be more thrilled and thankful to the USTA."

 

After a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Baris in Monday's opening round, Dostanic punched his ticket to New York with a 6-1, 6-4 win against Zheng on Wednesday. Two weeks earlier, Dostanic beat Zheng, 7-6(3), 6-4, at an USTA Pro Circuit and ATP Challenger Tour event in Tyler, Texas.

 

After navigating the drama of the playoff format, the California native hopes the experience will help him on the major stage.

"It was nerve-wracking for sure," he said. "It's high-pressure situations and I think it's great preparation for the US Open. A lot of people are going to be watching, so [I'm] getting used to it a little bit. I think I handled the pressure pretty well and had a great time at this event."

 

Glozman has already experienced the US Open Qualifying Tournament three times, reaching the second round each of the past three years dating back to when she was 15. Having turned 18 in November, the Stanford star can finally look forward to the main event.

 

"I'm super excited," she said. "I've always wanted to experience the main draw, so I've really pushed myself this week and the weeks leading up to this for training, as soon as I heard I was selected [for the playoffs]. I'm really grateful that the hard work paid off."

Glozman followed a 6-1, 6-2 win over Honer with a 7-6(8), 6-3 result against Stoiana in Wednesday's final. In a nearly three-hour battle of attrition, the drama peaked in the opening-set tiebreak when Glozman saved a set point with a brilliant lob at 6-7. After breaking new Grand Slam ground with her victory, she credited her past US Open experiences with helping her build her game over the years.

 

"The level is super high at the US Open, so I have to put it all out there and it really pushes me to the next level," explained the 5-foot-4 product of Bellevue, Wash. "It exposes a lot of my weaknesses, so I'm able to work on them in practice, and now that I'm in college, work on them throughout the season."

 

Glozman was an NCAA singles quarterfinalist in the fall and received ITA All-American and ACC Freshman of the Year honors for her freshman season at Stanford. Dostanic, who did not play college tennis in the fall, was named Most Outstanding Player at the 2025 NCAA team tournament after going a perfect 5-0 at No. 1 singles to help Wake Forest claim its second Division I title.

The American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs will conclude Thursday with the men's and women's doubles finals. For more information, visit the event's homepage on the USTA National Campus website.

Coco Gauff is a superstar in every sense of the word, and she has taken tennis to new heights with her play and off-court endeavors. The American has lived up to the enormous expectations placed on her as a teenager and continues to conduct herself with class and elegance in every setting. It all started with family, as her parents Corey and Candi Gauff instilled the key ingredients to becoming a good person in their daughter long before she picked up a tennis racquet.The patriarch of the family joined Tennis Channel 2's “Second Serve” program on the heels of his daughter's Roland Garros championship, which was a signature moment in career that's just getting started.Gauff was very candid about his team's work to bring out the best in his oldest child, and why the best really is yet to come.

Gauff was very candid about his team's work to bring out the best in his oldest child, and why the best really is yet to come.

Despite his background as his daughter's coach, Corey Gauff is a dad first, and a nervous one at that. He has a very difficult time staying in his seat during Coco's matches, and the Roland Garros final was no different.Read more: Coco Gauff battles past Aryna Sabalenka to win first Roland Garros title, second Grand Slam crown“I kind of parked in the transportation area and I watched on my iPad,” he explained with a sheepish grin. “The first match point, I start walking to go to the box, and she lost it, and then the next point to give her [Aryna Sabalenka] a break point. So I turned around and I went back and sat in my place. I said, 'I'm not moving until it's over.'”

It had been three years since Coco Gauff first reached the Roland Garros final, and though the match did not go her way, that experience served her well the second time around. Her triumph in 2025 showcased how far the American has come as a player and person.“There was too much celebration over trying to get to the final and not complete the task. And I think the second time, certainly she was mentally stronger,” Corey Gauff explained. His daughter has built a Hall of Fame resume at age 21, but the focus for Team Gauff remains less on accolades and more on self-actualization.“We put a racquet in her hand so she could be the best version of herself she could be," he added. "If that's winning lots of Grand Slams, then so be it. But as long as you're being the best version of yourself and proud of yourself, that's what really matters.”

Relying on the experiences he and his wife had as athletes, the Gauff patriarch incorporated a system to remain committed to his daughter in any avenue that she pursued, which fortunately for the tennis world, was this game she has shined brightly in. There would be no questioning their devotion to her pursuits, but they also refused to be overbearing sports parents.If Coco was going to succeed as a tennis player, it was going to because she wanted it, not because her parents demanded it," he said.“We were going to make sure we don't have any regrets about not giving her the best possible opportunity to get the best possible training we can afford or have time for,” he said.Their focus was not on raising a tennis champion, but rather a quality person: “You've got to let them grow and develop, and emphasize being good kids.”Read more: Michelle Obama: Coco Gauff's Roland Garros win 'inspired us all'

Corey Gauff and his wife Candi are a lesson for sports parents everywhere, and the humility they have amid their daughter's excellence on the tennis court is very impressive. The patriarch of the family knows he has the best seat in the house, and understands that the journey is as exciting as any one tournament can be.On "Second Serve," Corey Gauff discussed the importance piece of advice his daughter learned from Michelle Obama, the role of doubles in her singles career, and how Coco Gauff has become more mature in making her own professional decisions. Paris was just the latest step in what's still the beginning of a long and prosperous career, and Corey Gauff knows that each day is an opportunity for his little girl to better herself as a complete individual.“I really truly feel like her best years are ahead of her," he said. "I think there's so much more she can do to grow her game and get better.”

Racing Bulls faced a challenging weekend at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Isack Hadjar ending the race in P16 while Liam Lawson was forced to retire.

Isack Hadjar saw his run of points results come to an end at the Canadian Grand Prix after finishing a difficult race down in P16, while Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson also acknowledged that it had been a “tough weekend” as he recorded a third DNF of the season.

After starting on the medium tyres from P12 on the grid – having received a three-place grid drop for impeding Williams' Carlos Sainz during Qualifying – Hadjar ran a one-stop strategy but lost further positions during the race.

A final result of 16th place meant that the Frenchman failed to score points for the first time since the Miami Grand Prix in May.

Reflecting on the struggles that affected his afternoon at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, Hadjar explained: “I think we just pitted a bit too late. We had high graining at the start of the race and we lost a few positions in the pits.

“After that it was just a DRS train and towards the end I was lacking so much pace compared to the cars around. I just got overtaken by everyone.”

When quizzed on why the weekend had seemingly been a particularly challenging one for the Racing Bulls squad, Hadjar conceded that he had not felt content with the VCARB 02 from early on in the event.

“I think since the start of the weekend, even [on Saturday] I was not happy with the car,” the 20-year-old said. “I feel like on the one lap I can kind of make a difference, but over 70 laps there's no chance.”

It was also a tricky few days in Montreal for Lawson. The New Zealander started the race from the pit lane after changes were made to his car under parc ferme conditions, including a new power unit being fitted.

However, this did not prove to be enough to move him up the order and he eventually retired on Lap 53 owing to a cooling issue.

“It's disappointing,” the 23-year-old commented. “I think obviously it was going to be a very difficult race anyway from the pit lane, but we had a cooling issue at the end so unfortunately we had to retire. It's just been a tough weekend, which is a shame.”

Like Hadjar, Lawson gave his take on why the weekend in Montreal had proven particularly tough for Racing Bulls and admitted that the squad now need to regroup.

“[It] was a pretty specific thing we struggled with in Qualifying, but the pace of the car was actually quite good,” said Lawson.

“And then obviously what happened in the race today is a little bit out of our control, so it's a shame but obviously we've just got to keep resetting and looking ahead.”

The team will now set to preparing for the upcoming double header of Austria and Great Britain, with the former kicking things off at the Red Bull Ring on June 27-29.

Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur explains what went wrong for the Scuderia in Montreal.

Fred Vasseur believes Ferrari “failed massively” in Canada after failing to execute a clean weekend, despite his drivers both finishing in the points in Montreal.

Charles Leclerc came home fifth and Lewis Hamilton sixth, both inheriting a position thanks to the late retirement of Lando Norris. But Ferrari were not on the pace of Mercedes, Red Bull or McLaren – and that wasn't purely down to the car.

Leclerc crashed on Friday in Free Practice 1, which cost him the entirety of FP2 as well.

There were also question marks over the tyre strategy in Qualifying, with Ferrari focusing on using the C6 soft while Mercedes and Red Bull used the medium to good effect. Those questions intensified during the race, with Leclerc querying the decision to put him onto a two-stop strategy.

And Ferrari's cause was not helped by Hamilton picking up floor damage after hitting an animal.

“I think we made too many mistakes collectively from the beginning with the crash in FP1, with the mistake in Quali, with the marmot in the race,” Vasseur explained.

"And at the end the fight is so tight – I'm not speaking about lap time or race time, I'm speaking about that you can change the position for almost nothing from one weekend to another one.

“It's a good lesson also from Mercedes. They were nowhere the last three weekends and they were able to have the two cars on the podium this weekend.

“I'm not sure that they changed completely the car, it's more that from the beginning of the weekend, from Lap 1 on Friday morning, they were there, they did a good job in the preparation and so on. And honestly this weekend, for different reasons, the focus was not always there [for us].”

Vasseur added that, with the margins so small in 2025, executing the perfect weekend matters almost more than car set-up or any upgrades a team might bring.

“Honestly, I'm not sure that the characteristic of the car is the main issue today. The main issue is to do a good usage of the tyres first, and to understand the tyres and to choose the good ones for the Quali, and the exercise is quite difficult.

“I think today that Max [Verstappen] and Mercedes did a better job on the weekend than McLaren and us, but they were also into the choice of the tyres probably from the beginning of the weekend, and this you have to commit from Friday morning almost.

“Even before the weekend, you have to put everything together in the right place if you want to achieve a good result today, because in the tyre usage and the tyre performance, or what performance you get from the tyres, I think there is much more than between the cars.

“It doesn't matter the car, if the team is doing a very good job on the tyres, they will be in front. It's true this weekend, it was true in Monaco, it was true in Imola, and it is like it is, and it will be like this until the end of the season. But it's the same for everybody, we have to do a better job.”

Vasseur hinted that Ferrari would have some small upgrades in Austria – but was keen to stress that sharpening up the operation across the whole weekend would have far bigger an impact than any upgrades.

“If we want to achieve, if we want to start from the first rows and to have a clean weekend as [in] Monaco, we need to do a very smooth weekend in terms of execution, and it's where we failed massively in Canada,” he concluded.

Ferrari have slipped back to third in the Teams' Championship, 16 points behind Mercedes.

It was a tough day for Alpine at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Franco Colapinto slipping backwards from P10 while Pierre Gasly remained out of contention for points.

Franco Colapinto was left to rue a “wrong” strategy after slipping backwards and out of the points at the Canadian Grand Prix, while Alpine team mate Pierre Gasly also conceded that the team “need to review” following a tough afternoon in Montreal.

Things had initially looked promising for Colapinto, who lined up in P10 on the grid after outqualifying Gasly for the first time since making his F1 comeback. However, after losing a position early on to Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, the Argentine later lost out further when he found himself in traffic following his first pit stop.

It proved to be a difficult race from then onwards for Colapinto and he ultimately crossed the line in 13th, having been unable to work his way back up into the top 10.

“I think we maximised what we've done today. It just didn't go our way, I think, strategy-wise,” the 22-year-old reflected after the race. “It was tricky to know [if] we were doing the wrong thing, but I think we definitely were doing the wrong stuff.

“At the beginning of the race, stopping early with so many cars starting on [the] hard [tyre], and the team mates of the guys in front making the race slow for them – it just put us in a really bad position, killing the tyres.

“I had really slow pace after that pit stop with the dirty air and [it was] very tricky to overtake, just power [limited] on the straights and it just made our race very tricky. We went a bit backwards.

“It was tough out there today, I think still [there were] some things learned and some things to take, but we need to focus on the next one.”

Despite the disappointing outcome, Colapinto acknowledged that the weekend as a whole had felt like his strongest since making his return to the grid with Alpine in Imola.

“Yeah, it feels like that,” he explained. “It's just that when you start in the points you want to stay there, and it feels like we didn't do the right things today to try and stay [there], and that's the only thing.”

It was also a challenging day at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for Gasly. The Frenchman had it all to do after starting from the pit lane – due to changes being made to his car under parc ferme conditions – and a one-stop strategy failed to move him closer towards the points, meaning that he ended the race in P15.

“We tried with the strategy – to be fair, we tried everything we could,” Gasly admitted. “[We were] just very slow in the straights, so we need to review exactly what we could have done better.

“I think we had some pace, it's just been a very frustrating afternoon, being stuck behind cars, and unfortunately we're just slower than them in the straights and it made it very, very tricky to pass, so we'll review it.”

Gasly's tricky afternoon also saw him forced wide onto the grass by Lance Stroll during a battle for P17, an incident that resulted in the Aston Martin driver receiving a 10-second time penalty.

Reflecting on the clash, the 29-year-old said: “We kind of got side-by-side into the last corner. I feel like he could have done a slightly better job to give me a bit more room – not talking about much, I know we're both at the limit and we're talking a few centimetres.

“But unfortunately it put me in the grass – I had to try to cut the chicane and get back on track. I think bigger picture is just [that it was] a bit of a frustrating afternoon, not being able to race.”

Yuki Tsunoda gave his honest reflections after ending the Canadian Grand Prix in P12 as he continues to get to grips with the Red Bull.

Yuki Tsunoda has admitted that he feels “a lot of pressure” amid another weekend without points in Canada, with the Japanese driver still in the process of adapting to the Red Bull following his switch to the squad earlier in the season.

Tsunoda's prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren's Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field.

The 25-year-old ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before switching to the mediums – and while he made gains from his original starting slot, Tsunoda ultimately ended the race in P12, meaning that he has gone without points for the last three races.

Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that's it.

“The pace was okay, not amazing but still not too bad. Other than that, pretty much that's it really. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there's a bit of motivation there.”

Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”.

While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself.

“[Saturday] was a tough day with the 10-place nonsense penalty,” the Red Bull driver said. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car.

“Still with our team, you want to be as high as possible, but I enjoy this challenge I guess. [In] these moments I'm having a lot of pressure, sometimes I'm not enjoying them that much but it's part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.”

Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team's home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.

You'd be hard-pressed to find an album series as well-known as Lil Wayne's Tha Carter collection. The core of the New Orleans rapper's discography, this set of albums began partway through Wayne's extensive oeuvre. As a youth, the MC was tucked under the wing of Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan “Birdman” Williams, who signed Wayne at age 12. Immediately perceived as a preteen prodigy, Wayne put in work to pull stardom toward him, instead of being swallowed by the black hole-like music industry. He achieved that feat by being relentless with his output, establishing his sound, lyrical content, and delivery across his early albums (1999's Tha Block Is Hot, 2000's Lights Out, 2002's 500 Degreez), and via mixtapes series like Sqad Up, Da Drought, and Dedication, which weaved throughout Lil Wayne's official studio projects.

In 2002, Wayne released “10,000 Bars,” a 35-minute song featuring his last written lyrics. Everything from that moment forward, including Tha Carter series, was entirely freestyled and crafted from a stream-of-consciousness state. “You could ask my boy,” Lil Wayne said in a July 2023 interview on The Pivot Podcast. “‘I heard that n***a JAY-Z don't write no more.' We went in the studio and we did ‘10,000 Bars' and that was the last time I rapped anything off of a paper.” In addition to being influenced by JAY's rhyming preference, Tha Carter series is also directly inspired by the Brooklyn MC's late '90s album run, Vol. 1-3. Similar to JAY, Weezy aimed to use his batch of albums to etch his name at the top of the list of hip-hop greats.

With his first installment, released in 2004, Lil Wayne acknowledged the work that he put into his initial solo projects and differentiated between those efforts and the journey he was about to embark on (“This Is The Carter”). Prolific producer Mannie Fresh contributed the vast majority of the beats on Tha Carter, making way for a natural sonic cohesion. The smash single “Go DJ” further established the bond between Fresh and Weezy, while igniting an excitement in rap that extended from the South across the nation. 



Lil Wayne's commitment to championing Southern MCs has been unwavering since he picked up a mic, but Tha Carter series is where he cemented his agenda. On “BM J.R.,” he raps, “You see, we grind from the bottom / Just to make it to the bottom / At the very bottom of the map.” Long aware of the glares shot toward the South by East and West Coast hip-hop purists, Weezy made it a point to represent his hometown specifically, on tracks like the prideful “On My Own.” With the Mannie Fresh-produced “Bring It Back,” Wayne continues shouting out the South, but toward the end of the song, he makes a declaration: “The best rapper alive since the best rapper retired!” Another reference to JAY-Z, Lil Wayne's main goal was to prove that you could be clever (“Ain't That A Bitch”), empathetic (“I Miss My Dawgs”), and still spit street shit (“Snitch”).

The masterful balancing act of smarts, wit, heart, and grit became Weezy's calling card throughout Tha Carter series, but the second edition is the most well-assembled project of the series, despite the embattled state of Cash Money Records. After the unceremonious departure of the Hot Boys, Wayne's groupmates, and in-house producer Mannie Fresh, Cash Money was in desperate need of a new era. Wayne stepped up to the plate as the savior of the label; what followed was one of the most successful runs in rap history, and it kicked off with 2005's Tha Carter II.

Over production handled by an assortment of producers, including New York-based duo The Heatmakerz (“Tha Mobb”), Wayne sounded settled, reserved, and assertive. But that doesn't mean he wasn't filled with creative heat, heard most clearly on the fervent mainstream hit “Fireman.” He already established “Tha Block Is Hot” in 1999, and here, Lil Wayne felt the flames building higher around him. “Money On My Mind” is the quintessential rap song of the 2000s, oozing with confidence and solidifying Wayne's hyper-focus on stacking bread by any means necessary. The chopped-and-screwed background vocals on the hook, inspired by DJ Screw of Houston, loop back around to Weezy's mission to put the South on his back. The center of the entire album series is “Hustler Musik,” a soulful rumination that clearly presents Wayne's vision: He combines the threats, the vulnerability, the charisma, the boasts, and the clarity, never once taking his hard-won status for granted.

Three years passed between Tha Carter II and III (2008), and a lot changed for Lil Wayne during that time. In 2007 alone, he featured on close to 100 songs (that is not an exaggeration) and became not only the face of Cash Money but also the hip-hop industry at large. His run was unprecedented, and it put Weezy in a league of his own. Because of his dominance and subsequent exposure, Tha Carter III sold more than a million copies in the first week alone, an achievement we may never see again in rap. “They can't stop me—even if they stopped me!” Wayne proclaimed on “3 Peat,” at the very top of the album, inviting listeners to bear witness to his earned greatness. This triumphant energy is palpable throughout the album, most especially on the swaggering “Mr. Carter,” Lil Wayne's collaboration with his longtime hip-hop hero, JAY-Z: “And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or JAY-Z / Don't forget Weezy, baby,” he rapped proudly.

﻿

From an aerial perspective, it's clear to see that Tha Carter III represents Wayne's transition from ambitious and hungry to self-assured and exploratory. The lead single, “Lollipop” (featuring the late Static Major), painted an early picture of Weezy's renewed focus. Specifically, he brought his experimental, Auto-Tuned singing to the masses, to great success. “Lollipop” became his first No. 1 hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. The following single, “A Milli,” was more true to form and connected with the streets and the underground, thanks to exemplary production from Bangladesh and unceasing, hard bars from Wayne. Elsewhere, the MC equally fleshes out his horny side (“Mrs. Officer”) and affectionate side (the Kanye West-produced “Comfortable” featuring R&B legend Babyface), and showcases his conceptual humor (“Dr. Carter”). 

To this day, Tha Carter III is Lil Wayne's commercial opus. Thematically and sonically expansive, the album broke open Lil Wayne's world and directly defied the standards of modern rap, transforming the game in the process. While this album was the anthemic arrival of a star, from 2011's Tha Carter IV on, Wayne aspired to loosen the rigid boundaries of hip-hop even further. The delicate, inexplicit, guitar-driven “How To Love” is one of the most enduring songs of Tha Carter series; featuring tender lyrics from a thoughtful Lil Wayne, the deeply affecting and enormously successful single symbolized Lil Wayne's transition from hip-hop giant to multifaceted artist.

Weezy was and still is committed to innovating outside of expectations, but on Tha Carter IV, and those that followed, his experiments far outweighed the potency of his rhymes. Even pure rap songs like “6 Foot 7 Foot” with Cory Gunz (an unabashed “A Milli” remake), and the Rick Ross collaboration “John” (cobbled together by multiple producers, despite sounding like Lex Luger's work) leave much to be desired. “She Will,” a dark and dusky collaboration with Lil Wayne's Young Money signee Drake, is a fan favorite, but in the context of the earlier installments of the series, the song feels out of place. The treacly “Mirror” featuring Bruno Mars sees Wayne assessing himself and his path, and committing to a mirror motif that he revisited in later Carter albums. 

In December 2014, between Tha Carter IV and V, Lil Wayne declared, “I am a prisoner and so is my creativity,” sharing his disappointment in Birdman's handling of V, and expressing his desire to be released from Cash Money Records after contractual disputes. Originally scheduled to be released in 2014, Tha Carter V was delayed until September 2018, when it finally dropped on Wayne's Young Money Entertainment record label after his departure from Cash Money. From that moment forward, freedom was the main motivating factor for Wayne. On songs like “Dedicate,” he acknowledged and basked in his impact. “Uproar,” produced by Swizz Beatz, is an outright party starter that's still blasted at countless sporting events around the world. The fifth edition of the series also presented itself as a family tribute: Wayne starts the album with an emotional message from his mother (“I Love You Dwayne”), and includes his daughter Reginae Carter on the dated “Famous.” 

﻿

While Lil Wayne previously set the standard in hip-hop, upping the lyrical ante for all competitors, he slipped into unfamiliar territory on Tha Carter V. Here, he chased the vibes set by his successors—sometimes on songs with those very artists (“Don't Cry” with XXXTENTACION, “Let It Fly” with Travis Scott). On “Open Letter,” he circles back to the mirror theme set on IV, but he phones in bars like, “The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit / And sometimes, I fear who in the mirror, that n***a weird.” Wayne is still Wayne, so there are highlights peppered throughout, like the prime storytelling of “Mona Lisa” with Kendrick Lamar. However, when he says, “Thank God Weezy back / Order is restored, all is right with the world,” on the Nivea-assisted “Dope New Gospel,” the declaration doesn't ring out like before.

Some of those identity crises carried over to 2025's Tha Carter VI, Lil Wayne's latest and most recent addition to the series. “Hip-Hop,” one of the more palatable songs on the album, completely lifts from featured artist and Dallas rapper BigXThaPlug's song formula of spitting over funk-fueled, sample-heavy production. Overall, Weezy uses VI to continue reveling in his freedom—that includes a questionable collaboration with Bono (“The Days”), and an indulgent reworking of Weezer's “Island in the Sun” (“Island Holiday”).

He also raps over and interpolates some of the hardest hip-hop tracks ever. “Bells” samples LL Cool J's seminal 1985 record “Rock The Bells,” and “Banned From NO” flips N.O.R.E.'s high-octane 1998 posse cut “Banned From TV.” While the foundation is solid, Wayne doesn't meet the moment and the standard set by those originals. Missteps abound in other areas, including the cacophonic, head-scratching “Peanuts 2 N Elephant” produced by Lin-Manuel Miranda.

With Tha Carter VI, Lil Wayne has officially entered the respected trailblazer era of his career: He's slugged it out this far, and though his songs no longer crackle with the fiery intensity of his early career, he's earned the right to be uninhibited and unrestricted. But after 21 years of self-discovery, Wayne has skidded to a point of complacency. He's not as consumed with defending his claim as the Best Rapper Alive, and that has led to aimless concepts, uninspired bars, and bloated projects.

Uneven as it may be, Tha Carter series is still a testament to the importance of building respect, setting boundaries (for peers, fans, labels, and family alike), and admiring one's own journey. Lil Wayne is finally fulfilling his dreams and doing exactly what he wants—for better and worse. He's not quite out to pasture, but he's no longer the prize-winning thoroughbred in the hip-hop stable.

Opinion is sharply divided as to how high the superhero pic can fly when it hits theaters, with some suggesting a much lower range of $90 million to $120 million. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	With three weeks left to go, James Gunn and DC Studios‘ Superman is tracking to open in the $135 million range at the domestic box office.


	If that forecast is right, Superman would land high up on the list of DC openings, although it would lag well behind the $166 million domestic debut of 2016's Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, it would come in safely ahead of the last solo Superman movie, Zack Snyder's 2013 film Man of Steel ($116 million).




	Opinion, however, is sharply divided as to just how high Superman can fly.

					DC Studios Horror Movie 'Clayface' to Star Tom Rhys Harries		
			









	The $135 million stat is from leading tracking service the National Research Group, according to sources with access to the data. NRG always provides a range in addition to a solo number; in this case, the range for Superman's domestic opening is $125 million to $145 million. 


	Tracking is hardly a science, and projections have been notably off in a number of instances from all the services. To that end, insiders at DC Studios and Warners are being more conservative in suggesting $90 million to $125 million (although anything less than $100 million might be seen as a blemish).


	On the opposite end of the spectrum, some box office experts who monitor social metrics speculate that Superman could open to as much as $175 million, which would supplant Batman v Superman as DC's biggest opening. As of now, the next two biggest openings belong to Christopher Nolan's final two Batman movies, 2012's The Dark Knight Rises ($160.9 million) and 2008's The Dark Knight ($158.4 million). If opening to $135 million, Gunn's Superman would take the next spot, ahead of 2022's The Batman ($134 million) and 2016's Suicide Squad ($133.7 million), unadjusted.

	











	The highly anticipated summer tentpole is a seminal moment for Gunn and Peter Safran, as it's their first homegrown release since being tasked with restoring the luster to DC and making a stab at catching up with Marvel Studios. The movie, which kicks off their DC Universe, opens July 11 in North America, timed to its release around the world, meaning DC and Warners have three weeks to make their final marketing push.


Superman stars David Corenswet in the titular role opposite Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. In this latest rendition of a story that's been told on the big screen numerous times, Superman grapples with his powers while trying to balance everyday life as journalist Clark Kent  after being sent to Earth from his home planet Krypton. (One new addition is the dog, Krytpo).


	The cast also includes Skyler Gisondo (Jimmy Olsen), Sara Sampaio (Eve Teschmacher), Edi Gathegi (Mister Terrific), Terence Rosemore (Otis), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl) and María Gabriela de Faría (The Engineer).

Despite its passionate fanbase, the Netflix series that also starred Jonathan Groff only ran for two seasons: "David [Fincher] has to be happy with scripts," says McCallany.


							By 

	Lexi Carson



	There is hope, Mindhunter fans. 


Holt McCallany, who starred in the Netflix series for two seasons alongside Jonathan Groff, recently told CBR about the long-awaited possibility of a revival and how he's spoken to the show's executive producer/director David Fincher about the series returning as possibly three films.




	“I had a meeting with David Fincher in his office a few months ago, and he said to me that there is a chance that it may come back as three two-hour movies, but I think it's just a chance,” said the Waterfront star. “I know there are writers that are working, but you know, David has to be happy with scripts.”

	He continued, “I recently wrote a script that he was kind enough to give me notes on. I was in script revisions with David for two and a half years..  but [he] was very meticulous, which is why I think he's the best director in Hollywood,” The Iron Claw star said before adding, “He gave me a little bit of hope when I had that meeting with him, but the sun, the moon and the stars would all have to align.”


Mindhunter dropped on Netflix in 2017 and 2019 and followed Bill (McCallany) and Holden (Groff) investigating the psyche of serial killers. Netflix decided not to renew the series primarily because of high production costs, according to Fincher. “It's a very expensive show, and in the eyes of Netflix, we didn't attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment” for a season three, he said in 2023. 

	











	However, six years later, the fans and its passionate fanbase have continued to ask for more.


	Previously, in 2021, Groff also told The Hollywood Reporter he would return and gushed about his love of working with Fincher. “To me, Mindhunter is Fincher. The whole experience for me was the honor and privilege of getting to work with him. This was the main draw for me,” Groff said. “The minute he says he wants to do another one, I'll be there in a second. But I trust his vision and his instincts, and so I leave it always in his hands, as ever.”

	A collection of Chinese film studios have set plans to reimagine the Kung Fu Classics in their libraries using AI technology. 


	The studios partnered with the China Film Foundation announced their plans under the Kung Fu Film Heritage Project, a large-scale plan to restore martial arts films, at the Shanghai International Film Festival. 


	The announcement was first reported on by THR and Variety. It includes the goal of remastering 100 seminal kung fu films, using AI to enhance the overall production quality of the films while preserving authenticity.

	“From Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan, from ‘Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' to ‘Wolf Warrior,' these films have shown the world the vitality and spirit of the Chinese people,” China Film Foundation chair Zhang Qilin said at the event, according to Variety. “They are our cinematic calling cards to the world.”


	Partners on the project include the China Film Foundation's Film and Urban Development Special Fund and Quantum Animation, the studio behind A Better Tomorrow: Cyber Frontier, according to THR. 


	AI remains a controversial topic among film professionals. Earlier this month, representatives of the international animation, screenwriters, and actors guilds staged a protest at the Annecy Animation Film Festival to voice their fears over the implications of generative AI for their professions.

“The Waterfront,” a new Netflix series about a family-run fishery off the North Carolina coast, officially stems from “Dawson's Creek” and “Scream” scribe Kevin Williamson, but given the first season's shallow interest in its own characters, setting, and premise — combined with its unmistakable similarities to recent TV hits — the creator credit may as well be shared with the streamer's oft-vaunted algorithm. Even if “The Waterfront” wasn't pointedly conceived to pop up after “Ozark” (and thus also prevent subscribers from a far worse fate: opening a separate streaming app to watch five seasons of “Yellowstone”), the sloppy drama would still be little more than Netflix sludge: recognizable ideas, actors, and intentions tossed together in a functional story that slowly but steadily sours into overtly redundant dreck.

So first, let's look at what “The Waterfront” so clearly aspires to be, shall we? “Ozark” begins with an enthralling sense of urgency. Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), a family man working a white-collar accounting job in Chicago, has been skimming money for years from his top client — a Mexican drug cartel — and now they've finally caught on. Exposed to a level of violence foreign to his cushy suburban life, Marty makes a desperate plea to save his own skin: He promises to launder hundreds of millions of dollars for the cartel by establishing an outpost in the Ozarks (and, as an after-thought, he also might win back the wife who wants to leave him and the kids who are already drifting away). 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Yellowstone,” meanwhile, trades in “Ozark's” urgency for an enrapturing sense of place. Instead of being forced to flee his home and start over somewhere new, John Dutton (Kevin Costner) digs in his boot heels. He, too, is a family man, and he, too, sees his loved ones slipping away. But his greatest fears are existential. He's losing his legacy: the Dutton family ranch, and writer/director Taylor Sheridan makes it easy to see what a loss that would be by framing the Yellowstone-adjacent site as America's Holy Land — rolling green pastures, gurgling blue rivers, free-roaming cattle — and Dutton as its dying steward. Despite health issues and growing financial pressure, John guards his forgotten corner of a lost way of life knowing full well it could cost him his own.

“The Waterfront” features many of these facets, but it takes our investment for granted. Unlike “Ozark,” the story starts with minimum urgency. A drug hand-off goes bad, when a couple of nameless sailors get robbed, beaten up, and thrown overboard while waiting to unload a few dozen crates of cocaine. Turns out the deceased were working for Cane Buckley (Jake Weary), the heir apparent to the Buckley family fishing operation who's been prematurely elevated to the top spot while his father, Harlan (Holt McCallany), recovers from his second heart attack.

 










Cane's decision to start shipping drugs is meant to be the series' impetus: Pushed to the brink by his family's growing debts, the dumb son of a brilliant businessman makes a massive mistake that forces the family to temporarily take up a life of crime (just until they've balanced the books). OK, that's definitely a show born from Ted Sarandos' bored musings — it's easy enough to imagine him scribbling “Ozark” + “Yellowstone” on a cocktail napkin during the Golden Globes — but it's still a formula that's works.

Except in Williamson's telling, the family already has a background in smuggling drugs. Harlan did it for years because his dad did it before him, which makes Cane's choice less stupidly desperate and more stupidly fated. Harlan bitches and moans about Cane's foolish endeavor, but the Buckleys take to the drug trade like ducks to water — because they are and have always been drug-trading ducks who live on the water. Each week, a few trips to the open ocean get added to their shared Google calendar, but their lives otherwise continue uninterrupted. There's no stressful money-laundering learning curve, no awkward interactions with the locals, and no competency porn regarding how they get away with it. What's left is a flavorless, ill-defined routine, and a ho-hum routine isn't the stuff of great drama.

 










OK, fine. “Yellowstone” didn't depend on an off-to-the-races opening either, and it turned out… uh, it was very successful. Maybe “The Waterfront” will actually be about the waterfront. The Buckleys, after all, don't just catch, clean, and distribute fish. They have cousins all over town, and they own their own restaurant overlooking the ocean that's run by Harlan's wife, Belle (Maria Bello). His daughter Bree (Melissa Benoist) works there, too, but after watching all eight episodes, I still can't tell you how her job differs from her mom's.

Maybe the redundancy is intentional, since Bree rarely works and may have missed whatever few shifts she's assigned while in rehab. A self-described alcoholic and “pillhead,” Bree isn't clued into the family's illicit side hustle — a separation that's barely justified onscreen but could be easily explained by plot details I'm barred from discussing. Officially (and shared in terms vague enough that Brie doesn't really know what she's asking to be let in on), she has to prove she's serious about her sobriety before she can transfer from restaurant “manager” to cocaine trafficker, not that such a move would help win back her son, Diller (Brady Hepner), whose father took out a restraining order against his ex-wife when she burned down their house — with Diller inside.

 










(Side note: No matter how propulsive or immersive, there isn't a TV drama in existence that could get me to accept the given name “Diller.” Did they name him after a billionaire? A comedian? A pickle? Or perhaps a sweet treat at Dairy Queen? Please, prospective parents out there, let the vast disparity of potential inspirations serve as warning enough to choose a different moniker. If “The Waterfront” was a comedy or a satire? Sure. But a humorless crime saga where a terrified mother shouts “Diller” with the same emotional intensity as Ellie crying out for Joel? Absolutely not.)

Despite the Buckleys' luxurious waterfront property and small fleet of shiny shipping vessels, “The Waterfront” never bothers to emphasize what makes Havenport, North Carolina — or its esteemed fishery — so special. Episode 1 director Marcos Siega (known for “Dexter,” “Dexter: New Blood,” and the upcoming “Dexter: Resurrection,” in addition to Williamson favorites like “The Vampire Diaries” and “The Following”) primarily frames scenes in close-up, like the conventional TV of yore, rather than strive for the “cinematic” scene-setting that convinced so many “Yellowstone” viewers to visit Montana. There's a boat here and a beach there, but the visual template evokes impersonal wealth more than any specific place. Perhaps a perpetual light breeze is indicative of coastal North Carolina (and nowhere else)? 

 










As for the interpersonal succession drama that made “Yellowstone” the populist replacement for actual “Succession,” “The Waterfront” lacks the existential anxieties that plagued John Dutton (and Logan Roy), as well as the friction created by a family that doesn't abide by daddy's designs. There's a tinge of disapproval in how Harlan sees his timid son, but it's nothing close to the mutual scorn that drove so many blow-ups and near-reunions between John and Jamie (Wes Bentley), let alone Logan (Brian Cox) and any of his children. The Buckleys want to get along, which would be fine — a crime drama built around nice, loving family of criminals could, theoretically, be interesting — except their fluctuating feelings make it difficult for any of their fights to leave a mark. (A spoiler-free example: Harlan doesn't even bother hiding how often he cheats on his wife, and she doesn't care, which makes some of the season's soapier twists feel that much emptier.)

Early on, the family's motivation for breaking bad is written off far too quickly and never revisited: “You know what Cane's up against,” Belle says. “Overfished waters, environmental quotas, gas prices.” OK… so show us that! Get some predatory fishermen involved who are encroaching on the Buckleys' cherished waters. Toss in an uncaring government agent with an axe to grind. Watch Belle or Bree sweating over the books, firing staff, or otherwise struggling with the daily grind of running the family's beloved business. Make us feel how hard they're working to earn all that money the right way, rather than how easy it is to traffic cocaine.

 










Instead, “The Waterfront” cooks up bland, predictable melodrama (like Cane's high school sweetheart moving back to town) and random, extravagant violence (like a brief but brutal torture sequence midway through the season). Alluding to its desired audience, most of the show is set to a country-rock soundtrack, including a particularly bloody scene conversely set to Rodney Atkins' wholesome anthem, “True South.” Like the rest of the show, it's all vibes and no soul. 

But that's just how it goes in “The Waterfront.” Nothing that's heard has to mean anything, it just has to sound like it does. Nothing that happens has to evoke any real emotions, it just has to remind you of shows that did. Even if you haven't seen “Ozark” or “Yellowstone” — heck, even if “The Waterfront” is the first series you've ever seen — there's no mistaking a sinking ship. Let's just hope Holt — a mercurial bulldog of an actor worth building a real show around — makes his way back to solid ground.

“The Waterfront” premieres Thursday, June 19 on Netflix. All eight episodes will be released at once.

	Hot on the heels of landing a role in David Fincher's The Adventures of Cliff Booth, Carla Gugino has inked a deal to star opposite Lou Taylor Pucci (You) in Winthrop, a new horror film based on the cult podcast Knifepoint Horror and the fan-favorite episode “The Lockbox” by writer, creator, and narrator Soren Narnia.


	Set to enter production in Vancouver this summer, the film is about a woman (Gugino) who puts her life on the line to protect her troubled, enigmatic cousin, Winthrop (Pucci), who has been targeted and hunted by a powerful supernatural force. 


	An anthology of original stand-alone stories, Narnia's Knifepoint Horror podcast has developed a cult following in the years since its 2010 launch, reaching over 10 million downloads across all platforms. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Daniel Stamm, the filmmaker behind titles like The Last Exorcism and Prey for the Devil, is set to direct from a script by Emmy-winning playwright Justin Yoffe. Kearie Peak will produce for Peak Pictures, alongside Capstone Studios. AURA Entertainment will handle the flick's U.S. theatrical release, with MGM+ handle its subsequent streaming and linear debut. Seth Yanklewitz, CSA, and Ben Pollack handled casting.


	In a statement on the project, producer Peak said, “Winthrop captures the eerie dread that makes ‘Knifepoint Horror' such a success. Carla Gugino is a perfect fit for the film, bringing a rare intensity and subtlety that aligns perfectly with the silent horror of Winthrop. Beneath the supernatural tension, the film explores how generational trauma festers and twists over time. It's horror with weight, and it stays with you.”


	In the upcoming Adventures of Cliff Booth, a spin-off of Quentin Tararantino's recent Oscar winner Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, Gugino stars alongside Brad Pitt, who reprises as Cliff Booth amid the stuntman's transition to Hollywood fixer. Most recently seen in Bleecker Street's drama The Friend and Max's The Girls on the Bus, she'll next be seen in Amazon MGM's action comedy Heads of State, out July 2. She's represented by Gersh, Untitled Entertainment, and Kopeikin Law P.C.

	











	Known for turns in series like You and Physical, as well as 2013's Evil Dead, and currently appearing in Daredevil: Born Again, Pucci is repped by Innovative Artists, Authentic Talent and Literary Management, and Schreck Rose Dapello.


	Stamm is repped by Industry Entertainment and Gersh.

Johnny Depp brought a little pirate magic — and a lot of smiles — to young patients at Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital in Madrid.

The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star surprised kids on Monday, June 16, by arriving in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume during a break from filming his latest project, “Day Drinker,” in Spain. 

Here are pictures and videos:

Photos from the visit captured sweet moments of Depp — completely in character — laughing with children, touching pinkies with them in their rooms, and brightening their day with a swashbuckling dose of joy.

This isn't the first time Johnny Depp has donned his beloved pirate costume to bring joy to children in need.

In September 2024, while attending the San Sebastian Film Festival, Depp made a special visit to Donostia University Hospital in San Sebastian. 

A post shared by ABC News (@abcnews)

There, he visited young patients in the Pediatrics and Oncology ward — staying in full Jack Sparrow character the entire time, laughing, joking, and lifting spirits throughout the visit.

Over the years, Depp has brought this same kind of magic to children's hospitals around the world — from Vancouver, Paris, and London to Brisbane, Australia, and cities across the U.S., always surprising young patients and hospital staff with his heartwarming visits.

Depp first brought Jack Sparrow to life in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003, starring alongside Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.

He reprised the role in four more films: Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).

Following his highly publicized 2022 trial with ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp has been making a carefully orchestrated return to Hollywood, starting with his 2023 film, Jeanne du Barry.

The future of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has remained unclear since the release of “Dead Men Tell No Tales”.

In May 2024, franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer told Entertainment Weekly, “If it was up to me, [Johnny] would be in it.”

“I love him. He's a good friend. He's an amazing artist and he's a unique look,” Bruckheimer, 81, said. “He created Captain Jack. That was not on the page, that was him doing a little Pepé Le Pew and Keith Richards. That was his interpretation of Jack Sparrow.”

Though a rep for Depp denied reports of his return in 2022, a source close to the actor told PEOPLE in July 2023 that a comeback could still be possible.

As of December 2024, Variety reported that Bruckheimer was developing two versions of a sixth Pirates movie, leaving the door open for Depp to reprise his role, possibly. 

Whether or not he returns to the high seas in another Pirates adventure, Johnny Depp is keeping the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow alive — and for the young patients he visits, that magic means more than any blockbuster.

Diego Luna is the title character in one of the most acclaimed TV series of the past few years with “Andor” — not to mention that the Tony Gilroy-created show is one of the most acclaimed “Star Wars” projects in the history of the franchise.

But that doesn't mean Luna still doesn't get offered roles as drug dealers. Thankfully, though, his years with “Star Wars” dating back to 2016's “Rogue One” have resulted in drug dealers not being the only type of role he's offered.

“Before ‘Star Wars,' the only projects I'd get offered would be drug dealers,” Luna told The Hollywood Reporter, as part of their drama actors roundtable. “And then I could be the nice drug dealer and not the vicious one but still a drug dealer. Because the system wasn't even sending messages of, like, ‘Yes, you could find a way to be yourself and still work in those projects that you're looking at and hoping to see yourself reflected in.' But I do think that's changed, and the middleman between the audience and us is not there anymore. There's no guy with a cigar saying, ‘You! You're gonna be a star, boy.' People just click now, and suddenly it's like, ‘Shit, they're watching a Mexican show.' You can be as far away as you can from the system, and the system will go and search for you if there's a need to hear your story.”

But to clarify, Luna then added, “Oh, I still get a lot of drug dealers. It's just I'm not looking for what they want me to play. I can look for the stuff I want to do. It's that freedom that comes with understanding that people today care about specificity.” 

 










Luna played the “boss of all bosses” and founder of the Guadalajara Cartel Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo for two seasons of “Narcos: Mexico” from 2018 to 2020. The actor also recalled how often he'd be told to lose his Mexican accent in order to play a wider variety of roles earlier in his career.

“I remember being asked, ‘Are you going to clean up your accent?' That's not part of the conversation anymore. But when I was 20, it was like, ‘Man, you're great, and if you work with your accent, you'll be doing what this person or that person is doing.' And you go, ‘Why would I like to do that? This is what makes me unique.'”

Thankfully, the powers that be at Lucasfilm agreed. Hearing a Mexican accent from a member of the Rebel Alliance in “Rogue One” was quietly revolutionary in its own way. Sometimes leaning more into how you are can bring greater specificity and depth to a character. And TIME magazine certainly agreed recently, when they named Luna to the TIME 100.

Legacy has been top of mind for Uma Thurman: It's the primary reason she all but entirely avoided the action genre since “Kill Vill Vol. 2” came out in 2004.

That's about to change with her appearance in Netflix's “The Old Guard 2,” as the villain Discord. It took a particularly special film to get Thurman out of action-movie retirement, she said on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” June 17.

“I never really followed ‘Kill Bill‘ up with action because I didn't kind of want to be in a whole bunch of ‘B' action movies,” Thurman said. “When you do ‘Kill Bill,' you never stop hearing about, you know, it's like, ‘Oh, got to be very careful about what I do next.' So I did other stuff.”

That meant, post-“Kill Bill,” Thurman appeared in the musical “The Producers,” rom-coms like “Playing for Keeps,” and auteur projects such as Lars von Trier's “Nymphomaniac” and “The House that Jack Built” and Paul Schrader's “Oh, Canada!” But never really action again, until “The Old Guard 2.” The first movie, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and starring Charlize Theron, who returns for the sequel, impressed Thurman with its “depth” and by being “quite moving.” In fact, she had such regard for Theron's work on that film that when Fallon asked her if being in this movie gave Thurman an opportunity to “show everyone how it's done,” she had a pointed response.

 










“I didn't think I was going to show anybody how it's done after I saw Charlize in ‘Old Guard 1,'” Thurman said. “This one seemed different [from other action movies she was offered] because in ‘Old Guard 1' Charlize was just so epic in it. And so I thought, ‘Well, I could go do this for her in that. Where she's kind of taking the genre there. I'll go support her and fight her and battle her out.'”

“Putting her toe” into the action genre again, as she put it, didn't come quite as easily to Thurman as one might have thought, in part because she came aboard the project late and didn't have time for training beforehand.

“Oh, if only I could have trained,” she said. “No, I came on to do it kind of at the end. So I had no training. I was like, ‘Oh yeah, a sword. I think I hold it like this.'” 

Sounds like someone needs a return visit to Hattori Hanzo.

Bruce Springsteen confirmed the long-rumored existence of an electric, full-band version of his celebrated acoustic record Nebraska — after insisting it didn't exist during a new interview with Rolling Stone. 


	The electric Nebraska has become a mythical object for Springsteen fans over the years, and there's been a lot of evidence suggesting the tapes do exist. For instance, in past interviews with RS, E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg both separately recalled those sessions, with the latter even remarking, “It was all very hard-edged. As great as it was, it wasn't what Bruce wanted to release.”


	But when asked about the full-band Nebraska during a recent chat about Tracks II: The Lost Albums — Springsteen's massive compendium of unreleased material recorded between 1983 and 2018, out June 27 — the rocker insisted, “I can tell you right now, it doesn't exist.”


	He added, “We tried to do a few songs with the band for a few minor electric versions of ‘Nebraska,' maybe something else, I'm not sure. But that record simply doesn't exist. There is no electric Nebraska outside of what you hear us performing on stage.”

	











	After being told about Bittan's and Weinberg's memories of those sessions, Springsteen replied, “I have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there's nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska.”


	About a month later, however, Springsteen texted Rolling Stone's Andy Greene with a remarkable correction: “Just wanted to give you a heads up. I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record, though it does not have the full album of songs.” 

	











	Springsteen did not say which Nebraska songs were recorded, nor whether the collection would get a proper release at some point. There is another upcoming vault project, Tracks III, and while Springsteen said it's already finished and “ready to be released,” it may not arrive for another few years because of all the other projects he wants to release, too.

	The musician also didn't rule out the possibility of one day doing a full live run through of Nebraska. While he probably won't do it in connection to the upcoming biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere, which centers around the recording of Nebraska, he didn't dismiss the idea entirely. 


	“I could possibly go out and play that record straight through one day,” he said. “I think that would be fun to do, and the fans would get a kick out of it. That's not off the table.”

When you're able to launch into a successful career in comedy straight out of college, landing a cherished cult sketch series on MTV and continuing on in hit shows like “Reno 911!,” it's easy to become jaded into thinking you have all the answers. However, in reflecting on these experiences during the latest episode of “What No One Tells You,” Kerri Kenney-Silver admitted that many of her accomplishments have come from keeping up with changing trends.

“When we did the pilot for ‘Reno 911!', it was the year 2000,” she said. “Which sounds like a sci-fi movie now, but, things were different. Things were different in comedy, things were different in the world.”

She added, “We just did our most recent ‘Reno' movie two years ago, so it's a 25 year span of time. While the characters have remained the same, the subject matter has changed, and also the pace of comedy is changing. If we stuck to our guns and did everything the way we did when, when we first started, I don't think this show would've had as long a life as it has.”

 










Comedy has especially changed since Kenney-Silver first started consuming it as a child. Back then, she would watch “SNL” get away with 10-minute sketches, but nowadays, she sees that “people are consuming comedy in 10-second bites.” Rather than ignore these shifts, it's better to embrace them and think creatively about what it means for your art. Likening it to how digital quickly overtook film and how now cell phones are being used for professional shoots, Kenney-Silver shared that advancement is par for the course.

“I just did ADR for a movie and they missed a line, so I did it from my bedroom closet on my iPhone and it's in the film,” Kenney-Silver told IndieWire's Future of Filmmaking. “So you have to keep up with technology and keep up with the changing times.”

	Items from David Lynch's personal estate and archive sold for a total of over $4.5 million at a white-glove auction hosted Wednesday by Julien's Auctions and Turner Classic Movies. The famed filmmaker died in January at the age of 78. 


	Standout lots in the auctioned collection included Lynch's director's chair, which sold for $70,000, a 35-millimiter print of his 1977 surrealist classic Eraserhead that went for $40,000, and a personal copy of the script to the Oscar-nominated Mulholland Drive which sold for $98,000. 


	Lynch was know to drink over 20 cups of coffee a day at one point, and his personal La Marzocco GS/3 Home Espresso Machine sold for $35,000. 


	The prize of the night, however, was a set of screenplays related to Lynch's most infamous unfinished film: Ronnie Rocket: The Absurd Mystery of the Strange Forces of Existence. The project, originally begun by Lynch in the late 1970s, is the mythical lost film of Lynch's lifetime. Described by Lynch as a movie “about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair,” the director repeatedly came back to the screenplay and script, writing and rewriting Ronnie Rocket but never finding adequate financial backing to fully develop the project. 

	











	In 2013, Lynch told writer David Breskin that Ronnie Rocket was not a dead project. “No, no, no, no, never, not in a million years,” Lynch emphasized. “I'm waiting for the next step to happen to do it, if there is a next step. I'm waiting for a time where I don't really care what happens, except that the film is finished […] It might be a picture that I would love, but I don't know if too many other people are going to dig it. It's very abstract.”

	“Ronnie scripts have gone through all sorts of permutations over the years,” An Kroeber, the wife of Eraserhead and Elephant Man sound designer Alan Splet, said of the project. “I suspect that Ronnie Rocket is David's most thought-about story and may just never be made not because the production company didn't want to shoot it, they and several others were willing, but David wasn't.”

	The collection of manuscripts sold for a stunning $150,000. 


	“Every object in this collection served as a window into Lynch's surreal and uncompromising creative world — whether from his groundbreaking films, television work, or personal studio,” Catherine Williamson, Managing Director of Entertainment at Julien's Auctions, said in a statement. “The global response to the auction speaks not only to the cultural importance of his legacy, but to the profound admiration and reverence he inspires among fans, collaborators, and collectors alike.”

On May 13, production, financing, and distribution company StudioFest filed a copyright lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that Alison Brie and Dave Franco had turned down an offer to star in the studio's film “Better Half,” and then developed their own concept of a body horror movie based on a co-dependent relationship, “Together,” with WME.

Now the director of “Together,” Michael Shanks, is firing back in a statement released via the X and Instagram accounts of the film's distributor, Neon, which bought the completed feature for $17 million out of Sundance earlier this year, the biggest deal of the festival. The film had premiered to raves, with its sharp insights into what it means to be in a long-term relationship somehow then translated into grisly body horror visuals. Franco's Tim and Brie's Millie have been together for years and just at the moment that their relationship seems to have hit the rocks, something happens to cause them to start literally sticking together — to be incapable of leaving each other's presence.

Shanks called the accusation of idea theft “entirely untrue,” “devastating,” and that it had “taken a heavy toll” in the remarks that laid out his long relationship to this story. WME had previously told IndieWire that the lawsuit was “frivolous and without merit” and that the agency would “vigorously defend ourselves.”

“Have you ever been in a relationship so long that the line between you and the other person starts to blur?” Shanks said to kick off his statement. “I've been with my partner for over 16 years — almost half my life. That entanglement of identity, love, and co-dependence is what inspired TOGETHER. It's not just a script; it's a reflection of something deeply personal. Tim's story, his love for Millie, his relationship to his family, his relationship to unfulfilled ambitions as a musician, is completely rooted in my own personal life. I lost my father at a young age in the same way our main character does, his trauma is rooted in my own. To have this called into question is not only deeply upsetting but entirely untrue.”

“I wish I didn't have to clarify this, but I completed the first draft in 2019 and registered it to the Writer's Guild of America that same year. In October 2020, I received development funding from Screen Australia to further the project. In 2022, my agent at WME introduced me to Dave Franco. From the very first meeting, we bonded over our love of horror, and I pitched him TOGETHER — a script I had been trying to get into production for years, with no luck. Soon after, he and Alison Brie came onboard to act in and produce the film. To now be accused of stealing this story — one so deeply based on my own lived experience, one I've developed over the course of several years — is devastating and has taken a heavy toll.”

W
hen the pandemic brought the live-music industry to a complete stop in 2020, Bruce Springsteen found himself at home with a lot of free time on his hands. He decided to make good use of it by poring over his massive vault of unreleased music, pulling out seven complete records he shelved between 1983 and 2018, and packaging them together as Tracks II: The Lost Albums, which features an astounding 74 songs most hardcore fans have never heard. 


	“If you look at them as a group, they're sort of genres that I haven't quite dived into as of yet,” Springsteen says via Zoom from his home in Wellington, Florida, noting that the albums touch on everything from Western swing to Burt Bacharach-inspired Sixties pop. “They were all these sort of outliers, and what do you do with them? I don't know. So this is how we ended up solving the problem.”


	A high percentage of these songs were recorded in the Nineties, often seen as a lost period for Springsteen since he released only a single studio record, 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, between 1992 and 2002. “That was for a variety of reasons,” says Springsteen, who is touring in Europe this summer, and spoke to us before his anti-Trump remarks on opening night of the tour sparked a tense back-and-forth with the president. (Springsteen declined to comment on the exchange.) “Our children were very young at exactly that moment. And also I didn't have any interest, really, in working with the band. I felt just burned out on it at that particular place in time. But I was working on music all the time. I just wasn't releasing it.”

	











	In a wide-ranging interview, Springsteen delves deep into Tracks II: The Lost Albums, explains why he was never happy with Born In The U.S.A., reveals that he has a new album in the can for next year, drops a revelation about the fabled Electric Nebraska tapes, and explains why he still believes in America.

	











The box set starts with L.A. Garage Sessions '83. Nobody knew you recorded an entire album between Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A. I enjoyed the recording and the experience of Nebraska, and thought I might continue in that vein with a small rhythm section, still very lo-fi, and a new group of songs. At the time I wasn't sure where I was going with Born in the U.S.A. I had half the record, but I didn't have the other half. And so it was just a record that happened in between those two records.

Prior to Nebraska, you'd never cut an album outside of a studio before. It must have been really freeing.I was a lot less inhibited, so I was a lot more experimental. If you go to the studio, the whole band is there, all the producers are there. It's a very formal environment, and I found it tended to make me conservative in some ways. And so, Nebraska really broke through that ceiling where I brought in an element of risk that I hadn't previously to my recording process. I wanted to continue that, to continue to feel that freedom in the studio, and so I began to simply record at home more often.


You say in the liner notes that you “weren't happy” with Born in the U.S.A. and that it didn't “connect” like your other albums. Why not? It was a record I put out. It became the record I made, not necessarily the record that I was interested in making. I was interested in taking Nebraska and making a full record that had somewhat that same feeling. If you hear “My Hometown” and you hear “Born in the U.S.A.,” they were sort of the bookends I intended. And the rest of the stuff was … just what I had at the time. Those were the songs I wrote. Those were the songs I recorded.


	From conception to execution, it was not necessarily the record that in my mind I had planned on, but that's the way creativity works. You go in the studio, you have an idea. It's not necessarily what you come out with. So that was just the situation of that record for me personally.

I'm a little surprised to hear you say that. I always heard Born in the U.S.A. as dispatches from various people left behind by Reagan's America. As a listener, it felt cohesive. I guess, it was to a lot of other people too. I suppose maybe I was looking for something darker. But outside of that, the themes of Nebraska are in there — in “Downbound Train,” they're in there, they're disguised somewhat into pop music.


Did you feel any label pressure after “Hungry Heart” to create music less like Nebraska and more radio-friendly?No, I've been lucky in my relationship with Sony for all the years that I've been on there. I've never received any pressure to do anything other than what I've exactly wanted to do.

	











“The Klansman” is a chilling song. It's in the same vein as “Johnny 99,” where you write from the perspective of someone truly villainous.I do that from time to time. That was “Nebraska.” And this was a particularly risky choice. I'm singing in the voice of a member of the Klan. The song is about the way that hate and toxicity is passed down from generation to generation. 


I want to briefly talk about your albums Human Touch and Lucky Town. When you got inducted in the Hall of Fame in 1998, you said, “I tried to write happy songs in the early Nineties, and it didn't work. The public didn't like it.” Can you elaborate on what you meant by that?On the fan sites in general, Human Touch particularly is a record that doesn't get a lot of respect, even though I actually like it quite a bit, and it has got some great songs on like “Roll of the Dice,” “Human Touch,” and “Real World.” I think people had some second thoughts about the production, and maybe they were right, maybe they weren't. I don't know, but it is what it is.


	 So, I sort of was making light of the fact. Actually, Lucky Town came out pretty much precisely the way I wanted it to, and I think that's a very good record. But I was making light of just its public perception.


	And I think recording without the E Street Band also affected a lot of fans perception of it, so that had something to do with it also. The records weren't timed well, I would say.


There's an entire album of songs on Tracks II built around drum loops. What drew you toward that sound? “Streets of Philadelphia.” I set up a small drum loop on that. I liked the way it worked. It interplayed with synthesizers, which was an instrument I was beginning to write on. And so the natural thing to do after that was, I said, “Well, I'm going to try and create a whole album with the basic sound of a synthesizers and drum loops.” And so, that's what I did.


How were the loops created?Some of them I created myself, and some of them were just off CDs that my engineer brought in and we listened to, and I'd say, “Yeah, that's a cool one” or “That's a cool one. Let's try that. Let me try to write to that.”


It's been called your “hip-hop album” by fans in the past, but that's a real misnomer.Yeah, it's not that. I do use the drum loops, but I think when they heard drum loops, they jumped to hip-hop. But no, it's basically a record that uses loops and synthesizers.

	











How did the drum loops change your writing process?Drum loops are trance-like, I find, and so a lot of the music on that record is a little bit trance-like, very dreamy. The combination of the synthesizers and the loops made for a sort of dark, dreamy sound. And there's quite a bit of that on the record.


Why didn't the record come out?Bob Clearmountain mixed it. I had it at home. I was in the process of sequencing it. But I could never quite get the sequence correct, and I felt…. I've had a conversation going with my fans for 50 years now, which I try to honor as best as I can; and one of the ways I honor that conversation is by trying to keep its context open. And I said, “Well, gee, I'm not sure.” After the three records I wrote about relationships and the nature of the record, I just said, “I'm just not sure. Is this too closed off at this moment? Is it the right time?” A lot of releasing records for me comes down to timing, and it was one of the records where, for better or for worse, I didn't think the timing was right.


A lot of the lyrical content is pretty dark, which is interesting because this was a pretty happy time in your life.Yeah, those things don't go together. People tend to think that singer-songwriters are always writing autobiographically. Certainly in my case, that's not the point. I'll go to some completely different geography in my head, I'll strike a vein that I find that is rewarding to write in, and I'll just work in that vein for a while.


Somewhere North of Nashville was made at the same time as The Ghost of Tom Joad. How did that work?I'm recording that in the afternoon often, and Tom Joad, the darker material, was recorded in the evening, assuming they were both going to be part of the same record.


How did you realize you could only release one?Well, obviously if you listen to “Repo Man,” it doesn't back up against the “Straight Time” very well. So, it became obvious pretty quickly that I was in the process of making two records. And when I tried to put them together to make either a double album or a single album, it just didn't work. And so, I cut the material down to the music that felt like it worked well together, which was The Ghost of Tom Joad album.


Marty Rifkin does amazing work on this one.Marty Rifkin is a badass steel guitarist, one of the absolute best in the country. He played with me on the Seeger Sessions tour. He plays tremendously on this album. He's a real secret resource. He's an incredible musician, a wonderful guy, and he really comes to the fore and shows what he can do on Somewhere North of Nashville.

	











So much of this music was made in the Nineties, but I don't really hear any “Nineties” sounds on this record. A lot of your peers were incorporating elements of grunge and alternative. You never went even near the trends of the day.I believe you are who you are. And chasing trends, for me anyway, it never fit with who I was. It's just not the way that I operate. I work from the inside out, not from the outside in. And I believe that's what gives my music its intensity and its personalness.


It means the music isn't stuck in the amber of any particular time. You can play “Racing in The Street” next to anything on Tom Joad or anything that I've written since, and it'll slide right in. So, I've always wanted to write about themes that were timeless: family, work, spirituality, love, sex, just things that are always in people's lives. And that's the trail that I've always followed. I still follow it to this day. And like I said, I work from the inside out.


What drew you to the mariachi sounds on Inyo?We've had a farm since the early Nineties, and I was writing a few songs that were set in Mexico, and I had an assistant who would occasionally help me researching some details. He said, “Hey, there's a charro that moved into New Jersey in the apartment above me.” I said, “Really?” He says, “Yeah. A girl from New Jersey went to Mexico, met the 1994 All-Around Mexico Charro, and moved him back to New Jersey. I mean, this is one of the most incredible horsemen and guy with a rope I've ever seen.”


	So I said, “Well, bring him over to the house.” So he comes to the house and he ends up working on the farm with me for five years. And he taught us how to ride, a little bit of roping, rope tricks. 


	He was an incredible guy. When we would have our harvest parties, he said, “Man, I know this great mariachi band.” And I said, “Bring them down.” So he brought down these incredible mariachi bands, and they would play at our harvest parties. And so, I just got into the music sort of like that. And I had a few songs that I felt they would work well on, and that's how they ended up on the record.


How close did you come to putting this one out?Not that close. I did get Devils & Dust out [with some songs from this era], but I still had a large group of material left over. And I knew the songs were good. Once again, the timing wasn't right, so they were there in the vault. And so that one sat until I had time during the pandemic to go and put it together.

	











On Perfect World, there's a bunch of songs you co-write with Joe Grushecky. He's one of the few songwriters you've ever collaborated with. What drew you to him?Well, I always like his songs and I felt we had something in common in our roots, coming out of the working class, and he wrote about that a lot. And also, Joe was just very persistent. He would just send me lyrics. I think most of them I wrote for him to record, and I produced his record [American Babylon]. And so, he'd send me lyrics, I'd write the music, and send it back.


	He was just a persistent guy, and we became very close friends, as we are to this day. We haven't done a lot of writing together, but we've done some, and it's always fun. I tend to not write with others.


By the end of the E Street Band reunion tour, you were playing new songs in the set. You had “American Skin,” “Land of Hope and Dreams,” and some of the songs with Joe like “Code of Silence.” Were you planning another E Street record around 2000 or so?Once we did the reunion tour, my next thought was, “OK, now we've got to make a record if we're going to continue.” I did go into the studio with “American Skin,” “Land of Hope and Dreams,” a few other things, and we did do some recording, and it just wasn't good. 


	The production team I'd used for many years, really, we'd done the work we were going to do, and it was time for somebody else to come in with some fresh ideas, and to give us more of a current sound for the times we were working in.


	And that of course, was Brendan O'Brien, who was and is a tremendous producer, great guy. I've had wonderful times working with him, and he really was deeply responsible for giving us our modern recorded sound. And then I've worked with Ron Aniello — also an incredible producer and great guy — since then also. Once I started working with Brendan, the songs came, and The Rising came out of it. And then Magic and Working on a Dream. And he also assisted me in finishing Devils & Dust.


Unlike the others here, Perfect World wasn't a completely finished record at the time.Yeah, that was the one record that I didn't conceive of as a record. It was just material that I had, not sure where it was going to go. And so, when I thought of this particular project, I said, “Gee, there's a lot of stuff on here, but there's no rock music. And I know I've got some rock music fans out there.” So I said, “Well, maybe I'll try and put something together.” And I had that selection of material, and I put that album together from the material that I had.

	











Do you have any regrets that you didn't put out any of these albums back in the Nineties?Well, it's fun putting them all out at once with this project because it's unusual, and I actually believe it's the correct context for them to come out in. So, I don't regret it. No.


Was there any point in the Nineties where self-doubt started to sink in that maybe your career was slipping away? Not really. I always used to say, when I was in the middle of some of the big lawsuits [in the mid-Seventies], “OK. Well, somebody can take your publishing and somebody can take your records or take your songs or take whatever money you've made out of the thing, but you can drop me out of an airplane anywhere in the United States or most parts of the world, I'll land and I'll find the nearest roadhouse and I'll light up somebody's night.”


	And so, that's something that's in me. You can never lose it. And so during the Nineties, I understood that. And I even had a conversation with Jon Landau at one point where I said, “Gee, this record didn't do as well. Jon, it's just not our time. Somebody else's time.” If you're ever going to have a long career, hey, it's going to be your time and it's going to be not your time sometimes, and you got to be OK with that and you just got to carry on, work on.


Did any part of you think that the Born in the U.S.A. period simply got too big? There were seven hits off that record. You were almost as big as Michael Jackson. The red hat, blue jeans, and the flag became this iconic image of you that remains with many people to this day.I wasn't interested in carrying on with that. I did it at the time, but I wasn't interested in trying to catch those horses again. I always looked at it like, “Well, that was one of a thing,” and I immediately returned to my singer-songwriter roots and made Tunnel of Love. And so, I wasn't under any illusion that that was going to be my career. 


	And also, I didn't have any real desire for that to be my career, and I wasn't concerned about selling less records because I wasn't concerned about selling that many records in the first place.


	So, it was just an interesting moment in time. It was challenging. I generally had a great time during most of it. And to this day, if somebody is imitating me, they'll generally put that uniform on. I still see it at my shows. I see young men in their twenties come in with the bandanna and the sleeveless shirt. It is charming at this point, and I don't regret any of it. It was a great experience, but it wasn't something I considered a career.

	











And after that, there was no way to go any bigger. Wisely, you didn't even try.My attitude is I was never interested in going bigger. I was always interested in going deeper. That's how I've conducted my career.


Tell me about Faithless. This one really came out of nowhere. Nobody knew it existed.That was an unusual record. I was contacted to write a small group of songs for a film that was a Western. I was down here with my daughter in Florida in about two or three weeks, and I believe I wrote the whole record. And then I went home and I recorded it in, I don't know, a week or two weeks maybe, something like that, very, very quickly in the living room of the house next door to my house, which I was using as a temporary studio. And that was it. 


	I sat on it waiting for the moment when perhaps the film would get in the production, and it just didn't happen. So, I figured after about 20 years, “Well, maybe I would put this out myself, and who knows, maybe it'll still get made.” But I figured I put it out in this collection because Patti always loved this particular record and said, “You got to put that out.” And so, it's a really unique little selection of songs, and I'm glad it's in this particular package.


How'd you get in the mindset of these characters? Did you read a screenplay?There was a book, and there was a screenplay.


I imagine that you don't want to say the name of the director or anything, right?Correct.


Let's talk about Twilight Hours. There's obviously a lot of commonality with the songs on Western Stars, but they're distinct.Well, if Western Stars tilted a little more towards your Jimmy Webb and country music, Twilight Hours tilts more towards the Burt Bacharach and classic American songbook songwriting. 


	If you listen to “Sunday Love” or “September Kisses” or “Late in the Evening,” many of those things you think Sinatra could have sung, or Andy Williams or Jack Jones or any of the crooners from the early Sixties or Fifties. That's material they could have used. It's sort of in that Mad Men vein of pop music. So it differs quite a bit from Western Stars in that sense. But a few songs like “High Sierra” could have gone on Western Stars, and maybe “Sunliner.”


	I was using chord changes that I had not previously used, and that allowed me to investigate slightly more sophisticated types of chordal structures and songwriting than I've used in most of my other music.

	











Did you think about releasing Western Stars and Twilight Hours as a double album?I did, and I decided against it. Usually, when I write a lot of material at once, particularly if you're talking about 40 songs or something you wrote at one time, I always go, “Well, maybe this should be a double album.” But I usually end up opting for something that's more compact and intense.


“High Sierra” is a stunning song. Can you talk a bit about that one?I probably should have got that onto Western Stars somehow, and I almost did. I kept trying to squeeze it in this way, squeeze it in that way, and for one reason or another, it just didn't happen. I suppose there were a lot of other things in that with the same mood. There was a lot of those characters dealing with American isolation. I had “Drive Fast (The Stuntman),” “Western Stars,” “Tucson Train,” and “Stones.” 


	It was a lot of these singular characters dealing with American loneliness. It might've just tipped the balance a little too much, or I figured it might have not been as appreciated as much as I felt it might be in the context of this other record. It's one of my favorite songs in the whole package.


You played the entirety of Western Stars in your barn for the concert film, but you've never done any of them in public. Might you bring some of them into the set at some point?If I was going to do that, I'd go out on probably a smaller tour, where I might engage an orchestra and play those records specifically. When I go out with the E Street Band, I go out to do a rock show. I want to come out, put the pedal to the metal for three hours, and exhaust you, myself, and anybody in the immediate 20-mile vicinity. And so, there's certain things that mix and certain things that don't mix for me, and that's sort of the way I look at the work that I do with the band.


You've been photographed a lot on the set of your upcoming biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere, which centers around the creation of Nebraska. What's it been like to watch an actor play you? I'm sure it's much worse for the actor than for me. Jeremy Allen White was very, very tolerant of me the days that I would appear on the set. I said to him, “Look, anytime I'm in the way, just give me the look and I'm on my way home.” So the days that I got out there, he was wonderfully tolerant with me being there. And it was just fun. It was enjoyable.


	I mean, there's some unusualness to it because the movie involves, in some ways, some of the most painful days of my life. But it was a great project, and Jeremy and Jeremy Strong [who plays manager Jon Landau] were both fantastic, terrific in it as were all the other actors. Stephen Graham plays my dad, and he's out of this world, but everybody that was engaged in the film, they were all tremendous.

	











Watching actors re-create your childhood right in front of you must have been really intense emotionally.Well, some of the scenes I wasn't at. If there was a scene coming up that was sometimes really deeply personal, I wanted the actors to feel completely free, and I didn't want to get in the way, and so I would just stay at home. If Scott Cooper, the director, wanted or needed me there for something, I would try to make it. But I was on tour in Canada for the whole first month or so of the filming, and so I was out really out on the road quite a bit and working at that time.


	Hey — a shout-out to my Canadian audience, who was incredible on that tour, just the best Canadian tour we ever had.


Speaking of Nebraska, fans are fascinated by the idea of a full-band Nebraska. It's become this mythical thing over the years. Well, I can tell you right now, it doesn't exist.


Really?No, we tried to do a few songs with the band for a few minor electric versions of “Nebraska,” maybe something else, I'm not sure. But that record simply doesn't exist. There is no electric Nebraska outside of what you hear us performing onstage.


Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan have talked to me about running through a lot of the songs in the living room of Roy's house. I have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there's nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska.


	[Note: About a month after this interview took place, I turned my phone on after a plane ride and saw a missed call from an unfamiliar number in Freehold, New Jersey. I had a text from that number too: “Hey Andy! Bruce Springsteen here. Just wanted to give you a heads-up. I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record though it does not have the full album of songs. All best, Bruce.”]


Fans have fantasized about some sort of special show before the release of the movie where you play Nebraska straight through, which you've never done before. Is that possible?I doubt I'll do it, but I could possibly go out and play that record straight through one day. I think that would be fun to do, and the fans would get a kick out of it. That's not off the table.


We talked last time about Only the Strong Survive, Volume 2. Is that in the can?Yeah, that's finished, done. It's been finished for quite a while. Once again, timing. The covers records are things I make for my own amusement and entertainment when I'm not writing. It was just a project that I had a lot of fun doing. And I love all that music, I love all those songs and those singers. So I do have another one, and there's other covers things I've done that were not necessarily soul-related, so it's another project.

	











Are you writing songs now or thinking about your next record?Yeah, I have a record finished.


Is it with the E Street Band or is it solo?It's a solo record.


Is there anything you can say about it?No.


Do you think it'll be out next year?I would imagine it will come out in '26 sometime.


Besides Broadway, you haven't done a tour without the E Street Band in 19 years. Do you think you might do another solo tour at some point?Well, Broadway was 240 shows or something like that. But yeah, definitely, I will be doing that again at some point. I'm not sure what the music will be, but I'll have a lot to draw on because I'm making a lot of records. But at some point, I'd like to do that.


Is this summer run in Europe the end of the E Street Tour you started in early 2023?Yes. This next 15 or 16 shows are the official end of our 130-date E Street Tour. That's something debatable. Rather than do a 130-show stretch, which we did this time because we had been off for six years, so I had to get back in touch with my audience, and it was fun playing with the band … in the future, I think we'll probably play more often and less dates.


The fans in Australia are dying to see you down there.I'm doing my best as we speak to get down there, hopefully next year sometime. And I feel bad. I apologize to my Australian fans for not getting down on this stretch, but I want them to know that we are planning to get down there as soon as feasible, probably in the next year sometime.


The show you did last summer in Asbury Park was just an unbelievable night.Well, I put that in one of the top five or three shows we've ever done. That's how special it was for me anyway. And partly because I was in that town when there was no one there, when it was a ghost town. I mean, Asbury Park was a complete and utter ghost town for 30 years, and me and the guys were there. So to be there for its rebirth and when it came back to life, and to see that happen on that beach in front of us on a beautiful September night was one of the loveliest performing experiences of my life.


Is Tracks III happening?Yes. Still a lot of music in the vault, and that's something that I've finished and is ready to be released. It's just a question of when we have time to put that out, considering that I have a variety of other things that I'm interested in releasing soon also. But you won't be waiting 25 years for the next Tracks album. I suppose it'll come out in the next three years or so.

	











Are there other full, unreleased albums on there?No, there are no complete albums. This is all music from different points in my work life that I've made, some with the band, without the band, some that go way back. At that point, the vault will be not completely empty, but virtually empty. There will be really not more, which I'm sort of excited about doing, finally getting all the music that I have and have recorded out to my fans.


During the George W. Bush presidency, you wrote a lot of songs about the agony and insanity of that time. Are you tempted to write songs about this political era we're living through?Well, I think I'm inspired to sing about it. As of yet, I haven't been inspired to write about it. Whether I will or will not be, I don't know. But obviously we're living through an American tragedy, and I believe we will come out intact. The country is not like other countries that have had authoritarian histories. We have a democratic history, and I believe that will rear its head again. That is not a tradition that I believe is going to disappear overnight regardless of how hard somebody tries to subvert it.


You're not losing hope?No, no, no. Got to have hope, man. I got to have hope.


When we spoke a little over 10 years ago, you said that “the light from the oncoming train focuses the mind?” Do you feel that even more at this age?Yes. You realize time is finite, and your performing time is finite now. And I feel like if you come to see the band, you see a band at the top of their game. We played different in 1980. We played different in 1975. There was a different youthful energy that you have at that particular moment. But the depths and resonance and experience that we've had over the past 50 years of playing together has really come to the fore right now in our performance. And the band is just completely badass onstage at this moment. So, it's very exciting to play with the E Street Band now, and I'm looking forward to doing a good deal of it in the future. But that future is finite.


There are nights I look at Max near the end of the set and I think “How on earth is this man still going?”Well, Max, I believe has refined a technique where he is able to do that, which is amazing to me. I tell people, “Look, I come out and I have a brief breath in between songs because I like to keep the show just constantly moving.” Max doesn't get that because I say, “Max, while we're taking these five seconds, keep playing.” So the guy comes out and plays basically for three hours straight without stopping. He stops, maybe there's 30 seconds where he gets to take a sip of water twice, two or three times during the night. So Max is a human marvel, and he's a great blessing in my life and in my work life.

	











I often think about the crazy luck of putting an ad in the Village Voice looking for a drummer and keyboardist, and Max and Roy show up.Yeah. And they really defined an enormous part of the band sound where Roy Bittan's keyboards are very distinctive to E Street Band, as is Max's drumming. So, you got to have a little luck with you when you're going for the long haul also. I had some good luck. Those were some lucky days.


Do you hope to be like Pete Seeger and still be onstage in your nineties playing your music?Oh, absolutely. I mean, I knew Pete, and Pete had a lot of energy. And when his voice began to go, he simply found another way to do it. I think, was it his cousin or something who would play alongside him? Pete understood that people were coming to experience his spirit, which was as strong as could be.

He's a great role model.He certainly is, as is Willie Nelson, as were a lot of the fathers [of rock] who played well into their eighties. And the Stones are a great inspiration right now. I think the Stones are playing better than they've ever played, as is Paul McCartney. And Bob Dylan is out there. So these guys, they're a little in front of me, and they're showing, “Hey, it's not time to sleep yet. There's many miles to go.”


So there will be no farewell tour?No.

On June 17, friends, family, and fans of chef Anne Burrell were shocked at her sudden passing. The magnetic Food Network personality was beloved by many. One of the most emotional tributes was from her close friend and fellow chef, Rachael Ray. 

“I can't quite believe it — such a strong, vibrant, fearless woman, so full of life and love, could be gone so soon,” she wrote. Bobby Flay, friend and fellow “Worst Cooks in America” chef, has also posted his praise of the star. He also says she gave him “the greatest gift” that will last forever.

On June 18th, Bobby Flay took to his Instagram stories and posted a photo of Anne Burrell sitting in a chair with the biggest smile on her face. Her two Maine Coons in her lap: Nancy and Marcia. 

“Worst Cooks in America was the funnest show on TV,” Flay wrote in the caption. “All of your co-hosts (me included) were just alongside for the Anne Burrell ride.”

“The greatest gift I got from AB was turning me on to a world of Maine Coon Cats (including Nacho)… a gift that I'll have forever.”

The photo he used was one that Burrell had posted in July 2024, before Marcia died. In October, she posted a picture of the newest member of the family, Lady Lorraine Periwinkle.

Burrell loved her Maine Coons and often posted photos of them on her social media, chasing shadows or just being cute. The last time was on May 16, when she posted an adorable Instagram video of Nancy grooming her husband, Stuart's, head.

Bobby Flay's love of Maine Coons has been well-documented over the past decade. In 2015, he brought home Nacho, the first cat companion he'd had in 30 years. 

“I often wonder if I wasted three decades without a cat around my home,” he told CBS in 2017. “Especially when I look into Nacho's eyes and I can almost hear his thoughts. He knows when I'm feeling a little under the weather, or I'm having a case of the blues. 

“He makes me a softer and more understanding person, and just by his presence and affection,” he continued. “The world has a way of giving you what you need, and sometimes, a new best friend shows up when you need him the most.”

He even took his love for Nacho and created a line of cat food: Made by Nacho. While Nacho sadly passed away in 2023, he still regularly posts photos of his current Maine Coons: Conelo and Stella. He has also never forgotten Nacho and posts about him, as well.

EXCLUSIVE: John Morton's British sitcom series that has satirized the 2012 Olympics and the inner workings of the BBC is heading Stateside for a fictional soccer tournament.


	The BBC has officially greenlit Twenty Twenty Six, with Hugh Bonneville reprising his iconic role as Ian Fletcher from previous shows Twenty Twelve and W1A. 


	He'll be joined by a cast mixed with British and North American talent featuring Paulo Costanzo (Designated Survivor, Royal Pains), Chelsey Crisp (Fresh off The Boat, Ten Percent), Stephen Kunken (Billions, The Handmaid's Tale), Nick Blood (Day of The Jackal, Slow Horses), Jimena Larraguivel (Patience and RSC), Alexis Michalik (A Love Story) and Belinda Stewart-Wilson (The Inbetweeners, Stay Close).

	Bonneville has previously played Fletcher in Twenty Twelve and W1A, which satirized the organizers behind the London 2012 Olympics and the the working culture at the BBC via a pair of critically-acclaimed, BAFTA-winning comedies. Clarkson's Farm maker Expectation has taken over producing from BBC Studios for the new show.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In Twenty Twenty Six, former BBC Head of Values Fletcher heads to the U.S., Canada and Mexico to help with a highly anticipated soccer tournament. He takes on a new role as Head of Integrity for the Twenty Twenty Six Oversight team, made up of a set of new and colorful characters played by the fresh cast.


	Big names attached include Kunken, who played Ari Spyros in Billions; Costanzo, who has been in Road Trip and Joey; and Crisp, who played Honney Ellis in ABC's Fresh off the Boat.

	











	Given the setting and American talent attached, Twenty Twenty Six could be ripe for landing a U.S. co-production partner, but no word on that front yet.


Twenty Twenty Six was first mentioned by W1A star Sarah Parish on a podcast last year. No clarity on whether W1A favorites such as Parish, who played the robotic Head of Output Anna Rampton, or Jessica Hynes, who played Brand Consultant Siobhan Sharpe, will return for the Twenty Twenty Six series as of yet.


	Creator Morton said: “I'm thrilled and hugely grateful to the BBC for giving me the chance to follow Ian again, this time all the way to Miami, and I literally can't wait to see what happens.”  


	Nerys Evans, Creative Director, Scripted at Expectation, added: “I've been a fan of John's writing for such a long time, especially seeing the different challenges he creates for poor Ian Fletcher, so beautifully portrayed by Hugh Bonneville. We're thrilled to be collaborating on Twenty Twenty Six, I can't wait to see what he's got in store for Ian this time.” 


Twenty Twenty Six is being made for BBC One and iPlayer with additional support from OKRE regarding climate and health expertise. The series was commissioned by Jon Petrie, BBC Director of Comedy. The series is written and directed by Morton. The producer is Catherine Gosling Fuller, and the executive producers are Paul Schlesinger, Evans and Morton. The BBC Commissioning Editor is Emma Lawson. 


	BBC Studios, which has a minority investment stake in Expectation, will handle global sales.

The former couple performed the Sum 41 anthem together during Lavigne's headlining set at the Vans Warped Tour in D.C.

	Pop-punk icons Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley reunited onstage over the weekend for a surprise performance of Sum 41's “In Too Deep” during Lavigne's headlining set at the Vans Warped Tour stop in Washington, D.C.

	Eight songs into her June 15 set, Lavigne brought out her ex-husband — and Sum 41 frontman — to deliver one of the most iconic anthems of the genre. “What do you say we bring one of the OG Warped Tour bands back out here tonight to join me right now?” she told the crowd. “Let's hear it for Deryck from Sum f—ing 41!”

	Whibley, who had recently announced his retirement from music following Sum 41's final album Heaven :x: Hell, responded with his signature smirk: “Holy s—, goddamn. I thought I f—ing quit music. But how the f— can I miss the Warped Tour, right? I've come out of my three- or four-month retirement for two reasons: to be with the Warped Tour family, and to be with the one, the only, the motherf—ing princess.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The two, who were married from 2006 to 2010, launched into the 2001 hit backed by Lavigne's live band, creating one of the most buzzed-about moments of the Warped Tour's comeback weekend.


	After the show, Lavigne posted a carousel of photos from the set with a caption celebrating the reunion: “This legend @deryckwhibley from @sum41 joined me for one of the best pop punk anthems of all time ‘In Too Deep.'”

A post shared by Avril Lavigne (@avrillavigne)


	The moment marked Whibley's first return to the stage since Sum 41's retirement announcement earlier this year. The band wrapped things up following the release of their double album Heaven :x: Hell, citing Whibley's health issues and a desire to go out on a high note.


	The performance also came after a turbulent year for the frontman, who filed a lawsuit against former manager Greig Nori with claims of abuse. Nori denied the allegations and countersued.


	Still, in D.C., none of that overshadowed the shared nostalgia onstage. Lavigne summed it up best: “Headlined Vans Warped Tour last night and it was everything I would have expected and more!”

Palme d'Or winner Jafar Panahi and the Oscar-nominated Mohammad Rasoulof signed an open letter in France's Le Monde, calling on Iran to end uranium enrichment and for the killing on both sides to stop.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Iranian directors Jafar Panahi (It Was Just an Accident) and Mohammad Rasoulof (The Seed of the Sacred Fig) have signed an open letter calling for an end to the war between Iran and Israel and for the Iranian regime to shut down its nuclear program.


	Palme d'Or winner Panahi and the Oscar-nominated Rasoulof added their signatures to the op-ed published Wednesday in French newspaper Le Monde. Other prominent Iranian signatures included those of Nobel Peace Prize laureates Narges Mohammadi and Shirin Ebadi and human rights activists Sedigheh Vasmaghi, Shahnaz Akmali and Abdolfattah Soltani.

	“We demand the immediate halt of uranium enrichment by the Islamic Republic, the cessation of military hostilities, an end to attacks on vital infrastructure in both Iran and Israel, and the stopping of massacres of civilians in both countries,” the open letter reads. 


	Iran's enrichment of uranium has for decades been a cause of tension with the West and Israel. The latter justified its attacks on Iran last Friday, which sparked the current conflict, arguing Iran was close to building an atomic bomb, something Tehran denies.


	“We believe that continuing uranium enrichment and the devastating war between the Islamic Republic and the Israeli regime neither serves the Iranian people nor humanity at large,” the Le Monde letter continues. “Uranium enrichment is in no way in the interest of the Iranian people. They must not be sacrificed for the nuclear or geopolitical ambitions of an authoritarian regime,” they said.

	











	The signatories also called on Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down. “The current leaders of the Islamic Republic lack the capacity to resolve Iran's domestic crises or its external tensions. The only credible path to preserve this country and its people is for current authorities to step down.”


	In a post on his Instagram account, Panahi said he has been stranded in Australia since the invasion. The director was visiting the Sydney Film Festival when the conflict started. “Since that day, I have been looking for a way to come back home [to] my family and especially my mother,” Panahi wrote on his Instagram post, according to the Farsi to English translation.


	“This situation is deeply painful and deadly for me; not only because of the inevitable distance from home, but because of the feeling of incapability to face the suffering of the people who are sacrificed every day in the heart of this war. When the fate of a nation comes hostage to high-flying and power seekers, what is left for us is nothing but anger, grief and the heavy responsibility of telling the truth to future generations.”


	Panahi returned to Iran last month after winning the Palme d'Or for It Was Just an Accident. He has been able to travel freely since 2023, when Iran's Supreme Court overturned an earlier travel ban. Rasoulof, who received an Oscar nomination for The Seed of the Sacred Fig, fled Iran last year and currently lives in Germany. 


	The Israel-Iran conflict continues unabated, with Israeli media reports that Iran fired dozens of 30 ballistic missiles at Israel on Thursday morning. 

	











	U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Iran's “unconditional surrender,” but, so far, has not said whether the U.S. military will join Israel's ongoing attacks.

By inking a pact with French broadcaster TF1 to carry its live sports, drama series and reality shows, the streaming giant is evolving into a giant aggregator — that looks a lot like the Pay TV interface of old.  


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Netflix may entice its subscribers to chill, but the global streamer is working on new offerings and deals to future-proof its content lineup and business. In line with that, it made notable headlines on Wednesday, unveiling a carriage deal with French broadcaster TF1 at Cannes Lions that will see Netflix offering live broadcasts and on-demand content from the partner starting in the summer of 2026.


	“This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that plays to our strengths of giving audiences the best entertainment alongside the best discovery experience,” said Greg Peters, co-CEO of Netflix. “By teaming up with France's leading broadcaster, we will provide French consumers with even more reasons to come to Netflix every day and to stay with us for all their entertainment.”

	How much of a game-changer the TF1 deal presents was a topic of industry discussion following the news, with several analysts predicting that more carriage and aggregation agreements in its vein would follow.


	Some pointed out that TF1 CEO Rodolphe Belmer sat on the board of directors of Netflix from 2018 until 2022, namely until he was named the French giant's boss. Last year, Netflix also partnered with France's Newen Studios and TF1 to co-produce the streamer's first-ever daily drama series for France. The series, Tout Pour La Lumière (All for Light), a family series set in the world of music and dance, became available on Netflix late last week before its free-to-air debut on TF1, along with its TF1+ platform, this week.

	











	“This is a very innovative deal,” with “nothing of the sort elsewhere,” Enders Analysis analyst François Godard tells The Hollywood Reporter. “It pivots Netflix into aggregation.”


	Will Netflix bring this approach to other markets? “They could,” the expert says. “They are a trial-and-error company. So maybe they will wait first to see how it goes in France.”


	PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore tells THR that for Netflix, the TF1 deal “makes perfect sense given its direction of travel.” He explains: “It is pivoting towards a platform for entertainment, and it was only a question of time before we saw typically big hits being streamed on the platform.”


	For broadcasters and others, collaborating with the global streamer is also appealing. “Everyone wants to work and distribute with Netflix,” he says. “It is the undisputed market leader and paved the way for others. While rivals grapple to understand streaming and continue to figure out what to do with legacy businesses, Netflix remains one step ahead. Free-to-air broadcasters have got no choice but to either collaborate with each other as a final resort or partner with a streamer.”


	Pescatore sees no losers in such carriage pacts. “It is a win-win for all parties,” he argues. “For free-to-air broadcasters, it gives them a new lease on life, for Netflix, a broad range of programming, and users [get] reduced fragmentation by having more in one place.”


	The PP Foresight expert sees more deals ahead, adding: “This is the start, and we will now see a chain reaction with others looking to replicate this deal.”

	











Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also forecasts more Netflix carriage deals in the future, telling THR: “They are trying to be a platform and be the starting point for any viewing.”

The Veo 3 video generator is capable of creating both videos and sound based on text prompts, with YouTube CEO Neal Mohan saying the "AI technology will push the limits of human creativity."


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	In a move that could change the video landscape, YouTube will integrate Google's most advanced AI video generation tool, Veo 3, into YouTube Shorts later this summer.


	YouTube CEO Neal Mohan announced the integration in a keynote at the Cannes Lions festival Wednesday, where he was joined by YouTube creators Amelia Dimoldenberg, Alex Cooper, and Brandon Baum.




	“The possibilities with AI are limitless,” Mohan said. “A lot can change in a generation. Entertainment itself has changed more in the last two decades than any other time in history. Creators led this revolution.

	“My bet for the next 20 years? Creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream — as brand ambassadors, big business ventures and visionary storytellers,” he continued. “Communities will continue to surprise us with the power of their collective fandom. And cutting-edge AI technology will push the limits of human creativity. My biggest bet is that YouTube will continue to be the stage where it all happens. Where anyone with a story to share can turn their dream into a career… and anyone with a voice can bring people together and change the world.”

	YouTube already uses an older generation of Veo for its Dream Screen background generation tool, but Veo 3 is a substantial upgrade. It announced the product back in 2023, and has been iterating on it since.

	











	The company has also been proactive in trying to get ahead of potential issues or controversies, including partnering with CAA and some top creators to develop a tool that gives celebrities and other high-profile people control over their likeness on the platform.


	Already videos created by Veo 3 have gone viral on social platforms, including concepts that imagine if historical or fictional figures were vloggers, though Mohan framed it's integration into shorts a tool to “open new creative lanes” for creators.


	Shorts has become a strategic imperative for YouTube as platforms like TikTok and Instagram Reels also battle for shares of the short-form video audience. YouTube launches Shorts in 2021, and Mohan revealed Wednesday that it now averages more than 200 billion views per day, an astonishing number that underscores YouTube's scale in streaming video.


	Mohan also sued the keynote to highlight something that has become a recurring theme for the platform in recent years: That YouTube has become a dominant force in entertainment and popular culture, and telling the crowd in Cannes that creators “are the startups of Hollywood.”


	“Like most startups, these creators are reimagining the industry that inspired them and creating new jobs for writers, editors, actors and producers. Some are even building state-of-the-art studios,” he said. As THR previously reported, some creators have raised financing and turned to entertainment veterans to build bona fide production facilities.

The renowned restaurateur known for his own cooking shows says appearing on the Netflix docuseries was “the first time when I've been in no control.”


							By 

	Nicole Fell



	It was “a bit like therapy, which I've never done,” renowned chef Jamie Oliver says of his experience on Netflix's Chef's Table: Legends. “It was probably long overdue.”


	The Netflix docuseries is composed of four episodes, each spotlighting a different culinary icon, with Oliver being featured alongside José Andrés, Thomas Keller and Alice Waters. The approximately 50-minute episode dives into Oliver's television beginnings with The Naked Chef and follows his journey from novice cooking show host to mentor to activist.




	“Early in my career, don't ask me why — I was genius or mad — but I started making all of my content. I set up a production company as a chef that didn't know what he was doing,” Oliver tells THR. “I've always been in control, and this is the first time when I've been in no control,” he adds of filming the docuseries, which required him to be retrospective, calling it out as something “the program wanted me to do.”

	Having been full-on for the past 25 years, looking back isn't something Oliver has made time for. Of spending 12 hours chatting for the documentary, he jokes, “My ass was definitely sore. I don't sit down much.”

	The show's director, Brian McGinn, proved to be quite similar to the chef, Oliver learned after their 10 days together. But one of McGinn's biggest challenges, at least in Oliver's eyes, was unraveling his packed career. “I felt sorry for him, really,” Oliver says. “I had so much old content for him to go through.”

	











	Oliver says he's proud of his Chef's Table: Legends episode, which covers several aspects of his life, including his commitment to education, whether it be through his former restaurant Fifteen — which trained young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds — or his series Jamie's School Dinners, which showed the chef's dedicated campaign to offering nutritious yet still tasty school meals to children in the U.K. Still, he says the episode was just the “tip of the iceberg” of his career.


	While his efforts thus far have focused heavily on the U.K., Oliver, who hails from Essex, England, feels it's important work that can be done elsewhere in the Western world. “Every story I've told in the U.K. has been relevant in the U.S.,” he says. “We're so different, but we're so similar, and we both can be blessed in so many ways to live in the countries that we live in with the opportunities that we have.”


	The docuseries' message is a universal one, Oliver notes, in that food and nourishing oneself is always important. “We've created all this content, and we'll continue to do that for free,” he says of his series. “British and American kids deserve and need to be connected with food so that they can have choices when they become young adults and can be happier, healthier and live longer, more productive lives.”

"I've grown up in the age of people having iPhones at shows," Carpenter explained. "It unfortunately feels super normal to me."

Sabrina Carpenter concerts could look a little different in the future, with the star revealing she's open to the idea of banning phones at her shows.


	Carpenter's comments appeared in a recent article from Rolling Stone, who shared quotes that didn't make it into their recent cover story with the singer. One of the previously-unpublished revelations was that Carpenter indeed open to asking fans to pocket their devices at her gigs.

	“This will honestly p–s off my fans, but absolutely,” she explained, noting she was inspired by a Las Vegas show from Silk Sonic which required her to lock her phone up.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I've never had a better experience at a concert,” Carpenter explained. “I genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies — wasn't alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone's singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.”


	Notably, Silk Sonic's 2022 Las Vegas residency even featured Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak crafting a song to underline the lack of devices. “We took your phones away,” they sang. “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.”


	“I've grown up in the age of people having iPhones at shows,” Carpenter continued. “It unfortunately feels super normal to me. I can't blame people for wanting to have memories. But depending on how long I want to be touring, and what age I am, girl, take those phones away. You cannot zoom in on my face. Right now, my skin is soft and supple. It's fine. Do not zoom in on me when I'm 80 years old up there.”

	











	The topic of banning phones at gigs has been a contentious one over the years, with artists wishing for fans to live in the moment, and fans desiring a chance to memorialize their concert experiences.


	In 2015, Jack White shared a verbal plea for no phones during his Lazaretto tour, and by the time The Raconteurs toured in 2019, attendees were told to put their devices in locked Yondr pouches.


	“We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time.


	Other acts, such as Tool and A Perfect Circle have been noted for asking fans to observe such a practice, with the latter having made headlines for reportedly ejecting concert attendees who violated the request.


	“You ever go to a play or a movie?” A Perfect Circle guitarist Billy Howerdel asked in 2018. “If you've ever been to a play or a movie, it's kind of similar: you don't take out your phone and start filming, and let the people behind you stare into your screen.”


	More recently, Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood put out a request to fans to put down their phones during the band's Run for Your Lives World Tour. “We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood explained. 


	“The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers,” he added. “We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band.”

	Text messages between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift about the working environment on the set of It Ends With Us must be turned over to Justin Baldoni, a judge has ruled.


	“Given that Lively has represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film, among other issues, the requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively's harassment and retaliation claims,” U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman wrote in Wednesday's ruling.


	Reps for Baldoni, Lively, and Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 


	In May, Baldoni's legal team withdrew his subpoena against Swift as part of their ongoing legal battle against Lively. The following month, Lively's lawyers filed a protective order over “the Wayfarer Parties' continuing demands for Ms. Lively's communications with Taylor Swift.”


	Just days before, Baldoni was dealt a major blow after Judge Liman dismissed Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against the actress, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and publicist Leslie Sloane, as well as threw out a separate $250 million lawsuit against the New York Times. (In December, The New York Times published a story with Lively‘s sexual harassment and smear campaign allegations against Baldoni, which preceded Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni.)

	











	A Lively spokesperson previously told Variety: “The ongoing attempts to once again try and use the world's biggest star as a PR tactic in this matter reflects a public unraveling of epic proportions and serves only to distract from the fact that Justin Baldoni's lawsuits against Ms. Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist, and the New York Times have been entirely dismissed.”

	However, the judge wrote on Wednesday that despite Lively's allegation that the Wayfarer Parties are demanding communications with Swift in order to prop up a public relations narrative, “this concern does not justify denying the Wayfarer Parties relevant discovery.”

The superstar is only the second artist to perform for Spotify's Billions Club Live.


													By
												

	Lyndsey Havens



	As fortunate fans spilled into the intimate and sweaty Maxim's de Paris on Wednesday night (June 18), no one knew exactly what to expect. Vocals? For sure. Fashion? Absolutely. This is Miley Cyrus, after all.


	But when the superstar combined two of her biggest hits – none other than “The Climb” and “We Can't Stop” – into a special one-off medley, fans were floored. “We put this together just for all of you tonight,” shared Cyrus, in her first of two Mugler looks.

	











	The special and career-spanning fusion – reminiscent of two distinct times in the pop star's life – was fitting for an equally special evening. Cyrus hadn't performed in Paris for over 10 years, and she made sure her grand return was well worth the wait. The evening's set was for Spotify's Billions Club Live, making Cyrus only the second artist, after The Weeknd, to ever earn a Billions Club concert. (As Spotify previously confirmed to Billboard, Cyrus' Billions Club Live show was filmed to be released later this summer.)




			Trending on Billboard		







	Despite such a massive milestone, Cyrus stayed true to form and kept the setting and guest list rather intimate, with only a few hundred fans packed into Maxim's downstairs venue. But unlike her famed Chateau Marmont sets in Los Angeles or her recent performance at an equally intimate New York space — all in support of her latest album, Something Beautiful — Wednesday night was perhaps the most wide-ranging setlist fans have enjoyed for some time. 

	











	Thanks to the nature of Spotify's Billions Club Live, Cyrus' set was a tight hour (including an outfit change) of her biggest hits on the platform — all of which, yes, have reached more than 1 billion streams. (On the pre-show playlist, deep cuts including “Cattitude” off her She Is Coming EP satiated superfans.)


	“Being a part of the Billions Club is only a part of me – it's an honor, but in no means is it holistic,” Cyrus said. “Each of you are a piece of a billion, and without each of you, the billion doesn't even exist. That's how important and crucial you are to the success in my life. The confidence and goals that I have achieved [is] because of you and your support. And I've never really been too interested in numbers because math is done from the mind, but true authentic beauty is from the heart.”


	During her set, Cyrus demonstrated just how much of her heart has always been in her hits – and is likely what has pushed these in particular to become some of her biggest. During opener “Flowers,” she emphasized and riffed on the line “no regrets, baby” while holding up a bouquet of flowers gifted by a fan. And while introducing “The Climb,” she shared that the song is “inspired by the effort and the struggles that it takes to become the person you want to be. … I truly believe the most authentic version of yourself is deep within the struggle. … Everything in my life that I can stand here and be proud of at one point was towering over me like a mountain.” (The mere mention of a mountain elicited emphatic cheering.)


	And before performing her Plastic Hearts hit “Angels Like You” accompanied by nothing more than a piano, Cyrus told her fans: “You are the earth angels that make my life heaven.” And in another unexpected twist, she performed the impassioned “Wrecking Ball” next while still backed by only keys.

	











	After an outfit and hairdo change – from teased waves and a Mugler dress dripping with crystals to an updo with a Mugler crystal corset and suit jacket – Cyrus returned to the stage alongside her full backing band, which included a four-person string section and guitarist Maxx Morando. A front-row fan declared that Cyrus looked “super French,” to which Cyrus replied that they've actually been discussing what to name her current backing band, before concluding that “Super French” was the best idea they've heard yet.


	Cyrus then closed the show with a one-two punch of Something Beautiful standouts: “End of the World” and “More to Lose.” Before performing the latter, she said, “A lot of my songs are about resilience, and I'm very proud of that,” noting that the theme of resilience is one not only personal to her and her music, but that is universally felt – and desperately needed right now.


	Halfway through “More to Lose,” she turned to Morando and said she's tired of crying and wanted to do something a bit more fun. The solution? “Easy Lover.” Cyrus performed the song with an extended outro, during which she strutted from one side of the small stage to the other, blowing kisses to fans who were within arm's length before returning to its center to take a bow.


	And after showing off her outfit one last time, Cyrus seamlessly disappeared behind thick red velvet curtains, as if bringing her “End of the World” lyric to life: “Let's go to Paris, I don't care if we get lost in the scene.”


	As the wide-eyed expressions across the room proved, there's hardly a better scene to get lost in.

The Grammy winner pleads with people — again — to respect his boundaries. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



	The Biebs is setting his boundaries.


Justin Bieber recently posted a personal text exchange on Instagram between him and an unnamed someone with whom he's cut ties, saying his former friend doesn't understand where his “anger” comes from.




	“I will never suppress my emotions for someone. Conflict is a part of relationship. If you don't like my anger you don't like me,” he wrote. “My anger is a response to pain I have been through. Asking a traumatized person not to be traumatized is simply mean.”

	The recipient replied: “I'm not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not that I don't see and feel your anger,” to which Bieber responded: “Ouch. This friendship is officially over. I will never accept a man calling my anger lashing out. I enjoyed our short lived relationship. I wasn't kidding when I told you I didn't need you as a friend. I have good friends. Who will respect these boundaries.”

	Then, the “What Do You Mean?” singer told the person to leave him alone and that he was blocking him.


	The next day, Bieber posted a statement on Instagram that said, in part: “People keep telling me to heal. Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues. I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focused on myself I am. Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others.”

	











	The posts come after his unusual behavior on social media as of late, like when he went live on Instagram rapping to a song with gaunt eyes a few months ago, leading to fans becoming concerned.


	On Thursday, just three days before Father's Day, the Grammy winner was harassed — again — by paparazzi. In a video that's now gone viral, the photographers were surrounding his car. Bieber repeatedly told them to “get out of my face” and “stop asking me how it's going.” After they said “Happy Father's Day” to Bieber and continued to take photos and stay on his property, he said: “I'm a real dad with a real family. And you're really in front of my face.”


	“I'm just demanding respect. You confuse my anger with disrespect. It's anger because you're disrespecting me you don't get to disrespect me and get away with it,” he continued. “You don't get to force questions in people's face and take videos out of context and use it against people, that's mean.”


The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Bieber's reps for comment.

Judge Lewis J. Liman says the pals' discussions of the working environment on the set of It Ends With Us are relevant to Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation claims.

Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's text messages will have to be handed over in litigation over the movie It Ends With Us, with a judge determining that the friends' conversations about the working environment on set are relevant to Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation claims against co-star and director Justin Baldoni.


	Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, prevailed Wednesday (June 18) on the issue of Swift's text messages, which have taken center stage in Lively's It Ends With Us lawsuit over the past month. Baldoni first tried to get the texts directly from Swift herself, but then dropped his subpoena on the pop superstar, opting instead to seek the messages from Lively in the normal discovery process.


	Lively's lawyers fought that request last week, saying the actress' texts with Swift have no place in court and Baldoni is just trying to make headlines. But Judge Lewis J. Liman says these messages are indeed relevant, citing Lively's own discovery disclosures that identified Swift as someone who would know that Baldoni sexually harassed her on set and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Given that Lively has represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film, among other issues, the requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively's harassment and retaliation claims,” writes the judge.


	As for Lively's claim that Baldoni is only involving Swift in the case to prop up a public relations narrative, Judge Liman says “this concern does not justify denying the Wayfarer parties relevant discovery.”


	“A motion or request may be, and in this case often has been, both a legitimate litigation tactic and an attempt to maneuver in the broader court of public opinion,” writes the judge. “The mere fact that the request has been discussed in the press does not render it illegitimate.”


	A spokesperson for Lively reacted to the decision on Wednesday by noting that the actress has “produced far more documents in this case” than Baldoni. Lively's rep also says Baldoni and his publicity team have been trying to “drag Taylor Swift” into the debacle since they launched their alleged retaliatory smear campaign last summer.


	“We will continue to call out Baldoni's relentless efforts to exploit Ms. Swift's popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing,” adds Lively's spokesperson.


	A rep for Baldoni declined to comment on the decision.


	Swift's reps did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter. In a previous statement from May, the singer's team said she had no involvement in It Ends With Us and that Baldoni's subpoena against her was “designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.”


	The exchange of documents in Lively's harassment and retaliation lawsuit, which has also dragged in Swift's public opponent, Scooter Braun, is geared towards preparing for a trial in 2026. Baldoni has tried to bring a countersuit accusing Lively and her inner circle of defamation, but Judge Liman threw out those claims as legally invalid last week.

Creator Cylla Senii says T.I.'s conduct is "ironic" in the wake of the rapper's intellectual property court victory against toymaker MGA.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



T.I. has been hit with an intellectual property theft lawsuit over his upcoming movie Situationships, with a web series producer claiming the title is lifted from her own project of the same name.


	The rapper (Clifford Harris Jr.) faces trademark infringement claims in a complaint filed Wednesday (June 18) by Featherstone Entertainment, an Atlanta-based production company run by a creator named Cylla Senii.


	Senii has made two seasons of the scripted web series Situationships, which chronicles the ups and downs of millennial dating. The show launched on YouTube in 2016 and has since been distributed by BET Digital, Amazon Prime and Tubi.




			Trending on Billboard		







	According to the complaint, Senii worked between 2019 and 2024 to develop both TV show and movie versions of Situationships. But in the fall of 2024, she says, she was shocked to learn that T.I. and his company, Grand Hustle Films, were about to start filming their own comedy film called Situationships, written, directed by and starring the rapper.


	“Defendants are engaging in a common scheme and effort to take advantage of the public's association of Featherstone's ‘Situationships' brand by marketing their own film and entitling it ‘Situationships,'” writes Senii's attorney.


	The lawsuit claims T.I.'s alleged infringement is intentional. Senii's lawyer notes that one collaborator she worked with to develop her Situationships show is a close friend of T.I.'s family, and that another producer with whom she discussed the project is now working on the rapper's movie.


	Senii says this behavior is “ironic” after T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris' recent $71 million trial win in their long-running intellectual property battle against toymaker MGA, which took issue with dolls supposedly modeled after their teen pop group OMG Girlz.


	“Unfortunately, T.I. is engaging in the same conduct he fought so vigorously to protect himself from in his own intellectual property lawsuit,” writes Senii's lawyer.


	The lawsuit says Senii sent T.I. a cease-and-desist letter in December 2024, but he never responded. Senii has also challenged T.I.'s numerous attempts to obtain a trademark for “Situationships,” with one of T.I.'s applications getting preliminarily rejected in May after an examiner found there was a likelihood of confusion with the web series mark.


	Senii is now levying a slew of claims against T.I. and Grand Hustle Films for trademark infringement, unfair competition and civil conspiracy. She's seeking an injunction that would bar him from releasing his movie under the moniker “Situationships” as well as unspecified financial damages.


	Reps for the rapper and Grand Hustle Films did not immediately return a request for comment on the lawsuit.

A mysterious disc-shaped object has been captured on military footage over the Afghan-Pakistan border, sparking debates over its origins

In a groundbreaking release, the U.S. military has revealed stunning footage of a disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). Filmed over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020, this footage adds to the growing body of mysterious aerial phenomena captured by military personnel. The clip was made public by investigative filmmakers Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp on Tuesday, igniting fresh debate about the nature of UFOs and UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena).

According to Daily Mail, the newly released footage, captured by a high-altitude Air Force reconnaissance platform, shows a massive disc-shaped object weaving in and out of cloud cover. Unlike previous UFO sightings—particularly the now-famous “tic-tac” shaped objects—this particular UAP is notably distinct. Corbell, who has long investigated UFO phenomena, called this a major revelation. “This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” he stated. 

One of the most baffling aspects of the footage is its thermal imagery. The object displays an unexpected absence of propulsion. As Corbell pointed out, “You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object.” Typically, traditional aircraft, whether jet-powered or propeller-driven, leave behind clear heat signatures due to the use of engines. However, this UFO appears to lack any visible means of propulsion. This discovery deepens the mystery surrounding the nature of the craft, challenging conventional understanding of how aerial objects move through the atmosphere.

The lack of heat is a significant element for investigators. As Corbell explained, “This was captured on a thermal sensor – it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.” The absence of detectable propulsion means that the object is not using known technology.

Corbell and Knapp have estimated the object to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though the exact size is still under debate. “There's depth of field. There's relative distance. The shape is undeniable,” Corbell noted, describing the object's striking movements. The UAP can be seen shifting direction rapidly while weaving through clouds, a behavior that is unlike anything conventional aircraft would perform.

This high-speed maneuvering—especially the abrupt turns and changes in altitude—suggests that the object is operating with an advanced, and as yet unknown, technology. Corbell described the movements as “extraordinary” and said, “You're seeing it dip into clouds, then emerge and reverse direction. That's not an artifact. That's a real object in motion.”

This UFO sighting is not just another curious video; it's part of an ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena that has captivated both the scientific and military communities. The footage was kept under wraps by the U.S. government for years, only recently being released after extensive verification by the filmmakers. According to Corbell and Knapp, they spent over two years verifying the authenticity of the footage, consulting multiple sources with direct knowledge of official U.S. UFO programs.

The investigation revealed that the object was located in a sensitive area—the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This strategic location, fraught with military activity, makes the UFO sighting even more intriguing. Investigators are now pouring over the video's geolocation data, hoping to find more answers.

Corbell firmly believes that the public has a right to know more. “This capture is worthy of serious discourse—not just in the UFO community, but in international and scientific conversations. It challenges our understanding of what's flying through our skies,” he argued.

A mysterious disc-shaped object has been captured on military footage over the Afghan-Pakistan border, sparking debates over its origins

In a groundbreaking release, the U.S. military has revealed stunning footage of a disc-shaped unidentified flying object (UFO). Filmed over the Afghan-Pakistan border in November 2020, this footage adds to the growing body of mysterious aerial phenomena captured by military personnel. The clip was made public by investigative filmmakers Jeremy Corbell and George Knapp on Tuesday, igniting fresh debate about the nature of UFOs and UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena).

According to Daily Mail, the newly released footage, captured by a high-altitude Air Force reconnaissance platform, shows a massive disc-shaped object weaving in and out of cloud cover. Unlike previous UFO sightings—particularly the now-famous “tic-tac” shaped objects—this particular UAP is notably distinct. Corbell, who has long investigated UFO phenomena, called this a major revelation. “This is the first time in history that military filmed footage of a disc-shaped UAP, designated as such by the military, has been captured on camera and released to the public,” he stated. 

One of the most baffling aspects of the footage is its thermal imagery. The object displays an unexpected absence of propulsion. As Corbell pointed out, “You do not see plumes of heat coming off this disc-shaped object.” Typically, traditional aircraft, whether jet-powered or propeller-driven, leave behind clear heat signatures due to the use of engines. However, this UFO appears to lack any visible means of propulsion. This discovery deepens the mystery surrounding the nature of the craft, challenging conventional understanding of how aerial objects move through the atmosphere.

The lack of heat is a significant element for investigators. As Corbell explained, “This was captured on a thermal sensor – it should have detected heat if any traditional propulsion was present. But there's nothing. That's one of the wildest aspects.” The absence of detectable propulsion means that the object is not using known technology.

Corbell and Knapp have estimated the object to be between 200 and 400 meters in diameter, though the exact size is still under debate. “There's depth of field. There's relative distance. The shape is undeniable,” Corbell noted, describing the object's striking movements. The UAP can be seen shifting direction rapidly while weaving through clouds, a behavior that is unlike anything conventional aircraft would perform.

This high-speed maneuvering—especially the abrupt turns and changes in altitude—suggests that the object is operating with an advanced, and as yet unknown, technology. Corbell described the movements as “extraordinary” and said, “You're seeing it dip into clouds, then emerge and reverse direction. That's not an artifact. That's a real object in motion.”

This UFO sighting is not just another curious video; it's part of an ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena that has captivated both the scientific and military communities. The footage was kept under wraps by the U.S. government for years, only recently being released after extensive verification by the filmmakers. According to Corbell and Knapp, they spent over two years verifying the authenticity of the footage, consulting multiple sources with direct knowledge of official U.S. UFO programs.

The investigation revealed that the object was located in a sensitive area—the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This strategic location, fraught with military activity, makes the UFO sighting even more intriguing. Investigators are now pouring over the video's geolocation data, hoping to find more answers.

Corbell firmly believes that the public has a right to know more. “This capture is worthy of serious discourse—not just in the UFO community, but in international and scientific conversations. It challenges our understanding of what's flying through our skies,” he argued.

	When it comes to any government clean up job, there's going to be some dirty work. The work just happens to be dirtier when extra-dimensional ghouls are involved. That's the premise of Remedy Entertainment's new cooperative shooter, FBC: Firebreak (out now), and it's one that the developers have leaned into with hilarious results.


	Set in the world of Remedy's 2020 paranormal action-adventure game Control, Firebreak takes place six years after the events of the mainline title, wherein a government organization dubbed the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC) has set up shop to contain an otherworldly threat known as the Hiss. Whereas Control was a single-player, third-person adventure that focused on exploration and backtracking, Firebreak is Remedy's take on cooperative first-person shooters like Left 4 Dead (2008).


	It's a very different kind of game for the studio, whose previous work like Control and the Alan Wake series have been celebrated for their atmospheric and often experimental storytelling — routinely blending live-action footage with in-game graphics to eerie effect. Here, the plot takes a back seat to gameplay, making for a strange mash-up of inspirations that feels equal parts dollar store Ghostbusters and intense extraction shooter.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But does it work?


FBC: Firebreak is a three-person cooperative shooter that sees players take on the role of Firebreakers, a unit of not-quite-elite soldiers tasked with quelling the chaos inside the FBC's HQ, known as the Oldest House. Under perpetual siege by the Hiss, the FBC relies on Firebreak to mow down monsters that have possessed their office workers and solve an escalating series of problems (often mundane tasks like fixing ventilation and cleaning up haunted stick notes) before things get out of hand.

	











	Players can choose from three Crisis Kits, which serve as specific class specializations. The Fix Kit is a wrench-wielding mechanic, the Jump Kit is an electrician, and the Splash Kit is a poor man's firefighter. Weapons and gear (like grenades) are interchangeable between the kits, but each serves a specific purpose. Around each level, certain jobs must be completed, like fixing machines dedicated to powering fans or workstations, which can be done more quickly by Fix and Jump classes. For the Splash players, their glob-shooting hose can heal their teammates, put out dangerous fires, and weaken the Hiss, who are vulnerable to H20 (and fire, ice, and radiation!). The last bit is key, too, because players themselves can quickly fall victim to environmental hazards and having a Splash Kit handy can quickly correct a series of mishaps.

	Prior to queuing up with others online, players must select a specific level that revolves around a job. Hot Fix requires them to fix all the fans in the area as rising heat becomes dangerous. Paper Chase is a level where players eradicate possessed sticky notes like a power washing simulator. Ground Control is set deeper in the depths of the Quarry, where players pop leech pods like pimples to find irradiated pearls to shove into a cart. Frequency Shift is pulled directly from Ghostbusters 2, where pink slime gunks up the gears of the facility and must be cleared before antennae can be restored. Lastly, Freezer Duty sees the team igniting portable generators to heat up frozen extra-dimensional anomalies.


	The jobs themselves are mostly easy to perform. Some only require smacking a machine with a wrench, while others can be more puzzling at first — like rapidly hitting button prompts to kickstart a fire generator and tossing it into a frozen anomaly without setting yourself on fire. Most tasks have some sort of inherent threat that must be managed, and multitasking becomes key. Gathering pearls in Ground Control requires shooting pods that are high up, collecting the bright green pearl and racing back to the cart (which can be pushed, but slides back on the rails when left alone). In this instance, the pearls themselves are radioactive, and can kill you quickly if not tossed. Players must then either rinse off in a nearby shower (or Splash Kit hose) to reduce their radiation levels.

	There's also the ever-present threat of the Hiss which, fortunately, comes in clearly telegraphed waves. When the comms ring alerting players to a Hiss invasion, it's time to drop the job at hand and hunker down for battle. Enemy difficulty and density can be decided prior to the mission, and for veteran players, a Corruption modifier can be added making certain high-powered foes appear. But at the base threat level, the game is manageable, even in single-player mode. With moderate coordination, enemy AI can be overcome handily — at least at lower levels.

	











	Mechanically, FBC: Firebreak feels excellent to play. The controls are tight and generous with the stamina meter, meaning that all the sprinting, lifting, and throwing required for jobs can be done plentifully without constantly stopping down to rest. Aiming and shooting is solid, with snappy gunplay and reasonable levels of recoil keeping firefights enthralling. On the PS5, the adaptive triggers have a defined crunch when pulling the trigger, which rarely becomes distracting even when the odds are overwhelming.


	Jobs and the individual tasks required can become a little redundant, however. Hotwiring a generator or mining ammunition from a workstation always requires the same rapid input of shoulder button presses, which can harm the player if they mess up. The design shines when players are under duress; fumbling to properly string together prompts for just one more clip of ammo as an enemy's footsteps loom closer can be riveting. But when the same actions are repeated ad nauseum regardless of the threat level, it can be monotonous.


	This is somewhat offset by the pace of each level which, unlike the 40-minute plus journey of each level in Left 4 Dead, can be made to run much faster. Jobs can be selected at levels one through three; choosing level one means there's only a single area to clear, which can be done in a couple of minutes. Each additional level essentially doubles the playtime, forcing players to clear out and complete a job, then move deeper into the facility to do a larger scale version, then race back to the starting point to extract via elevator. The option to go deeper for better and more plentiful materials (used for unlocking and upgrading gear and skills) can be worth the extra effort, but it's nice to be able to play a cooperative shooter than offers a blitz mode. Not everyone has time to descend every layer of hell, every time; an occasional jaunt can be just as fun.


	At present, matchmaking can be hit or miss. Starting up your own team by selecting a job and waiting for other players rarely pans out; it's easier to begin a mission solo and hope someone jumps aboard. Annoyingly, quick start tends to drop you into a mission at random, meaning that any specific goals you might have (like completing certain levels to unlock more) are at the will of the draw. It's commonplace to be disconnected from servers too, losing progress toward unlockables.

	











	While the game is a cooperative shooter with different skins and progression systems, Firebreak isn't exactly a live-service — meaning there's no battle passes or ongoing events to keep up with. At $40 (technically a budget title!), what levels, classes, and unlockables there are what you get, although the developers have a roadmap for releasing more classes, jobs and more for free. For players accustomed to grinding out every inch of content out of their games, there might be a limited pool of rewards compared to games like Call of Duty or Fortnite that dole out endless updates season after season.


	For fans of Remedy's previous games, the tone of Firebreak could be the real issue. While Alan Wake and Control aren't themselves deadly serious, Firebreak hues much more heavily into broad comedy than the mainline Remedyverse titles. If the humor clicks with you, there's joy to be had in accidentally setting yourself on fire over and over again while being chased by a Slenderman-like apparition made of Post-Its. But for anyone looking for deeper storytelling or nuance, it isn't to be found here.

	It's hard to say if FBC: Firebreak will have longevity as a multiplayer experience. It packs in plenty up front, but with some redundant missions and tasks, it might be better suited for occasional spurts of high-octane gameplay with friends or strangers. But that's not necessarily a knock. Gigging as a ghost buster doesn't need to be a full-time job.


FBC: Firebreak is out now for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

SpaceX's Starship 36 underwent a "catastrophic failure" on the stand at its Texas launch site, but the latest setback is unlikely to dent the company's ambitions.

SpaceX's Starship has exploded once again — adding to a growing list of setbacks for the company's rocket.

The upper stage of the rocket, the largest ever built, was undergoing routine testing to prepare for its 10th test flight at SpaceX's South Texas Starbase site on Wednesday night (June 18) when it "suffered a catastrophic failure and exploded," local authorities wrote on Facebook.

The gigantic fireball adds to a string of recent headaches for the rocket's upper stages. The ship exploded mid-flight during two previous test flights in January and March, and fell to pieces during an earlier-than-planned reentry in May.

In a post on X, SpaceX has attributed the latest explosion to "a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase," yet the exact cause of the malfunction is unclear.

"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for," SpaceX added in the post. "Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing [sic] operations continue."

Starship is key to SpaceX majority shareholder Elon Musk's ambitions to transport spacecraft, crew members, satellites and cargo into orbit around Earth and to the moon and Mars.

Standing 403 feet (123 meters) tall and propelled by a record-breaking 16.5 million pounds (7.5 million kilograms) of thrust from its 33-engine Super Heavy booster rocket, Starship can carry 10 times the payload of SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rockets.

Designed primarily with affordable and efficient manufacturing in mind, the gargantuan rocket uses inexpensive stainless steel for its construction and methane — which SpaceX claims can be collected on Mars — to power the rocket.

These early failures are unlikely to deter SpaceX from further developing the rocket. Musk announced in March that he expects the ship to carry Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots to Mars by the end of 2026, and the rocket is also set to carry some of the Starlab private space station into orbit once the International Space Station retires after 2030.

SpaceX has also won around $4 billion in NASA contracts to develop the Human Landing System (HLS). This is a lunar lander variant of the spacecraft, and has been selected by NASA to carry American astronauts to the moon aboard the 2027 Artemis III mission — the first time humans will have walked on the moon in more than 50 years.

The impact of yesterday's explosion on SpaceX's launch date for Starship's 10th flight is unclear. Currently, the company is investigating what happened to cause Flight 9's failed reentry alongside the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

Groundwater records from the last ice age indicate that aquifers in the U.S. Southwest are more sensitive to global warming than aquifers in the Pacific Northwest.

Aquifers in the U.S. Southwest will be more badly affected by climate change than those farther north, a new study suggests.

Climate models predict that a warmer climate will lead to less rainfall in regions like Southern California and wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest. But what could really spell trouble for the Southwest is that groundwater pools there are more sensitive to climate shifts than pools farther north, researchers said.

Modern aquifer records are poor indicators of what happens when Earth gets warmer, because humans have pumped out huge amounts of groundwater. So instead scientists looked at records from the past, with the end of the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) revealing some of the changes that might be coming our way.

"The last ice age gives us a window to explore groundwater dynamics that might be quite relevant to future change," study lead author Alan Seltzer, an associate scientist specializing in marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a statement.

Researchers looked at the period between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago, when ice sheets retreated from North America and storms moved northward. Before this period, what is now the U.S. Southwest received abundant rainfall, while the present-day Pacific Northwest was relatively dry. But by the start of the Holocene — the current geological epoch — the climate had shifted to resemble today's patterns, with a wet Northwest and a drier Southwest.

For the new study, Seltzer and his colleagues analyzed ancient groundwater from the Palouse basin aquifer, which sits beneath Washington and Idaho. Ancient groundwater holds geochemical clues, such as dissolved noble gases, that can reveal past changes in water table depth.

The researchers measured different versions, or isotopes, of the noble gases krypton and xenon from 17 wells in the aquifer, which enabled them to reconstruct water table depths over 9,000 years of global warming.

The scientists then compared these records with records from the San Diego aquifer in Southern California that Seltzer and other researchers had previously compiled in a 2019 study. The researchers revealed their findings in a new study published June 11 in the journal Science Advances.

In response to global warming and drier conditions at the end of the last ice age, water table levels in Southwestern aquifers dropped sharply. In contrast, water table levels in the Pacific Northwest stayed surprisingly stable, despite an increase in rainfall, according to the new study.

The reason for this may be that groundwater systems with a shallow water table — where water sits nearer the surface, such as the Palouse basin — are able to transfer more water to neighboring soils than systems with a deep water table, so they remain relatively stable. Surface soils are less compact, and can therefore hold more water than deeper soils.

Systems with a deep water table, such as the San Diego aquifer, are more sensitive to changes in rainfall. Without precipitation, these aquifers rapidly dry out, according to the study.

To confirm their findings, the researchers compared the ancient groundwater data from the aquifers to groundwater processes in an Earth system computer model. "The model gave almost exactly the same answer as the isotope measurements," Seltzer said.

Overall, the research suggests that aquifers are more vulnerable to climate change in the Southwest, which is predicted to get drier over the coming decades, than in the Pacific Northwest. Millions of people in the Southwest depend on groundwater to live — and "these results should help direct research and adaptation efforts" to combat water insecurity, study co-author Kris Karnauskas, a climate scientist and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement.

  It's been seven years since the halls of this once-thriving Darlington hotel were roamed by guests… or has it? 



  The rings of the reception bell and tunes of the grand piano are nothing more than a distant memory at the former St George Hotel at Teesside Airport, which shut in 2018.



  And now, the doors have been opened once again as The Northern Echo takes an exclusive look around the frozen in time venue. 



The St George Hotel was part of the former RAF base and became a hotel in the 1960s, but has stood empty since 2018. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Since then, the 59 suites, bar, and ballroom have remained frozen in time, with some of its fixtures and fittings still in tact. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



And while the last time guests checked in for an overnight stay may be long gone, it doesn't mean the hotel is fully unoccupied. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Ghostly goings on have been documented at the hotel for years, according to Geoff Hill, chair of the Middleton St George Memorial Association.(Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



The rooms that were once bouncing with music, dancing, and happy holidaymakers - like the old Mynarski's Bar here - are now just a shell of their former self. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



But now empty pint glasses, mattresses, curtains, and chandeliers are the only brief reminders of the hotel in its heyday. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



The hotel was owned by the Peel Group until the Tees Valley Combined Authority took over the airport in 2018. But days before the deal, Peel closed the hotel.(Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Geoff, from Sedgefield, said it was a "crying shame" to see the hotel this way - but said that many areas have actually stood the test of time. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



And as with many abandoned hotels, talk can often turn to its paranormal guests - and it's fair to say Geoff knows a few. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)Geoff (pictured) said arguably the hotel's most famous resident is flying officer Raymond Thomas Norman, who died after his plane crashed into the side of the hotel. (IMAGE: CHRIS BOOTH)Raymond's Gloster Meteor aircraft lost control and ploughed into Room 52 on November 24, 1951 - and despite surviving the crash, he was killed by falling bricks. 



The room he crashed into, Room 52, has since been split into two, but back then was normally occupied by a flight controller. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)Geoff said his wife would work in the room and Raymond would "tug her apron". He said: "She would say: 'Raymond, please stop, I have got work to do!" (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Since its closure, the building has even been used by police to train tracker and sniffer dogs, with officers hiding items throughout the venue (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Geoff, who stayed in Room 16 when he got married, said he believes Room 44 is home to its own hanger-twitching poltergeist. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO) 



Geoff's grandson, air cadet Reece Downs, 19, said he had also seen some otherwordly incidents - describing how he saw someone walk past while alone. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



Suites are now in varying states and boast random bits of furniture, mainly due to an auction was held for fixtures and fittings after the closure in 2018. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



This bathroom, for example, looks almost ready to use. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)One room that still looks well is The Spitfire Room, which was once stayed in by Queen Elizabeth in 1951. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



And one of the most striking features of the site is the ballroom, where many weddings and functions were held over the years. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)Inside the ballroom. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



It hasn't changed much from its closing day either - with the grey carpets and panelling looking almost brand new. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)



A particularly sad room for Geoff is the RAF Middleton St George Memorial Room, where an array of memorabilia and wartime artifacts once adorned the walls. (Image: THE NORTHERN ECHO)

The friends of the slain Boston cop at the heart of Karen Read's murder trial slammed the justice system following her acquittal yesterday.

Read, 45, was found not guilty of the January 2022 murder of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, after jurors rejected the prosecution's argument that she hit him with her SUV when she dropped him at a house party and left him to die in the snow. 

Her defense team alleged that Read was the victim of an elaborate plot by local Boston law enforcement to frame her, claiming other police officers at the gathering killed O'Keefe.

After Read's first trial last year ended in a hung jury, the case gained national attention amid scrutiny over Read's claims that investigators planted evidence and covered up other suspects. 

After Read walked free from the murder charge, O'Keefe's loved ones, including the party's host Brian Albert, condemned the not guilty verdict as a 'miscarriage of justice.' 

'Today, our hearts are with John and the entire O'Keefe family. They have suffered through so much and deserved better from our justice system,' they said in a statement. 

'While we may have more to say in the future, today we mourn with John's family and lament the cruel reality that this prosecution was infected by lies and conspiracy theories spread by Karen Read, her defense team, and some in the media. 

'The result is a devastating miscarriage of justice.' 

The statement was penned by Jennifer McCabe, Matthew McCabe, Chris Albert, Julie Albert, Colin Albert, Nicole Albert, Brian Albert, Kerry Roberts, and Curt Roberts, some of whom were at the house party that O'Keefe was found outside of. 

Read's attorneys argued that some attendees at the party including Brian and Colin Albert and Brian Higgins could have been involved in killing O'Keefe, however none have been formally accused of any wrongdoing by authorities. 

Read's case sharply divided opinions in Boston and the true crime community, with the accused gaining an ardent following who gathered at court during her trial. 

The 'Free Karen Read' supporters were such a presence at her trial that the judge ordered they be kept 500 feet away from the courthouse and banned attendees inside the court from wearing pink, a color that they wore to show support for Read. 

Huge cheers erupted outside the trial as the not guilty verdict was read on Wednesday, with Read thanking her supporters in a speech from the courthouse steps soon after. 

'I could not be standing here without these amazing supporters,' she said. 'No one has fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than I have.' 

Read was found not guilty on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but was convicted on Wednesday on the lesser charge of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. 

The penalty could result in over two years in state prison, but typically is limited to probation. 

The verdict brought fresh scrutiny over those who attended the house party O'Keefe was found outside. 

This included several of those who released the statement slamming the 'miscarriage of justice', including party-goer Jennifer McCabe, whose internet searches on the night of O'Keefe's death became central to the defense. 

Several hours before O'Keefe was found dead on the front lawn of Albert's home, McCabe searched how long it takes 'to die in the cold.' 

Prosecutors argued that there was no evidence that O'Keefe ever went inside the house party, however forensic investigators never took evidence from inside Albert's home, muddying theories over whether he was beaten inside. 

Read and O'Keefe had been drinking heavily on the night he died, and voice messages she left him that night where she fumed over their turbulent relationship were also played in court.

The couple had been dating for two years at the time of O'Keefe's death. He had been serving on the Boston Police Department for 16 years. 

After saying she dropped O'Keefe at Albert's home for an afterparty, Read said she woke up around 5am and panicked when he hadn't returned home, immediately driving back to the scene of the house party. 

Read then searched for O'Keefe with a friend, and prosecutors allege that during the search she told her friend: 'What if he's dead? What if a plow hit him? … I don't remember anything from last night, we drank so much I don't remember anything.'

At 6am, Read found O'Keefe laying in the snow outside Albert's home. A first responder on the scene reportedly claimed Read repeatedly cried out, 'I hit him, I hit him'. 

Investigators said they found pieces of broken taillight around O'Keefe's body, however Read's defense alleged this could have been planted after the debris was not found in an initial search and was only discovered hours later. 

 'She could have driven home, they could have talked about it the next day... (instead), she takes a 6,000-pound Lexus and she makes a decision - she steps on the gas after banging it into reverse,' prosecutors said.

O'Keefe's phone data last recorded at 12:32am that night, the same time that prosecutors argued car data from Read's SUV showed she hit the reverse pedal hard. 

The phone's temperature then steadily dropped over the next several hours, which prosecutors said was evidence that he never went inside and lay in the snow after they say he was hit.  

O'Keefe was rushed to the hospital when he was found hours later, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy found that the cause of death was blunt impact injuries and hypothermia. 

Read's defense pointed to apparent dog bite marks on O'Keefe's body they argued were evidence that he had been attacked by Albert's dog. 

The defense alleged that the close-knit cop community of Canton, Massachusetts helped the cover-up of O'Keefe's murder inside the party, saying the lack of forensic investigating inside the home was because of the host's ties to law enforcement. 

'What if it wasn't the home of a Boston cop?' Read's attorney Alan Jackson said in his closing argument. 

'We can be certain that investigators would have torn that house apart to get answers.'  

Read, a financial analyst and college professor, also faced backlash from followers of her case for her antics, including winking at cameras, embracing her supporters and snacking and laughing in the courthouse. 

The bungled investigation ultimately led Read to walk free from the charges, Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University who closely followed the case, told the New York Times. 

'The defense did a very good job of poking holes in the prosecution's case and generating reasonable doubt about her guilt,' he said in his analysis of the verdict. 

'At bottom, trials are about putting the government's evidence to the test. Norfolk prosecutors simply failed the test.'

Jason Aldean sat down with Taste of Country Nights and rolled through the gamut of conspiracy theories, and you will be surprised which ones he believes in and which ones he refutes.

Taste of Country Nights host Evan Paul began tossing out the conspiracy theories to Aldean, who gave his answers:

Interesting answer to the last one about the Illuminati, due to the fact that the Aldeans are friends with President Donald Trump, and Aldean was tapped to perform at Trump's inaugural ball on Jan. 20.

Could it be possible that some of Aldean's opinions could have been swayed by the fact that he is an acquaintance of the current President of the United States?

Of course, we can't confirm that, but we do know that the "Whiskey Drink" singer does have President Trump's cell phone number, and the two text one another.

Granted, those texts are more along the lines of talking about golf, but it could be intimidating to answer conspiracy theories about our country and the world knowing that one wrong answer could solicit a text from the President of the United States of America.

Eleven-year-old orphan Elio (voiced by Yonas Kibreab) is ­obsessed with outer space and the prospect of extraterrestrial life there. So much so, in fact, that he's using homemade apparatus to send a signal offering himself up for alien abduction.

When events at the nearby airforce base where aunt and guardian Olga (Zoe Saldana) works bring that dream to reality, Elio is zapped to the Communiverse, a peaceful space society of various alien races.

But he's mistaken for an official emissary from Earth rather than just a lonely boy reaching out to see who's listening. When Elio befriends the offspring of a galactic warlord, he causes a diplomatic incident.

This is all very “nice”, with the character expressions and elasticated action sequences bound to strike a chord with little people. But Pixar's name was built upon the grown-up wit it smuggled beneath the kid-acting, somewhere Elio declines to boldly go.

As for the title character and the story's child-alien bromance, co-directors Madeline Sharafian, Domee Shi and Adrian Molina seem to be banking on their target market not having seen a certain ­Spielberg sci-fi classic just yet.

You don't have to be a trained fashion designer to join Alien Fashion Week. All you need is the proper canvas—and that's where the AI picture maker comes in as your gateway. Rather than drawing, simply put into words your ideal alien fashion and let the gadget bring it to life with extraterrestrial panache.

Try this prompt: “A six-limbed alien clad in a liquid chrome jumpsuit, pale wings with circuitry runners, and earrings fashioned from orbiting moons strutting down a crystalline catwalk on a space station.”



Feel bolder? Include environmental details—glowing mushrooms of the onlookers, nebula-hued spotlights, or robo-tailors tweaking sleeves on the go. In just a few phrases, you can bring the whole setting to life that seems ripped from a space opera's high-fashion conclusion.

Fashion houses from other worlds

If you're going to design alien fashion, you'll need a house to represent your vision. Maybe your brand is called “VOIDRIFT” and specializes in geometric gowns stitched from dark matter threads. Or Glimmr, a high-concept label that tailors clothing for light-based beings who change shape every 17 minutes.



Every fashion brand for space needs a logo—and luckily, you don't need to create one from the ground up. Employ Dreamina's AI logo generator to create a visual identity that blends cosmic sophistication with future weirdness. Whether tentacle typography, starry night skies formed into brand initials, or flowing alien glyphs inserted into holographic crests, AI can make it happen with a surreal, out-of-this-world look.

Once you've got your logo, add it to digital lookbooks, posters for your intergalactic fashion show, or merch from your fictional planetary boutique.

Accessories that orbit your art

No look is complete without the accessories—and that's where things get truly fun. Imagine designing:



Make these designs into portable, collectible art with Dreamina's sticker maker. Produce sticker sets of your best looks: each alien model in a stance, their clothing in full gear, accessories whizzing in the background. You can even make themed sticker sheets—such as “Venusian Streetwear” or “Haute Mars Couture“—and trade them with fellow worldbuilders, gamers, or fashion dweebs.



Your stickers aren't adorable–they're an invitation to a world of visual possibility only you can imagine.

Alien silhouettes with history

Alien style is so interesting because every look has a story behind it. When you create a look, consider:

Every tiny detail can mean much politically, emotionally, and ceremonially. You are not just making clothes. You are making history.

Use AI-generated art to animate these figures. Combine the fashion with bios, snippets of lore, or fictional interviews with methane moon models in Sector YZ-4. The richer the worldbuilding, the more engaging your visual narrative.

Host your own space runway

Once your designs are complete, think about hosting your own virtual fashion show. Display your work in a scrollable “runway” thread, share a carousel on social media with fake commentary, or produce a zine called Intergalactic Vogue: The Outer Rim Edition.

What would be a strobe-light gala

Alien DJs spinning synthwave from Mercury, tentacled influencers weighing in from floating front-row seats. With your logo at the front, backstory each photo, and allow people to get lost in your orbit.



Fashion Week is then for you, from your five friends to five thousand internet strangers. It is unlike any other-an-otherworldly gathering sewn from starlight, circuitry, and imagination.

Conclusion

Fashion does not have to remain earthbound. Indeed, the most revolutionary ideas are most likely lightyears ahead of what's conventional. So don your design helmet, get in touch with your space stylist, and launch your concepts into space with Dreamina's fast and efficient image generation. The universe is your catwalk—and there's no dress code in space.
