Isack Hadjar saw his run of points results come to an end at the Canadian Grand Prix after finishing a difficult race down in P16, while Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson also acknowledged that it had been a “tough weekend” as he recorded a third DNF of the season. After starting on the medium tyres from P12 on the grid – having received a three-place grid drop for impeding Williams' Carlos Sainz during Qualifying – Hadjar ran a one-stop strategy but lost further positions during the race. Reflecting on the struggles that affected his afternoon at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, Hadjar explained: “I think we just pitted a bit too late. “After that it was just a DRS train and towards the end I was lacking so much pace compared to the cars around. It was also a tricky few days in Montreal for Lawson. “I think obviously it was going to be a very difficult race anyway from the pit lane, but we had a cooling issue at the end so unfortunately we had to retire. Like Hadjar, Lawson gave his take on why the weekend in Montreal had proven particularly tough for Racing Bulls and admitted that the squad now need to regroup. “[It] was a pretty specific thing we struggled with in Qualifying, but the pace of the car was actually quite good,” said Lawson. “And then obviously what happened in the race today is a little bit out of our control, so it's a shame but obviously we've just got to keep resetting and looking ahead.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cool-down room: Russell, Verstappen and Antonelli give their take on Norris/Piastri clash The Cooldown Room | 'Quote or Nope' with Guenther Steiner Ferrari team boss Fred Vasseur explains what went wrong for the Scuderia in Montreal. Charles Leclerc came home fifth and Lewis Hamilton sixth, both inheriting a position thanks to the late retirement of Lando Norris. But Ferrari were not on the pace of Mercedes, Red Bull or McLaren – and that wasn't purely down to the car. Leclerc crashed on Friday in Free Practice 1, which cost him the entirety of FP2 as well. Those questions intensified during the race, with Leclerc querying the decision to put him onto a two-stop strategy. And Ferrari's cause was not helped by Hamilton picking up floor damage after hitting an animal. "And at the end the fight is so tight – I'm not speaking about lap time or race time, I'm speaking about that you can change the position for almost nothing from one weekend to another one. Vasseur added that, with the margins so small in 2025, executing the perfect weekend matters almost more than car set-up or any upgrades a team might bring. But it's the same for everybody, we have to do a better job.” Vasseur hinted that Ferrari would have some small upgrades in Austria – but was keen to stress that sharpening up the operation across the whole weekend would have far bigger an impact than any upgrades. “If we want to achieve, if we want to start from the first rows and to have a clean weekend as [in] Monaco, we need to do a very smooth weekend in terms of execution, and it's where we failed massively in Canada,” he concluded. Ferrari have slipped back to third in the Teams' Championship, 16 points behind Mercedes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cool-down room: Russell, Verstappen and Antonelli give their take on Norris/Piastri clash It was a tough day for Alpine at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Franco Colapinto slipping backwards from P10 while Pierre Gasly remained out of contention for points. Franco Colapinto was left to rue a “wrong” strategy after slipping backwards and out of the points at the Canadian Grand Prix, while Alpine team mate Pierre Gasly also conceded that the team “need to review” following a tough afternoon in Montreal. Things had initially looked promising for Colapinto, who lined up in P10 on the grid after outqualifying Gasly for the first time since making his F1 comeback. However, after losing a position early on to Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, the Argentine later lost out further when he found himself in traffic following his first pit stop. It proved to be a difficult race from then onwards for Colapinto and he ultimately crossed the line in 13th, having been unable to work his way back up into the top 10. “It was tricky to know [if] we were doing the wrong thing, but I think we definitely were doing the wrong stuff. “I had really slow pace after that pit stop with the dirty air and [it was] very tricky to overtake, just power [limited] on the straights and it just made our race very tricky. “It was tough out there today, I think still [there were] some things learned and some things to take, but we need to focus on the next one.” “It's just that when you start in the points you want to stay there, and it feels like we didn't do the right things today to try and stay [there], and that's the only thing.” It was also a challenging day at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve for Gasly. Gasly's tricky afternoon also saw him forced wide onto the grass by Lance Stroll during a battle for P17, an incident that resulted in the Aston Martin driver receiving a 10-second time penalty. I feel like he could have done a slightly better job to give me a bit more room – not talking about much, I know we're both at the limit and we're talking a few centimetres.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cool-down room: Russell, Verstappen and Antonelli give their take on Norris/Piastri clash Yuki Tsunoda gave his honest reflections after ending the Canadian Grand Prix in P12 as he continues to get to grips with the Red Bull. Tsunoda's prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren's Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field. Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that's it. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there's a bit of motivation there.” Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”. While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car. [In] these moments I'm having a lot of pressure, sometimes I'm not enjoying them that much but it's part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.” Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team's home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.</p>
