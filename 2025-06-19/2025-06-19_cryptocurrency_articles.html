                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto Exchange Token a Surprise Winner as Bitcoin, ETH and XRP Stay Flat: Analysis The crypto market finds itself at a crossroads as geopolitical tensions rattle global financial markets. Total cryptocurrency market capitalization sits at $3.58 trillion, right around where it was yesterday. Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $104,000 mark, again, right around where it was yesterday. In the macro picture, the Israel-Iran conflict has sent oil prices surging 7%, with Brent crude touching $78, while traditional safe havens like gold see renewed interest. The S&P 500 hovers just below 6,000 points, reflecting broader market uncertainty as investors juggle inflation concerns, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and escalating Middle East tensions. For one, because it's funny and memes trade on vibes. Fartcoin's 9.7% tumble today exemplifies the volatile nature of meme coin trading. This "sell the news" pattern is a textbook reaction that experienced traders often anticipate. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Fartcoin sits at 42, nearing oversold territory—this metric measures momentum by comparing recent gains to losses, with readings below 50 suggesting bearish pressure is building. When RSI drops below 50, it often signals that sellers are gaining control, making short-term rebounds less likely. ADX measures how strong a price trend is regardless of direction—readings below 25 suggest the market lacks conviction, meaning traders should expect choppy, directionless action rather than sustained moves. When price falls below these key moving averages, it typically indicates that the short-term trend has turned negative, and traders often use these levels as dynamic resistance points to sell rallies. Crypto exchange OKX's token climbed all the way up to $54.70 before a minor correction to its current price of $52.87—still enough for a 9.87% price jump on the day. OKX's 28th token burn removed 42.4 million OKB from circulation, representing 20% of the circulating supply—a move that typically creates immediate scarcity and drives prices higher as remaining tokens become more valuable. OKB's RSI reading at 55.26 actually shows neutral-to-bullish momentum rather than oversold conditions. This suggests OKB has already recovered from oversold levels and is now in healthier territory above 50, which typically indicates bullish momentum when combined with price above key EMAs. Combined with the oversold bounce, this suggests a potential trend reversal is underway, though experienced traders with an eye for technicals will wait for ADX to rise above 25 to confirm a new uptrend is established. Price action shows OKB reclaiming the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $52.81—these levels act as natural support and resistance based on mathematical ratios traders widely monitor. Breaking above this level with volume suggests buyers are regaining control. As always, though, it's impossible to say with certainty whether the move is just a reaction to big news or a natural correction that will maintain momentum over time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the conflict between Israel and Iran erupted on June 3, Bitcoin has dropped 3% to about $104,000, while Ethereum has shed nearly 10%, falling to $2,500. “Markets will be swayed by rising Middle East conflict updates and any shifts in Bitcoin ETF flows over the coming week,” Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, a crypto research firm, told DL News. “Macroeconomic uncertainty could fuel fresh volatility across crypto and drive investor sentiment.” That brings their total holdings up to about $131 billion. Options traders aren't betting on a speedy recovery for crypto prices. Deribit data shows that Bitcoin put options — bearish bets — are gaining ground, especially around the $100,000 price tag. It's more risk management in the short term,” said Liu. “As news shifts sentiment between fear and greed, uncertainty grows.” XRP traders are also hedging their bets for a price drop. US President Donald Trump hinted this week that the US could soon intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict, warning Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei that “our patience is wearing thin.” In fact, Trump cut short a G7 summit and ordered the National Security Council to convene. Meanwhile, prediction platform Polymarket shows odds of a US military strike against Iran before July at 61%, down from 70% earlier this week. US stocks dipped, oil prices jumped, while gold slid. Data from the Federal Reserve doesn't offer much optimism, either. The money printer isn't coming back anytime soon, said Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday. Inflation, meanwhile, remains stubborn, and interest rates will stay high — a situation that doesn't help risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shrinking liquid supply, persistent ETF demand, and strong technical factors could push ETH price above $4,000. Spot ETH ETF net inflows totalled $861.3 million over the last two weeks. ETH price could rally toward the bull flag's target of $4,100 if a key trendline breaks. “Ethereum price price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level,” said popular crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades in a June 16 post on X Several bullish signs suggest that ETH is well-positioned to break above $3,000 in the following days or weeks. One factor supporting Ether's bullish argument is persistent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Related: Ether price stable near $2.4K as crypto investors bet on long-term growth Spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day inflow streak before it broke on June 13, but rebounded with three consecutive days of fresh inflows between June 16-18, including over $19 million on Wednesday. These investment products have seen net inflows totaling $861.3 million over the last two weeks, as per data from Farside Investors. As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and reflect growing confidence among traditional finance players, despite initial market panic from the Israel-Iran conflict. Ether staked increased by more than 500,000 ETH between June 1 and June 15, pushing the total locked amount to a new all-time high of over 35 million ETH. This growth signals rising confidence and a continued drop in liquid supply. This creates scarcity that can drive prices up if demand holds or grows. In a June 16 QuickTake, CryptoQuan's analyst OnChainSchool also pointed out that Ether's accumulation addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH worth approximately $58 billion at current rates. This signals strong investor confidence and minimal selling pressure, often a precursor to price rallies. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that ETH price is stuck between two key levels: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,600 acting as resistance and the 50-day SMA at $2,450 as support. As Cointelegraph reported, Ether's breakout from a cup-and-handle chart pattern could result in 51% gains to $4,200.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex was hacked for around $90 million on Wednesday, on the surface of it an almost routine exploit in an industry that already dealt with a $223 million exchange exploit earlier this month. Below the surface, it was anything but. Digging a little deeper reveals this was not simply a cash grab, in fact, not a cash grab at all, but a political message that could end up being a hammer blow to one of the primary combatants in the escalating conflict in the Middle East. The hackers, the pro-Israel activist group Gonjeshke Darande, demonstrated their indifference to monetary gain by transferring the stolen funds to a series of inaccessible "vanity" wallets ladened with the words like "terrorist," essentially burning those tokens forever. "This appears to be an act of politically motivated sabotage rather than a financially motivated hack," Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an interview. The regime has been under sanctions for years as due to international concerns over its human rights record and attempts to develop nuclear weapons. The European Union introduced sanctions in 2011 and has renewed them every year since, even strengthening them in the meantime. Iran says its program is purely peaceful. Last week, immediately before Israel's air strikes, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had violated its non-proliferation commitments. Gonjeshke Darande's tweet refers to allegations about Iran's use of cryptocurrency to evade the sanctions, echoing concerns Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King raised to former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2024. Without Nobitex, Iran, a nation already hamstrung by oil and financial sanctions, may struggle to move capital around in a time of intense conflict. That could weaken its efforts to mobilize and launch attacks into Israel,. There has been some discussion about the vanity wallets. There is "practically zero chance attackers control these addresses," Yehor Rudytsia, a security researcher at Hacken, told CoinDesk. Creating the vanity addresses with a private key to unlock them "is computationally trivial task and might be done in micro/milliseconds," Rudytsia said. "It is practically infeasible to find the private key which maps to such a public address." Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump himself has publicly thrown his support behind the bill, urging the House to approve it ‘ASAP – NO DELAYS' and directly to his office. The broader market optimism caused by the GENIUS Act is perfect for projects like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which introduce significant technological innovation and address a market need. It's well-positioned to thrive in this new era of crypto clarity. The innovative AI creator platform is designed to empower both creators and fans by integrating cutting-edge AI creation tools and token-powered experiences. With an impressive combined following of over 250M across its ecosystem and ambassadors, and substantial benefits for token holders, $SUBBD is poised for mass adoption. As the first AI-integrated crypto creator/subscription platform, SUBBD offers a unique value proposition. Creators can leverage an AI assistant to automate tasks like chat, editing, and monetization, freeing them to focus on content. Meanwhile, users can generate realistic photos and short-form videos, approved by the original creator, fostering a deeper engagement. This meme-inspired token gains traction by fostering a community around the viral ‘Chill Guy' meme – a nonchalant character unfazed by life's challenges. $CHILL aims to embody this ethos, providing a cool and engaging space for crypto enthusiasts. While many coins prioritize short-term hype, $CHILL distinguishes itself by focusing on strong community engagement and long-term potential, making it an appealing option for those seeking a more relaxed crypto journey. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the best meme coins will seek to carve out their niche by leveraging the widespread appeal of their underlying memes and cultivating a loyal following. If you're confident in Bitcoin's inevitable climb to $1M and beyond, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an exciting and accessible entry point. Bitcoin remains the most talked-about crypto asset when it comes to market adoption, making headlines in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve back in March of this year. The institutional confidence and broader adoption bolstered by the GENIUS Act will see it gain even more attention, creating an even more favourable environment for Bitcoin-linked assets. $BTCBULL, a community-driven token built on the Ethereum network, is designed to let holders earn free $BTC and $BTCBULL tokens as $BTC surges. $BTCBULL's unique mechanics are engineered for maximum holder benefit. As Bitcoin hits the $150K and $200K landmarks, $BTCBULL holders receive direct $BTC airdrops seamlessly integrated through its partnership with Best Wallet, one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets. Furthermore, the project operates a deflationary token burn mechanism, also at key $BTC landmarks, meaning the $BTCBULL supply is permanently reduced, increasing scarcity and value. The GENIUS Act has undoubtedly stirred excitement in the crypto market, bringing a fresh wave of optimism and transforming investor sentiment to anticipation. The evolving landscape offers fertile ground for innovative projects, making both $SUBBD and $BTCBULL compelling options for those wanting to capitalize on the next wave of altcoin rallies in what looks to be a vibrant ‘Stablecoin Summer' and beyond.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump's administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging. Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment. Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump's desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives. House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate. “The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean' Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.” Meanwhile, Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ford and Iagon's PoC on Cardano aims to revolutionize legal data storage through decentralized blockchain solutions. Following the news, Iagon's IAG token climbed over 11% to $0.1664 at press time. The collaborators noted that law firms and corporate legal departments handle massive volumes of material, from depositions and court transcripts to confidential filings. These records are often spread across multiple teams and platforms, leading to inefficiencies, lost insights, and serious data security concerns. As a result, this pilot scheme focuses on helping legal teams and enterprises gain control over litigation data. Legal data will be encrypted and stored off-chain, while Cardano's blockchain will handle permission controls, access logs, and data verification. This setup is designed to reduce data fragmentation while providing clear audit trails, stronger security, and smoother internal collaboration. Meanwhile, the initiative will showcase Cardano's evolving utility in enterprise environments. If successful, the project could be a model for integrating blockchain and AI in law, healthcare, finance, and public administration. Ford will serve as an advisor for the exploratory project. Moreover, the company's participation is also expected to encourage other corporations to explore similar tools, especially as demand for secure and transparent data management grows.

Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) told investors it is in talks with two companies to port its AI technologies onto aftermarket control boards for bitcoin miners. “The live and off-line demonstrations of QBT's technology in Las Vegas proved to be essential in convincing some of the major players that the ability to make predictions on the behavior of SHA-256 using AI learning models is indeed, real, as it provides a practical solution to improve the quality hashing power of a miner,” chief executive Francesco Gardin said. Gardin added: "We are now moving fast from the single ASIC implementations of Method A and Method B to the mining rig versions in order to deploy to potential customers and partners QBT technology, while for Method C we are working hard to integrate our product into the new versions of the ASIC chips of two Bitcoin mining manufacturers." Aftermarket boards are used to replace original control boards in crypto mining machines, to boost hash rate and lower energy and temperature costs. QBT plans to release Methods A and B immediately through partnerships with board providers. It will maintain a live connection to servers that run its AI models. The company noted that it will focus on rigs by leading Chinese manufacturers and new US producers. QBT said it is also engaged with two ASIC chip manufacturers to begin an in-depth assessment of Method C for integration into new ASIC designs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week South Korea published the Basic Digital Asset Act legislative bill, which gave significant powers of approval over stablecoin issuers to the Financial Services Commission (FSC) rather than the Bank of Korea (BOK). That was despite recent lobbying by the central bank for a key supervisory role. Yesterday the Democratic Party of Korea, which won this month's Presidential election, introduced complementary legislation that adjusts this regulatory framework, the Digital Asset Innovation Growth Act. While the newer bill is meant to supplement the Basic Digital Asset Act, there's considerable overlap, especially regarding stablecoin issuance. The new legislation also addresses some of the central bank's earlier concerns about regulatory oversight by providing a role for BOK. While issuer supervision still falls to the FSC, the central bank can express an opinion on any won stablecoin issuer and the FSC is obliged to comply unless it has a good reason. The bill also states that won stablecoins are neither securities nor electronic money. Yesterday BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong said, “I think a won-based stablecoin is necessary, and I don't oppose its issuance.” This foreign exchange concern reflects broader worries about monetary policy control. News reports regarding both sets of regulations only mentioned the issuance of won-based stablecoins, not dollar ones which already circulate freely in the country. Tether recently announced plans to launch its USDT on the local Kaia public blockchain. USDC issuer Circle reportedly met with the central bank and National Assembly with plans to visit the FSC, triggering speculation that it might want to issue a Korean won stablecoin. “If payment settlement business is transferred from banks to non-banks, we need to draw a big picture regarding the profitability of banks and changes in business structure.” This leans into long held concerns that if deposits migrate away from banks, it will inhibit their lending ability or loans will become more expensive.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Join the event trusted by enterprise leaders for nearly two decades. VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy. GenLayer, a startup building decentralized legal infrastructure for AI and machine agents, has launched its first incentivized testnet, dubbed Asimov. Asimov is the first of three sequential testnets in GenLayer's roadmap, to be followed by Bradbury and Clark. The company aims to progressively test and scale its “Optimistic Democracy” consensus mechanism. Unlike conventional blockchain validators that simply execute code, GenLayer validators are paired with large language models (LLMs), enabling them to evaluate off-chain data and make subjective decisions—such as determining whether submitted content meets campaign requirements or whether a smart contract's conditions have been fairly fulfilled. GenLayer positions this model as essential infrastructure for the coming age of AI agents and machine-to-machine transactions. The validator program for Asimov targets seasoned blockchain infrastructure operators. Selected participants will earn rewards for testing consensus logic, transaction handling, and model coordination. GenLayer has already onboarded dozens of validators, with more in the pipeline. To support builders, GenLayer is releasing a comprehensive developer stack, including the GenLayer Studio, Wallet, Blockchain Explorer, and GS Library (a Python toolkit). The testnet is also paired with a grant program to encourage early development and experimentation ahead of mainnet launch. Coinciding with Asimov is the beta release of Rally, a decentralized marketing protocol that automates influencer and community incentive campaigns. Using AI-powered validators, Rally evaluates submitted content — such as social media posts — against campaign rules embedded in smart contracts. “Rally is our first protocol built on GenLayer,” Castellana told VentureBeat. “It autonomously evaluates community-created content and determines compensation, opening participation beyond influencers to anyone.” Brands define guidelines (e.g., hashtags, tone, originality), deposit funds, and let the protocol autonomously determine payouts. This setup avoids manual negotiation and performance disputes common in traditional influencer programs. Content creators, in turn, receive transparent, on-chain compensation if their submissions meet preset criteria. “In the future, many influencers will be AI agents seeking opportunities to earn—this system accommodates that evolution,” Castellana added. Rally operates independently of GenLayer's core team and will eventually be governed by a DAO. Instead of manually managing influencer relationships, approving content, and disputing post-campaign performance, teams can deploy smart contracts that use LLMs to judge submissions against predefined standards. For enterprises that regularly invest in brand visibility, product launches, or community engagement, Rally could streamline marketing operations while offering auditable proof of campaign performance. Combined with GenLayer's broader infrastructure, brands also gain access to AI-driven decision systems for everything from grants disbursement to smart contract enforcement, potentially transforming legal and operational workflows in Web3 contexts. These integrations ensure that the platform remains performant, secure, and aligned with broader Ethereum-based ecosystems. GenLayer sees its protocol as the foundation of a synthetic, global jurisdiction—an autonomous legal layer for the AI economy, capable of settling disputes at machine speed with greater accessibility than traditional legal systems. Each phase is designed to validate system components ahead of a mainnet launch planned for later this year. GenLayer is actively seeking professional validators and developers to participate in the testnet. With applications like Rally already live in beta, GenLayer presents a new category of intelligent blockchain infrastructure — combining AI decision-making with decentralized governance to unlock more autonomous, transparent, and scalable systems for enterprise and community users alike We give you the inside scoop on what companies are doing with generative AI, from regulatory shifts to practical deployments, so you can share insights for maximum ROI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins are lagging as Bitcoin holds above $100,000, with key trading data showing sustained sell pressure across the broader market, analyst Burak Kesmci argues. The 1-year cumulative buy/sell quote volume difference for altcoins — excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) — has plunged to -$36 billion as of June 2025. Since then, it's been downhill, even as Bitcoin broke above six figures. In effect, altcoin investors have disappeared, or as the data suggests, they're “MIA.” “Even though Bitcoin is enjoying a bull run, altcoins are behaving like it's still winter,” wrote Kesmci, adding: “Unless this metric starts rising again, expecting a full-blown altseason or altcoin FOMO might just be wishful thinking.” Historically, strong altcoin performance has followed sharp recoveries in this metric, when net buying returns and confidence build across the market. With global economic uncertainty lingering and regulatory clarity limited in many regions, traders appear to be rotating capital into Bitcoin as a safer, more liquid asset, while sidelining altcoins with higher volatility and lower trust.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was a time, not so long ago, when Donald Trump thundered: any country daring to build a future without the dollar would be punished by an avalanche of tariffs. China, however, does not respond with bombs or missiles. Not a currency war, but another map of global finance. Developing a multipolar international monetary system will help strengthen global financial stability. Pan also denounces current flaws: “Cross-border payment infrastructures can be politicized and used as tools for unilateral sanctions.” Finance is no longer neutral; it becomes a battlefield. It is an economic maneuver, but also a diplomatic one. Because where the United States isolates, Beijing weaves ties: Russia, Iran, Persian Gulf. The digital currency becomes an alternative to hegemony. More than 261 million users use it, with a cumulative volume exceeding 7.3 trillion dollars (Blockhead). Daily life is converting: transportation, salaries, taxes. In Chengdu, it is used at the market. Even tourists have access via a simple mobile app. UnionPay, supported by the PBoC, is rolling out QR payments in Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos: the ecosystem is exported. Thanks to mBridge, transactions between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi settle in 7 seconds, with a 98% reduced cost (Blockhead). Central bank digital currencies could increase public profits derived from seigniorage. The digital yuan is not just a monetary gadget. It is a strategic instrument that redraws balances in regions seeking emancipation from the dollar. And even if the RMB climbs, it still only represents 4% of global reserves, compared to 60% for the dollar. China moves forward, with a discreet method but deep impact. For him, a CBDC threatens individual freedom. “We will ban all forms of central bank digital currency,” he declared as soon as he returned to power.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new owners of Nexus Mods have officially responded to fans' concerns about a change in the video games site's direction, after some unsettling details about the company and its plans to use tactics like microtransactions and NFTs in its business ventures. For the first time since its inception, Nexus Mods has changed owners, with founder Robin Scott announcing that the site had been sold. What was strange about the announcement was that Scott didn't name the new owners; fans discovered that it was a company called Chosen. As reported by PC Gamer, it was discovered that one of Chosen's founders' LinkedIn pages mentioned a “Gaming Startup Monetization Cheat Sheet,” listing the things most gamers despise when it comes to monetization, such as NFTs. However, no details were given about how the site could be monetized. Online multiplayer games like Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Fortnite, and Final Fantasy XIV let players from different consoles and PC play together. The problem with monetizing a site like Nexus Mods is that game mods already exist in a strange legal area. For the most part, developers and publishers don't care about hobbyist fans tinkering with games, and will usually only step in if there's some controversy involved. The second people start charging for mods is when companies will start cracking down on them. Perhaps if the former Nexus Mods owner had spoken about the buyers more openly, then fans wouldn't have been so quick to dig into their history. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Be the first to post your thoughts. The Final Fantasy series has produced some of the greatest video games of all time, but even the best ones have glaring issues that fans dislike. These great horror games flew under the radar and sold poorly, despite delivering unique scares and memorable moments.</p>
