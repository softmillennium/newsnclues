Follow:


            Aboard Air Force One late Monday night, having hastily left the G7 meeting in Canada, President Donald Trump took questions from reporters about the escalating Israel-Iran conflict. In the back and forth, Trump was asked about Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, who testified to Congress in March that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon — a direct contradiction of Israel's claims that Iran was racing toward a bomb.
    


            “I don't care what she said,” Trump replied. “I think they were very close to having it.”
    


            Trump's terse rebuke of his top intelligence official set off a firestorm among the MAGA faithful on right-wing media, long divided over the issue of Iran. It also raised serious questions about Gabbard's standing in the administration.
    


            Just a month ago, White House officials insisted that the president not only liked Gabbard but enjoyed her company.  Even as some in the administration believed that she was out of her depth, officials insisted that Trump and his team were giving Gabbard leeway to learn the ropes of her new job.
    


            But that tone has shifted, as multiple people inside the West Wing have grown disillusioned with Gabbard's performance, sources say.
    


            Though she's been among the most visible voices for the president's national security policy, behind the scenes Gabbard has struggled to carve out her own place in the Trump White House. Recently, Trump has come to see her as “off message” when it comes to the conflict in the Middle East, according to one senior White House adviser.
    


            Trump's annoyance with Gabbard peaked earlier this month, this person said, when she posted a 3-minute video warning that the world is “closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” and blaming “political elite and warmongers” for stoking “fear and tensions between nuclear powers.”
    


            Trump viewed the video as a thinly veiled criticism of his consideration to allow Israel to strike Iran, and many inside the White House agreed Gabbard was speaking out of turn, the person added.
    


            “When the president thinks you are off message, he doesn't want you in the room,” the senior White House adviser said.
    


            On Tuesday, the White House and Gabbard both sought to downplay the moment from Air Force One. Gabbard told reporters that she and the president were on “the same page” on Iran, and the White House rapid response team shared a post on X documenting her comments.
    


            An ODNI official called the president and Gabbard's statements on Iran “congruent,” noting “just because Iran is not building a nuclear weapon right now, doesn't mean they aren't ‘very close' as President Trump said.”
    


            “This is just a lazy regurgitation of a fake news story that BOTH the White House and Vice President have already debunked,” Office of the Director of National Intelligence Press Secretary Olivia Coleman said in a statement. “The Director remains focused on her mission: providing accurate and actionable intelligence to the President, cleaning up the Deep State, and keeping the American people safe, secure, and free.”

            Gabbard is among the newer members of Trump's orbit. A former Democratic congresswoman who forged common cause with the MAGA coalition in part because of its anti-interventionist posture, Gabbard was a frequent critic of Trump during his first term. She attacked him for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and even accused him of “an act of war” against Iran over his decision to kill a top Iranian general in 2020.
    


            Now, in near-weekly appearances on conservative cable news and in her regular social media feed, Gabbard exudes an image of the perfect MAGA warrior — physically fit, focused on weeding out “deep state” haters and absolutely loyal to Trump.
    


            But in the White House, some Trump officials have begun to question whether she has fully grasped what the job of DNI actually entails, with its oversight of the government's sprawling intelligence community, two administration officials told CNN.
    


            “It's an enormous job,” one administration official told CNN. “She is still very much learning the ropes — and all the various areas that DNI touches.”
    


            Two days before she posted her nuclear war video, Gabbard was absent from a last-minute Camp David gathering of Trump's top national security officials to discuss Israel's plans to attack Iran. Among those present were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.
    


            Gabbard was on National Guard duty, according to an administration official, who said that the meeting had originally not been slated to address foreign policy. But one person familiar with the session said she wasn't invited because officials didn't feel her presence was required.
    


            Gabbard was back in the White House the Monday after the Camp David meeting, an administration official said. And this week, the White House deliberately moved a meeting to accommodate her schedule, said one official familiar with the episode.
    


            “If they wanted her excluded, that's not what you do,” that person said. An ODNI official said that Gabbard has been at every Situation Room meeting since the conflict between Israel and Iran began last week.
    


            Gabbard maintains allies in the White House, in particular Vice President JD Vance, who issued a statement Tuesday calling her “an essential member” of the team.
    


            When asked if Gabbard was in danger of getting fired, one senior White House official said that the president was hesitant to fire anyone, given the optics.
    


            “He's not interested in firing her at this moment because she's not doing any harm,” the official said. “I think he's questioning her viewpoint as a value, especially after that video.”
    


            Since taking office in February, Gabbard has been fighting to clear a path inside the thorny bureaucracy of the intelligence community. An ODNI official claimed to CNN that Gabbard has identified savings totaling approximately $150 million in contracts, including roughly $20 million by cutting diversity programs and roles.
    


            The job is a tall order for anyone: The DNI has a notoriously fuzzy mandate.
    


            Created after 9/11 to facilitate information sharing and coordination across the now-18 agencies that make up the intelligence community, the office lacks budgetary and operational authority over the CIA and the other agencies it nominally oversees. Past directors have struggled to define its role in the US government, and Trump officials have considered disbanding it entirely in both his first and second terms.
    


            Gabbard has sought to wrest control of the President's Daily Brief from the CIA. The powerful document has long been under the authority of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, but it was produced at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.
    


            Now, Gabbard has directed the document to be put together at ODNI, located a few miles down the beltway from CIA, as part of what an official said was a streamlining effort designed to get vital intelligence in Gabbard's hands faster.
    


            In a job that is explicitly supposed to be apolitical, Gabbard has been overt in her public focus on Trump's political objectives.
    

Former DOD official Alex Plitsas joins Abby at the magic wall to talk through what he sees as three military options that President Trump is likely considering on Iran.

            She launched a high-profile effort called the Director's Initiatives Group designed to look into political priorities of the president, including what the administration has deemed the “weaponization” of the US intelligence community under the Biden administration. She's also fired top career officials she accused of leaking and participating in an office chat group devoted to trans support issues.
    


            Gabbard declassified documents about domestic terrorism in an effort to show the Biden administration targeted its political opponents, revoked security clearances for former intelligence officials critical of Trump, and made referrals to the Justice Department for criminal leak investigations.
    


            She also called for former FBI Director James Comey to be jailed after he posted an image of seashells that read “86 47” — a matter of domestic law enforcement, which the ODNI, as a foreign intelligence-focused organization, is not traditionally supposed to be involved in.
    


            Gabbard and her allies say she is working to restore trust in the US intelligence community by purging it of “rot” that she says “runs deep.”
    


            But inside the organization she leads, some career officials say Gabbard appears more focused on the image of leadership than actually leading. Like several others in the Trump administration, Gabbard has embraced an online persona that at times has more in common with a fitness influencer than the nation's spy chief. Her Instagram is punctuated with stylized photos of her working out. In one post in early May, she answered a comment from a follower who wanted to know what workout shoes she was wearing.
    


            There's also the sheer breadth of her media appearances. Gabbard is a regular guest on Fox News. On one occasion in late May, she appeared on the network for nearly half an hour.
    


            Multiple career officials who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity said it's not clear to the rank-and-file what Gabbard is doing day-to-day beyond posting to social media and trying to root out intelligence officials she believes have become “politicized.” Her husband, a videographer named Abraham Williams, has appeared on campus and has been known to film Gabbard for her personal social media, according to two sources familiar with the pattern.
    


            Gabbard has surrounded herself with a small, insulated team that has largely cut senior career officials with experience running the agency out of the loop, sources familiar with the dynamic said. That has created a very small circle of people who have insight into her day-to-day running of the intelligence community.
    


            It's all made Gabbard somewhat of a Rorschach test: to her supporters, she's a MAGA warrior tackling entrenched corruption; to her opponents, she's a naive crusader, warping the ideal of apolitical intelligence in her zeal to support the president.
    


            Democrats say, far from depoliticizing the intelligence community, Gabbard is doing the opposite — wielding the office for Trump's own political advantage. By involving herself so directly in the politics of his administration, Gabbard risks compromising the objectivity and integrity of the intelligence analysis that national security leaders rely on to make decisions.
    


            The top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees last week sent a letter to Gabbard demanding information on her decision to fire the top lawyer to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community and place a “senior advisor” in an office that is, under statute, supposed to conduct independent oversight of the intelligence community.
    


            And the firing of the top two officials on the National Intelligence Council — the senior most analytical group in the intelligence community, whose job it is to understand and assess the biggest threats facing the United States — has also drawn fierce scrutiny from Democrats and former intelligence officials.
    


            In April, one of Gabbard's top advisers, Joe Kent, demanded that the NIC “update” an assessment that undercut the president's rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act to speed up deportations — an interference that former intelligence officials and Democratic members of Congress say was a disturbing example of a political leader inappropriately politicizing intelligence conclusions.
    


            “She believes she was hired to do the political aspect of this job,” one source close to Gabbard told CNN.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said on Thursday that Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, “can no longer be allowed to exist.” Previous media reports suggested that US President Donald Trump blocked an Israeli plan to assassinate him.

Israel launched airstrikes last Friday targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and carried out targeted killings of senior military officials. The attacks elicited an Iranian response and the two countries have traded blows since.

Katz made the statement following a missile strike that reportedly seriously damaged Soroka Hospital in Be'er Sheva, a major city in southern Israel. Shlomi Codish, the hospital's director general, said the missile hit an old building that had been evacuated.

“There is widespread damage to other buildings at the hospital. All patients and all staff were in shelters,” Codish said. “The several injured we have are lightly hurt, mostly from the blast shockwave.”

Katz claimed Khamenei was personally ordering strikes on hospitals, which he asserted justified calling for the Iranian leader's death. He also accused Khamenei of seeking Israel's destruction.

Iranian media, however, reported that the intended target was an Israeli military intelligence facility located in the Gav-Yam Negev Advanced Technologies Park, about 1.3km from the hospital.

Reports from several Western outlets last week stated that Israel had consulted the US about a plan to assassinate Khamenei prior to the latest escalation. According to Axios, Trump rejected the idea, with US officials telling Israel, “The Iranians haven't killed an American and discussion of killing political leaders should not be on the table.”

In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed Iran had tried to assassinate Trump twice and still considered him a target due to his firm stance against Tehran.

The US authorities accused two individuals, one of them posthumously, in two separate cases of trying to assassinate Trump on his 2024 campaign trails, but linked neither to Tehran. US officials also claimed that Iran conspired with people in the US to kill Trump before his second election victory, which Tehran denied.

Trump threatened Khamenei this week, stating on social media that he is “an easy target, but is safe” because “we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.” He also demanded unconditional surrender from Iran.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has told his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping that Moscow is ready to help mediate between Iran and Israel, the Kremlin said after their phone call on Thursday, which focused on the worsening conflict in the Middle East.

The conversation, which lasted about an hour, was described as “friendly and constructive” by Putin's foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov.

Moscow and Beijing share “identical approaches” to the crisis, Ushakov told reporters, adding that both leaders “strongly condemn Israel's actions, which violate the UN Charter and other norms of international law.”

Putin briefed Xi on his recent phone conversations with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held in the aftermath of Israel's strike on Iran last week.

The Russian leader reaffirmed Moscow's “readiness to carry out possible mediation efforts, if necessary,” Ushakov said, adding that Xi welcomed the initiative, calling it a step that could help defuse the conflict.

“Both Moscow and Beijing fundamentally believe that there is no military solution to the current situation or to issues related to Iran's nuclear program. This must be resolved exclusively through political and diplomatic means,” the presidential aide stressed.

The two leaders agreed to instruct their respective ministries and agencies to stay in close contact and exchange information in the coming days, he added.

Israel launched a major attack on Iran last Friday, targeting nuclear facilities and military sites in airstrikes. Tehran responded with its own attacks on the Jewish state. The escalating conflict has since left at least 639 people dead in Iran and 24 in Israel, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group and Israeli officials.

Russia condemned Israel's initial airstrikes and called for de-escalation. Putin also spoke with US President Donald Trump by phone over the weekend, with the two discussing the possibility of reviving negotiations on Iran's nuclear program.

Trump reportedly has not ruled out direct military intervention in the conflict. According to CBS, he has approved a potential plan to attack Iran, though no final decision has been made.

Israel's strikes against Iran amount to US military action despite official denials from Washington, US Senator Ted Cruz has suggested. Tehran has accused America of complicity in Israel's attacks on its nuclear infrastructure.

Israel launched a series of attacks on Iran last Friday, targeting sites linked to its nuclear program and killing scientists and senior military officials. The Israeli authorities described the campaign as “preemptive,” claiming it was aimed at stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, defended the strikes and called for regime change in Tehran during a tense interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson this week.

”We are bombing the crap out of them. Israel is,” the lawmaker said.

”Right now, this tiny little country the size of the state of New Jersey is fighting our enemies for us and taking out their military leadership, and trying to take out their nuclear capacity,” he added. “That makes America much safer.”

Iran denies having a military component to its nuclear program and maintains that it does not seek nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said it sees no evidence to support Israel's allegations. US intelligence agencies have offered similar assessments, though President Donald Trump has dismissed these conclusions.

Carlson confronted Cruz over his failure to recall basic facts about the Iranian population, including its size and composition, raising concerns about the senator's support for regime change.

Cruz pushed back, accusing Carlson of being overly skeptical about allegations that Iran had plotted to assassinate Trump – a claim brought up by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during an appearance on Fox News last week.

”You don't believe they are trying to murder Trump because you are not calling for military strikes against them in retaliation,” Carlson argued.

”We are carrying out military strikes today,” Cruz replied.

Carlson noted that it was Israel conducting the attacks, to which Cruz responded: “Right, with our help. I've said ‘we.' Israel is leading them, but we are supporting them.”

Carlson highlighted the significance of Cruz's comments, pointing out that they contradict statements made by National Security Council spokesman Alex Pfeiffer, who has denied US military involvement.

Cruz went on to say he hopes Iran's government will fall to a popular uprising – a scenario Israeli leaders have endorsed during the conflict. He added, however, that he would not support sending US troops to occupy the country.

TEHRAN, June 19. /TASS/. Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has reported a combined strike on Israel, which involved strategic missiles and drones and targeted a military command post and intelligence facility.

""The fourteenth phase of Operation True Promise 3 began with a combined strike involving kamikaze drones and strategic missiles. During the attack, a precision strike was launched at a command and reconnaissance center of the [Israeli] regime's army, located near a hospital,"" the report reads.

According to the IRGC, the Israeli military has evacuated its bases and ""deployed its ineffective missile and air defense systems in city centers, using residential buildings as shields.""

""We have already warned that the entire sky over the occupied territories has been left defenseless and that there are no more safe places [in Israel],"" the IRGC added.

Iran's IRNA news agency reported earlier that the headquarters of the Israeli army's cyber command, the C4I Corps, and a military reconnaissance center in Gav-Yam came under Iranian missile strikes on Thursday morning. According to the outlet, ""thousands of troops"" were stationed at the site, tasked with handling intelligence data and conducting cyber operations. IRNA stated that the Gav-Yam reconnaissance center was situated near Soroka Hospital in the city of Be'er Sheva in southern Israel. The hospital felt the impact of the shock wave but did not suffer significant damage, as the military site had been struck with high accuracy, the agency noted.

Brad Lander was manhandled and marched out of the courthouse after trying to shield a man from arrest – but, he tells the Guardian, he's not backing down

As the New York city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was hauled away by masked Ice agents on Tuesday, all he could think about was whether there was anything more he could do for the man he was trying to help, an immigrant New Yorker named Edgardo.

Both men ended up detained, but unlike Edgardo's, Lander's ordeal was over after a few hours. By the time the New York governor, Katy Hochul, marched him out of the courthouse – after proclaiming, of his arrest: “This is bullshit” – videos and photos of the officers manhandling him had gone viral. The arrest of yet another elected official prompted widespread condemnation of another sign of the US's steady slide into authoritarianism. A host of New York politicians, along with a swelling crowd of angry New Yorkers, awaited Lander outside the courthouse in downtown Manhattan. (Andrew Cuomo, the former governor and mayoral race frontrunner, was a notable absence, though he did condemn the arrest.)

“I wasn't surprised there were a lot of folks outside angry both about the violations of the rights of immigrants and about Trump's efforts to undermine democracy,” Lander told the Guardian in an interview.

“The Trump administration has been very clear that they are looking to stoke conflict, weaponize fear, and undermine democracy, and here they are doing it,” he added.

Lander was “just fine”, he told the crowd. He had lost a button in the commotion. But he would sleep in his bed and while no charges against him were filed, he would have had access to a lawyer if they had been. “But Edgardo will sleep in an Ice detention facility God knows where tonight,” he said. “He has been stripped of his due process rights in a country that is supposed to be founded on equal justice under law.”

A day after the ordeal, Lander said he had no updates on Edgardo, a Spanish-speaking immigrant whom Lander had met just before they were both detained. Lander had been accompanying Edgardo as part of an organized effort to shield immigrants from agents who have been increasingly stalking them for arrest when they appear for their regularly scheduled court hearings. On Tuesday, the group watching proceedings at the court included four rabbis, in addition to Lander, his wife Meg Barnette, and other advocates.

He's been showing up, he says, because people in the immigration court system are otherwise unprotected. “This is one of the rights violations of this system,” he said. “All these people in it with no lawyers and really no one, no advocates, no one looking out for them.”

With early voting well under way and election day less than a week away, the New York City mayoral race is heating up – and Wednesday's arrest has significantly raised the visibility of Lander, a well-respected, longtime New York politician who has nonetheless struggled to gain recognition in what is largely a race between Cuomo and the leftist Zohran Mamdani. (Mamdani rushed to the courthouse on Wednesday as soon as news of Lander's arrest broke.) Lander, who like Mamdani is pitching a progressive vision for a more affordable city, is also running on his years-long experience with city government and his bridge-building skills.

Lander is the third Democratic politician recently detained by Department of Homeland Security officials in connection with Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. In this distinction, he joins the California senator Alex Padilla, recently handcuffed and forcibly removed from a DHS press conference, and Newark's mayor, Ras Baraka, who was arrested while protesting outside an immigration detention center in New Jersey last month.

Lander sees in the targeting of outspoken Democratic politicians the fulfillment of the Trump administration's promise to “liberate” cities such as Los Angeles and New York. He said it was “strange” to find himself a casualty of the administration's crackdown.

“But unfortunately not that strange, as Trump has named New York City on the list of places where they are planning to both ratchet up immigration enforcement and put pressure on elected officials.”

In recent weeks Ice agents have been ordered to ramp up arrests, even without warrants. In a video of Lander's arrest, he is heard asking Ice agents multiple times for a warrant – which they do not produce – before telling them, as they place him in handcuffs, that they “don't have the authority to arrest US citizens asking for a judicial warrant”.

The Ice agents who arrested him knew he was an elected official, Lander said. He tried to learn more about them while he was detained. “I asked a few questions just to understand who they were,” he said. They were also immigrants – one a Pakistani Muslim resident of Brooklyn, the other an Indo-Guyanese man from Queens. “I asked about their shifts. I hear that Ice agents are working a lot of hours right now,” he said.

“Brad's arrest was shocking – not in the violence, not in the lawlessness, because we've seen this directed at immigrants and citizens profiled as immigrants – but in the decision from Ice to inflict that violence on a sitting elected citywide official,” said Sophie Ellman-Golan, an organizer with Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, of which Lander has been a member for decades. Along with JFREJ, he has been working with Immigrant Act, another advocacy group, in shifts to accompany immigrants to court hearings.

Lander has gained some momentum after challenging Cuomo during a recent mayoral debate and cross-endorsing fellow progressive Mamdani. But he consistently polled in third place in the race, well behind the other two.

Lander called out the current mayor – Eric Adams, who offered little sympathy – of having “sold out our city” through corruption.

He said Cuomo “made no effort whatsoever to reach out to most New Yorkers” and that he and Mamdani cross-endorsed one another “because we fundamentally agree that Andrew Cuomo is utterly unfit to be mayor of this city”. He cited Cuomo's hesitation when he was asked in a recent debate whether he had visited a mosque. “He has nothing to say to Muslim New Yorkers,” said Lander. “He is an abusive bully who doesn't even love New York City and is just in it for himself.”

While some of his supporters criticised him over the Mamdani endorsement – largely due to Mamdani's openly pro-Palestinian views – Lander said that there was “an enormous outpouring of goodwill for it”.

“It really did prompt a sense of, ‘Oh, politics could be not just about individuals looking out for themselves, but trying to build something broader that would build a more aspirational vision for the city, and help people come together around it.

“Obviously, I am putting my case out for why I will be the best mayor of New York City,” he said, citing recent endorsements as a sign his campaign is surging. But, he added, he also hoped to promote a politics “that's trying to bring people together across divides, and in this case, having one Jewish New Yorker and one Muslim New Yorker cross-endorse in that way offers a hopeful project”.

“Whoever wins, I intend to continue to pursue that hopeful politics.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israeli defence minister acknowledges goal of war is to attack ‘symbols of the regime'. Plus, only two years left to meet 1.5C warming target

Good morning.

Israel's defence minister has said he ordered increased attacks on government targets in Iran to “undermine the regime”, while an Iranian missile evaded Israeli air defences to hit a hospital in the country's south.

Other missiles landed around Tel Aviv, injuring at least 40 people, as Israeli planes bombed a heavy-water reactor and returned to strike the Natanz nuclear complex. The comments from Israel Katz were the first time that regime change had officially been claimed as a goal of the seven-day-old war.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump said he had not decided whether to take his country into Israel's new war, as Iran's supreme leader said the US would face “irreparable damage” if it deployed its military to attack.

How is Israel's military strategy shifting? When Israel launched its first strikes, Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered a strategic operation targeting Iran's nuclear programme, although the Israeli prime minister has made no secret of his hopes that the government in Tehran would fall. After the initial focus on military and nuclear sites, Israel recently attacked targets with no links to the nuclear project, but which Katz described as “symbols of the regime”, including the state broadcaster.

What is the latest on the conflict? Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy-water reactor early on Thursday, Iranian state television reported. In Israel, Soroka hospital in Beersheba was hit by a ballistic missile, Israeli officials said, after Iran launched its latest wave of retaliatory airstrikes. Read our live blog here.

A Tennessee state law banning gender-affirming care for minors can stand, the supreme court has ruled, a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.

The case, United States v Skrmetti, was filed last year by three families of trans children and a provider of gender-affirming care. In oral arguments, the plaintiffs, as well as the US government, then helmed by Joe Biden, argued that Tennessee's law constituted sex-based discrimination and thus violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.

Under Tennessee's law, someone assigned female at birth could not be prescribed testosterone, but someone assigned male at birth could receive those drugs.

The ruling is part of wider pushback on trans rights. In recent years, the question of transgender children and their rights has consumed an outsized amount of rightwing political discourse. Since 2021, 26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, affecting nearly 40% of trans youth in the US. Twenty-six states have also outlawed trans kids from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.

The sole survivor of the Air India crash has helped carry his brother's flower-heaped coffin to a crematorium in the western Indian coastal town of Diu, days after the plane plummeted into the ground shortly after takeoff.

Mental health problems and economic hardship are widespread among survivors of the Maui wildfire as access to food, stable housing, work and healthcare remains a struggle for many, according to a study tracking 2,000 survivors.

Seven men in southern California have been charged in connection with what federal authorities are calling the “largest jewelry heist in US history,” after allegedly stealing approximately $100m worth of goods.

The planet's remaining carbon budget to meet the international target of 1.5C has just two years left at the current rate of emissions, scientists have warned, showing how deep into the climate crisis the world has fallen. The latest assessment found that emissions from 2025 onwards must be limited to 80bn tonnes of CO2. That is 80% lower than it was in 2020.

When residents in a small Swedish town discovered their drinking water contained extremely high levels of Pfas, they began blood testing. They had no idea what it would mean for their health and their children's future. For the long read, Marta Zaraska followed the story.

As the world's attention moves to Iran, what are Israeli forces doing in Gaza? The Guardian's chief Middle East correspondent, Emma Graham-Harrison, tells Nosheen Iqbal that the killings in Gaza have by no means stopped.

The youth activists who put the Green New Deal on the political map are launching a campaign to “villainize big oil” which will push for the industry to pay for climate action so the costs do not fall on ordinary people. “[Donald Trump] takes his orders from big oil billionaires like the ones who funded his campaign,” said Stevie O'Hanlon, the co-founder and communications director of the Sunrise Movement.

After two years, Michigan wildlife experts finally were able to trap a black bear and remove a large lid that was stuck around his necks. “It's pretty incredible that the bear survived and was able to feed itself,” Cody Norton, a state bear specialist, said. “The neck was scarred and missing hair, but the bear was in much better condition than we expected it to be.”

Keir Starmer is weighing up whether to back the US and – as a lawyer – will be aware of the legal landscape

Middle East crisis – live updates

UK politics live – latest updates

As Keir Starmer considers whether Britain should support the US if Donald Trump decides to bomb Iran, the attorney general, Richard Hermer, has reportedly warned him that UK involvement could be illegal. The prime minister was an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war when he was a human rights lawyer in 2003 and will be well aware of the thorny legal issues around engagement in strikes against Iran.

British officials have repeatedly emphasised that the UK is not expected to deploy its military forces in any attack on Iran. Instead, a key issue would probably be whether to give permission for the US to fly B-2 stealth bombers from the Diego Garcia airbase in the Indian Ocean. Diego Garcia, which is the subject of a new 99-year lease agreement with Mauritius that leaves the UK in full operational control, is mainly used by the US. But the fact it is ultimately a British base means that Starmer would have to approve its use for an attack. RAF Akrotiri, Britain's base in southern Cyprus, is also a potential launch site for US aircraft. Any use of the base by US forces would require the green light from the British government.

The UN's founding charter outlines the principles governing the use of military force. There are three possible justifications: self-defence (which may include collective self-defence); exceptionally, to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe; and authorisation by the security council acting under chapter VII of the charter. In the case of the bombing of Iran, the justification given by Israel – and one that would presumably be offered by the US and any of its allies – would be self-defence under article 51 of the charter. Force may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack. It must be the only means of averting an attack and the force used must be proportionate.

The US has taken a broad view of “imminence” in cases of threats of terrorism or mass destruction in the past but it could prove difficult to argue that a US attack against Iran's nuclear programme or leadership would constitute an act of self-defence against an imminent armed attack on the US. The White House would probably argue that it was acting in collective defence of Israel. The strength of this argument would rest on whether Israel has acted in accordance with international law in attacking Iran in the first place and then whether the US use of force was limited to protecting Israeli civilians and US interests from an Iranian attack.

Israel says its goal is to damage Iran's nuclear programme and prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. This is a broad interpretation of self-defence and its legality would depend on stressing the imminence of a nuclear attack. Israel would need to argue that it was the last window of opportunity to stop such an outcome. In 1981, Ronald Reagan's administration backed a security council resolution that condemned Israel for launching an attack on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Baghdad. The resolution stated that “diplomatic means available to Israel had not been exhausted”. Comments from some Israeli politicians also throw doubt on the self-defence rationale. Israel Katz, the defence minister, said on Tuesday that the purpose of the campaign was “to remove threats to the state of Israel and undermine the ayatollahs' regime”.

There is no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have “knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act”, according to the UN. In 2021, John Healey, the defence secretary, asked in the Commons for clarification from the then Conservative government over the ground rules on the use of British bases by US forces. He was told that a proposed military operation would need to be accordance with UK law and the UK's interpretation of relevant international law. The UK's position on pre-emptive strikes is well known. In the lead-up to the Iraq war, the then attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, argued that international law permitted force only in self-defence where there was an actual or imminent attack and that “the development of [weapons of mass destruction] was not in itself sufficient to indicate such imminence”. Goldsmith argued only later that a UN resolution relating to Iraq made it a legal war. Writing in the Guardian at the time, Starmer, then a human rights lawyer, said article 51 might authorise a pre-emptive strike “in a nuclear world” but that any threat to the UK or its allies would have to be imminent and any force used in response to that threat would have to be proportionate. “The mere fact that Iraq has a capacity to attack at some unspecified time in the future is not enough,” Starmer wrote.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Three Taiwanese universities ranked among the world's top 200 in the latest Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings, released yesterday.

National Taiwan University (NTU) ranked 63rd — its highest position ever — followed by National Tsing Hua University (NTHU) at 176th and National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU) at 199th.

NTU earned an overall score of 78.9, up from 68.7 last year, tying with City University of Hong Kong.

Meanwhile, NTHU returned to the top 200 after falling out last year, while NYCU entered the top 200 for the first time.

Several other Taiwanese universities also placed in the top 500, all improving their positions from last year. These include National Cheng Kung University (203rd), National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (345th), National Taipei University of Technology (420th), National Taiwan Normal University (435th) and National Sun Yat-sen University (439th).

Globally, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US has held the top spot for more than a decade, followed by Imperial College London, Stanford University, the University of Oxford and Harvard University.

This year's QS World University Rankings feature more than 1,500 universities from more than 100 locations, according to the QS Web site.

The rankings are based on five indicators: research and discovery (50 percent), employability and outcomes (20 percent), learning experience (10 percent), global engagement (15 percent) and sustainability (5 percent), according to the Web site.



                                                                                Taiwan is to have nine extended holidays next year, led by a nine-day Lunar New Year break, the Cabinet announced yesterday.
The nine-day Lunar New Year holiday next year matches the length of this year's holiday, which featured six extended holidays.
The increase in extended holidays is due to the Act on the Implementation of Commemorative and Festival Holidays (紀念日及節日實施條例), which was passed early last month with support from the opposition Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party.
Under the new act, the day before Lunar New Year's Eve is also a national holiday, and Labor Day would no longer be limited

Lin made the announcement during a reception in Taipei marking the 127th anniversary of Philippine independence and the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The decision reflected Taiwan's commitment to deepening exchanges with the Philippines, the statement cited Lin as saying, adding that it was a key partner under the New Southbound Policy launched in 2016.
Lin also expressed hope

The hottest location in Taiwan was in Sindian, where the mercury reached 37.5°C at about 2pm, according to CWA data.
Taipei's Shilin District (士林) recorded a temperature of 37.4°C at noon, Taitung County's Jinfeng Township (金峰) at 12:50 pm logged a temperature of 37.4°C and Miaoli County's Toufen Township (頭份) reached 36.7°C at 11:40am, the CWA said.

From carbon pollution to sea-level rise to global heating, the pace and level of key climate change indicators are all in uncharted territory, more than 60 top scientists said yesterday.

Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation hit a new high last year, averaging over the past decade a record 53.6 billion tonnes per year — that is 100,000 tonnes per minute — of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other gases, they reported in a peer-reviewed update.

Earth's surface temperature last year breached 1.5°C for the first time, and the additional carbon humanity can emit with a two-thirds chance of staying under that threshold long-term — our 1.5°C “carbon budget” — would be exhausted in a couple of years, they said.

Investment in clean energy outpaced investment in oil, gas and coal last year two-to-one, but fossil fuels accounted for more than 80 percent of global energy consumption, and growth in renewables still lags behind new demand.

Included in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate as an aspirational goal, the 1.5°C limit has since been validated by science as necessary for avoiding a catastrophically climate-addled world.

The hard cap on warming to which nearly 200 nations agreed was “well below” 2°C, commonly interpreted to mean 1.7°C to 1.8°C.

“We are already in crunch time for these higher levels of warming,” coauthor Joeri Rogelj, a professor of climate science and policy at Imperial College London, told journalists at a news conference.

“The next three or four decades is pretty much the timeline over which we expect a peak in warming to happen,” he said.

No less alarming than record heat and carbon emissions is the gathering pace at which these and other climate indicators are shifting, according to the study, published in Earth System Science Data.

Human-induced warming increased over the past decade at a rate “unprecedented in the instrumental record,” and well above the 2010-2019 average registered in the UN's most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2021.

“I tend to be an optimistic person,” said lead author Piers Forster, head of the University of Leed's Priestley Centre for Climate Futures. “But if you look at this year's update, things are all moving in the wrong direction.”

The rate at which sea levels have shot up in the past few years is also alarming, the scientists said.

After creeping up, on average, well under 2mm per year from 1901 to 2018, global oceans have risen 4.3mm annually since 2019.



                                                                                Former Nicaraguan president Violeta Chamorro, who brought peace to Nicaragua after years of war and was the first woman elected president in the Americas, died on Saturday at the age of 95, her family said. 
Chamorro, who ruled the poor Central American country from 1990 to 1997, “died in peace, surrounded by the affection and love of her children,” said a statement issued by her four children. 
As president, Chamorro ended a civil war that had raged for much of the 1980s as US-backed rebels known as the “Contras” fought the leftist Sandinista government. That conflict made Nicaragua one of

                                        The US and Russia make up about 90 percent of the world stockpile and are adding new versions, while China's nuclear force is steadily rising, SIPRI said                                        Most of the world's nuclear-armed states continued to modernize their arsenals last year, setting the stage for a new nuclear arms race, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said yesterday.
Nuclear powers including the US and Russia — which account for about 90 percent of the world's stockpile — had spent time last year “upgrading existing weapons and adding newer versions,” researchers said.
Since the end of the Cold War, old warheads have generally been dismantled quicker than new ones have been deployed, resulting in a decrease in the overall number of warheads. However, SIPRI said that the trend was likely                                    



                                                                                Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki yesterday erupted again with giant ash and smoke plumes after forcing evacuations of villages and flight cancelations, including to and from the resort island of Bali.
Several eruptions sent ash up to 5km into the sky on Tuesday evening to yesterday afternoon. An eruption on Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds 10km into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 150km kilometers away.
The eruption alert was raised on Tuesday to the highest level and the danger zone where people are recommended to leave was expanded to 8km from the crater.

As the sun sets on the third UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, there is much to celebrate, but also much unfinished business for the world to address at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil, later this year.

Against a backdrop of global uncertainty and questions about whether multilateral processes can still deliver, the nations represented in Nice were largely united on the need for a more ambitious response to the challenges facing our oceans, but this was only the first leg of the journey. To protect this life-preserving global commons in time, much more must be done ahead of COP30.

Among the outcomes to celebrate, the High Seas Treaty has made remarkable progress. With 19 nations ratifying it in Nice, and another dozen committing to do so, we are now on course to make this landmark global agreement operational by the start of next year, enabling the creation of marine protected areas on the high seas. That would plug an enormous hole in ocean governance.

Illustration: Mountain People

Achieving the goal of protecting at least 30 percent of the world's oceans by 2030 is not possible without setting aside large areas of the vast high seas — an area representing two-thirds of the oceans and half our planet's surface. Establishing effective marine protection is especially urgent in polar regions, which are on the front line of the climate crisis. The situation in the Southern Ocean is dire, demanding immediate action to advance long-stalled proposals for marine protected areas. Such protections would both safeguard the ocean's ability to help mitigate climate change (by absorbing carbon) and increase marine species' resilience against warming temperatures (such as by removing pressures from overfishing).

In Nice, several nations also announced significant new marine protections in their national waters, with French Polynesia announcing what, at nearly 5 million square kilometers, would be the world's largest network of protected areas, and the conference delivered welcome progress toward combating plastic pollution and restricting the most harmful fishing practices. However, none of these milestones should be mistaken as a turning of the tide for ocean protection. Rather, each must be part of a broader shift — a rising tide of higher ambitions that still has further to go.

Consider what remains to be done.

First, we are still falling woefully short in designating and enforcing marine protection. Even after Nice, only 10 percent of oceans are now protected in some fashion. That is a long way from the 30 percent we need to protect by the end of the decade. Worse, many protected areas are protected in name only. For example, many hoped that an environmental champion such as France would have announced a strict ban on bottom trawling in its protected areas. Still, there is time for more nations to set an example, including at COP30.

Second, dollars still count. There remains a big gap between what has been pledged and what has been delivered. Globally, only US$1.2 billion annually is going toward ocean protection, less than 10 percent of what is needed, even when studies show that protecting 30 percent of oceans by 2030 could unlock US$85 billion annually by 2050. In fact, redirecting the money allocated to harmful fishing subsidies in just 10 nations would plug the financing gap for ocean protection. Government spending must rehabilitate, not debilitate, this critical resource.

Third, the silence in Nice on ending our fossil-fuel addiction was deafening. Although the world committed two years ago, at COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to “transition away” from fossil fuels, this issue seems to be relitigated at every multilateral convening. With the climate crisis providing an existential threat to all life on our blue planet, new unmitigated offshore oil and gas development is antithetical to all our stated goals.

Still, one bright spot was the Blue NDC Challenge — launched by Brazil and France, and supported by eight inaugural nations — which is pushing for ocean-based measures to be included in national climate plans.

The Nice conference must become a springboard for greater ocean action in Belem. COP30 is the ideal platform to announce new marine protections and financing for conservation efforts in developing nations, and for resilience-building in vulnerable island and coastal countries.

As the COP30 president and a coastal country itself, Brazil has the opportunity to use the momentum generated in Nice to integrate the world's response to our connected climate and ocean crises. We have a choice. We can be the generation that turned ambition into action, or we can let our most important global commons collapse irretrievably. The oceans cannot wait. COP30 must deliver.

Earlier that day, Tsai had met with a group of Danish parliamentarians led by Danish Parliament Speaker Pia Kjaersgaard, who has visited Taiwan many times, most recently in November last year, when she met with President William Lai (賴清德) at the Presidential Office. Kjaersgaard had told Lai: “I can assure you that ... you can count on us. You can count on our support

Denmark can be proud of its clear support for peoples' democratic right to determine their own future. However, this democratic ideal completely falls apart when it comes to Taiwan — and it raises important questions about Denmark's commitment to supporting democracies.
Taiwan lives under daily military threats from China, which seeks to take over Taiwan, by force if necessary — an annexation that only a very small minority in Taiwan supports.

Chen, better known as Kuan Chang (館長), is a former gang member turned fitness celebrity and businessman.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) — The world experienced its second warmest May since records began this year, a month in which climate change fueled a record-breaking heatwave in Greenland, scientists said on June 11.

Last month was Earth's second warmest May on record — exceeded only by May 2024 — rounding out the northern hemisphere's second hottest March-May spring on record, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said in a monthly bulletin.

Global surface temperatures last month averaged 1.4 C higher than in the 1850-1900 preindustrial period, when humans began burning fossil fuels on an industrial scale, C3S said.

That broke a run of extraordinary heat, in which 21 of the last 22 months had an average global temperature exceeding 1.5 C above pre-industrial times — although scientists warned this break was unlikely to last.

“Whilst this may offer a brief respite for the planet, we do expect the 1.5 C threshold to be exceeded again in the near future due to the continued warming of the climate system,” said C3S director Carlo Buontempo.

The main cause of climate change is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. Last year was the planet's hottest on record.

A separate study, published by the World Weather Attribution group of climate scientists on June 11, found that human-caused climate change made a record-breaking heatwave in Iceland and Greenland last month about 3 C hotter than it otherwise would have been — contributing to a huge additional melting of Greenland's ice sheet.

“Even cold-climate countries are experiencing unprecedented temperatures,” said Sarah Kew, study coauthor and researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute.

The global threshold of 1.5 C is the limit of warming which countries vowed under the Paris climate agreement to try to prevent, to avoid the worst consequences of warming.

The world has not yet technically breached that target — which refers to an average global temperature of 1.5 C over decades.

However, some scientists have said it can no longer realistically be met, and have urged governments to cut CO2 emissions faster, to limit the overshoot and the fueling of extreme weather.

C3S's records go back to 1940, and are cross-checked with global temperature records going back to 1850.

A senior Russian official on June 19 inadvertently confirmed the staggering troop losses incurred by Moscow's forces during its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In an interview with CNN, Russian Ambassador to the U.K. Andrey Kelin was asked about Moscow's maximalist intentions in Ukraine and its ability to recruit enough soldiers to fulfill them.

Despite ongoing U.S.-led peace efforts, Russia continues to demand Ukraine withdraws from the four partially occupied regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia — as a precondition for negotiations.

Meanwhile, according to figures from Kyiv, Russia has suffered more than 1 million dead, wounded, and missing soldiers since the start of its full-scale invasion.

Kelin dismissed the 1 million casualties figure but did confirm that ""about 600,000"" Russian soldiers were fighting in Ukraine, a number which tallies with Ukrainian estimates from January.

The number is actually lower than the 700,000 (Russian President Vladimir) Putin claimed in June 2024, and the 617,000 he claimed in December 2023.

Kelin was then asked about Russian army recruitment.

""I'm not a specialist in this area, but as I understand it we have 50-60,000 a month, those volunteers who are coming, recruiting, posting, and they would like to get engaged in this thing (in Ukraine),"" he replied.

He did not explain why the size of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine has gone down despite what would amount to around 250,000 extra troops being recruited and sent to the front since the beginning of the year.

According to figures from Ukraine's General Staff, Russia has lost 217,440 troops since Jan. 1, 2025.

The discrepancy tallies with Western analysis of Russia's staggering losses. 

""They lose somewhere in the ballpark of 35,000 to 45,000 people per month, and perhaps they recruit a little bit north of that number,"" George Barros, Russia team lead at the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told the Kyiv Independent earlier this month.

Given that Russia is having to pay people to sign up, the losses have potentially huge ramifications for the country's economy.

According to an analysis by economist Janis Kluge, Russia's daily bill just for sign-up bonuses is $24 million.

The ballooning bills come at a time when Russia's economy is already under huge strain from Western sanctions and falling oil and gas revenues.

""The implications for Russia are grave,"" energy security analyst Wojciech Jakobik wrote in an op-ed for the Kyiv Independent this week.

According to Barros, making any predictions about whether or not the Russian economy is going to collapse is ""supremely difficult to do,"" but the signs for the Kremlin ""don't bode well.""

""If you look at the current Russian economic indicators, for example their inflation rate, their overnight lending interest rates, Russian monetary constraints… government spending is out of control — it's a very loose fiscal policy and so the economy is at risk of overheating,"" he said.

""I don't know to what extent the economy can continue to last.""

Kelin also said Ukraine must accept Moscow's terms for ending the war or face further military advances and eventual ""surrender"" — you can read the full story here.

KANANASKIS, Canada — The Group of Seven (G7) Leaders' Summit ended on June 17 with no joint statement in support of Ukraine, no commitments to provide desperately needed U.S. weapons, and no meeting between President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Ukrainian delegation headed into the summit, held in the remote community of Kananaskis, Canada, with an air of cautious optimism and hopes of winning renewed international support.

Instead, Trump left, Russia slammed Kyiv with ballistic missiles, and optimism quickly turned to anxiety.

As Zelensky arrived in Kananaskis on June 17, Moscow hit Kyiv with one of the largest Russian attacks on the capital since the start of the war — a brutal strike that killed 28 people and injured 134.

Zelensky, who learned of the attack en route to Canada, hoped to once again rally world leaders around Ukraine's defense and convince them to mount pressure on Russia in light of the relentless attacks on civilians. But Trump — the man with the most power to impact the course of the war and prospects for peace — met the moment with indifference. 

Trump departed the summit just hours ahead of Zelensky's arrival, saying he was leaving to tend to a different conflict: ""I have to be back (to the White House) as soon as I can ... because of what's going on in the Middle East,"" Trump told reporters, referring the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. ""I have to be back early for obvious reasons,"" Trump said, without further elaborating.

Trump was expected to meet with Zelensky on the sidelines of the G7 summit on June 17, marking their third in-person meeting since the American president took office in January. After his sudden exit, the Ukrainian delegation was left with the impression that Trump had brushed off their concerns. 

While Kyiv managed to make progress and maintain unity among remaining world leaders at the summit, the bleak state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations casts a shadow over these gains. Zelensky left the summit early, with even more uncertainty about how Ukraine can win the war in the face of dwindling U.S. support.

After a disastrous first in-person meeting between Trump and Zelensky in the Oval Office in February — during which Trump and Vice President JD Vance lambasted the Ukrainian president over what they described as ""a lack of gratitude for U.S. support"" — a second meeting in the Vatican helped smooth over tensions between the two leaders. 

Zelensky praised his brief but ""most substantive"" conversation with Trump following the funeral of Pope Francis in early May. 

""With all due respect to our teams, the one-on-one format, in my opinion, worked. We had the right atmosphere for the conversation,"" Zelensky said after the talk.

At the G7 summit, the Ukrainian delegation hoped to convince Trump to exert additional economic pressure on Moscow through sanctions — which the U.S. president has not followed through on implementing — during a third in-person meeting with Zelensky. 

Trump's exit put those hopes on hold and cost Ukraine an opportunity to improve relations with the White House. Sources familiar with the situation told the Kyiv Independent that there was resounding disappointment within the president's circle. 

Zelensky ended up leaving the summit early too, canceling a planned press conference and additional events in Calgary in the wake of the Russian missile strikes on Kyiv and changes to the G7 agenda.

""What is there (for Zelensky) to say?"" a source familiar with the logistics of Zelensky's canceled press conference said following Trump's early departure.

Kyiv's hopes of winning over Washington have run up against Trump's indifference to a Ukrainian victory and his sympathies with the Kremlin. One expert told the Kyiv Independent that Trump ""does not share (the) commitment"" that other Western allies do to help put an end to the war.

""Trump seems to be walking away from an attempt to reach a ceasefire in the war, and is focused on the Israel-Iran conflict and U.S. domestic politics,"" said Brian Taylor, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.

""Of course, Trump is unpredictable and could change his mind (about providing support for Ukraine), but it seems pretty clear that, for whatever reason, he sympathizes with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,"" Taylor said. 

""It looks like President Trump is walking away from his erratic and half-hearted efforts to make a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine War.""

Trump's lack of commitment has Ukraine questioning the value of participating in the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague. Zelensky is reconsidering his attendance at the June 24-25 summit amid questions over Trump's participation, the Guardian reported on June 17, citing unnamed Ukrainian officials.

One official told the Guardian that Ukraine is in a ""permanent hazard"" of becoming a victim of ""Trump's short attention span,"" adding that Russia has exploited this uncertainty by fresh aerial attacks. The source said there had been ""all sorts of promises for this summit,"" including U.S. arms.

Despite Trump's abrupt departure, Zelensky did come out of meetings with other world leaders with some positive results as well as additional support for Ukraine.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the host of the summit, announced a sweeping new support package for Ukraine during a bilateral meeting with Zelensky. The measures include two billion Canadian dollars ($1.5 billion) in military funding and new sanctions aimed at restricting Russia's energy revenues and evasion tactics.

""To be absolutely clear, this support will be unwavering until we get a just peace for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,"" Carney said ahead of the bilateral, attended by the Kyiv Independent.

Additionally, the United Kingdom imposed new restrictions on Russia on June 17, adding 20 vessels from Russia's so-called ""shadow fleet"" and 10 individuals and entities to its sanctions list. Australia also joined the U.K. in targeting 60 vessels — its first-ever sanctions against the shadow fleet. 

Zelensky said he had told the G7 leaders that ""diplomacy is now in a state of crisis"" and urged allies to press Trump ""to use his real influence"" to force an end to the war.

Trump has not been very responsive to such appeals. During a G7 dinner discussion where world leaders reportedly attempted to convince Trump to impose tougher sanctions against Russia, Trump insisted sanctions were too costly for the U.S., according to Bloomberg.

The New York Times reported in May that Trump opposes sanctions because they may jeopardize future business and trade opportunities with Moscow.

While Zelensky pushes for the support and sympathy of Western leaders, the U.S. pushes back — often with disappointing results for Ukraine. Canada reportedly dropped plans for the G7 to issue a joint statement on the war in Ukraine after the U.S. insisted on weakening the language. Instead of a unified call to action, Canada's Carney released a Chair's Summary on the event.

""I think the possibility of additional pressure on Russia from the United States, in the form of tougher sanctions and further military assistance for Ukraine, are low,"" Taylor said. ""The good news for Ukraine from the G7 Summit is that the other six members of the G7 remain firmly behind Ukraine.""

Ukraine's military has warned that Russian forces have intensified operations across the front line amid a renewed summer offensive — meaning Ukraine desperately needs external forces to exert economic pressure on Russia's war machine. 

""The key questions now are, first, will the U.S. Congress try to force Trump into further sanctions and, second, how much can Europe make up for the absence of U.S. support?"" Taylor told the Kyiv Independent.

A U.S. sanctions bill, jointly introduced on April 1 by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, seeks to impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries that continue purchasing Russian oil and raw materials. The bill aims to tighten economic pressure and discourage third-party nations from enabling the Kremlin's energy profits.

Despite broad support for these efforts from his own party, Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to postpone a vote on the bill, according to Senator Roger Wicker. Semafor reported on June 17 that the bill has been further delayed until at least July as Congress grapples with domestic legislation as well as the conflict in the Middle East. 

While the European Union insists that its commitment to Ukraine remains unwavering, the bloc is also vulnerable to U.S. pressure and internal disagreements. 

In its 18th package of sanctions against Russia, the EU proposed lowering the oil price cap from $60 to $45 a barrel. While leaders were reportedly prepared to champion the proposal even without support from the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen appeared to walk back the price drop during the G7 summit.

""In the last days, we have seen the price has risen so the oil price cap does serve its function,"" von der Leyen said. ""At the moment, there's little pressure on lowering the oil price cap.""

EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, however, urged the EU to press forward with lowering the cap on Russian oil, even without U.S. support, warning that Middle East tensions could otherwise drive prices up and boost Russia's revenues.

The EU also requires unanimous support on punitive measures related to Russia, giving Ukraine-skeptic leaders in Slovakia and Hungary an opportunity to obstruct and delay the approval process. 

Prospects for peace in Ukraine will likely be determined by the amount of economic strain exerted on Russia. Kyiv now faces tough decisions as to how to publicly court support from Trump without relying too heavily on Washington's global leadership.

Kyiv may soon be forced to put all its efforts into winning more European support, becoming reliant on allies with more limited capabilities.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Russian President Vladimir Putin has received an official invitation to attend the G20 summit in South Africa, Russian Ambassador-at-Large Marat Berdyev said in an interview with state-owned media outlet RIA Novosti on June 19.

South Africa is a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and a signatory to the Rome Statute, meaning it is obliged to arrest Putin if he enters the country.

The ICC issued a warrant for the Russian leader's arrest in March 2023 over the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children during Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

""Last week, we received an official invitation. This is an appeal from the head of state, the president of South Africa (Cyril Ramaphosa), to his colleagues,"" Berdyev said.

The summit is scheduled to take place in Johannesburg from Nov. 22 to 23. Berdyev noted that Russia's final decision on Putin's participation will be made closer to the date. In recent years, Russia has been represented at G20 summits by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Despite the warrant, South Africa continues to deepen political and military ties with Moscow. In 2023, the country conducted joint naval drills with Russia and China, and maintains its membership in the BRICS bloc alongside both nations.

In November 2024, Putin skipped the G20 summit in Brazil, another ICC member state, and sent Lavrov instead. Russia's G20 participation has continued uninterrupted despite its war against Ukraine.

In September 2024, Putin made a rare visit to Mongolia, which is also a signatory of the ICC, prompting criticism over the non-enforcement of the warrant.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Israel's Defence Minister threatened Iran's Supreme Leader on Thursday after Iranian missiles crashed into a major hospital in southern Israel and hit residential buildings near Tel Aviv, wounding at least 240 people. As rescuers wheeled patients out of the smouldering hospital, Israeli warplanes launched their latest attack on the country's nuclear program.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz blamed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for Thursday's barrage and said the military “has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.”

While it remained unclear whether U.S. President Donald Trump would task American forces to join Israel's sweeping campaign against Iran's military and nuclear program, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he trusted that Trump would “do what's best for America.”

“I can tell you that they're already helping a lot,” Netanyahu said from the rubble and shattered glass around the Soroka Medical Center in Israel's southern city of Beersheba.

U.S. officials said this week that President Donald Trump had vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei. Trump later said there were no plans to kill him “at least not for now.”

On Thursday morning, several Iranian missiles struck populated areas in Israel, including a hospital in the southern part of the country, according to an Israeli military official.

Reuters

The U.S. has been weighing whether to join Israel's attack by striking Iran's well-defended Fordo uranium enrichment facility, which is buried under a mountain and widely considered to be out of reach of all but America's “bunker-buster” bombs.

The conflict began last Friday with a surprise wave of Israeli air strikes targeting nuclear and military sites, senior officers and nuclear scientists. At least 639 people, including 263 civilians, have been killed in Iran and more than 1,300 wounded, according to a Washington-based Iranian human rights group.

Iran has retaliated by firing hundreds of missiles and drones, killing at least 24 people in Israel and wounding hundreds.

At least 240 people were wounded by the latest Iranian attack on Israel, among them 80 wounded in the strike on the Soroka Medical Center. The vast majority were lightly wounded, as much of the hospital building had been evacuated in recent days.

Israel's Home Front Command said that one of the Iranian ballistic missiles fired Thursday morning had been rigged with fragmenting cluster munitions. Rather than a conventional warhead, the missile carries dozens of submunitions that can explode on impact, showering small bomblets around a large geographic area and posing major safety risks on the ground.

The Israeli military did not say where the missile with the cluster munition warhead had been fired.

Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard insisted that it had not sought to strike the hospital and claimed the attack hit an Israeli military intelligence compound near the Gav-Yam Negev advanced technologies park, some three kilometres from the hospital. An elite technological unit of the Israeli military has a branch campus in the area, according to the tech park's website.

The Israeli army did not respond to a request for comment. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, acknowledged that there was no specific intelligence that Iran had planned to target the hospital.

Many hospitals in Israel, including Soroka, had activated emergency plans in the past week. They converted underground parking garages to wards and moved patients to them, especially those on ventilators or are difficult to move quickly.

Israel also has a fortified, subterranean blood bank that kicked into action after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.

Doctors at Soroka Medical Center said that the Iranian missile struck almost immediately after air raid sirens went off, causing a loud explosion that could be heard from a safe room. The strike inflicted the greatest damage on an old surgery building and affected key infrastructure, including gas, water and air-conditioning systems, the medical centre said.

The hospital, which provides services to around 1 million residents of Israel's south, had been caring for 700 patients at the time of the attack. Of the 80 lightly wounded in the strike, half were hospital staff, it said. Afterward, the hospital closed to all patients except for life-threatening cases.

Iran has fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, though most have been shot down by Israel's multitiered air defences.

The head of Russia's nuclear energy corporation warned on Thursday that an Israeli attack on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant could lead to a “Chernobyl-style catastrophe.”

An Israeli military spokesperson said Israel had struck the site, but an Israeli military official later called this statement “a mistake” and said he could neither confirm nor deny that the Bushehr site on the cost of the Gulf had been hit.

Bushehr is Iran's only operating nuclear power plant and was built by Russia.

An Iranian missile slammed into the main hospital in southern Israel early Thursday, wounding people and causing 'extensive damage,' according to a spokesperson. Israeli media aired footage of blown-out windows and heavy black smoke.

The Associated Press

Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, in addition to having a nuclear power plant, it also enriches uranium up to 60 per cent, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state to enrich at that level.

Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons – making it the only such state in the Middle East – but does not acknowledge having such arms.

Iran's Supreme Leader on Wednesday rejected U.S. calls for surrender and warned that any American military involvement by the Americans would cause “irreparable damage to them.”

Already, Israel's campaign has targeted Iran's enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran, and a nuclear site in Isfahan. Its strikes have also killed top generals and nuclear scientists.

Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he would travel to Geneva for meetings with his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France and Germany, as well as the European Union's top diplomat, indicating a new diplomatic initiative might be under way.

Trump has said he wants something “much bigger” than a ceasefire and has not ruled out the U.S. joining in Israel's campaign.

Israel eyes the heart of Iran's nuclear ambitions

Israel's military said Thursday its fighter jets targeted the Arak heavy water reactor, some 250 km southwest of Tehran, in order to prevent it from being used to produce plutonium.

Iranian state TV said there was “no radiation danger whatsoever” around the Arak site, which it said had been evacuated ahead of the strike.

Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon.

Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to alleviate proliferation concerns. That work was never completed.

This satellite image provided by Maxar Technologies shows the Arak heavy water reactor in Iran on Feb. 15.Wood, Stephen/The Associated Press

The reactor became a point of contention after Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018. Ali Akbar Salehi, a high-ranking nuclear official in Iran, said in 2019 that Tehran bought extra parts to replace a portion of the reactor that it had poured concrete into under the deal.

Israel said strikes were carried out “in order to prevent the reactor from being restored and used for nuclear weapons development.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. IAEA inspectors reportedly last visited Arak on May 14.

Due to restrictions Iran imposed on inspectors, the IAEA has said it lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran's heavy water production – meaning it could not absolutely verify Tehran's production and stockpile.

Powerful Hurricane Erick has made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The hurricane's centre was located about 30 kilometres east of Punta Maldonado. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 205 k/h. It was moving northwest at 15 k/h, the hurricane centre said.

The storm was downgraded slightly before making landfall, from a powerful Category 4 to a Category 3. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 210 k/h.

The storm threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero states. Agricultural fields blanket the low-lying coastal area between small fishing villages.

Erick is expected to rapidly weaken over the mountains of Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane centre said.

The Mexican resort of Acapulco awoke on Thursday under dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach. It appeared the town had dodged the worst at least in terms of strong winds.

The Associated Press

The storm threatened to unleash destructive winds near where the eye crashes ashore, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge, forecasters said.

At first light Thursday, Acapulco awoke under ominous dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach.

However, the storm was forecast to move northwest just inland up the coast through midday, bringing heavy rain to the resort and the mountains that tower dramatically above it.

Still, it appeared Acapulco had dodged the worst at least in terms of Erick's strong winds.

Late Wednesday, Erick's projected path crept south, closer to the resort city of Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state, and centred on a sparsely populated stretch of coastline between the Oaxacan resort and Acapulco to the northwest.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video message Wednesday night that all activities in the region were suspended and she urged people to stay in their homes or to move to shelters if they lived in low-lying areas.

Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. The beach disappeared under pounding waves and the rising tide had already reached the interiors of some waterfront restaurants.

Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied.

The storm's course shift could be welcome relief for residents of storm-battered Acapulco.

The city of nearly one million was devastated in October, 2023, by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.

Acapulco residents said they were bracing for Erick's arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Otis two years earlier.

Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday.

Forecasters said Erick was expected to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 40 centimetres could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the centre's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Ángel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane centre advisory.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defence co-ordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said all schools would remain closed and the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators to make their boats storm-ready. Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes.

Sheinbaum warned in her daily briefing that those in the hurricane's path should heed government instructions and wait out the storm in their homes or designated shelters.

A couple years ago, Tara Lagu asked her 12-year-old niece what she wanted for Christmas. Her wish list consisted of around US$300 worth of skin care products. Dr. Lagu, an adjunct lecturer of medicine at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, was baffled. Why did a tween want anti-aging face creams, peptide serums and toners?

What seemed like an odd request was, in fact, a symptom of a growing phenomenon.

Known as “Sephora kids,” a wave of tweens and teens are embracing pricey skin care routines and documenting their rituals online.

There was no existing medical literature systematically analyzing these TikTok videos, so Dr. Lagu partnered with dermatologist and medical anthropologist Dr. Molly Hales to conduct the first peer-reviewed study investigating the potential risks and benefits of such skin care routines.

The rise of ‘Sephora kids' and the tween obsession with pricey skincare products

Released earlier this month in the journal Pediatrics, the study found that girls aged seven to 18 use an average of six different products on their faces, with some girls using more than a dozen. These products carry a high risk of skin irritation and allergy, the study found. 

In the study, Dr. Hales and another researcher each created a new TikTok account with a reported age of 13 years old. They scrolled the “For You” feed – which is powered by an algorithm that adapts to a user's likes and saves – and collected data on the first 100 skin care videos they viewed. 

The top brands used by the creators were Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary and Glow Recipe, and the average daily regimen cost US$168, which the authors estimated would typically last a month. Some cost up to US$500. 

The researchers found that in the 25 videos with the most views, these skin care routines included products that contained an average of 11 active ingredients, such as the chemical exfoliant alpha hydroxy acids. 

“For this age group, the recommendation is zero. A young teen or preteen who doesn't have any acne yet doesn't need to be using any active ingredients,” says Dr. Hales, who is a postdoctoral research fellow at Northwestern. “For an older teen who does have some acne, an argument could be made to having an active ingredient like salicylic acid maybe once a day as part of a skin care routine, but certainly not more than that.”

The study also found that fragrance, one of the most common contact allergens in personal care products, was added to more than half of the products used in all the videos. “Although there's not a lot of research around this, especially with kids, there's concern that with the earlier and more frequent use of personal care products, the rates of allergic contact dermatitis are going up,” says Dr. Hales. 

Most surprising for the researchers, however, was how only 26 per cent of the routines involved any SPF, especially since many active ingredients increase sensitivity to the sun.

The rise of viral anti-aging skin care products prompted a California assembly member to introduce legislation earlier this year that would ban the sale of anti-aging products that contain harsh ingredients, such as vitamin A and its derivatives, including retinol, and alpha hydroxy acids. “We have to stop the beauty industry from exploiting our youth,” assembly member Alex Lee said in a statement. 

In the videos, creators said they liked specific products because of how it made their skin look more “glowy,” “dewy” or “like a glazed doughnut.” Others said certain products “soothed” undereye bags. Many videos featured the products, in their pretty vessels, carefully arranged in the girls' bedrooms and on vanities, like status symbols. 

“Sometimes in the videos, part of it is displaying all of these products that you've purchased and have ownership of, like an expensive sneaker collection,” says Dr. Hales. 

Past generations swore by their own questionable skin care hacks – think abrasive fruity scrubs, toothpaste on pimples and dehydrating alcohol pads – but Dr. Hales worries the Sephora kid trend is reshaping what young people see as healthy living.

“What was disturbing to me as a dermatologist, but also as a mom, was seeing how this pursuit of beauty was also tied up in this language of health and self-care,” says Dr. Hales. 

“I wouldn't want these young girls to be getting the message somehow that they need to spend 45 minutes every day and $200 worth of products on skin care in order to be healthy or to be taking care of themselves.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Fact check: Old war videos recycled as fake news","https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-ai-chatbot-grok-wrongly-identifies-old-iraq-footage-as-2025-iran-israel-conflict/a-72950293","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:13:27 GMT","

Many viral videos claiming to show Israeli and Iranian bombings are fake and include AI-generated clips as well as 2003 Iraq war footage. Learn how to spot disinformation and verify content yourself.

Since Israel started bombing Iran last Friday, and Iran hit back in retaliation, the battlefield has not just stayed on the ground but expanded to include the internet. A huge amount of disinformation is being spread there by both sides: mainly old videos being reused as allegedly current material. DW Fact check also found AI-generated videos created to spread false information. 

DW Fact check debunked some of them and tells you what to watch out for and how to fact-check content yourself. 

Claim: A video clip compilation shows multiple bombings from the air, explosions and fire at night. In the one-minute video shared on TikTok ""No mercy - Israel launches revenge attack on Iran"" is written in capital letters. In the caption, the user repeats the claim: ""Israel bombing Iran with no mercy."" The video has been seen more than 2.8 million times.

DW Fact check: False

The videos do not show the current conflict between Iran and Israel. They are 22 years old and date back to the US bombings in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, in 2003.  

A reverse image search of stills from the compilation reveals two sources that prove the time and place for sequences of the video. The first sequence of the TikTok video is part of a longer video compilation of a bombing at night in Iraq, published by the US media outlet CNN (minute 2:46.)  

A sequence that starts at minute 0:31 on TikTok can be found here at the Getty Images photo agency.

In conflict situations, old footage or pictures are often shared out of context. In this case, many users pointed out in the comment section that the videos show the US strikes in Baghdad. When in doubt whether a video shows a current conflict, the first clue can be to check other users' comments. However, sometimes users misuse this to sow doubt and claim that authentic material is AI-generated or mislabeled.    

This video is also an example of how unreliable AI chatbots are as a fact-checking tool, as DW Fact check has written here in detail. In the comment section under an X post containing this video, some users turned to Grok, X's AI chatbot, in an attempt to verify what the video shows.    

Grok incorrectly answered, it ""likely shows Iranian missile strikes on Tel Aviv on June 16, 2025."" In one comment, Grok even contended that its answer is ""based on reports from CNN, BBC, and The Guardian. These sources confirm similar events, with no evidence suggesting the video is from another location."" This is not true.  

Even upon further questioning and providing information that the video shows Baghdad in 2003, the Grok AI chatbot sticks to its own theory but adds: ""But claims it's 2003 Iraq War footage can't be fully dismissed—similar visuals exist, and mislabeling has happened before. Without clear proof, I'd say it's probably recent but urge caution with social media clips.""

As DW Fact check has shown, there is clear proof that the videos date back to 2003.

The same or similar versions of the video have also been spread to claim it allegedly shows Iranian bombings of Israel. These claims appear here in Arabic or  Urdu or also on the French version of Pravda, a website that is known to be part of a Russian disinformation campaign.



Claim: A 16-second video clip shows a bird's-eye view of a city with massive destruction and collapsed buildings. A location stamp in the video reads in Arabic, ""Tel Aviv."" This video has been shared widely, for example, on X by the Iranian media outlet Tehran Times, calling it ""Doomsday in Tel Aviv."" It has been viewed more than 1.9 million times. The video has been shared in Arabic as well, with the claim, ""Unusual. This isn't Gaza, this is Tel Aviv.""  

DW Fact check: Fake

The video is not real; it is AI-generated. It doesn't show destruction in Tel Aviv.    

With a reverse image search, we found out that the video was published on TikTok on May 28, before the current escalation between Israel and Iran. The account's bio reads ""The AI resistance."" Many of the videos published on this account are AI-generated.  

Two clear clues reveal that the video is AI-generated, which are marked in the screenshot below. In the back, two cars merge while driving towards each other at 0:07 of the video. In the lower part, the shades on top of the roofs give it away: The shadows of the cylindrical objects would need to be parallel as a rule of physics, as the sun, as the source of light, is so far away. However, they are not. On the left roof, the shadows point slightly more to the left than on the right roof.   

In the top left corner, two cars merge while driving towards each other. At the bottom, the shadows of the cylindrical objects on top of the roof would need to be aligned at the same angle. On the left building, they turn more towards the left than on the right building.  

According to AI expert Hany Farid, this video has been created by the AI model Veo3, as he stated in a post on the social network LinkedIn. Farid is a professor at the California UC Berkeley School of Information who works in the field of digital forensics. He is the co-founder of GetReal, a company that aims to detect AI deepfakes.

Farid said AI models currently have limits to a maximum shot length of eight to 10 seconds for one video sequence. If a video has this maximum length or consists of multiple short shots, it is an indication that the video might be AI-generated. 

It is becoming more and more difficult to judge with the naked eye whether a video is AI-generated. Tools have become better and better at creating very realistic videos. When in doubt, try to find a version of the video in higher resolution. Be cautious if a video looks grainy or has a low resolution. People who spread disinformation use downscaling to hide manipulation, as visual inconsistencies are much more difficult to spot in a grainy video.

Poor video quality can also indicate that a clip was downloaded and uploaded multiple times. This usually results in a lower video quality. In this case, the original video posted on TikTok has a much better resolution than the other versions.

Claim: Many viral tweets on X, including this one, which received 2.1 million views at the time of writing, claim in Arabic that this video shows an Iranian bomb destroying arms stocks in Tel Aviv. It reads, ""A huge Iranian bomb fell, destroying weapons depots in Tel Aviv, causing the largest explosion in the history of the occupying entity.""

Another post shared the same video and also claims it shows an Iranian strike in Israel. Here, the post claims it shows an explosion in the port of Haifa after Iranian strikes: ""The blast at Haifa Port is set to be remembered in history as one of Iran's most lethal and strategically devastating strikes. Witnesses were left in shock as the sheer scale of the explosion unfolded before their eyes.""

DW Fact check: False

The video doesn't show an explosion in Israel caused by an Iranian attack. It does not show Haifa or Tel Aviv. A reverse image search reveals that the footage is much older and from a totally different region. It shows chemical explosions at a factory in the port of Tianjin in northern China. This incident occurred on August 12, 2015, killing 173 people according to Chinese authorities.  

It is not the first time that this video has been presented in the wrong context. In 2023, the same video was falsely presented as a Turkish nuclear power plant on fire after the earthquake in February in Turkey and Syria.

State Department officials will review applicants' social media accounts for ""indications of hostility"" towards the United States. 

The United States announced on Wednesday that it would resume processing of visa applications from foreign students but that all applicants would now be required to make their social media accounts available for review.

The State Department said that an applicant's failure to set their accounts to ""public,"" the lowest-level privacy setting, could be taken as a sign they are trying to hide their online activity.

""Under new guidance, consular officers will conduct a comprehensive and thorough vetting of all student and exchange visitor applicants,"" read a statement.

""The enhanced social media vetting will ensure we are properly screening every single person attempting to visit our country.""

In internal guidance sent to consular officers and cited by the Associated Press, the department said staff should be looking for ""any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.""

The Trump administration last month temporarily halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students, leaving students around the world waiting anxiously for consulates to reopen appointments.

With the window closing to make travel and accommodation arrangements ahead of the start of term, students from China, India, Mexico and the Philippines have been posting on social networks that they have been refreshing visa booking websites and following State Department press briefings for any hint of a resumption of applications.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Can Israel's economy withstand multiple conflicts?","https://www.dw.com/en/israel-economy-iran-hamas-technology-industry/a-72960150","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 03:48:07 GMT","

With Israel fighting on at least two fronts, the country's finances and economy are strained. The government hopes higher taxes can cover some of the bills while its high-tech industry remains a safe investment.

War is expensive. Besides causing destruction, personal tragedies and deaths, it costs a lot of money to buy and mobilize equipment. It also costs manpower as Isreal — and its economy — is finding out on multiple fronts.

Since the militant islamist group Hamas attacked the Jewish state on October 7, 2023, Israel has been engaged in intense fighting in Gaza. After that, Israel launched airstrikes into Lebanon as retaliation for cross-border Hezbollah missile and drone attacks. Last week, Israel struck deep within Iran with the aim of disabling its nuclear capabilities.

With all this going on, Israel's economy is under significant strain. Many reservists have been called up to fight forcing them to temporarily leave their jobs. Adding to this labor shortage, work permits for many Palestinians have been cancelled and crossing borders has become increasingly difficult for them.

All this makes filling job vacancies difficult. In April, the country reported a 3% unemployment rate, down from 4.8% in 2021.

At the same time, military spending in Israel has surged. In 2024, it grew by 65% to reach $46.5 billion (€40.4 billion), according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published in April. That brings its military spending to 8.8% of GDP — the second highest in the world after Ukraine.

The country's 2025 budget includes spending of 756 billion Israeli shekels ($215 billion; €187 billion)  — a 21% rise over the previous year. It is set to be the largest budget in Israeli history and includes $38.6 billion for defense, according to reporting in The Times of Israel.

Itai Ater, an economics professor at the Coller School of Management, Tel Aviv University, says the war is ""very expensive"" at the moment, and there is ""huge uncertainty about the near and long-term future.""

""The military costs on both the offensive and defensive fronts are very high. This will surely impact the budget, the deficit, the GDP and the Israeli debt,"" Ater told DW.

The costs are indeed high. In the past 20 months, many Israelis have spent hundreds of days in reserve duty. Others have been evacuated from their homes near border regions leading to big disruptions in their lives. Social services are under strain.

Since last Friday's attacks, many people have not worked, including in manufacturing, trade, tech and the education system, says Ater.

Commercial flights in and out of the country are also currently suspended. Airlines have evacuated their jets and airspace over much of the Middle East is closed. 

To compensate for some of this financial strain, the government has increased taxes. The country's value added tax (VAT) for most goods and services went from 17% to 18% at the beginning of this year. The health tax deducted from employee salaries and national insurance contributions went up, too. 

The Israeli economy has suffered over the past year and a half but has been ""surprisingly resilient,"" says Benjamin Bental, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Haifa.

While tourism, manufacturing, construction and farming have suffered, other industries like high-tech, defense and retail food remain resilient. In 2024, the economy brought in over $540 billion, topping both previous years.

Bental points to the continued success of the high-tech sector and the overall labor market that is ""as tight as it has ever been."" Warnings that critical energy and internet infrastructure would be targeted by Hezbollah or Iran have, so far, proven unfounded leaving businesses on track.

It is no coincidence that Israel is known for its advanced high-tech industry.

The sector employs 12% of the country's workforce and pay around 25% of all income taxes because of their high salaries, according to US investment bank Jefferies. High-tech services and products make up 64% of the country's exports and around 20% of total GDP.

But the number of high-tech employees in Israel has stagnated since 2022, according to a report released in April by the Israel Innovation Authority.

In 2024, the number of local high-tech employees decreased for the first time in a decade. At the same time the number of employees leaving the country for long-term relocation increased, the report found.

Today, these companies still have around 390,000 employees in Israel and a further 440,000 outside the country. Some fear higher taxes could push more mobile companies or workers to leave. 

The biggest unknown now is the general uncertainty of the situation in and around Israel. This impacts workers, employers and investors.

""Nevertheless, if you look at the stock market and the foreign exchange rate, it seems that investors are optimistic, likely anticipating that the war would end soon, that Iran's nuclear threat would be eliminated and that the economy would recover and get better,"" said Ater.

For investors, the short-term risks have increased, but the real impact depends on how long the military conflicts last and how they end.

""An alternative scenario, in which we enter a long attrition war with Iran, is also likely,"" said Ater. ""In that case, the economy is unlikely to flourish.""

Looking ahead, Ater sees the security situation in general, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in particular, as one of the country's long-term economic challenges. Besides these tensions he says it will be important to also keep an eye on the country's internal social divide and the judicial overhaul and its implications on democratic institutions.

			Michael Kurilla said to be power behind throne as US president mulls over direct military action

“Shots fired!” shouted Gen Michael Kurilla moments before charging towards the sound of gunfire to save two junior officers.

Weaving through the rubble-strewn alleyways of war-torn Mosul, Iraq, the then-lieutenant colonel was pursuing a group of terrorist suspects when three more shots rang out.

Taking bullets to the arm and both legs, one snapping his femur in half, he “performed a judo roll” and carried on firing his rifle, witnesses say. As the gunfire continued, he covered his troops and reeled off orders while bleeding on the concrete floor.

Nearly 20 years later, Gen Kurilla, who was awarded a Bronze Star for valour and now heads the US military Central Command (Centcom), is once again leading the fight in the Middle East – this time against Iran.

Known to be Israel's favourite general and nicknamed “The Gorilla”, Gen Kurilla is understood to have been given unusual levels of authority by Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, to determine the American response to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict.

The 59-year-old has apparently overruled other top Pentagon officials in managing the crisis and has had nearly all his requests approved for more weapons and air defences for the region, multiple sources told Politico and Axios.

More than six feet tall, the “jacked” (muscular) general certainly looks the part and is known for his abrasive approach. He was investigated by the army last year for allegedly shoving a military crew member, although the outcome is not clear.

According to one former official, his tough-guy persona and commanding physical presence give Gen Kurilla powerful influence over the US defence secretary.

“He's a big dude, he's jacked, he's exactly this ‘lethality' look [Donald Trump and Mr Hegseth are] going for,” the ex-official told Politico. “If the senior military guys come across as tough and war fighters, Hegseth is easily persuaded to their point of view.”

The general is said to have had more face time with the US president than most other generals, according to Politico.

Where Gen Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon policy chief, have repeatedly urged against overcommitting to the Middle East, Gen Kurilla is said to be pushing for a strong military response to Iran.

As the department of defence (DoD) moves aircraft carriers and a large formation of refuelling planes to the region and the president mulls over a direct military strike on Iran, there is speculation that Gen Kurilla is pulling the strings behind the scenes.

“Hegseth has sided with him time and again,” a diplomat told the website.

Hailed by Israeli news outlet Ynet as “the US general Israel doesn't want to strike Iran without”, Gen Kurilla is a long-time Iran hawk who is expected to retire from the military this summer.

A veteran of Panama, the Gulf War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Kurilla is seen as “one of Israel's staunchest allies in the American defence establishment”, according to Ynet, and has travelled to the country dozens of times since he first visited as a young officer in his 20s.

“He knows the type of every munition launched at Israel that night, and where each interceptor was positioned,” an Israeli official told the news outlet last year. “Wake him in the middle of the night, and he'd ace a pop quiz better than some of our own officers.”

According to The New York Times, the general had been open to US involvement in an Israeli strike plan to attack Iran earlier this spring, combining a bombing campaign with commando raids on nuclear sites, but was blocked by Mr Trump, who favoured a diplomatic approach.

“He has been pushing for war with Iran and away from diplomacy since before Trump took office in ways that run over civilian officials,” Justin Logan, director of foreign policy and defence studies at the Cato Institute, told Responsible Statecraft.

Since taking over as head of Centcom in 2022, Gen Kurilla has pursued a strategy of military integration with Israel and regional partners to deter Iranian aggression, known as “Kurilla's umbrella”.

The system has enabled US radar systems in the UAE and Qatar to aid Israeli defence and has included co-operation with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, according to Ynet.

Explaining his approach to a US House congressional committee in March, Gen Kurilla said that Iran had taken a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape the region to its advantage”, which could be halted by a “deep partnership” between Israel, the US and the Gulf States.

He is also thought to have played an instrumental role in pushing for sustained attacks on Houthi Rebels in Yemen in March, according to the New York Times, details of which were later made public in the infamous Signal group chat leak.

The 30-day operation cost more than $1 billion and was widely viewed as an ineffective use of resources, yet it enabled Mr Trump to strike a deal to end the fighting.

Deployed to Israel in April, Gen Kurilla is said to have passed on the news to government officials there that the US would not endorse strikes on Iran to curb its uranium enrichment programme.

He also is said to have released a statement in which he reiterated the two nations' “ironclad military-to-military relationship”, The Jerusalem Post reported.

Gen Kurilla may have also played a decisive role in determining Israel's decision to pull the trigger on operation “Rising Lion” last Friday, when it launched a devastating series of precision air strikes on Iranian military sites and personnel.

Although Israel acquiesced to Mr Trump's demands in April to hold off attacking Iran, military sources told The Jerusalem Post at the time that they hoped to strike before Gen Kurilla stepped down in July, recognising him as a key ally.

“I think it's been reported, and you know, based on my experience with him, that he takes a fundamentally different view of the importance of the Middle East than a lot of other people in the administration,” Dan Caldwell, former adviser to Mr Hegseth, told the Breaking Points podcast on Monday.

He added: “And he also, I think, believes that a military campaign against Iran will not be as costly as others.”

With time running out before Iran produces an atomic bomb and with Gen Kurilla's retirement looming, it may well be that Israel saw its window of opportunity closing.

Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said: “Secretary Hegseth empowers all of his combatant commanders the same way – by decentralising command and harnessing their real-world expertise regarding the defence of their respective areas of responsibility.

“The entire DoD leadership team – from the chairman of the joint chiefs to the undersecretary of defence for policy – similarly provide courses of action and counsel to the secretary based on their expertise. The secretary then makes a decision and final recommendation to the president. This is how the Pentagon does, and should, function. Our senior leaders are in lockstep and will continue to work in unison to deliver on President Trump's national security agenda.”

Representatives for Gen Kurilla and the White House were contacted for comment.

As a lawsuit tries to stop a forced prison labor program, a beer distributor is defending its own participation.

In 2022, Alabama became one of the first states in the nation to ban slavery without exception. A constitutional amendment, passed overwhelmingly by voters, removed language that had long allowed involuntary servitude to continue in state prisons — a holdover from the 13th Amendment's infamous “exception clause.” The 13th Amendment, though widely celebrated at the time for abolishing most forms of slavery, still allows for involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime, and has remained the legal backbone for the vast system of prison labor in the U.S., where incarcerated people can be compelled to work under threat of punishment.

In Alabama, that legal framework is now gone. The new constitution is clear: slavery and involuntary servitude are banned in all forms, period.

And yet, the practice continues.

Incarcerated people in Alabama are still being forced to work, in part through “work release” programs where refusal can mean being sent to solitary confinement, transferred to more dangerous prisons, or denied parole. Some are punished not for choosing not to work, but for being unable to work — because of disability, injury, or chronic illness. In some cases, people are removed from work release without explanation, and when they seek to be reassigned or evaluated medically, they are told they are “noncompliant” or “refusing.” The punishment is the same.

It's against this backdrop that a group of incarcerated workers filed an ongoing federal lawsuit in December 2023, challenging Alabama's continued use of forced prison labor. Their claims go far beyond the state's constitutional ban on slavery. The lawsuit also invokes the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which prohibits labor obtained through coercion, and the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 — a Reconstruction-era statute designed to combat racially motivated abuses by government officials. The suit further alleges that Alabama's overly harsh and racist parole policies trap Black people in prisons for years beyond when they have proven ready for release, as part of a plan to keep large numbers of workers enrolled in forced, off-site work release. Together, the claims argue that Alabama's prison labor system is not only unconstitutional, but part of a broader pattern of racial discrimination, corruption, and systemic violence.

The plaintiffs allege they are “entrapped in a system of ‘convict leasing' in which incarcerated people are forced to work, subject to threats of physical violence, deprivation of bare necessities, and threat of extended imprisonment, for little or no money, to the significant benefit of the numerous government entities and private businesses that ‘employ' them.”

The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry.

The lead plaintiff, who goes by Kinetik Justice, has faced years of retaliation for creating the Free Alabama Movement, through which he encourages incarcerated people to strike and engage in other nonviolent refusal to work. In the complaint, Justice alleges that after helping organize a 2014 strike, he faced retaliation, including “years of solitary confinement, torture, taking away his personal and legal documents and records, beatings and transfers to prevent him from speaking about Alabama's forced labor system.”

Another plaintiff, Lakiera Walker, who was incarcerated from 2007 to 2023, alleges that for years she was forced to work long, daily hours of unpaid physical labor in the prison, under threat of solitary confinement. She subsequently conducted road work for the county, for which she was paid $2 per day. When a work supervisor demanded sex, Walker refused and reported him to the prison. In response, she alleges prison officials issued her a disciplinary offense for purportedly refusing to work and sent her back to unpaid work in the prison.

During the final years of her incarceration — including after the 2022 state constitutional amendment banned forced labor — Walker was sent on work release to off-site, private companies, including one where she regularly worked 12-hour shifts inside freezers without adequate work clothes. The Alabama prison system keeps 40 percent of people's work release pay, and charges them additional fees like $5 per day for van rides to work and $15 per month for laundry. Once, when Walker was so ill she had to be carried to the healthcare unit, she says a prison job placement officer told her to “get up and go make us our 40%.”

Last year, the judge initially dismissed the case without prejudice, allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. But the early ruling made something else clear: the court has yet to grasp the full extent of what is happening inside Alabama's prisons — the coercion masked as corrections, the public-private partnerships that treat incarcerated bodies as profit centers, and the near-constant threat of physical violence used to enforce compliance.

The defendants include the commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, top officials in the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, and several private corporations that profit from this labor. One of those companies is Bama Budweiser, a distributor operating under the Budweiser name.

In its March 2024 legal response to the allegations, Bama Budweiser does not meaningfully address the constitutional issue — whether Alabama's prison labor system violates the state's explicit ban on slavery. Instead, the company's brief resorts to a series of dehumanizing attacks and dangerous arguments that seek to delegitimize the plaintiffs themselves.

Anheuser-Busch can't have it both ways. If they stand for justice, they must say so. If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone.

The brief opens by arguing that the plaintiffs “never worked for Bama Budweiser,” and therefore the claims should be dismissed. This, of course, ignores that the company has contracted with ADOC to knowingly obtain and benefit from the labor of incarcerated workers. But Bama Budweiser's response then quickly shifts into something much darker. In one of the most inflammatory passages, the company writes:

“What we have, then, are two murderers, an attempted murderer, multiple violent felons, robbers, burglars, and drug dealers. And they come into this Court complaining about having to work for a beer distributor.”

This is not a legal defense. It's a moral judgment — one that seeks to strip incarcerated people of constitutional protection by appealing to public fear and disgust. The clear implication is that some people do not deserve rights. That their labor can be taken. That their bodily autonomy is irrelevant.

Elsewhere in the brief, Bama Budweiser points back to the previous version of the Alabama Constitution that provided an exception legalizing slavery for people in prison, which seems to suggest that the amendment — passed in 2022 by 76 percent of Alabama voters — banning slavery and involuntary servitude for all, without exception, should never have passed. They dismiss media reports of inhumane prison conditions as unreliable “hearsay,” and mock the idea that enforcing labor rules against incarcerated people might ever rise to the level of coercion.

All of this is done under the brand name of Budweiser — a company that, in recent years, has styled itself as a champion of inclusion and human dignity. Its parent company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, has released national advertisements promoting LGBTQ+ rights, immigrant narratives, and “American values.” They have called themselves proud allies of “marginalized communities.”

But in this brief, filed in a federal court in Alabama, a place where marginalized communities are plentiful, a distributor making use of the company's name is sending an unambiguous message: people in prison are not worthy of dignity. Not worthy of labor protections. Not worthy of constitutional enforcement.

The dissonance is staggering.

That's why I'm calling on Anheuser-Busch InBev to go on the record. If they believe, as they say, in human dignity and freedom, they must disavow this brief. They must state clearly whether they support the position their distributor has taken — that the constitutional ban on slavery does not apply to people behind bars.

Because silence here is not neutrality. It's complicity.

This isn't a theoretical debate. I've been incarcerated in Alabama since 2006, and I've spent years in solitary confinement — not for violence or escape, but for speaking out against forced labor. Since 2016, I've helped organize work strikes, exposed illegal retaliation, and insisted that every person behind these walls deserves the right to refuse labor without facing abuse.

That's not “insubordination.” That's autonomy. That's freedom. Those in prison have lost nearly everything, but under the U.S. Constitution we still have the right to say no to bodily abuse and exploitation. And the fact that such basic assertions of bodily integrity are met with punishment shows just how far this system has strayed from anything resembling rehabilitation.

People in prison are disciplined for refusing to work even when they are mentally or physically unable to perform the assigned task. There are men here with untreated injuries, degenerative conditions, serious mental illness — and still, refusal is met with sanctions. Write-ups. Lost parole dates. Transfers to higher-security prisons. Extended time in cages.

That is not a job. That is coercion. That is slavery — rebranded for the 21st century.

The question before the court is whether this system is legal under Alabama's new constitution. But the question before the public is even more urgent: will we allow companies to profit from forced labor, while branding it “corrections”? Will we let corporate lawyers rewrite the meaning of abolition from inside federal courtrooms?

Alabama voters already made their decision. They banned slavery. Now it's time for the courts — and the corporations — to honor that decision.

Anheuser-Busch can't have it both ways. If they stand for justice, they must say so. If not, their name will remain attached to a defense that argues — in plain terms — that the right to be free from slavery does not belong to everyone.

The stakes could not be clearer. And neither could the line that's been crossed.

On Juneteenth, I draw strength from the rich history of Black communities' struggles for environmental justice. 

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

As an environmental justice worker, I've developed a deep appreciation for Juneteenth as an opportunity to celebrate Black freedom struggles and their connection to diverse ecologies. Today, I can't help but reflect on the often overlooked yet rich and complex relationships enslaved people had with their local environments as landscapes that both enforced captivity and provided opportunities for liberation. The harrowing realities of enslaved people cultivating cash crops in brutal plantations were also filled with spaces where enslaved people developed intimate knowledge of local ecologies to survive, assert their humanity, and establish cultural practices. Enslaved people did this every day: from foraging for food and gardening to fortify their meager diets, to developing herbal medicinal knowledge, and creating spiritualities tied to their local ecologies. Thousands of enslaved people used this critical knowledge of the environment to brave the wilderness, run away, and self-emancipate.

This complex relationship to the environment did not stop after emancipation. Descendants of enslaved people continue to face challenges from the legacy of slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed, and this has lasting impacts on their relationship to the environment. Persistent inequality in access to safe and healthy environments, gaps in environmental services such as access to clean, treated water, and the disproportionate effects of environmental disasters and climate change continue to impact Black communities in the U.S. However, Black communities also continue to assert their connection to the environment through the movement of environmental justice, which has made substantial breakthroughs in the past few decades in its quest for a just and sustainable world.

Now, the vibrant environmental justice movement is facing mounting attacks as Republicans gut federal funding, weaken enforcement of environmental policies, and empower corporations to deepen existing environmental inequality. It has been devastating to experience such swift government repression from the Trump administration. But this Juneteenth, I'm remembering that our relationship with the environment has always been complex, enduring, and profound, and caring for the Earth is a Black tradition that can't be easily erased.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Juneteenth has its roots in Galveston, Texas, where some of the last enslaved people were emancipated with the arrival of Union troops on June 19, 1865. Though some African American communities in Texas and across the South celebrated Juneteenth for centuries, it became a federal holiday in 2021 under President Joe Biden, in response to demands for racial justice following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. I myself only began celebrating this holiday recently, and like millions of Americans, I take the day to commemorate the liberation of enslaved people and their legacy of resistance and resilience. It serves as a reminder of the long history of Black environmental culture that my work in environmental justice hopes to protect and uplift.

We can't fully understand the devastating impact of settler colonialism on the environment without also understanding its interconnectedness with the enslavement of Black people.

Enslaved people had very complicated relationships with the diverse American environments they were forcibly relocated to. This aspect of enslavement is often overlooked because it is painfully obvious, yet hard to pinpoint how these new environments fundamentally shaped enslaved people's lives. Europeans violently displaced Native Americans from their traditional homelands beginning in the 16th century, and sought to extract the resources of their new colonies. Africans forced into slavery came from across central and western Africa, hailing from diverse ecologies, from bustling coasts and lush rainforests, to sprawling deserts and arid regions. Enslaved Africans were then shipped across the Americas to work mainly on plantations where they cultivated cash crops like cotton, indigo, sugar cane, coffee, and rice under brutal work regimes, stripped of their dignity and humanity. These agricultural practices and labor regimes imposed by European settlers degraded Southern ecologies and reduced biodiversity while also murdering and maiming enslaved people and denying them their humanity. We can't fully understand the devastating impact of settler colonialism on the environment without also understanding its interconnectedness with the enslavement of Black people. This painful history of forced labor, exploitation, and violence to people and planet fundamentally shapes contemporary Black communities' relationship with their American ecologies.

Joshua Jenkins, a fellow Black environmentalist working in the environmental justice space, highlights the deep interconnected links between environmental injustice and U.S. slavery in his work. Jenkins is the Alabama and Mississippi field representative, and former civil rights fellow, at the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA), where he advocates for national park protection in the Deep South while also highlighting the region's rich environmental and cultural history. When asked about the links between Juneteenth and environmental justice, he reflects on the fact that the enslaved people who were forced to work the land generated an incredible amount of wealth that became the bedrock for the American economy. He concluded that “this country itself was built on environmental injustice.”

This legacy of environmental racism would go on to shape generations of African Americans. After emancipation, millions of enslaved people were forced to “pay off debts” to former enslavers, and many elements of slavery's exploitative labor continued under a new system of sharecropping. In the few cases where African Americans were able to purchase land as farmers and businesspeople, the fear of racial violence loomed over these new opportunities. Threats of retaliation, lynching, and capricious white officials who would extort and steal land robbed Black communities of land stewardship, environmental knowledge, wealth, and their very homes for generations throughout the post-Reconstruction South. During the early 20th century, millions of African Americans migrated from the South to the North, West, and Midwest as refugees from racial violence, political repression, and economic disparity, leaving behind their rural backgrounds for cities. But racism continued to shape their relationship with the environment in these bustling cities. Black communities were zoned through housing discrimination into neighborhoods surrounded by higher levels of pollution from factories, sewage systems, and landfills, as well as undesirable lands that were vulnerable to natural disasters.

Recognizing these persistent disparities in environmental access, exposure to pollution, and loss of land on the heels of the civil rights movement, Black communities across the country worked initially independently to address local and statewide inequalities. An early environmental justice action took place in Warren County, North Carolina, between 1978 and 1982, when locals in a majority-Black community organized for over four years against the creation of a toxic landfill with cancer-causing PCBs. As these efforts gained national traction, environmental justice organizing sprang up in Chicago, led by Hazel M. Johnson with the People for Community Recovery; in New York City, with WE ACT for Environmental Justice; and in Houston, Texas, with Robert Bullard and Linda McKeever Bullard of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice. These efforts highlighted the disproportionate number of toxic landfills, polluting factories and industries, and the numerous health impacts on predominantly Black and Brown communities.

In 1991, these once-fragmented campaigns, organizing efforts, legal efforts, and the advocates behind them would come together in the National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. The summit connected the hundreds of groups and communities across the nation working on environmental justice, as they found common ground. Peggy Shepard, one of the co-founders of New York-based environmental justice organization WE ACT, recalled that the summit “was the first time I really understood that there were hundreds of groups like mine working on similar issues around the country.” This summit transformed the path of the environmental justice movement as the term itself was formalized, and the attendees established the 17 guiding principles of the movement. “[I]f you look at those principles, you'll see that all of them are just totally relevant today,” Shepard said on the 30th anniversary of the summit in 2021. “They're important values that we all hold dear and an important roadmap for the future.”

The principles that shape environmental justice were developed through a coalition of diverse stakeholders with a vision of collective liberation. Unlike the mainstream environmental movement of its time (and oftentimes still today), intersectional environmental justice connected the dots across multiple forms of oppression. The crafters of the movement's principles understood that a just and healthy planet was also one with reproductive rights, Native sovereignty, workers' rights, and community participation as central facets of policy. A radical movement with a commitment towards justice, sustainability, and liberation was born.

Now, more than three decades later, that movement has grown and seen numerous victories. In 2022, Congress passed Joe Biden's climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which funneled billions to clean energy, green jobs, and environmental justice efforts. With federal programs like the Justice40 Initiative — which ensured that 40 percent of new climate funding, jobs, and investments would go to historically marginalized communities — things were looking up. Hundreds of organizations, local community groups, state and municipal governments, and advocates applied for grants, loans, and investments for new and exciting projects and to build climate-resilient infrastructure, create green jobs, invest in clean energy, and address persistent issues of pollution and ecological degradation. I was energized in my work as exciting opportunities for funding, collaboration, and advancing environmental justice principles quickly grew. As the country charted a path to address climate change, I was optimistic that Black, Brown, poor, and rural communities wouldn't be left behind this time.

However, this billion-dollar beacon of hope was quickly derailed as the Trump administration ascended and targeted funding for the environment by pausing the government funding disbursement. This recent shift has devastated the environmental justice movement. Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) has been used to discredit programs, funding, and opportunities that addressed inequality, and has also hit the movement hard. The administration took particular issue with the few environmental justice guardrails in government that safeguarded against persistent inequality, with polluting industries disproportionately placed in communities of color and low-income communities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was central to enforcing environmental justice policies, saw significant staff cuts as well, which will undoubtedly hamper — and in some cases, halt — environmental justice work. Routes for remedying environmental injustices through programs like the EPA Superfund, for example, are at risk for cuts.

New funding allocated through the IRA, passed by Congress, has also been a hotbed issue. Organizations, states, local governments, and companies with government contracts were shocked to see contracts quickly revoked, funds frozen, and programs terminated, with threats of legal action from the government. Though a recent court ruling demands that the government resume funding, it is unclear when and how this will happen — if it happens at all. The impact of such hostile policies is devastating. We can “no longer rely on the federal government to support EJ [environmental justice] work. It's now a divisive topic,” Jenkins says. “So, funding has dried up and larger organizations are less willing to take EJ stances for fear of reprisal from the federal government.”

This harsh reality has had a chilling impact on my own work supporting young climate leaders from historically marginalized backgrounds. I've seen firsthand the bleak and uncertain reality of reluctant funders and companies laying off or firing employees. This year alone, I've witnessed a number of the partner organizations that I've worked with on youth programming and environmental justice issues tighten their belts because of smaller budgets, hiring freezes, or just anxiety around environmental justice being framed as a “partisan issue.” In my programs that link young people to green jobs, I've had to email dozens of applicants to let them know the positions that were advertised just last November are no longer available. And this is only the tip of the iceberg; organizations that were dependent on federal funding are preparing to furlough employees as they scurry to secure new funding sources or close down. Even as I work in an organization that doesn't rely on federal funding, the influx of organizations with new funding gaps makes the limited private funding available even more competitive as we all struggle to stay afloat.

However, even with these bleak circumstances, hope is certainly not lost. The environmental justice movement has managed to avoid being totally defanged. Although some diluted elements of environmental justice have only recently penetrated the mainstream environmental movement, for the most part, the movement retains much of its core radical vision for justice.

“This is a really good time for us to put our heads together and think really hard about the world we want to live in. Really hard, like the most aspirational reality we can think of. Afrofuturism levels of imagination,” says Jenkins. “And then we should organize and build coalitions that will help us realize that dream. If we're the forest, it feels like these times are a massive wildfire. It is destructive and it's hard to breathe right now, but we know some seeds can't even germinate unless they're subjected to the heat.”

As some major environmental organizations back away from their commitments and scrub their websites of environmental justice language, others stand firm and push forward. In this moment of adversity, I'm witnessing many environmental justice advocates, organizations, and communities clarify their vision and deepen their intersectional liberatory aspirations. Amid the U.S.'s descent into fascism, the interconnectedness of reproductive rights, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, and Black and Brown communities is clearer now than ever as right-wingers mount attacks on us all.

Juneteenth is an opportunity to contemplate and learn from the resilience and ingenuity of enslaved people who formed rich environmental relations. As this current Trump administration rolls back critical policies, climate funding, and enforcement of environmental protection, the environmental justice movement has our work cut out for us. This is the time for us to strengthen coalitions, build upon ambitious visions for liberation, and continue demanding a just and sustainable future.

Customs and Border Protection agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” Alistair Kitchen said.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A leading press freedom advocate on Tuesday condemned the United States' “disturbing pattern” of screening and expelling international visitors for their political viewpoints following the detention and removal of an Australian journalist who criticized the Trump administration's targeting of Palestine defenders on college campuses.

Alistair Kitchen said he was detained for 12 hours and interrogated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents in Los Angeles International Airport while en route from Melbourne, Australia to New York last week.

“I was denied entry, detained, and deported from the USA over the last 48 hours because of my reporting on the Columbia [University] student protests,” Kitchen wrote Friday on the social media site Bluesky. “I arrived back in Melbourne hours ago and had my phone handed back to me upon landing.”

“I had it easy,” he added, “one woman had been in that detention room four days when I arrived; she's still there.”

Kitchen said that CBP agents “were waiting for me when I got off the plane,” and although he “had cleaned up my online presence expecting ad hoc digital sweeps,” he “was not prepared for their sophistication.”

“If you are deleting social media 48 hours before your flight to the U.S., it is already too late,” he stressed.

Kitchen wrote that the agents “just came out and said it: ‘We both know why you've been detained…it's because of what you wrote about the protests at Columbia,'” he recounted.

""Writers, artists, and scholars must be free to express their views openly without compromising their free movement across borders,"" said PEN America's @jonfreadom.bsky.social following detainment and deportation of Australian writer Alistair Kitchen for his personal writings pen.org/press-releas…

Responding to Kitchen's ordeal, Jonathan Friedman, managing director of the U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America, said in a statement Tuesday that “it is gravely concerning to read an account of someone being detained and turned away at the border due to their writings on student protests, Palestine, and the Trump administration.”

“Writers, artists, and scholars must be free to express their views openly without compromising their free movement across borders,” Friedman added. “Kitchen's account fits a disturbing pattern, in which border agents appear to be screening visitors to the U.S. for their viewpoints. That is anti-democratic, and it must be halted.”

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) — which earlier this year issued its first-ever travel advisory for journalists entering the United States, including warnings about searches of electronic devices — called Kitchen's detention and expulsion “alarming.”

“Alistair Kitchen's deportation is a clear case of retaliation in connection with his reporting, and such action sends a chilling message to journalists that they must support the administration's narratives or face forms of retribution,” CPJ U.S., Canada, and Caribbean Program coordinator Katherine Jacobsen said Monday.

“Foreign media operating on U.S. soil are covered by First Amendment protections, and it is incumbent upon U.S. officials — from [CBP] to the White House — to allow journalists to do their jobs and travel freely without fear of reprisal,” Jacobsen added.

Kitchen suspects CBP agents used technology contracted from Palantir, which has been targeted by the No Tech for Apartheid movement over its involvement in Project Nimbus, a cloud computing collaboration between Israel's military and tech titans Amazon and Google criticized for enabling Israeli human rights crimes.

In March, Kitchen published a piece on his Kitchen Counter blog, titled “On the Deportation of Dissent.” The post highlighted the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and former Columbia University student and Palestine solidarity activist arrested on March 8 by plainclothes Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers in front of his pregnant wife in New York before being transferred to New Jersey and then to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement lockup in Louisiana, where he missed the birth of his son.

Khalil, who the Trump administration admits has committed no crime, is being held as a political prisoner under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which empowers the secretary of state to expel noncitizens whose presence in the United States is deemed detrimental to U.S. foreign policy interests. Numerous foreign nationals, including green-card holders, have been targeted under the law for criticizing Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza and U.S. complicity.

Kitchen wrote:

The goal here is the deportation of dissent. In an executive order 10 days ago, the Trump administration promised to “go on offense to enforce law and order” by “cancel[ing] the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” This is a mode of speech suppression that seeks to physically remove the undesirable elements it can, and, through fear, ensure silence in everyone else.

To my mind the arrest of a student on utterly specious grounds by a neo-fascist state, clearly designed to breed a climate of fear among students, calls for the resignation of a university president. That role is untenable so long as it does not involve the ferocious protection of student speech. The same goes for faculty, who last year demonstrated a mixed commitment to the defense of students. The situation requires their concerted action.

“The CBP explicitly said to me, the reason you have been detained is because of your writing on the Columbia student protests,” Kitchen told Guardian Australia on Sunday.

However, a DHS spokesperson denied Kitchen's assertion, telling the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he was denied entry to the United States “because he gave false information” regarding alleged drug use on his Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application.

“Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from [vetting] measures, which are designed to protect our nation's security,” the spokesperson added. “However, those intending to enter the U.S. with fraudulent purposes or malicious intent are offered the following advice: Don't even try.”

Kitchen told Guardian Australia that he had previously indicated on an ESTA application that he had not done drugs, but admitted under interrogation that he legally purchased marijuana in New York state and partook while abroad.

“There's certainly not proof of me doing drugs on my phone,” he said. “But this is a method of interrogation that uses entrapment.”

Kitchen added that “in retrospect, I should have… accepted immediate deportation,” but that he was “too compliant, too trustful, too hopeful” at the start of his detention.

Free press advocates said Kitchen's detention and removal was yet another sign that “we are becoming a police state,” as well as a reason “to avoid the United States as a holiday destination like the bubonic plague,” and, as the hacktivist collective Anonymous called it, “a harsh lesson in digital footprints.”

The Supreme Court has issued a major decision upholding Tennessee's ban on so-called gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, for minors. Its decision on June 18 will likely influence how states craft legislation and how other gender-related cases unfold in the legal system.

In the case United States v. Skrmetti, a majority of the justices disagreed with the Biden administration's argument that Tennessee's law should undergo more rigorous scrutiny in the courts. Instead, Chief Justice John Roberts said in his majority opinion that courts should apply a less rigorous standard known as rational basis, under which states have to show that their law is rationally related to a state interest.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            After Supreme Court oral arguments last December, it was clear conservative justices had the votes to uphold state bans on gender care for trans youths under age 18. The question was how far the decision would sweep to affect trans individuals in other situations.
    


            In the end, Chief Justice John Roberts used the power of his office to keep the opinion for himself. He penned a decision that affirmed state restrictions on puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but he declined to adopt the reasoning of some conservatives that could have made transgender people even more vulnerable to discrimination.
    


            Roberts, by virtue of his position as chief, assigns opinions when he is in the majority. He regularly keeps the most significant cases for himself, as he did in the controversy over President Donald Trump's assertion of immunity from prosecution last year. Yet Roberts, now in his 20th year in the center chair, also strategically assigns cases to restrain or otherwise influence the court's holding.
    


            On Wednesday, he fended off the more aggressive right-wing sentiment. In his seven-minute statement from the mahogany bench and in his written opinion, Roberts adopted a cut-and-dried tone. He eschewed the heat of the three liberal dissenters, as well as the conservatives who broke off to write their own statements. Justice Clarence Thomas, for example, insisted medical experts “have surreptitiously compromised their medical recommendations to achieve political ends,” and Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised concerns about boys' and girls' sports teams.

            All told, Roberts appeared to try to lower the temperature on the combustible issue of trans rights – which Trump promised to curtail during his 2024 reelection bid. Since taking office again in January, multiple executive orders have targeted trans people, including servicemembers in the US military.
    


            The chief justice's 24-page opinion, to be sure, thoroughly rejected the challenge to a Tennessee law that forbids healthcare providers from providing hormones and other treatment for children under age 18 to transition or, as the law states, to “identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's biological sex.”
    


            He said the classification related to age and medical use, rather than to sex, which would have meant it was more likely to violate the Constitution's equal protection guarantee.
    


            The disputed Tennessee law permits puberty blockers and hormones for minors to treat some conditions, such as a congenital defect or precocious puberty, but not to treat gender dysphoria – that is, the incongruence between one's gender identity and sex assigned at birth.
    


            Roberts referred to evolving medical assessment of potential harms associated with such treatment, primarily in European countries, as he emphasized that the Tennessee legislature had sufficient grounds for the regulation of medical treatment for minors.
    


            Advocates for the children and families in the high court case argued that hormone treatment can be crucial to the health and wellbeing of transgender adolescents. They contended the Tennessee law amounted to a type of sex discrimination that would have warranted a tougher standard of judicial review.
    


            Justice Sonia Sotomayor, speaking for the three liberal dissenters, lamented Roberts' approach. “By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the Court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims.”
    


            Roberts declined to address whether transgender individuals would specifically merit heightened protection under the Constitution. Yet, Barrett and Thomas, along with Justice Samuel Alito, would have taken on that question, disfavoring trans individuals. (The remaining two conservative justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, signed Roberts' opinion and wrote nothing more.)
    


            Barrett opened her separate statement by asserting that she would have ruled that transgender people do not constitute a class of people who deserve special protection in the law.
    


            “Beyond the treatment of gender dysphoria, transgender status implicates several other areas of legitimate regulatory policy—ranging from access to restrooms to eligibility for boys' and girls' sports teams,” she wrote, joined by Thomas, and adding that if laws singling out transgender people required heightened constitutional scrutiny, “then the courts will inevitably be in the business of closely scrutinizing legislative choices in all these domains.”
    


            In their own separate writings, Thomas and Alito reiterated their criticism of the court's 2020 case, Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that employees fired for being gay or transgender can sue under the prohibition on sex discrimination in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Roberts' opinion neither retrenched on Bostock nor extended it beyond the Title VII employment context to the case at hand.
    


            Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation, said of the court's Wednesday decision, “It's a devastating loss for trans youth and their families who have lost their essential medical care, but it's significant that the opinion is cabined both on the record and on doctrine. We live to fight another day on other laws discriminating against transgender Americans, including our cases challenging Trump's animus-fueled policies.
    


 During oral arguments in December, Roberts foreshadowed his concern that legislators should play the leading role on trans rights:
    


            “We might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else,” Roberts said at the time, “but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.”
    


            That statement recalled similar sentiment from 10 years ago when Roberts dissented as the five-justice majority declared a right to same-sex marriage.
    


            “Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law,” he wrote in that 2015 case of Obergefell v. Hodges. “Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept. … Just who do we think we are?”
    


            That was unusually strident for the chief. Roberts felt so strongly about the case that it marked the first and only time he had dissented aloud from the courtroom bench. (Justices take that rare step when they want to call particular attention to their dissenting view, as Sotomayor did on Wednesday.)
    


            As Roberts referred to legislative control of policy, he avoided the dramatic flourish of 2015.
    


            “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,” he wrote as he concluded his opinion in United States v. Skrmetti. “… (W)e leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
    


            For as much as Roberts confined the decision to medical treatment for trans minors, the Trump administration has already signaled that it would try to use the Skrmetti case to augment its actions against transgender servicemembers.
    


            For the liberal dissenters, the current Trump agenda was in the foreground.
    


            As Justice Barrett questioned whether trans individuals had faced government discrimination, Sotomayor wrote, “Transgender people have long been subject to discrimination in healthcare, employment, and housing, and to rampant harassment and physical violence.
    


            And directly citing Barrett's opinion, Sotomayor added, “(T)hose searching for more evidence of de jure discrimination against transgender individuals, need look no further than the present. The Federal Government, for example, has started expelling transgender servicemembers from the military and threatening to withdraw funding from schools and nonprofits that espouse support for transgender individuals.”
    


            Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, pointed to “the recent rise in discriminatory state and federal policies and the fact that transgender people are underrepresented in every branch of government,” and said the court majority had rendered “transgender Americans doubly vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination.”

Alex Zverev continued his Wimbledon preparations with a dominant 6-2, 6-1 win over the US' Marcos Giron to reach the second round in Halle, despite his attention being temporarily diverted to help an injured fan in the stands.
    


            Play was halted in the first set with Zverev leading 5-2, 15-30 after a crash was heard inside the arena, with video footage showing that a piece of an advertising hoarding had fallen and struck a female spectator sitting in the tier below.

            The world No. 3 quickly went over and handed an ice pack to the fan, who held it against the back of her neck.
    


            “There has never been anything like this in our 32-year tournament history. We deeply regret the incident,” tournament director Ralf Weber said in a statement.
    


            The woman didn't suffer any “major injuries,” the statement added, but was taken to hospital “for safety reasons.”
    


            Weber also offered the spectator a season ticket for next year.
    


            Event managers Dr. Udo Kleine and Uwe Greipel-Dominik said in a joint statement that they suspect “drumming against the boards caused screws to come loose.”
    


            “This must not happen and we apologise. We will also check all the other boards and their fixings immediately after the Zverev match,” they added.
    


            Zverev, who is still searching for his first career grass title after defeat to Taylor Fritz in Sunday's Stuttgart Open final, will play Italy's Lorenzo Sonego in the second round.
    


            The German has twice previously reached the final in Halle, in 2016 and 2017, and is aiming for his seventh career title on home soil.

Live Updates


• Conflict rages: A new wave of Iranian missiles hit Israel today, with a major hospital in the south sustaining “extensive damage,” according to officials. Iran says it targeted a nearby technology park it claims was used by the Israeli military. Israel also attacked Iran's “inactive” Arak nuclear facility, with no major damage reported.
    


• Israel threatens Iran's top leader: Israel's defense minister said Iran's supreme leader cannot be allowed to “continue to exist.” He has instructed the Israeli military to “intensify strikes” against Iranian targets.
    


• US weighs options: President Donald Trump has reviewed attack plans for Iran but is waiting to see whether Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a source told CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has praised the US for “helping a lot” in the conflict.
    


• On the ground: CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Tehran, where the streets are nearly empty amid the sounds of sporadic thuds and outgoing anti-aircraft fire.
    


            The southern Israeli hospital that was damaged in Iranian strikes today has been closed to new admissions, with the exception of “urgent and life-threatening cases,” the hospital spokesperson's office said.
    


            Around 400 patients who were at the hospital in Beer Sheva before it was hit have been discharged or transferred to other hospitals, the spokesperson's office for the Soroka Medical Center said in a statement, with approximately 300 patients remaining at the hospital.
    


            “Approximately 80 people were injured in the incident, about half are hospital staff,” the spokesperson's office said. “All injuries were classified as mild or stress-related.”
    


            The Iranian attack that damaged the hospital was “the most severe incident of its kind in the history of Israel's healthcare system,” according to the statement, adding that the hospital's gas, water, and air-conditioning systems were affected by the blast.
    


                    “All Soroka staff – across all sectors – are operating with a strong sense of responsibility and dedication, ensuring the continued care of the wounded and the maintenance of essential medical services,” the hospital said.
                





            Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Turkey this weekend, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported Thursday.
    


            Araghchi will attend a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an intergovernmental group that largely comprises Muslim-majority countries, Tasnim reported. The meeting will take place Saturday and Sunday in Istanbul, it said.
    


            A special session to address the conflict between Iran and Israel will also take place at the summit, according to Tasnim.
    


            Israeli strikes in Gaza killed more than 70 people on Thursday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said, as Israel continues its military campaign in the besieged enclave amid the escalating conflict with Iran.
    


            Among Thursday's dead are multiple children, Gaza health officials said, including two who were killed after several homes in Jabalia al-Balad, in northern Gaza, came under Israeli fire. In the Al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, three children sheltering in a tent were killed by the bombardment, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza.
    


            Video from after the attacks showed adults bringing injured children, screaming in pain, to Baptist Hospital in Gaza City. Other children appeared lifeless as they were carried into the ward.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment.
    


More context: The latest strikes come as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. The United Nations repeated its warnings Thursday that famine is growing increasingly likely and that there are few areas left in the territory where Palestinians are safe from bombardment.
    


            Attacks on civilians attempting to access food supplies continue, hospitals are overstretched and 55,000 pregnant women are facing growing health risks, according to the most recent report from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
    


            More than 55,160 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war with Hamas began on October 7, 2023, according to the health ministry, including more than 17,000 children.
    


            Satellite images show that Israeli strikes on Iran's Arak Nuclear Facility breached the containment dome of the “inactive” heavy water reactor's containment dome and damaged heavy water distillation towers.
    


See before-and-after images of the Arak nuclear facility: 



            CNN's Jeremy Diamond gained access to a residential and commercial building destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile in Ramat Gan, just to the east of Tel Aviv.
    


            The impact damaged buildings and cars in nearly every direction around the blast radius. The missile, which struck the location just east of Tel Aviv shortly after 7 a.m. local time, shredded the facades of buildings and blew out windows in high-rise blocks.
    


Take a look here:



            Iran has issued a new threat to any “third party” thinking about getting involved in its conflict with Israel, threatening an “immediate” response.
    


            Iran's Supreme National Security Council issued a statement on Thursday afternoon, announcing that the “confrontation with the enemy will continue, until the compensation is paid.”
    


            As the conflict between Iran and Israel stretches to a week, the council said that Iran has plans in place for various scenarios.
    


            Without naming the US or any other country, the council said: “In the event of a third party's intervention in this aggression, they will be confronted immediately according to a specific plan.”
    


            US President Donald Trump is considering entering the conflict but has signaled he's yet to make a decision.
    


            He has reviewed attack plans but is holding off to see if Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The US military has taken several steps to protect its assets and equipment in the Middle East as the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, including evacuating all non-sheltered planes from its sprawling base in Qatar and moving US Navy ships stationed in Bahrain, two defense officials told CNN.
    


            US Central Command has also pre-positioned additional supplies of blood in the region, the officials and a source familiar said, which is standard operating procedure any time there is a possibility of an attack on US forces.
    


            One of the officials described the changes as prudent, precautionary planning amid threats by Iran that it will attack US troops and bases in the Middle East if the US decides to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            The non-sheltered American planes were moved out of Al Udeid airbase in Qatar earlier this week, an official confirmed after satellite imagery showed that the area had been emptied. Additionally, all of the US Navy ships that had been forward-deployed at Naval Support Activity Bahrain — the US Navy's base in the island country — left port earlier this week. It's not clear where the planes and ships have been moved to during the heightened tensions.
    


Remember: President Donald Trump has not yet decided whether to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CNN has reported. But if he does, Tehran has threatened to retaliate directly against the US. Iran has dozens of proxy groups in the region that can launch ballistic missiles and drones at US forces and bases. In January 2024, three US service members were killed and dozens were wounded after an Iran-backed Shia militia launched a drone attack at Tower 22, a US base on the border of Syria and Iraq.
    


            US President Donald Trump's national security team is convening at the White House on Thursday ahead of a scheduled meeting with the president in the Situation Room.
    


            Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and special envoy Steve Witkoff were all seen arriving to the West Wing in the hour ahead of the 11:30 a.m. ET meeting.
    


            Witkoff was seen in the driveway speaking on the phone using AirPods before going inside. Others could have arrived through a different entrance.
    


            The meeting was listed on Trump's schedule as an “intelligence briefing,” but the Situation Room location suggested the talks would be more sensitive than the typical daily intelligence update that is often conducted in the Oval Office.
    


            Trump has met with his team in the Situation Room each of the last two days.
    


            Iran's foreign minister asked Israelis to avoid being near “military and intelligence sites” as his country continues to carry out strikes.
    


            Abbas Araghchi said on X that Iran's military “accurately” eliminated an Israeli command, control and intelligence headquarters, “and another vital target,” but he did not identify the location.
    


            He said the “blast wave” caused “superficial damage” to the nearby Soroka Medical Center, which he claims was treating Israeli soldiers injured in Gaza.
    


            Israel says Iran directly targeted the hospital, while Iran says it was targeting the command center near the medical center.
    


                    “Hundreds of innocent Iranians have been murdered in cold blood since Israel launched its illegal war against the Iranian people last week,” Araghchi said.
                





            “Our powerful Armed Forces will continue to pummel the criminals who target our people until they cease and pay for their criminal aggression against our nation,” he added.
    


            The Iranian foreign minister is set to travel to Geneva in Switzerland to meet European counterparts for talks tomorrow. A diplomat told CNN the talks were exploratory, to “feel the room” as to what could be achieved.
    


            US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to attend the meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy at the White House Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CNN.
    


            The meeting, which was originally scheduled for last week, comes amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and as President Donald Trump mulls US military involvement.
    


            Lammy is expected to travel from the US to Geneva for a meeting Friday between the Iranian foreign minister and British, French, German and EU foreign ministers. As of Thursday morning, Witkoff was not expected to attend that meeting.
    


            Civilians can now leave protected spaces after sirens stopped sounding in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and its surroundings on Thursday.
    


                    “Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces. The public is requested to continue to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command,” the Israeli military said.
                





            CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Beer Sheva, Israel, where a hospital was struck during an Iranian attack.
    


            Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.” There have been dozens of injuries but no reported deaths from the strike.
    


            If Iran's Fordow nuclear facility were damaged or destroyed in a strike by the US, it would likely lead to a limited radiation leak in the immediate area, but it would not pose the same catastrophic consequences as bombing a nuclear reactor, experts told CNN.
    


            Kelsey Davenport, the Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, said that if bombs were able to penetrate Fordow, it would likely lead to “some limited radiation from the uranium enriched and stored at the facility,” but “it's unlikely to cause significant, widespread environmental health contamination.”
    


            She explained that attacking a site where uranium hexafluoride gas — the material fed into the facility's centrifuges — is stored “is going to create chemical toxicities” and “low level alpha radiation,” which would likely be localized to the site.
    


            Davenport said that it would likely be “manageable if people are wearing the right protective equipment.”
    


            Behnam Ben Taleblu, the Iran program senior director and a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), also described the potential damage as being a chemical hazard.
    


            “There isn't a major radiation dispersal risk at Fordow because that enriched uranium is fresh,” explained Scott Roecker, the Vice President for Nuclear Materials Security at NTI.
    


            “It'd be localized around the site, and because it's buried underground too, I don't know you know how much of that would even be released,” he said.
    


            “Bombing a reactor is a whole different ball game,” Davenport explained.
    


            Davenport said she believes it's “extremely unlikely” Israel would bomb a nuclear reactor — a move that “would be a clear violation of international law.”
    


            “You risk a reactor meltdown, widespread radiation and environmental contamination, devastating to the region,” she said.
    


            On a visit to the Soroka Medical Center in the city of Beer Sheva, which was damaged in Iranian strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the United States is “already helping a lot” in his country's conflict with Iran.
    


                    “They're participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities,” Netanyahu told CNN among a group of reporters. “I think it's a remarkable cooperation.”
                





            The prime minister also said that he is being asked whether Israel is targeting the downfall of the Iranian regime. “That may be the result,” he said. “But it's up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap.”
    


            “We may create conditions that may help them do it,” Netanyahu said.
    


            As Israel continues its push against Iran's nuclear ambitions, here's what we know about its own program.
    


How long has Israel had nuclear weapons?



            Israel has never acknowledged its nuclear weapons program and American presidents, certainly aware of Israel's nuclear capabilities, have helped keep secret the closely held details of the program.
    


            But Israel is one of nine countries known to have nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel began exploring nuclear weapons development before its establishment in 1948, then at a secret development site in 1958, near the southern town of Dimona.
    


            It is widely thought that Israel first assembled its first nuclear weapon around 1966 or 1967. In 1968, the CIA issued a report that said Israel had successfully started production of nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel is believed to have conducted a clandestine atmospheric nuclear test in 1979, which it denies.
    


            Its program has been expanding for years, experts say.
    


How big is Israel's nuclear arsenal?



            Israel now possesses around 90 nuclear warheads and is believed to have enough nuclear material to produce up to 300 nuclear weapons, according to the Washington, DC-based NGO, Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI).
    


            It is continuing to modernize its stockpile, according to SIPRI, who said that Israel conducted a test of a missile propulsion system in 2024 that could be related to its Jericho family of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles.
    


            Israel also appears to be upgrading its plutonium production reactor site at Dimona, SIPRI said.
    


What has Netanyahu said?



            In an interview with CNN in May 2018 – shortly after Israel stole Iran's nuclear archive from Tehran – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked if he was ready to acknowledge Israel's own program.
    


            “We've always said that we won't be the first to introduce (a nuclear weapon), so we haven't introduced it,” he said.
    


            Israel has not signed the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and opposes diplomatic efforts to establish a WMD Free Zone in the Middle East.
    


            Israel has signed and ratified the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which obligates signatories not to explode a nuclear device in the atmosphere or oceans.
    


            Iran fired more missiles at Israel today, the Israeli military said, adding that “defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.”
    


            Sirens sounded in the northern city of Haifa and its surroundings.
    


            “The public is requested to follow the instructions of the Home Front Command. At this time, the IAF (Israeli Air Force) is operating to intercept and strike where necessary to eliminate the threat,” the Israeli military said.
    


            It comes after Israel was hit by a new wave of Iranian missiles earlier.
    


            Israel's health ministry says at least 271 people were admitted to hospital this morning following Iranian strikes across the country.
    


            The ministry said four of those sustained severe injuries, while 16 were moderately injured, 24 were hospitalized for anxiety and the remainder were either mildly injured or are still being assessed.
    


            In Soroka, where a hospital was hit by an Iranian missile, 71 people were mildly injured, according to the ministry. Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.”
    


            Since Israel started its operation “Rising Lion” on Friday, more than 2,300 people in Israel have been hospitalized but most have been discharged, the ministry says.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “all of Israel is paying a price” amid the country's conflict with Iran, as he visited the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beer Sheva that was damaged in Iranian strikes
    


                    “All of Israel is paying a price,” Netanyahu said today, adding that, “it is really reminiscent of the Blitz spirit of the British people.”
                





            The prime minister claimed that while Israel is hitting military sites only, Iran “targets and hit a hospital.”
    


            “They hit a hospital where people can't even get up and run away,” he told reporters at the scene, adding that Iran “hit not far from here where there's a ward for children and babies.”
    


            Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that it had targeted an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.”
    


            Israel was hit by a new wave of Iranian missiles on Thursday, which hit multiple cities.
    


            The Israeli military confirmed that its fighter jets struck dozens of military targets in Iran overnight, including the “inactive” Arak nuclear facility.
    


            Tehran is very empty.
    


            The roads are almost empty of traffic and there are few people on the streets.
    


            While many shops remain shut, most supermarkets and banks are still open and still frequented by the people who have remained in the city. And basic services are still very much in operation.
    


            Sporadic thuds can be heard around the city — and the sound of outgoing anti-aircraft fire — but there is no panic. The people who remain here are trying to go about their business.
    


            Following scenes of large lines of cars leaving Tehran — after US President Donald Trump this week warned residents of the city to evacuate — queues at gas stations have dramatically shortened, perhaps because so many people have fled.
    


            On our drive from the Turkish border and in Tehran, there was no sign of any shortage of fuel.
    


            Talks between Iran, the UK, Germany, France and the European Union planned for tomorrow in Switzerland are happening in consultation with the Trump administration, a diplomat from a western European country told CNN.
    


            The official described the talks as exploratory, to “feel the room” as to what could be achieved.

Follow:


            He might do it. But he might not. And you've got no idea whether he will. Then again, neither does he.
    


            Donald Trump's riffing ahead of the most wrenching national security decision in either of his presidencies is nothing like the complex war-gaming and careful tilling of public opinion that most commanders in chief require before they send Americans off to fight.
    


            Trump's vague soliloquies and ambiguous comments, on camera and online, seem glib and even negligent given the grave potential consequences of a US attack on Iran's nuclear sites.
    


            But it's how he rolls. He wants to keep friends and foes guessing. He's shown that he believes unpredictability and volatility — factors that most presidents seek to avoid in national security crises — offer him a key advantage.
    


            Trump loves to be the center of attention with the world hanging on his every word. His equivocating creates space for him to postpone the moment of decision and to avoid locking in definitive courses of action he can't reverse. His fans say it's genius. But there's not much evidence that strategy transfers from a real estate magnate's boardroom to complex geopolitical showdowns and global peacemaking.
    


            Iran's ayatollahs, Israel, US allies, members of Congress, pundits, reporters and Americans watching at home can never be certain what Trump might do next. And no modern president has ever managed the run-up to a possible war as though he is sketching a series of cliffhangers to compel viewers to watch the next episode. Trump is no JFK calmly averting nuclear war with high-pressure diplomatic chess during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
    


            Trump's critics have dreaded the moment when he'd face the kind of international crisis he largely avoided during his first term. And his style has serious drawbacks.
    


            His administration has yet to take the American people into its confidence and explain why it has suddenly changed its view that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. Now, Trump says it's weeks away from one. There's no sign the administration intends to seek authorization from Congress for a possible new act of war against Iran — as the Constitution requires. And it's refusing to say whether it's gamed out how an attack on Iran's nuclear plant at Fordow could reverberate through a treacherous region and whether it has any kind of exit strategy.
    


            This would be troubling in isolation. But following Washington's disastrous history of plunging into quagmires caused by paltry planning for the day after shock-and-awe beginnings, it's tempting fate. And Trump's serial dishonesty and scorched-earth leadership style mean millions of Americans will need a lot more than his word to trust any decision to wage military action.
    


            The president's plans might be a mystery. But his calculation is a simple one.
    


            He must decide whether US interests are served by joining Israel's assault on Iran to try to destroy the Islamic Republic's nuclear program with unique bunker-busting capabilities that only the United States possesses.
    


            It's a tough call because of the potential consequences: Iranian attacks on US bases in the Middle East, potential terrorist attacks on US targets, and a shockwave that could destabilize the world if the regime in Tehran collapses.
    


            The latest developments are ominous. A third US aircraft carrier group is moving toward the Middle East. A fierce war of words between Trump and Iran's clerical leaders is heating up. And the president is huddling in daily Situation Room meetings with his top national security aides.
    


            CNN reported on Wednesday that the president is preoccupied with finding a way to strike key targets of Iran's nuclear program without being dragged into a full-scale war. Sources familiar with the matter said he wants to avoid the kind of open-ended conflict like those in Iraq and Afghanistan that he's vowed to avoid and that he used as a catalyst for his rise among MAGA voters skeptical of war.
    


            These revelations might offer Americans some comfort since they suggest that the president is weighing the implications of his decisions with greater diligence than his offhand patter suggests.
    


            There's some logic to his position. No one expects Trump to put US troops on the ground — they could be a sitting target in Iran or in any post-war failed state insurgency, as happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump's first-term assassination raid that killed Iranian intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani didn't unleash fury against US targets that many analysts expected. And US bases in the region are heavily defended against missile attacks. There's also some question about how much Iran's degraded military can now throw at the US and Israel.
    


            But US foreign policy of the last 25 years is haunted by false assumptions about the behavior of adversaries when they are attacked. As Trump said himself last month in Saudi Arabia, US officials were often meddling in societies they didn't understand.
    


            So, it's fair to ask whether Trump has any idea what he's getting into.
    


            A watching world is no wiser after the president's public appearances Wednesday.
    


            “I mean, you don't know that I'm going to even do it. You don't know. I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,” Trump told reporters who asked him about his plans for Iran as he unveiled two massive flagpoles at the White House. “Nothing's finished until it's finished. You know, war is very complex. A lot of bad things can happen. A lot of turns are made.”
    


            Later, in the Oval Office, Trump told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that he hadn't made a final decision on what to do as he's besieged by pressure for action by Israelis and warnings from his own MAGA base to stay out of foreign wars. “I have ideas as to what to do, but I haven't made a final — I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things change.”
    


            Trump's lack of precision worries Democrats.
    


            “It's obviously unclear where his head is at right now. I think he was pretty indecisive on the subject of Iran, which I can understand,” California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said on “The Situation Room.”
    


            “This is a difficult call. But I don't think we got much guidance as to whether he is optimistic about talks with Iran leaning in towards a potential strike on Iran,” Schiff said, reacting to one of Trump's meandering press availabilities. “It was pretty nebulous, the kind of usual stream-of-consciousness.”
    


            There's confusion about conflicting intelligence assessments in the US and Israel about Iran's nuclear progress. Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is part of a group of senior lawmakers who are given access to the most sensitive classified information. But he's as much in the dark as anyone about what's next.
    


            “I'm a member … of the Gang of Eight. We're supposed to know,” Warner told CNN's Kasie Hunt. “I have no foggy idea what this administration's plans are or what the foreign policy is vis-a-vis Iran.”
    


            The question of the administration's contingency planning is also coming into focus. But don't expect any details.
    


            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confronted by Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin during a hearing on Wednesday. Slotkin speaks from experience: She was a CIA officer who completed combat tours in Baghdad after the George W. Bush administration's disastrous lack of forethought for how to win peace in Iraq.
    


            “Have you commissioned any day-after planning?” Slotkin asked. “Any force protection, any use of ground troops, in Iran; any cost assessments, because I don't think we doubt what we can do as a country, and in the attack. It's the day after with Iraq and Afghanistan that so many of us have learned to be so deeply concerned about.
    


            Hegseth reacted with disdain. “We have plans for everything, Senator,” he said.
    


            Trump showed similar hubris.  “I have a plan for everything, but we'll see what happens,” he told reporters on the Oval Office.
    


            The president also says he's open to diplomacy. But there's no sign of a James Baker-style peace shuttle.
    


            Far from offering his adversary a face-saving off-ramp. Trump is demanding total surrender at the outset. While this may match Israel's goals, it's a nonstarter for Iran's revolutionary corps of leaders in Tehran, who've founded their regime on more than 45 years of defying successive American presidents.
    


            Trump often seems to be operating in a parallel universe. He for instance insists Iranian leaders wanted to meet and “to come to the White House.”
    


            Iran strongly denied any such aspirations.
    


            “We are not begging for anything,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. “As long as the aggression continues, as long as this brutality continues, we cannot think of engaging.”
    


            This points to one of the liabilities of Trump's diplomacy, which also helps explained his failed Ukraine peace drive. His administration shows little skill in creating openings and multilayered negotiating scenarios that can loosen entrenched positions. Trump makes maximalist demands. When interlocutors demur, the process grinds to a halt.
    


            So, for now, the country seems on a path to another venture in the Middle East, with uncertain consequences.
    


            But Trump had one more cliffhanger.
    


            “Anything could happen,” he said, when asked if the regime in Iran could fall in a response which exemplifies his entire presidency.

PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Powerful Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.

The hurricane's center was located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Punta Maldonado. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 125 mph (205 kph). It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center said.




The storm was downgraded slightly before making landfall, from a powerful Category 4 to a Category 3. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 129 mph (210 kph). 

The storm threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero states. Agricultural fields blanket the low-lying coastal area between small fishing villages. 

Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it crashes into the coastal mountains of southern Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane center said.

The storm threatened to unleash destructive winds near where the eye crashes ashore, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge, forecasters said. 




At first light Thursday, Acapulco awoke under ominous dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach.

However, the storm was forecast to move northwest just inland up the coast through midday, bringing heavy rain to the resort and the mountains that tower dramatically above it. 

Still, it appeared Acapulco had dodged the worst at least in terms of Erick's strong winds. 

Late Wednesday, Erick's projected path had crept south, closer to the resort city of Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state with Acapulco up the coast to the northwest. 

President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video message Wednesday night that all activities in the region were suspended and she urged people to stay in their homes or to move to shelters if they lived in low-lying areas.

Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. The beach disappeared under pounding waves and the rising tide had already reached the interiors of some waterfront restaurants.

Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied.

Earlier in the day, fishermen in Puerto Escondido pulled their boats out of the water ahead of the storm's arrival. Some surfers continued to ride waves at the Zicatela beach, even with red flags up to warn people to stay out of the water.

Acapulco residents had braced for Erick's arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Otis two years earlier.

The city of nearly 1 million was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.

Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday.

Carlos Ozuna Romero, 51, lost his restaurant at the edge of an Acapulco beach when Otis slammed the resort with devastating winds. On Wednesday, he directed workers storing tables and chairs.

“Authorities' warnings fill us with fear and obviously make us remember everything we've already been through,” Ozuna Romero said in reference to Otis.

Elsewhere, workers nailed sheets of plywood over shop windows and stacked sandbags outside doorways. Cars lined up to fill their tanks and shoppers made last-minute purchases before rushing home.

Verónica Gómez struggled through the streets of Acapulco with a large jug of water. “We're all afraid because we think the same thing could happen,” said the 40-year-old employee of a shipping company.

But she said she and others learned a lot from Otis. “Now it's not going to catch us by surprise,” she said, holding out a bag of canned food as evidence.

In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.

Forecasters expected Erick to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.

Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes across Guerrero.

Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick churned through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification — when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours — which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.

ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) — Hurricane Erick powered up into a Category 3 major hurricane Wednesday evening as it bore down on the southern Mexico coast, threatening to unleash destructive winds, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge on the region in coming hours, forecasters said. 

Swiftly strengthening from a Category 1 hurricane hours earlier, Erick had maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (200 kph) by nightfall as it churned offshore about 55 miles (85 kilometers) southwest of Puerto Angel, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

Erick was also about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of Punta Maldonado and moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph) toward an expected landfall sometime Thursday morning, according to the center's latest advisory. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph). Forecasters said further strengthening is expected and devastating wind damage is possible near where the eye crashes ashore. 




The projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort's hotels.

In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.

Some beaches were already closed, but tourists continued to sunbathe on others hours earlier as the storm gained strength well offshore.

On a beach in Acapulco, a line of people waited for the help of a backhoe to pull their boats out of the water.

Adrián Acevedo Durantes, 52, hauls tourists around Acapulco's picturesque coastline in boats. Two of his boats sank in Hurricane Otis and a third was badly damaged.

“We're taking precautions because with Otis we never expected one of that magnitude to come and now with climate change the water is warmer and the hurricanes are more powerful,” Acevedo said.

This time the port administration ordered that no one ride out the storm aboard their boats. During Otis many lost their lives by staying on boats in the harbor, which had traditionally been how they ensured their safety during previous storms. He said knew some of those lost at sea.

He acknowledged that it was sunny and the water calm Wednesday afternoon, making it hard to imagine a major storm was on the way, but said “with Otis it was calm all day, sunny, then at midnight there were two hours of strong winds and we saw what had happened the next day.”

Francisco Casarubio, a 46-year-old choreographer, carried a carton of eggs as he did some last-minute shopping ahead of the storm. He planned to pick up rice, beans and some canned food as well.

His home flooded and lost power in Otis and said he was taking Erick more seriously, but hadn't had time to shop until Wednesday.

Forecasters said Erick was expected to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.

A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Ángel. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions are expected in the area, and preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, according to the hurricane center advisory.

Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick's possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday.

Even though the wind had yet to pick up at the Zicatela beach, red flags were up to warn people to stay out of the water. But some surfers ignored them as they continued to ride waves.

Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.

Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said all schools were closed Wednesday and the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators to make their boats storm-ready. Acapulco's port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes.

President Claudia Sheinbaum warned in her daily briefing that those in the hurricane's path should heed government instructions and wait out the storm in their homes or designated shelters.

Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick was churning through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification — when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours — which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa was under a declared state of national disaster on Thursday as the death toll from floods caused by severe rains in the Eastern Cape region rose to 92.

The Eastern Cape government honoured the victims of last week's floods with a provincial Day of Mourning and a memorial service at King Sabatha Dalindyebo Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College in Mthatha, one of the few schools whose infrastructure remained intact.

Speaking at the public memorial service, Zolile Williams, a member of the executive council, said the people of the coastal province have not been the same since the disaster hit, and many are now faced with the challenging task of rebuilding.

“Since June 9, this province has been hit hard by unprecedented, catastrophic and unimaginable disasters, where in the whole of the province, about 92 people have perished,” said Williams.

“Since that day, the Eastern Cape has not been the same. It is the first time we have experienced so many dead bodies, some of whom have not yet been found.”

An extreme weather front brought heavy rain, strong winds and snow to parts of the province caused flooding in one of South Africa's poorest provinces last week, leaving dozens dead and roads, houses, schools and other infrastructure damaged.

At least two school children who were washed away in a bus are among the unverified number of missing persons according to local media reports, while thousands have since been displaced.




Authorities have appealed for residents to report missing people so rescuers could better understand how many people they were still looking for.

Religious leaders from different Christian religions were among the hundreds of mourners who attended the memorial ceremony, lighting candles as a symbolic expression of remembering the 92 people who died in the floods.

In a government notice on Wednesday, Elias Sithole, director of the National Disaster Management Centre, said severe weather had caused property damage. and the disruption of vital services in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, the Western Cape, and the Free State, which prompted South Africa to declare a national state of disaster.

The declaration allows the government to release funding for relief and rehabilitation and will remain in place until it lapses or until the conditions can no longer be categorised as such and is revoked by the head of the centre.

President Cyril Ramaphosa recently visited the town of Mthatha, in Eastern Cape province, where the floods hit hardest.

Many of the Eastern Cape flood victims lived on floodplains close to rivers. Government officials said poor neighbourhoods with informal dwellings were most severely impacted. Authorities have been criticized for the rescue response but also for the state of the infrastructure in the area.

Vanessa Hernández, known by her stage name Nezza, sang a Spanish rendition of the United States' national anthem at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, and she claimed the team wished she did not. 

Now, the singer is saying she has since received death threats for her performance.

Nezza, wearing a Dominican Republic shirt while performing, posted a video on TikTok of a team employee telling her, ""We are going to do the song in English today.""

Nezza decided to sing the Spanish version anyway, saying in a later TikTok video that it was in response to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence in Los Angeles that has led to protests and unrest in the city.

She said the backlash she has received has been harmful.

""That's just the internet. That's going to come with something like that. Anything that involves politics is going to include a death threat here and there,"" Nezza said to TMZ Sports. 

""The main thing I've seen seeing is that it's disrespectful. I don't think it's disrespectful, because the lyrics are still the same exact lyrics as the English version. If both songs were made into a music video, it'd be the exact music video.

""I'm a proud American. I was born here, raised here, my dreams came true here in L.A. I think being a proud American and still wanting better for your country can still be the same truth, and I think people are forgetting that.""

Nezza said she has also received support from celebrities in the Latin community, which ""outweighs"" the hate.

""It's been really sweet to see people you idolize be on the right side of history…"" she said. ""I already knew in my heart what I did was right, but this just triple-confirms it.""

In the aforementioned TikTok, Nezza said she ""just felt like I needed to"" sing the Spanish version - but now she does ""not feel welcome back"" at Dodger Stadium.

Other Los Angeles-based professional sports teams have taken a stance, including the NWSL's Angely City F.C., which gave fans ""Immigrant City Football Club"" T-shirts at their game on Saturday. Players were also seen warming up with the t-shirts on before their match to show support for those protesting.

Nezza's Spanish rendition of the anthem came on the day of numerous ""No Kings"" protests, which were against the military parade in Washington, D.C., that coincided with President Donald Trump's birthday, across the country.

Caitlin Clark was fouled hard during the Indiana Fever's 88-71 victory over the Connecticut Sun. Colin Cowherd says this is great for the WNBA and Caitlin Clark's career and he discusses how she's impacted the league. 

ESPN star Stephen A. Smith suggested on Wednesday that Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was responsible for some of the resentment toward her in the WNBA.

Smith and ""First Take"" panelists Monica McNutt and Christopher ""Mad Dog"" Russo broke down the skirmishes between Fever and Connecticut Sun players. Clark was on the receiving end of an eye poke from Sun guard Jacy Sheldon and was then bumped to the floor by Marina Mabrey.

Clark and Sun players were talking trash throughout the game as tensions began to rise early and eventually boil over. Fever guard Sophie Cunningham also got into the fray with a hard foul on Sheldon late in the game. Both players were ejected.

Smith reiterated his stance that he believed there was ""resentment"" toward Clark but said he had no problem with the frenzy that took place at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse, noting the highly competitive nature of all the athletes on the court.

""Now, here's the thing about, because I want to make sure everyone understands what I'm about to say,"" Smith began. ""Caitlin Clark being that ‘golden goose' per se, that ‘rising tide that's lifting all boats,' I stand by my past proclamations that there's resentment toward her because of that. But I want to take it a step further. There's also resentment toward her because she instigates resentment toward her sometimes. Oh, Caitlin can clap at ya now, Caitlin can antagonize ya now.

SPARKS FACE BACKLASH AFTER SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ACCUSE WNBA TEAM OF POSTING ‘THIRST TRAPS' 

""Remember, in college, the whole Angel Reese thing started because when Caitlin was giving it to everybody else, she was the one waving in their face and that's why when Angel Reese and LSU got a whole of her, Angel Reese was like (waves hand in front of face), ‘Yeah, it's your turn.' That's where it came from. It was instigated by Caitlin Clark. She got a comeuppance and she was big enough to embrace it and accept it and say, ‘Yo, I deserve it, it was my turn because they got me good.""

Smith pointed out that Clark does her fair share of trash talking and can dish it out as well as anyone.

He then compared her to Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird.

""On top of the fact that she could play … but she's kinda like what Larry Bird was when Larry Bird was shooting the lights out and stuff like that but Larry Bird also talked junk,"" he said. ""Dr. J was one of the nicest, sweetest people on the planet. People were saying he was making house calls, helping invite the NBA into America's living room, and Dr. J swung on Larry Bird. Why? Because Larry Bird says, ‘I'm gonna hit this jumper right here on you,' Bam! ‘I'm gonna hit this 3 right here on you,' Bam! … Caitlin Clark is that person as well. The vitriol that she gets, some of it is self-induced, I just happen to love it because that's sports.""

The WNBA gave an additional fine to Cunningham for her involvement in the fracas after the Sheldon foul. She received a standard fine automatically for the Flagrant-2 foul. Mabrey's technical foul was upgraded to a Flagrant-2 foul, and she received a standard fine for that.

The Arkansas Razorbacks, needing a win to stay alive in the NCAA College World Series, were one out away from forcing a rematch with the LSU Tigers on Wednesday night. 

However, left fielder Charles Davalan had a brutal blunder in the outfield in what could have been the end of the game. Instead, it helped LSU earn themselves a spot in the championship series. 

Tigers right-handed hitter Luis Hernandez roped a pitch to left field that went 104 mph off the bat, but it was hit directly at Davalan. However, it appeared the left fielder slipped and misjudged the ball, and it bounced off his shoulder and went toward the wall.

If that was not enough of a problem, there were runners on first and second for LSU, and they both scored to tie things up at five apiece. 

The Razorbacks had just taken the lead in the top of the ninth inning thanks to a Justin Thomas two-RBI single to left field, but it was all for naught in the end.

The Tigers celebrated their trip to the championship series, while Arkansas could not believe they did not force a rematch.

While LSU celebrated, Davalan was understandably emotional after the game. His Razorbacks teammates were seen consoling him as he let his emotions pour out on the field.

Former Acting I.C.E. Director Ron Vitiello applauds President Donald Trump and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem for enforcing the administration's immigration policies on ‘The Ingraham Angle.'

All Elite Wrestling star Brody King wore an ""Abolish ICE"" T-shirt as the company held ""Grand Slam Mexico"" in Mexico City on Wednesday night.

King was a part of a 14-person tag-team match with Adam Cole, Atlantis, Atlantis Jr., Bandido Daniel Garcia and Templario. The pro wrestling stars defeated the team of Dax Harwood, Hechicero, Josh Alexander, Konosuke Takeshita, Kyle Fletcher, Lance Archer and Volador Jr.

The event took place in Arena México and featured wrestlers from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) – one of the top promotions in Mexico.

King's apparent call to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came as he showed support for protestors in Los Angeles who were against the raids that took place in the city. The protesters took a violent turn at several points during the week, with law enforcement officers being injured, autonomous vehicles being set on fire and stores being looted.

He shared a post from Mexican makeup artist Jose Corella, which started ""Let me be clear.""

""What's happening in Los Angeles right now is not only morally reprehensible – it's legally indefensible. This is a sanctuary city, a designation that was democratically voted on and enacted into law by the residents of this city – not by political opportunists grandstanding from a golf course in Florida,"" the message read.

""Let me be clear: being undocumented in the United States is not a criminal offense. It is a civil violation. That means it holds the same legal weight as running a stop sign on a bicycle, setting off a firework after a drink, or selling unlicensed fan merch on Etsy. It is subject to civil penalties – typically a fine – not imprisonment, not detention, and certainly not extrajudicial abduction.

""Dragging someone off the street at gunpoint, without a warrant or due process, and forcing them into an unmarked vehicle operated by armed, plainclothed agents is not law enforcement – it is armed kidnapping. And armed kidnapping is a felony – a real one.

""So, if you're going to obsess over who is *illegal,* start by looking at the heavily armed individuals violating constitutional protections under the guise of enforcing the law. Because what they're doing is criminal, not the people they're targeting.""

Since then, similar messages have been shared by Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Enrique Hernandez and the National Women's Soccer League's Angel City FC.

President Donald Trump has since doubled down on his support of ICE in Los Angeles and called on ICE officers to expand their efforts to other cities.

Caitlin Clark spent part of her offseason on the golf course, teaming up with Nelly Korda and Annika Sorenstam in a pro-am at Pelican Golf Club in November.

The Indiana Fever star played the front nine with Korda and the back nine with Sorenstam. Clark had joked after the team was eliminated from the playoffs that she would take up golfing – and likely did not expect to hit the course with a legend like Sorenstam.

In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Sorenstam recalled playing with Clark on the golf course and said she was a ""bigger fan"" after meeting the young basketball player.

""It's great, obviously, I'm a big fan, and bigger fan after meeting her and spending some time, great athlete very focused, understands when you have a task to do it,"" she said. ""Obviously she has a little golf background, so she is familiar with the sport and understands it to have the culture and have the tradition a little bit.

""No, it is great to bring new people to the sport, get excited and for us to walk around and share stories. To be anything from, I was in college, I was a professional, how to do this or that, working out, there is a lot of things we have in common. It is always fun to listen to other successful athletes or people to pick their brands. Just felt like she was very mature and down to earth in a way.""

GOLF LEGEND ANNIKA SORENSTAM TALKS CHARITABLE EFFORTS AHEAD OF AMERICAN CENTURY CELEBRITY TOURNAMENT

Clark said at a leadership summit connected with the pro-am in November that she tries to practice as much as she can.

""I've tried to take as much time as I can to practice, but there is only so much hope. You just cross your fingers, pray,"" she said at the time. ""No, I've practiced a little bit and I just had the quote about becoming a professional golfer. Everybody thought I was serious. I was not serious. I love it. I love being outside and making it competitive with my friends.

""It's challenging and getting to come here and be around the best and have a good time is what I'm looking forward to.""

Washington Commanders managing partner Josh Harris discusses plans to transform the RFK Stadium site by 2030 on 'Special Report.'

The Washington Commanders will eventually return to the nation's capital and play at the old RFK Stadium site in a state-of-the-art stadium.

One of the keys to earning federal lawmakers' support in building the stadium there was to have ""good-faith negotiations"" about honoring the franchise's legacy as the Redskins and the Native American family that created the original logo the team used for decades before switching names. 

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., made it clear in November on Fox News Channel's ""America Reports.""

While Commanders team owner Josh Harris has made clear that the Commanders nickname is here to stay, Super Bowl champion Joe Theismann expressed optimism that the franchise will find a way to honor the logo and the family behind it.

""I think Josh Harris and his group are certainly well aware of what the Redskins were – obviously being a big fan growing up in this area, it's a dream come true I'm sure for him and some of the people that are a part of the ownership group,"" Theismann told Fox News Digital. ""In some way, shape or form they possibly will honor it.

""I don't know whether people realize but the Redskin logo that was on our helmets was designed by a Native American, and it would be a great honor to be able to continue to honor the Native Americans and the tribes that are a part of that going forward. I mean, that's the way I felt when I put that uniform on. It was an honor for me to be able to represent the Washington Redskins, the Native Americans of this country. We won a Super Bowl, and I was given a chief's headdress. It would be nice again to sort of connect the old with the new.""

Theismann was adamant that the new faces of the franchise should establish their own path forward as the Commanders like the Redskins of his day established theirs.

""Let this group of guys called the Commanders establish their own legacy,"" he said. ""We had one, now it's their turn to establish theirs.""

Blackie Wetzel was credited with creating the portrait of John Two Guns White Calf in 1971, which the Washington Redskins used in 1972, Fox News Digital previously reported. The descendants of Two Guns White Calf also called for the image to be back in the NFL.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The US is debating using its ‘bunker-buster' bomb on Iran: How the weapon works","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense/3446343/bunker-buster-bombs-us-iran-israel-conflict/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:21:15 GMT","

As Iran remains undeterred by President Donald Trump's calls for surrender in its conflict with Israel, the president is considering using a “bunker-buster” bomb to take out a critical Iranian nuclear facility.

Fordow, a key nuclear enrichment site in Iran, was found to have 60% enriched uranium last month, according to the Washington Post. Once uranium reaches 90% enrichment, it can be used to fuel a nuclear weapon.

While Israel has already damaged Natanz, one of Iran's nuclear facilities, Fordow remains untouched. Left unchecked, there is concern that the Iranians could use this facility to build a nuclear weapon quickly, prompting Trump to consider hitting the facility with a “bunker-buster” bomb as a proactive measure to cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities.

Here is everything you need to know about the United States's “bunker-buster” bomb.

The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, also known as the “bunker-buster” bomb, is a GPS-guided bomb measuring 20 feet long and weighing 30,000 pounds, according to the Aviationist.

Trump approved Iran attack plans on Tuesday but still not ready to pull trigger

The bomb is transported using B-2 Spirit planes. According to Air Force Global Strike Command, their stealth and ability to carry significant weight make them the only planes capable of successfully delivering the GBU-57. Typically, each plane can carry two bombs at a time.

Trump has received repeated requests from Israel to come alongside its forces to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, namely its Fordow nuclear enrichment site, Axios reported.

The Fordow facility is buried deep underground in the city of Qom. It is believed to be roughly 262 to 360 feet below the surface, according to the Center for Strategic & International Studies. While Israel does not possess the weapons necessary to penetrate that deep, the U.S. does.

The “bunker-buster” bomb is described as having the ability to breach 200 feet before detonating, according to the Aviationist. If the bomb is successful and destroys the Fordow nuclear enrichment site, it will cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities for the foreseeable future.

It is unclear whether the weapon would successfully destroy Iran's key nuclear facilities.

“So even with bunker-busters, when you're talking about sites like Fordow that are half a mile under mountains, there's no certainty that the U.S. can actually completely destroy the stuff,” Rosemary Kelanic, the director of the Middle East program at Defense Priorities, told the Washington Examiner.

“And so, where does that lead you?” she continued. “Well, if the U.S. bombs them, and we're not certain whether or not it will actually destroy its sites, or we're not certain that we've gotten all the stockpiles. … If we leave it only partly disabled, that gives Iran every incentive to run for a bomb.”

An Iranian official said Wednesday that any U.S. military intervention on behalf of Israel, including bombing Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, would risk “all-out war,” CBS News reported.

One way the Iranians could retaliate against the U.S. for getting involved is by attacking military bases in the region. An Iranian missile has already damaged the U.S. Embassy in Israel, though no military bases have been hit and no U.S. lives have been lost.

Trump has reportedly approved attack plans on Iran but, as of Wednesday night, had not made a call on whether to proceed. U.S. support may be necessary to take out Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Israel's defense minister has since hinted at an intention to kill what he deemed the “modern Hitler.”

IRANIAN STATE TELEVISION ALLEGES WHATSAPP IS PROVIDING USER INFORMATION TO ISRAEL

Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei but has since taunted the supreme leader, suggesting the U.S. could assassinate him in the future.

“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump said of Khamenei in a Tuesday post on Truth Social. “He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats take a political gamble with arrests and theatrics","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3446169/democrats-arrests-confrontational-tactics-draw-attentio/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Democrats are getting arrested, detained, and censured all in the name of protesting President Donald Trump‘s policies, but the theatrics run the risk of backfiring.

From a local mayor to a sitting senator, Democrats have used more confrontational tactics to stand up to Trump's mass deportation operations, which have resulted in lawmakers getting handcuffed or criminally charged. Sitting governors and members of Congress have also dared the Trump administration to arrest them to make political points of defiance.

It's part of a broader strategy by Democrats to show their base they are doing something to stand up to Trump's “tyranny” at a time when they are virtually powerless in Washington and have few legislative ways to check Trump's actions.

While images of lawmakers detained can ignite the base and amplify their accusations of Trump's executive overreach, political strategists say the strategy is risky as one to win back voters, especially if it involves defending illegal immigrants.

Republicans have quickly leaped on recent Democratic run-ins with law enforcement over immigration as “political theater” and an attempt to gain a few moments in the spotlight. And some Democrats agree.

“If showing up at a courthouse and genuinely helping people who have committed no other crime than trying to come here to work, send their kids to school, pay taxes, and be Americans, then, yes, it is good to advocate,” Democratic strategist Jon Reinish said.

“However, if you are doing it to insert yourself into the news cycle or be a performance artist, that is not helpful, and that's something that any American can see through and is exploitative and disingenuous,” Reinish added.

But other strategists argue that protesting outside of immigration detention centers is “absolutely the right approach” and can actually get the young, grassroots voters eager for change and fresh blood to be on the side of Democrats.

“Democrats and Democratic leadership, more importantly, need to get into the street,” strategist Hank Sheinkopf said. “[Sen.] Bernie Sanders is not a young guy, but he's revered by the younger people. Why? Because he's in the street. He's taking on the powerful. He's taking on Trump. Failure to engage in direct action makes the Democrats look old and out of touch.”

Democrats have a long way to go to rebuild trust among voters after the elections last November, as new polls show the party with high disapproval ratings. With no governing power, the party is solely dependent on loud messaging and the hope that Republicans shoot themselves in the foot.

At Trump's joint address before Congress, Democrats wasted no time protesting the president's remarks. Several wore T-shirts with the message “No Kings Live Here” and walked out of his address. Others held up signs that stated “False” or “That's a lie!” Rep. Al Green (D-TX) famously stood up, waving his trademark cane and yelling, “No mandate!” at the president. 

Republicans had accused Green of behaving like a “child,” and 10 Democrats voted with all of the House GOP to censure the Texas Democrat. Several Democrats had said in the aftermath that the explosive outburst by Green and others may not be the best look for the party, despite agreeing with his intentions.

In the months since the address, the ICE raids and deporations of illegal immigrants have given Democrats a soapbox to stand on, but it also presents the party with a problem: Do Democrats fight to release all immigrants, including those who may have committed crimes, in the name of fighting against Trump and his “authoritarian” policies? 

Many household party names, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Govs. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) and Gavin Newsom (D-CA) have adopted the “arrest me” rallying cry — essentially kickstarting a standoff between Democrats and the Trump administration after ICE Director Tom Homan and Trump himself have threatened to arrest lawmakers for not adhering to federal immigration laws. 

Since the deportations from ICE have increased, several Democrats have attempted to gain entry to the facilities or prisons. Some were denied access, while others — like Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ) — have been charged and indicted for allegedly assaulting law enforcement. McIver could face up to 17 years in prison if found guilty.

Republicans have latched onto these incidents as another argument that the GOP is the party of law and order. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) visited ICE's field office in Chicago on Wednesday, praising the “understaffed” and “overwhelmed” officials.

“We came here to make sure that these brave men and women that serve in ICE, who are protecting our communities and upholding federal law, I want to make sure that they know that Republicans have their back,” Johnson said on Fox News' America's Newsroom Wednesday.

“And we want them to know that even though assaults on ICE officers have risen by 413% just in this recent period. Democrats are leading that,” the speaker added. “Republicans are on the opposite side.”

Democrats have warned members of their party to remain peaceful, otherwise they will be at the risk of playing into Trump's hands that the party is out of control and without a cohesive message — a longtime GOP narrative that helped them secure majorities in Congress.

Last week, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was briefly detained by ICE officers after he interrupted a Homeland Security briefing. The department accused him of doing so “without identifying himself” and performing for the cameras. In a widely-circulated video, he is filmed saying, “I'm Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary.”

Democrats are largely standing behind their colleagues, arguing McIver and Padilla were conducting oversight well within their rights as lawmakers. Padilla's arrest, in particular, ignited a firestorm on Capitol Hill as Democrats demanded that congressional Republican leaders denounce the administration's behavior.

Some Democrats have latched onto the opportunity to campaign off of Padilla's brief detainment. Requests have come from lawmakers such as Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ), as well as groups like the DNC, the Harris Victory Fund, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Defend Our Courts, and Resist Reclaim Rebuild.

A Democratic strategist, granted anonymity to speak freely, said he thought Padilla was operating as an “advocate” for his constituents, not doing it for stardom. 

“I do think that he was sticking up for Californians who are terrified,” the strategist said of Padilla. “In the case of Brad Lander, I think that he is a cynical performance artist.”

On Tuesday, New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE officers and charged with assaulting an officer while attending an immigration court hearing.

In the aftermath, Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Dan Goldman (D-NY) were denied access to the ICE office.

The photos of Lander have been ridiculed as staged and “coordinated,” and the strategist agreed. 

“I'm sorry, so Gov. [Kathy] Hochul just sort of happened to be a block away, as did Leticia James, as did [state Rep.] Zoran Mamdani? Come on,” the strategist said. “I beyond cry foul on that one. Migrants are scared. Migrants are terrified. But Brad Lander literally just looks like a cynical performative artist who is exploiting people in need.”

Sheinkopf has been critical of the progressive wing of the Democrats and has encouraged the party to return to the center on political issues, but he thinks the protests and arrests are good branding for the party.

However, are they good for Democratic candidates, including those in swing districts or running in high-profile elections?

“Questionable,” Sheinkopf said. “Lander looks like he's playing to an audience. The photos of him, it's outlandish, grimacing, it was kind of not useful.” 

But, he added, “there are people within his own constituency who are going to be attracted to that.”

He said that, if Lander comes up second in the New York City mayoral race after Zohran Mamdani (who's leading in polls), his stunt with ICE could be “very helpful” in gaining support from the younger electorate in a ranked-choice voting setting.

But that hasn't proven effective in other candidates' cases. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who also protested outside the ICE facility with McIver, lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary last week to Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ).

Trying to circumvent federal law hasn't worked for those within the justice system chafing under Trump's immigration laws, either. A Wisconsin judge was arrested by the FBI and indicted last month for allegedly helping a man escape immigration authorities.

But Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said the arrests and detainments will “fire up Democrats” come the midterms next November, and that the protests shine a light on a larger issue than just congressional lawmakers being unfairly treated.

“I think it's going to make voters stand up and realize we're dealing with a rogue Republican presidential administration that is reaping chaos and confusion across the land. And this is not good for Trump and his MAGA supporters,” Bannon said, particularly as 2026 will be the first ballot in recent cycles where the president's name is not on the ballot.

In the midterms, the House historically flips to the party opposite that of the White House. Upcoming elections in New Jersey and Virginia will serve as a temperature gauge to determine how well-liked Trump's policies are. Democrats only need a net gain of three seats to take the House and break up the trifecta.

Sheinkopf thinks the protests and arrests can help with that, noting Democrats will only be able to “undo” Trump by taking action in the streets.

“It's a smart move,” Sheinkopf said. “It's part of the party rebuilding. If they sit in their office and do nothing, what will happen for them is absolutely nothing. They can't rely on Trump to undo himself.”

But Reinish is urging caution, noting that the American people are smart and can tell when a lawmaker is correcting injustice or “trying to get your couple of hours on social media and on the nightly news.” 

“If you are all across the board trying to apply that to people, regardless of any criminal status, you're out of step with public opinion, and that hurts good people, and it also hurts the Democratic Party,” Reinish said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The White House is staying mum about its plans for Juneteenth, with official guidance released Wednesday night listing no events for the federal holiday.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump will receive an intelligence briefing at 11:30 a.m. and hold a swearing-in ceremony for the ambassador to the Republic of Ireland at 2:30 p.m. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt will host a news briefing at 1 p.m.

No other events are listed on Trump's public calendar, though it's possible officials could make a last-minute addition. The White House did not respond to questions sent earlier in the week from the Washington Examiner about Trump's Juneteenth plans. The federal government will observe the holiday, however.

Last year, President Joe Biden went big, hosting a Juneteenth-themed concert on the White House south lawn and delivering remarks, though the concert was held on June 10 rather than June 19. That event was mostly remembered for the blank stare on Biden's face as the music played and people around him danced.

While Trump's stance against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives is well known, he has been a longtime supporter of Juneteenth, which marks the day in June 1865 when slaves in Galveston, Texas, were told of their emancipation following the end of the Civil War. The news arrived more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.

In 2020, Trump sought to take credit for making Juneteenth “very famous,” telling the Wall Street Journal that “nobody had ever heard of it” before he came along. 

That “fame” arose because Trump scheduled a campaign rally for June 19, 2020, which would have been his first since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. After facing blowback for planning a rally on Juneteenth, especially as Black Lives Matter protests were spreading throughout the country, Trump agreed to push the date back to June 20.

“I did something good: I made Juneteenth very famous,” Trump said of news coverage regarding the controversy. “It's actually an important event, an important time. But nobody had ever heard of it.”

Trump's evidence for that claim was that he'd asked people around him, and none knew of Juneteenth. His White House was generally supportive of the occasion, however, issuing statements in honor of Juneteenth during each year of his first term.

Later in 2020, amidst a fierce reelection campaign, Trump promised to make Juneteenth a national holiday as part of the “Platinum Plan for Black America.” Juneteenth did become a federal holiday in 2021 except under Biden.

The New Right rides again: Review of ‘The New Conservatives' by Oren Cass

Outside of Washington, concerns have arisen about Trump's anti-DEI push affecting Juneteenth plans.

Organizers of the Juneteenth Atlanta parade, for example, said the U.S. Army pulled its support for the event, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, losing about $70,000 because of the pullback. 

Reports have also circulated that corporate sponsors are withholding support, and some local governments have cut back their funding as well. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Israeli Defense Forces warned Iranians within the area of Iran's Arak heavy water reactor to evacuate on Wednesday.

The Farsi-language warning included a red circle around the reactor that indicated it would be targeted for a military strike. The reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran.

It noted that any presence within the area will endanger citizens' lives and that the move is a part of Israel's assault on Iran's military infrastructure.

#BREAKING Israeli army issues evacuation order for Arak and Khandab. This is the area that contains Iran's heavy water reactor. Israel bombing this area would release radioactive materials causing widespread contamination and pose serious health risks ☢️ pic.twitter.com/ZbswrZqrjZ

Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns. Heavy water cools nuclear reactors but creates as a byproduct plutonium, which can be used in a nuclear weapon and could have given Iran a different path to a nuclear bomb instead of enriched uranium. 

In 2019, the country started up the heavy water reactor's secondary circuit, which at the time did not violate the 2015 nuclear deal. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal meant the United Kingdom had to step in for America in helping Iran redesign the Arak reactor to limit the amount of plutonium it produces.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations's nuclear watchdog, urged Israel in the past not to strike Iranian nuclear sites. But the IAEA has said it lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran's heavy water production due to Iranian restrictions on its inspections.

Israel and Iran's recent conflict has been prompted by a lack of success in disarming Iran's nuclear program. Israel said it believed Iran would have nuclear weapons soon, and struck top generals, nuclear scientists, and nuclear sites to sink the country's nuclear effort.

Trump has adamantly said he doesn't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon and is reportedly considering involving the United States in the conflict to strike Iranian nuclear sites.

TRUMP DEMANDS IRAN'S ‘UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.' AND NOW WE WAIT.

“Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple — you don't have to go too deep into it. They just can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said on Tuesday.

The intelligence community has denied that Iran's nuclear program has changed since March, when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building a bomb.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East offer Americans a glimpse into the battles of the future—and a warning.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

I stopped using my cellphone for regular calls and text messages last fall and switched to Signal. I wasn't being paranoid—or at least I don't think I was. I worked in the National Security Council, and we were told that China had compromised all major U.S. telecommunications companies and burrowed deep inside their networks. Beijing had gathered information on more than a million Americans, mainly in the Washington, D.C., area. The Chinese government could listen in to phone calls and read text messages. Experts call the Chinese state-backed group responsible Salt Typhoon, and the vulnerabilities it exploited have not been fixed. China is still there.

Telecommunications systems aren't the only ones compromised. China has accessed enormous quantities of data on Americans for more than a decade. It has hacked into health-insurance companies and hotel chains, as well as security-clearance information held by the Office of Personnel Management.

The jaded response here is All countries spy. So what? But the spectacular surprise attacks that Ukraine and Israel have pulled off against their enemies suggest just how serious such penetration can become. In Operation Spiderweb, Ukraine smuggled attack drones on trucks with unwitting drivers deep inside of Russia, and then used artificial intelligence to simultaneously attack four military bases and destroy a significant number of strategic bombers, which are part of Russia's nuclear triad. Israel created a real pager-production company in Hungary to infiltrate Hezbollah's global supply chains and booby-trap its communication devices, killing or maiming much of the group's leadership in one go. Last week, in Operation Rising Lion, Israel assassinated many top Iranian military leaders simultaneously and attacked the country's nuclear facilities, thanks in part to a drone base it built inside Iran.

In each case, a resourceful, determined, and imaginative state used new technologies and data to do what was hitherto deemed impossible. America's adversaries are also resourceful, determined, and imaginative.

Just think about what might happen if a U.S.-China war broke out over Taiwan.

A Chinese state-backed group called Volt Typhoon has been preparing plans to attack crucial infrastructure in the United States should the two countries ever be at war. As Jen Easterly put it in 2024 when she was head of the Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), China is planning to “launch destructive cyber-attacks in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States,” including “the disruption of our gas pipelines; the pollution of our water facilities; the severing of our telecommunications; the crippling of our transportation systems.”

The Biden administration took measures to fight off these cyberattacks and harden the infrastructure. Joe Biden also imposed some sanctions on China and took some specific measures to limit America's exposure; he cut off imports of Chinese electric vehicles because of national-security concerns. Biden additionally signed a bill to ban TikTok, but President Donald Trump has issued rolling extensions to keep the platform functioning in the U.S. America and its allies will need to think hard about where to draw the line in the era of the Internet of Things, which connects nearly everything and could allow much of it—including robots, drones, and cloud computing—to be weaponized.

China isn't the only problem. According to the U.S. Intelligence Community's Annual Threat Assessment for this year, Russia is developing a new device to detonate a nuclear weapon in space with potentially “devastating” consequences. A Pentagon official last year said the weapon could  pose “a threat to satellites operated by countries and companies around the globe, as well as to the vital communications, scientific, meteorological, agricultural, commercial, and national security services we all depend upon. Make no mistake, even if detonating a nuclear weapon in space does not directly kill people, the indirect impact could be catastrophic to the entire world.” The device could also render Trump's proposed “Golden Dome” missile shield largely ineffective.

Americans can expect a major adversary to use drones and AI to go after targets deep inside the United States or allied countries. There is no reason to believe that an enemy wouldn't take a page out of the Israeli playbook and go after leadership. New technologies reward acting preemptively, catching the adversary by surprise—so the United States may not get much notice. A determined adversary could even cut the undersea cables that allow the internet to function. Last year, vessels linked to Russia and China appeared to have severed those cables in Europe on a number of occasions, supposedly by accident. In a concerted hostile action, Moscow could cut or destroy these cables at scale.

Read: How Israel executed its surprise assault on Iran

Terrorist groups are less capable than state actors—they are unlikely to destroy most of the civilian satellites in space, for example, or collapse essential infrastructure—but new technologies could expand their reach too. In their book The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman and Michael Bhaskar described some potential attacks that terrorists could undertake: unleashing hundreds or thousands of drones equipped with automatic weapons and facial recognition on multiple cities simultaneously, say, or even one drone to spray a lethal pathogen on a crowd.

A good deal of American infrastructure is owned by private companies with little incentive to undertake the difficult and costly fixes that might defend against Chinese infiltration. Certainly this is true of telecommunications companies, as well as those providing utilities such as water and electricity. Making American systems resilient could require a major public outlay. But it could cost less than the $150 billion (one estimate has that figure at an eye-popping $185 billion) that the House of Representatives is proposing to appropriate this year to strictly enforce immigration law.

Instead, the Trump administration proposed slashing funding for CISA, the agency responsible for protecting much of our infrastructure against foreign attacks, by $495 million, or approximately 20 percent of its budget. That cut will make the United States more vulnerable to attack.

The response to the drone threat has been no better. Some in Congress have tried to pass legislation expanding government authority to detect and destroy drones over certain kinds of locations, but the most recent effort failed. Senator Rand Paul, who was then the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and is now the chair, said there was no imminent threat and warned against giving the government sweeping surveillance powers, although the legislation entailed nothing of the sort. Senators from both parties have resisted other legislative measures to counter drones.

The United States could learn a lot from Ukraine on how to counter drones, as well as how to use them, but the administration has displayed little interest in doing this. The massively expensive Golden Dome project is solely focused on defending against the most advanced missiles but should be tasked with dealing with the drone threat as well.

Meanwhile, key questions go unasked and unanswered. What infrastructure most needs to be protected? Should aircraft be kept in the open? Where should the United States locate a counter-drone capability?

After 9/11, the United States built a far-reaching homeland-security apparatus focused on counterterrorism. The Trump administration is refocusing it on border security and immigration. But the biggest threat we face is not terrorism, let alone immigration. Those responsible for homeland security should not be chasing laborers on farms and busboys in restaurants in order to meet quotas imposed by the White House.

The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East are giving Americans a glimpse into the battles of the future—and a warning. It is time to prepare.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

As The Atlantic continues a major expansion of its editorial staff, today editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg is announcing the hires of Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef as staff writers.  Nancy is joining from The Wall Street Journal where she was a national security correspondent; Toluse joins from The Washington Post, where he was a national political reporter and previously served as White House bureau chief; and Quinta has been a contributing writer for The Atlantic and senior editor at Lawfare.  Below is the staff announcement about Nancy, Toluse, and Quinta:

Dear everyone,  I'm writing to share the news that three excellent journalists are joining our team as staff writers: Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef. The Atlantic continues to be the premier destination for the most talented journalists in America, and the addition of these three extraordinarily talented writers simply underscores this point.  First, Quinta: Quinta's byline is actually a familiar one to you and to our readers; as a contributing writer here for the past several years, she's produced some of the most incisive coverage of the Trump years of anyone in journalism. Quinta was one of the people I looked to in the early days of the first Trump term to try to make sense of it all, and she delivered, time and time again. (Her Atlantic archive is a rich source of analysis and wisdom for those seeking to understand our political moment.)  Quinta is sharp, quick, and extremely adept at translating difficult concepts of law and governance into illuminating stories for the general reader. She is currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a senior editor at Lawfare, for which she previously served as managing editor. Quinta will be joining us at the Wharf.  Next, Tolu, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter known for his thoughtfulness, brilliant writing, and years of experience covering politics at the highest level. He is equally at home questioning presidents in the Oval Office as he is documenting the impact of their decision-making on the people they ostensibly serve. He joins us from The Washington Post, where he has been a national political reporter and the paper's White House bureau chief. Before joining the Post, Tolu did stints at Bloomberg News and The Miami Herald.  Tolu is the co-author of His Name is George Floyd: One Man's Life and the Struggle for Racial Justice, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, and was a finalist for the National Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and the J. Anthony Lukas Prize. Tolu will be based at the Wharf.  And now, Nancy: Nancy is a fearless and experienced reporter with a great knowledge of the Middle East. She was based in Baghdad during the Iraq War and later in Cairo, where she covered the broader Muslim world. Her reporting from Iraq focused on the everyday experience of Iraqis and how the U.S.'s military presence reshaped the country's social and political dynamics.  Nancy comes to us from The Wall Street Journal, where she developed a reputation both as a scoop artist and as a tenacious leader among Pentagon and national security reporters. Before joining the Journal, she was a reporter at Buzzfeed News, the Daily Beast, McClatchy Newspapers, the Detroit Free Press, and the Baltimore Sun. Nancy will also be based at the Wharf.  Please join me in welcoming them to The Atlantic.  Best wishes,  Jeff

﻿How smart do toys need to be, really?

The first big Christmas gift I remember getting was an animatronic bear named Teddy Ruxpin. Thanks to a cassette tape hidden in his belly, he could talk, his eyes and mouth moving in a famously creepy way. Later that winter, when I was sick with a fever, I hallucinated that the toy came alive and attacked me. I never saw Teddy again after that.

These days, toys can do a lot more than tell pre-recorded stories. So-called smart toys, many of which are internet-connected, are a $20 billion business, and increasingly, they're artificially intelligent. Mattel and OpenAI announced a partnership last week to “bring the magic of AI to age-appropriate play experiences with an emphasis on innovation, privacy, and safety.” They're planning to announce their first product later this year. It's unclear what this might entail: maybe it's Barbies that can gossip with you or a self-driving Hot Wheels or something we haven't even dreamed up yet.

All of this makes me nervous as a young parent. I already knew that generative AI was invading classrooms and filling the internet with slop, but I wasn't expecting it to take over the toy aisle so soon. After all, we're already struggling to figure out how to manage our kids' relationship with the technology in their lives, from screen time to the uncanny videos made to trick YouTube's algorithm. As it seeps further into our society, a growing number of people are using AI without even realizing it. So you can't blame me for being anxious about how children might encounter the technology in unexpected ways. 

A weekly dispatch to make sure tech is working for you, instead of overwhelming you. From senior technology correspondent Adam Clark Estes.

AI-powered toys are not as new as you might think. They're not even new for Mattel. A decade ago, the toy giant released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond (think Siri, not ChatGPT). It was essentially the same concept as Teddy Ruxpin except with a lot of digital vulnerabilities. Naturally, security researchers took notice and hacked Hello Barbie, revealing that bad actors could steal personal information or eavesdrop on conversations children were having with the doll. Mattel discontinued the doll in 2017. Hello Barbie later made an appearance in the Barbie movie alongside other poor toy choices like Sugar Daddy Ken and Pregnant Midge.

Despite this cautionary tale, companies keep trying to make talking AI toys a thing. One more recent example comes from the mind of Grimes, of all people. Inspired by the son she shares with Elon Musk, the musician teamed up with a company called Curio to create a stuffed rocket ship named Grok. The embodied chatbot is supposed to learn about whomever is playing with it and become a personalized companion. In real life, Grok is frustratingly dumb, according to Katie Arnold-Ratliff, a mom and writer who chronicled her son's experience with the toy in New York magazine last year.

“What captures the hearts and minds of young children is often what they create for themselves with the inanimate artifacts.”

“When it started remembering things about my kid, and speaking back to him, he was amazed,” Arnold-Ratliff told me this week. “That awe very quickly dissipated once it was like, why are you talking about this completely unrelated thing.”

Grok is still somewhere in their house, she said, but it has been turned off for quite some time. It turns out Arnold-Ratliff's son is more interested in inanimate objects that he can make come alive with his imagination. Sure, he'll play Mario on his Nintendo Switch for long stretches of time, but afterward, he'll draw his own worlds on paper. He'll even create digital versions of new levels on Super Mario Maker but get frustrated when the software can't keep up with his imagination.

This is a miraculous paradox when it comes to kids and certain tech-powered toys. Although an adult might think that, for instance, AI could prompt kids to think about play in new ways or become an innovative new imaginary friend, kids tend to prefer imagining on their own terms. That's according to Naomi Aguiar, PhD, a researcher at Oregon State University who studies how children form relationships with AI chatbots. 

“There's nothing wrong with children's imaginations. They work fine,” Aguiar said. “What captures the hearts and minds of young children is often what they create for themselves with the inanimate artifacts.”

Aguiar did concede that AI can be a powerful educational tool for kids, especially for those who don't have access to resources or who may be on the spectrum. “If we focus on solutions to specific problems and train the models to do that, it could open up a lot of opportunities,” she told me. Putting AI in a Barbie, however, is not solving a particular problem.

None of this means that I'm allergic to the concept of tech-centric toys for kids. Quite the opposite, in fact. Ahead of the Mattel-OpenAI announcement, I'd started researching toys my kid might like that incorporated some technology — enough to make them especially interesting and engaging — but stopped short of triggering dystopian nightmares. Much to my surprise, what I found was something of a mashup between completely inanimate objects and that terrifying Teddy Ruxpin.

One of these toys is called a Toniebox, a screen-free audio player with little figurines called Tonies that you put atop the box to unlock content — namely songs, stories, and so forth. Licenses abound, so you can buy a Tonie that corresponds with pretty much any popular kids character, like Disney princesses or Paddington Bear. There are also so-called Creative Tonies that allow you to upload your own audio. For instance, you could ostensibly have a stand-in for a grandparent to enable story time, even if Grandma and Grandpa are not physically there. The whole experience is mediated with an app that the kid never needs to see.

There's also the Yoto Player and the Yoto Mini, which are similar to the Toniebox but use cards instead of figurines and have a very low-resolution display that can show a clock or a pixelated character. Because it has that display, kids can also create custom icons to show up when they record their own content onto a card. Yoto has been beta-testing an AI-powered story generator, which is designed for parents to create custom stories for their kids.

If those audio players are geared toward story time, a company called Nex makes a video game console for playtime. It's called Nex Playground, and kids use their movements to control it. This happens thanks to a camera equipped with machine-learning capabilities to recognize your movements and expressions. So imagine playing Wii Sports, but instead of throwing the Nintendo controller through your TV screen when you're trying to bowl, you make the bowling motion to play the game. 

Nex makes most of its games in-house, and all of the computation needed for its gameplay happens on the device itself. That means there's no data being collected or sent to the cloud. Once you download a game, you don't even have to be online to play it.

“We envision toys that can just grow in a way where they become a new way to interact with technology for kids and evolve into something that's much deeper, much more meaningful for families,” David Lee, CEO of Nex, said when I asked him about the future of toys.

It will be a few more years before I have to worry about my kid's interactions with a video game console, much less an AI-powered Barbie — and certainly not Teddy Ruxpin. But she loves her Toniebox. She talks to the figurines and lines them up alongside each other, like a little posse. I have no idea what she's imagining them saying back. In a way, that's the point.

“I should have thought of this 10 years ago,” Yoshua Bengio says.

The science fiction author Isaac Asimov once came up with a set of laws that we humans should program into our robots. In addition to a first, second, and third law, he also introduced a “zeroth law,” which is so important that it precedes all the others: “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”

This month, the computer scientist Yoshua Bengio — known as the “godfather of AI” because of his pioneering work in the field — launched a new organization called LawZero. As you can probably guess, its core mission is to make sure AI won't harm humanity. 

Even though he helped lay the foundation for today's advanced AI, Bengio is increasingly worried about the technology over the past few years. In 2023, he signed an open letter urging AI companies to press pause on state-of-the-art AI development. Both because of AI's present harms (like bias against marginalized groups) and AI's future risks (like engineered bioweapons), there are very strong reasons to think that slowing down would have been a good thing.

But companies are companies. They did not slow down. In fact, they created autonomous AIs known as AI agents, which can view your computer screen, select buttons, and perform tasks — just like you can. Whereas ChatGPT needs to be prompted by a human every step of the way, an agent can accomplish multistep goals with very minimal prompting, similar to a personal assistant. Right now, those goals are simple — create a website, say — and the agents don't work that well yet. But Bengio worries that giving AIs agency is an inherently risky move: Eventually, they could escape human control and go “rogue.”

So now, Bengio is pivoting to a backup plan. If he can't get companies to stop trying to build AI that matches human smarts (artificial general intelligence, or AGI) or even surpasses human smarts (artificial superintelligence, or ASI), then he wants to build something that will block those AIs from harming humanity. He calls it “Scientist AI.”

Scientist AI won't be like an AI agent — it'll have no autonomy and no goals of its own. Instead, its main job will be to calculate the probability that some other AI's action would cause harm — and, if the action is too risky, block it. AI companies could overlay Scientist AI onto their models to stop them from doing something dangerous, akin to how we put guardrails along highways to stop cars from veering off course.

I talked to Bengio about why he's so disturbed by today's AI systems, whether he regrets doing the research that led to their creation, and whether he thinks throwing yet more AI at the problem will be enough to solve it. A transcript of our unusually candid conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. 

Sigal Samuel

When people express worry about AI, they often express it as a worry about artificial general intelligence or superintelligence. Do you think that's the wrong thing to be worrying about? Should we only worry about AGI or ASI insofar as it includes agency? 

Yoshua Bengio

Yes. You could have a superintelligent AI that doesn't “want” anything, and it's totally not dangerous because it doesn't have its own goals. It's just like a very smart encyclopedia.

Sigal Samuel

Researchers have been warning for years about the risks of AI systems, especially systems with their own goals and general intelligence. Can you explain what's making the situation increasingly scary to you now? 

Yoshua Bengio

In the last six months, we've gotten evidence of AIs that are so misaligned that they would go against our moral instructions. They would plan and do these bad things — lying, cheating, trying to persuade us with deceptions, and — worst of all — trying to escape our control and not wanting to be shut down, and doing anything [to avoid shutdown], including blackmail. These are not an immediate danger because they're all controlled experiments...but we don't know how to really deal with this.

Sigal Samuel 

And these bad behaviors increase the more agency the AI system has?

Yoshua Bengio

Yes. The systems we had last year, before we got into reasoning models, were much less prone to this. It's just getting worse and worse. That makes sense because we see that their planning ability is improving exponentially. And [the AIs] need good planning to strategize about things like “How am I going to convince these people to do what I want?” or “How do I escape their control?” So if we don't fix these problems quickly, we may end up with, initially, funny accidents, and later, not-funny accidents. 

That's motivating what we're trying to do at LawZero. We're trying to think about how we design AI more precisely, so that, by construction, it's not even going to have any incentive or reason to do such things. In fact, it's not going to want anything. 

Sigal Samuel 

Tell me about how Scientist AI could be used as a guardrail against the bad actions of an AI agent. I'm imagining Scientist AI as the babysitter of the agentic AI, double-checking what it's doing.

Yoshua Bengio

So, in order to do the job of a guardrail, you don't need to be an agent yourself. The only thing you need to do is make a good prediction. And the prediction is this: Is this action that my agent wants to do acceptable, morally speaking? Does it satisfy the safety specifications that humans have provided? Or is it going to harm somebody? And if the answer is yes, with some probability that's not very small, then the guardrail says: No, this is a bad action. And the agent has to [try a different] action. 

Sigal Samuel 

But even if we build Scientist AI, the domain of “What is moral or immoral?” is famously contentious. There's just no consensus. So how would Scientist AI learn what to classify as a bad action?

Yoshua Bengio

It's not for any kind of AI to decide what is right or wrong. We should establish that using democracy. Law should be about trying to be clear about what is acceptable or not. 

Now, of course, there could be ambiguity in the law. Hence you can get a corporate lawyer who is able to find loopholes in the law. But there's a way around this: Scientist AI is planned so that it will see the ambiguity. It will see that there are different interpretations, say, of a particular rule. And then it can be conservative about the interpretation — as in, if any of the plausible interpretations would judge this action as really bad, then the action is rejected. 

Sigal Samuel 

I think a problem there would be that almost any moral choice arguably has ambiguity. We've got some of the most contentious moral issues — think about gun control or abortion in the US — where, even democratically, you might get a significant proportion of the population that says they're opposed. How do you propose to deal with that?

Yoshua Bengio

I don't. Except by having the strongest possible honesty and rationality in the answers, which, in my opinion, would already be a big gain compared to the sort of democratic discussions that are happening. One of the features of the Scientist AI, like a good human scientist, is that you can ask: Why are you saying this? And he would come up with — not “he,” sorry! — it would come up with a justification. 

The AI would be involved in the dialogue to try to help us rationalize what are the pros and cons and so on. So I actually think that these sorts of machines could be turned into tools to help democratic debates. It's a little bit more than fact-checking — it's also like reasoning-checking.

Sigal Samuel 

This idea of developing Scientist AI stems from your disillusionment with the AI we've been developing so far. And your research was very foundational in laying the groundwork for that kind of AI. On a personal level, do you feel some sense of inner conflict or regret about having done the research that laid that groundwork? 

Yoshua Bengio 

I should have thought of this 10 years ago. In fact, I could have, because I read some of the early works in AI safety. But I think there are very strong psychological defenses that I had, and that most of the AI researchers have. You want to feel good about your work, and you want to feel like you're the good guy, not doing something that could cause in the future lots of harm and death. So we kind of look the other way. 

And for myself, I was thinking: This is so far into the future! Before we get to the science-fiction-sounding things, we're going to have AI that can help us with medicine and climate and education, and it's going to be great. So let's worry about these things when we get there. 

But that was before ChatGPT came. When ChatGPT came, I couldn't continue living with this internal lie, because, well, we are getting very close to human-level.

Sigal Samuel 

The reason I ask this is because it struck me when reading your plan for Scientist AI that you say it's modeled after the platonic idea of a scientist — a selfless, ideal person who's just trying to understand the world. I thought: Are you in some way trying to build the ideal version of yourself, this “he” that you mentioned, the ideal scientist? Is it like what you wish you could have been?

Yoshua Bengio 

You should do psychotherapy instead of journalism! Yeah, you're pretty close to the mark. In a way, it's an ideal that I have been looking toward for myself. I think that's an ideal that scientists should be looking toward as a model. Because, for the most part in science, we need to step back from our emotions so that we avoid biases and preconceived ideas and ego. 

Sigal Samuel 

A couple of years ago you were one of the signatories of the letter urging AI companies to pause cutting-edge work. Obviously, the pause did not happen. For me, one of the takeaways from that moment was that we're at a point where this is not predominantly a technological problem. It's political. It's really about power and who gets the power to shape the incentive structure. 

We know the incentives in the AI industry are horribly misaligned. There's massive commercial pressure to build cutting-edge AI. To do that, you need a ton of compute so you need billions of dollars, so you're practically forced to get in bed with a Microsoft or an Amazon. How do you propose to avoid that fate? 

Yoshua Bengio 

That's why we're doing this as a nonprofit. We want to avoid the market pressure that would force us into the capability race and, instead, focus on the scientific aspects of safety. 

I think we could do a lot of good without having to train frontier models ourselves. If we come up with a methodology for training AI that is convincingly safer, at least on some aspects like loss of control, and we hand it over almost for free to companies that are building AI — well, no one in these companies actually wants to see a rogue AI. It's just that they don't have the incentive to do the work! So I think just knowing how to fix the problem would reduce the risks considerably.

I also think that governments will hopefully take these questions more and more seriously. I know right now it doesn't look like it, but when we start seeing more evidence of the kind we've seen in the last six months, but stronger and more scary, public opinion might push sufficiently that we'll see regulation or some way to incentivize companies to behave better. It might even happen just for market reasons — like, [AI companies] could be sued. So, at some point, they might reason that they should be willing to pay some money to reduce the risks of accidents. 

Sigal Samuel

I was happy to see that LawZero isn't only talking about reducing the risks of accidents but is also talking about “protecting human joy and endeavor.” A lot of people fear that if AI gets better than them at things, well, what is the meaning of their life? How would you advise people to think about the meaning of their human life if we enter an era where machines have both agency and extreme intelligence? 

Yoshua Bengio 

I understand it would be easy to be discouraged and to feel powerless. But the decisions that human beings are going to make in the coming years as AI becomes more powerful — these decisions are incredibly consequential. So there's a sense in which it's hard to get more meaning than that! If you want to do something about it, be part of the thinking, be part of the democratic debate. 

I would advise us all to remind ourselves that we have agency. And we have an amazing task in front of us: to shape the future.

Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he expects Donald Trump to name a mainstream candidate to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite the president's bashing of the US central bank leader for failing to cut interest rates this year.

“I would be quite surprised if he did not make a choice that fair-minded observers on both sides recognized as a reasonable person,” Summers said on Bloomberg Television's Wall Street Week with David Westin. “I am considerably more confident than some” that Trump would make such a decision, thanks to the swift financial-market reactions to the news when it comes, he said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Travel:

The iconic airline, which went bankrupt in 1991, returns to the air in an unexpected way.

A Pan American flight from the airline's final years.

A small gaggle of former Pan American World Airways flight attendants stood by a window in Terminal 7 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, craning their necks and holding up phones. There were a few audible gasps and a soft cry of “Oh gosh, there it is” as the plane came into view. Several of the women teared up as the jet finally slid past the window, its fin bearing the unmistakable cobalt-blue meatball of the Pan Am logo.

The former flight attendants—and several dozen fellow passengers—were at JFK on Tuesday to board the plane, a chartered Boeing 757 that's being billed as a “Pan Am journey by private air.” Over 12 days the plane will travel from New York to Bermuda and then on to Lisbon, Marseille, London, and Shannon, Ireland, before returning to New York City. The plane itself, which has capacity for 50 passengers, features fully reclinable lie-back seats, personal devices from which to stream entertainment options, as well as an open bar and chef-prepared meals served by attendants dressed in full Pan Am regalia. The trip cost $59,950 per person for double occupancy, $5,600 more for single occupancy.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In a wider context of might makes right, the attack on Iran will pile onto a trend.

The Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima.

Donald Trump seems on the cusp of ordering B2 bombers to join Israel's assault on Iran's nuclear program. It could all be a bluff, of course, but I suspect Benjamin Netanyahu knew his man. The appeal of being the US president who finally ended the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran – as opposed to the one who Taco'd out of helping Israel to get there – will be strong.Should that happen, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei will have multiple options: He could attack US bases, set Saudi oil refineries ablaze or close the Strait of Hormuz. Or, he could do nothing, hoping to avoid an all-out war he could never win. He might cut a new deal, abandon nuclear enrichment or build new enrichment cascades even deeper underground and dash for a bomb. Such are the unknowns that can produce the forever wars that nobody ever intends.The one thing that does seem clear, however, is that the Israeli and now potentially US decision to bomb a threshold nuclear power to its knees will have significant implications for arms proliferation.The optimistic case is that those B2s fly the roughly 7,000 miles from their base in Missouri to drop 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iran's deeply buried uranium-enrichment facility, at Fordow, near the holy city of Qom, and obliterate it. With Israeli jets already taking care of less hard-to-reach targets, and assuming no secret factory gets missed, the Islamic Republic would have to restart its uranium-enrichment program from scratch.That should dissipate or at least postpone the risk of a regional arms race. For if Iran doesn't have a nuclear arsenal, there'd be no imperative for Saudi Arabia or Turkey to get one, too. At least, that's among the key justifications for taking military action that proponents in Washington and Israel have long made.Israel has its own reasons for preventing Iran from getting the ultimate weapon, which would pose an existential threat in implacably hostile hands. That doesn't apply for the US. Its interests are more focused on these regional proliferation calculations — a difference that may help explain the reluctance of successive American presidents to back Israeli plans for airstrikes.But a more positive regional outcome is hardly guaranteed. It isn't just that the MOPs could fail to blast through a mountain to the cascade chambers at Fordow, leaving Iran's neighbors to assume the worst — that the regime would dash for a bomb to ward off future attacks. That's especially true if Iran should, as some officials have threatened, kick out international inspectors and withdraw from the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, or NPT.A less cheering interpretation is that no matter how successful the attack, it will reinforce for governments around the world the lesson that a working nuclear arsenal protects you from getting bombed or invaded. That was illustrated by Libya in 2011, Ukraine in 2022, and now Iran in 2025. Iran's fellow pariah state North Korea, meanwhile, remains free to taunt the US and its allies, because it already has the bomb.There's a bigger trend and context to this scenario, because the NPT looks increasingly like a document from an earlier era. It's going to lose potency as we move from a rules-based order to one in which stronger countries assert their perceived national interests, regardless of international laws and treaties.This is the world in which China, in 2016, simply dismissed international arbitration that rejected its claims to own the South China Sea and all islands within it, up to an imaginary “nine-dash line.” It's the world in which Russia claims a right to invade Ukraine in breach of multiple treaties and agreements, and is willing to threaten a nuclear strike in pursuit of this territorial conquest. Meanwhile, the main architect of the rules-based order, the US, is now declaring intentions to take over Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal.Arms control, too, looks out of fashion. China's adding 100 warheads to its arsenal each year, while most of the established nuclear powers have announced programs to update or expand theirs. New Start, the only remaining nuclear arms-control treaty is due to expire next year and there's no sign of any negotiations to renew it.In this environment, it becomes increasingly appealing to have your own nuclear weapons. What else could protect against apex predators such as China, Russia and the US? Or from the regional hegemon that Israel is fast becoming? 

“Some will bandwagon with stronger states while others may decide to balance with the only truly powerful asset, nuclear weapons,” Nikolai Sokov, a nuclear negotiator (for Moscow) during the Cold War and now senior fellow with the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told me. “We are talking years, of course, so neither Trump, nor Netanyahu will be answerable or will have to deal with consequences.”Should Trump decide to join Israel in bombing Iran's fuel-enrichment facilities (another first), it may well have no discernible short term effect on proliferation. Added together, the world's nuclear arsenals already store 14,000 times the power of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and that figure is rising all the time. But while setting back one nuclear program, the attack on Iran will very likely add to a gathering momentum for more.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Oil watchers are re-evaluating the risk premium they should place on the global crude market, with the prospect of the US joining Israel in bombing Iran looming.

Brent futures have been pricing in a geopolitical premium of about $8 a barrel since Israel and Iran began attacking each other last week, according to a survey of analysts and traders. US intervention in the conflict would bolster that further, but exactly how much would depend on the nature of the involvement, the nine respondents said.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Google suffered a setback Thursday after an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended it dismiss the tech giant's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.7 billion) antitrust fine.

Juliane Kokott, advocate general at the European Court of Justice, advised the court to throw out Google's appeal and confirm the fine, which was reduced in 2022 to 4.125 billion euros from 4.34 billion euros previously by the EU's General Court.

""In her Opinion delivered today, Advocate General Kokott proposes that the Court of Justice dismiss Google's appeal and, therefore, uphold the judgment of the General Court,"" the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a press release Thursday.

The fine relates to a long-running antitrust case surrounding Google's Android operating system.

In 2018, the European Commission slapped Google with the record-breaking penalty on the grounds that it abused Android's mobile dominance to give unfair advantage to its own apps via pre-installation deals with smartphone makers. The Commission is the executive body of the EU.

Google said it was ""disappointed"" with the ECJ advocate general's verdict, adding it ""would discourage investment in open platforms and harm Android users, partners and app developers.""

""Android has created more choice for everyone and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world,"" a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email.

Though the advocate general's proposal is non-binding, judges tend to follow four out of five such non-binding opinions. The ECJ is expected to deliver a final ruling in the coming months.

BEIJING — Avatars generated by artificial intelligence are now able to sell more than real people can, according to a collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and a popular livestreamer.

Luo Yonghao, one of China's earliest and most popular livestreamers, and his co-host Xiao Mu both used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers in real time for well over six hours on Sunday on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform ""Youxuan"", the Chinese tech company said. The session raked in 55 million yuan ($7.65 million).

In comparison, Luo's first livestream attempt on Youxuan last month, which lasted just over four hours, saw fewer orders for consumer electronics, food and other key products, Baidu said.

Luo said that it was his first time using virtual human technology to sell products through livestreaming.

""The digital human effect has scared me ... I'm a bit dazed,"" he told his 1.7 million followers on social media platform Weibo, according to a CNBC translation.

Luo started livestreaming in April 2020 on ByteDance's short video app Douyin, in an attempt to pay off debts racked up by his struggling smartphone company Smartisan. His ""Be Friends"" Douyin livestream account has nearly 24.7 million followers.

Luo's and his co-host's avatars were built using Baidu's generative AI model, which learned from five years' worth of videos to mimic their jokes and style, Wu Jialu, head of research at Luo's other company, Be Friends Holding, told CNBC on Wednesday.

""This is a DeepSeek moment for China's entire livestreaming and digital human industry,"" Wu said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. DeepSeek, China's version of OpenAI, rattled global investors in January with its claims of rivaling ChatGPT at far lower costs and using an open-source approach.

AI avatars can sharply reduce costs since companies don't need to hire a large production team or a studio to livestream. The digital avatars can also stream nonstop without needing breaks.

""We have always been skeptical about digital people livestreaming,"" Wu said, noting the company had tried out various kinds of digital humans over the years.

But he said that Baidu now offers the best digital human product currently available, compared to the early days of livestreaming e-commerce five or six years ago.

Livestream shopping took off in China after the pandemic forced businesses to find alternative sales channels. More people are turning to livestreaming to earn money from commissions and virtual gifts amid slower economic growth.

Livestreaming generated so many sales on Douyin last year that the app surpassed traditional e-commerce company JD.com to become China's second-largest e-commerce platform — and ate into the market share of lead player Alibaba, according to a report from Worldpanel and Bain & Company last week. Both JD.com and Alibaba's Taobao also offer livestreaming sales portals.

Meanwhile, other Chinese companies, including tech giant Tencent, have developed tools to create digital people that can be used as news anchors. In late 2023, several businesses started trying out virtual human livestreamers during the Singles Day shopping holiday.

But analysts have cautioned that products sold via livestreams tend to have a high return rate as they are often impulse purchases.

The biggest challenge for using virtual humans to livestream is no longer the technology, but compliance and platform requirements, Wu said. Digital humans need to be trained to adhere to regulations about product advertising, while major livestreaming platforms may have different rules about allowing virtual people to host the sessions, he said.

For example, Douyin has rolled out restrictions on using the technology, especially if the virtual people do not interact with viewers.

While Luo's next virtual human appearance hasn't been set yet, Wu said he expects it will be very soon. And in the future, he said, digital humans could easily livestream in multiple languages to reach users outside China.

A SpaceX Starship rocket on Wednesday exploded at the Starbase facility in Texas during routine testing in preparation for a launch flight, according to local authorities and live stream footage.

The rocket ""experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase"" at 11 p.m. local time, SpaceX said on social media, noting ""a safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for.""

Local authorities said that Starship ""suffered a catastrophic failure and exploded,"" with no injuries reported at the time of writing and an investigation is now underway. Live stream footage of Starbase showed the rocket burst into flame, shooting a large fireball into the sky.

Another Starship launch was expected to take place by the end of this month.

It's been a tempestuous ride for Elon Musk's mammoth Starship, after three flight launch attempts devolved in fiery glory and air-traffic stopping debris this year to date. Notably, the rocket model has taken off successfully in previous instances, but its vast scale — standing 120 meters (394 feet) tall when factoring in the Super Heavy booster — has raised concerns over its overall reliability and requirements for orbital refueling once in flight.

Yet Musk has clinched his hopes on Starship as the key vehicle for both NASA's third and fourth Artemis missions — part of a broader plan to return humans to the Moon — due to take place over 2027-2028. The rocket is also set to play a role in launching the Starlab private space station in the transition to commercial space orbiting labs once the International Space Station retires after 2030.

Critically, Starship is also central to Musk's — and former ally U.S. President Donald Trump's — broader ambitions to colonize Mars. The rocket is set to ferry Optimus robots to the red planet by the end of 2026, with Musk in March saying, ""If those landings go well, then human landings may start as soon as 2029, although 2031 is more likely.""

At U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, the topic of tariffs — specifically, their impact on prices — was a recurring one.

""Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs,"" Powell said. ""And some of it will fall on the end consumer.""

Granted, recent economic data has been upbeat, suggesting the U.S. economy has been able to — and could still — escape from tariffs mostly unscathed.

In May, a better-than-expected 139,000 jobs were added and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%. Consumer sentiment in early June was much more optimistic than forecast, according to a University of Michigan survey. And, most crucially, inflation in May — based on the consumer price index — ticked up just 0.1% for the month, lower than estimated.

But that string of positive data might have to thank the slow process by which tariffs move through the economy.

""It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed. So we're beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over the coming months,"" Powell said.

And even though Fed officials, at present, ""don't see signs"" of the U.S. economy weakening, Powell acknowledged growth will slow ""eventually."" In other words, stagflation — the toxic mix of higher prices and slower growth — could be a possibility in the months ahead.

The song ""I Got Summer on My Mind"" went viral in 2022. ""I Got Stagflation on My Mind"" could be the Fed's — and market watchers' — earworm this summer.

U.S. central bank holds rates, sees two cutsThe U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. Along with the rate decision, the committee indicated, through its closely watched ""dot plot,"" that two cuts by the end of 2025 are still on the table. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the fed funds rate should be at least 2 percentage points lower, and again slammed Chair Jerome Powell, calling him ""stupid.""

Fed hikes inflation and lowers growth forecastsInflation in the U.S., measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will rise beyond 3% in 2025, according to an updated Fed forecast. The central bank had in March expected the PCE to hit 2.8%. The PCE came in at just 2.1% in April. The Fed also sees economic growth slowing to 1.4% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. In combination, both forecasts point to early signs of stagflation.

Markets flat in U.S. but fall in AsiaU.S. stocks hovered around the flatline Wednesday. The S&P 500 slipped 0.03%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1% down, but the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.13%. Oil prices, likewise, were little changed. Asia-Pacific markets fell Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost as much as 2%, leading declines in the region. In Japan, shares of Nippon Steel popped more than 3% after the firm completed its acquisition of U.S. Steel.

Iran regime change 'not an official objective': HerzogIsraeli President Isaac Herzog told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Wednesday that a regime change in Iran was ""not an official objective of ours,"" and the goal was ""to remove the Iranian nuclear program."" Herzog, who accused Tehran of ""rushing to the bomb,"" added that a ""change in [regime] can also bring peace in the region."" When asked if there was a diplomatic ramp off available to de-escalate the situation, he said ""there is actually a lot of back channel.""

Trump says he hasn't decided on Iran strikesFor the second time in two days, Trump on Wednesday met his national security team in the White House amid the Israel-Iran conflict. The closed-door gathering took place as Trump insisted he had not yet decided whether to order a U.S. strike on Iran. The same day, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said evacuation flights and cruise ship departures were being arranged for American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

[PRO] Investor interest in emerging marketsTrump hit developing economies, such as Vietnam and India, especially hard with his ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The clock is ticking down on Trump's 90-day pause on those tariffs — but institutional investors are actually growing more enthusiastic about emerging markets, according to Bank of America's most recent Fund Manager Survey.

Trump and India's Modi split over U.S. role in Pakistan ceasefire

During a Tuesday phone call between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump, the former expressed his frustration with the U.S. President's repeated claims that he had played a significant role in brokering a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed countries.

""Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India does not and will never accept mediation. There is complete political consensus in India on this matter,"" Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a statement.

Modi ""clearly conveyed"" to Trump that the U.S. played no role in the mediation between India and Pakistan and denied any discussion of a trade deal, said Misri.

The 35-minute call was initiated by Trump, he added.

The Swiss National Bank on Thursday cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points to 0% — adding to concerns over a potential return to negative rates.

The reduction was widely expected by markets ahead of the decision, after traders priced in an around 81% chance of a quarter-point cut and around a 19% chance of a bigger 50-basis-point cut.

""Inflationary pressure has decreased compared to the previous quarter. With today's easing of monetary policy, the SNB is countering the lower inflationary pressure,"" the central bank said in a statement.

""The SNB will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust its monetary policy if necessary, to ensure that inflation remains within the range consistent with price stability over the medium term,"" it added.

While other nations continue to battle inflation, Switzerland faces deflation, with consumer prices falling by an annual 0.1% in May.

SNB Chairman Martin Schlegel told CNBC's Carolin Roth on Thursday that ""current negative inflation for us is not a reason to lower interest rates. For us [the] important [thing] is the medium term,"" he said. 

One, or even several, negative prints in the short-term ""are not really relevant for us,"" Schlegel added.

The SNB on Thursday took down its inflation expectations for 2025, saying it was now expecting the print to average 0.2% this year and 0.5% in 2026. Switzerland's overall economic outlook remained uncertain, the central bank noted, citing ""developments abroad"" as the main risk.

Low levels of inflation are not unusual for Switzerland — the country has seen several periods of deflation in the 2010s and 2020s. The strength of the country's currency, the Swiss franc, is a major contributor to this trend.

""As a safe-haven currency, the Swiss franc tends to appreciate when there is stress on world markets,"" said Charlotte de Montpellier, a senior economist covering France and Switzerland at ING.

""This systematically pushes down the price of imported products. Switzerland is a small, open economy, and imports account for a large proportion of CPI [consumer price index] inflation,"" Montpellier told CNBC ahead of the central bank's announcement.

Amid high levels of global economic uncertainty, the franc has continuously strengthened in recent months and is widely expected to continue on this path, suggesting ongoing challenges for the SNB.

As the strength of the franc has been the primary driver of Switzerland's low inflation, the SNB is now taking steps to constrain the currency's rally by keeping rates ""systematically lower than elsewhere,"" Montpellier said.

After the interest rate decision, the franc strengthened, with the U.S. dollar last trading flat against the Swiss currency.

Adrian Prettejohn, Europe economist at Capital Economics, told CNBC ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision that he expects rates to be cut to -0.25% this year, but noted that the SNB could go even lower.

""There are risks that the SNB will go further in the future if inflationary pressures don't start to increase, and the lowest the policy rate could go is -0.75%, the rate it reached in the 2010s,"" he told CNBC.

The SNB's Schlegel told CNBC that the central bank could not forecast the path ahead for interest rates. The central bank's next interest rate decision is scheduled for September.

""But what I can say is that going negative we would not take this decision lightly,"" as negative rates come with challenges and side effects, he said. ""The hurdle to go negative is certainly higher than just like a lower interest rate in the positive territory,"" Schlegel added.

Prettejohn said interest cuts weigh on currencies, making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment.

However, there are also some concerns and risks attached to negative rates, including for savers, who could see any profit on their savings wiped out, and for banks, which will rake in lower returns on their loans.

ING's de Montpellier noted that eventually, negative rates might ""distort financial markets, compress bank margins, and raise concerns about long-term financial stability.""

Israel and Iran's escalating conflict has significantly driven up the cost of insurance for ships sailing through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.

Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of the value of a ship for journeys into the Gulf, according to data from the world's largest insurance broker Marsh McLennan, up from 0.125% prior to Israel's surprise attack on Iran last week.

There has also been an uptick in war risk insurance rates for the Red Sea, Marsh said, while cover relating to ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%.

The length of time quotes are valid for has been cut to 24 hours from most leaders, Marsh said, down from 48 hours previously.

The scramble to reassess shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, with Israel and Iran continuing to exchange fresh air attacks over recent days.

The conflict between the two powers has ratcheted up concerns of a broader conflict, with many closely monitoring the prospect of U.S. intervention.

""Given that the situation is currently contained within the region, risks are still being placed to enable cargo to flow through these areas,"" Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo and logistics at Marsh, told CNBC by email.

Some shipowners have recently opted to steer clear of the strategically important Strait of Hormuz, reaffirming a sense of industry unease amid the conflict.

Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said earlier this week that the escalating conflict was causing concerns in the shipowner community and prompting a ""modest drop"" in the number of ships sailing through the area.

Situated between Iran and Oman, the Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea. It is recognized as one of the world's most important oil chokepoints.

The inability of oil to traverse through the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

Airbus orders and new models have taken center-stage at this year's Paris Air Show, as its U.S. rival Boeing spends yet another major industry event keeping a low profile due to turmoil at the business.

Airlines and manufacturers use air shows as an opportunity to make splashy aircraft purchase announcements following months of negotiations, some of which will be wrapped up at the event. Airbus had racked up nearly $21 billion as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation.

That included 132 firm orders on Monday, from customers including Saudi leasing firm AviLease, Japan's ANA and Poland's LOT, versus 41 for Boeing and 15 for Brazil's Embraer, according to a tally by aviation advisory IBA.

The following two days saw Boeing hold back from announcements completely, while Airbus splashed a 150-aircraft Memorandum of Understanding with VietJet Air focused on its single-aisle 100 A321neos, and orders with EgyptAir and Starlux Airlines for its wide-body A350s.

Air Asia chief Tony Fernandes told CNBC on Thursday that he was in discussions at Paris about expanding the firm's existing order for the Airbus XLR — the Toulouse-based planemaker's flagship new long-range, narrowbody aircraft — and expected an announcement within the next month or so. The model, which entered service last year, is set to allow airlines to offer medium- and long-haul routes at lower rates due to reduced fuel costs.

Embraer also secured a key win Wednesday with 60 firm orders for the E175, along with further options.

Boeing's relatively quiet presence in Paris isn't indicative of a wider demand crisis in the sector. The manufacturer sealed plenty of orders during U.S. President Donald Trump's May trip to the Middle East, including a 210-jet deal with Qatar Airways.

Both Boeing and Airbus meanwhile have aircraft backlogs of more than 5,000 and 8,000 aircraft, respectively, figures that have barely budged for nearly a decade as industry supply challenges — exacerbated in the wake of the pandemic — leave airlines struggling to renew their ageing fleets.

John Plueger, chief executive officer of Air Lease Corp, told CNBC earlier this week that the backlog meant it was always expected to be a subdued show in Paris compared to those past, including the post-pandemic boom year of 2023. ""Both Airbus and Boeing are all sold out to 2031 and '32 anyway. So how many follow-on orders into the '33, '34, '35 time frame are you really going to see? ... But overall, the demand environment remains very robust,"" Plueger said.

However, this does mark yet another year in which Boeing has refrained from the aircraft flypasts or major promotional activities. Starting in 2019 in the wake of the two fatal crashes of its B737-Max model, followed by the pandemic which threw the industry into turmoil, and then with fresh crises delivered via an emergency exit door blowout, allegations of widespread quality control issues, and increasingly-disgruntled customers over delivery delays — Boeing has had a host of reasons to avoid the spotlight.

Just as 2025 appeared like it may represent a tentative turning point for the company, with CEO Kelly Ortberg due to attend Paris, the first-ever crash of a Boeing Dreamliner in last week's Air India disaster threw that into disarray. Ortberg pulled out of attending the event, and the firm has made few press announcements while it says it is focused on its customers and the investigation into the causes of the crash.

""Demand for new aircraft remains unprecedented, matched only by passenger demand for air travel,"" said Tony Payne, partner at law firm DLA Piper.

He added that orders remain strong despite a ""sombre and reflective environment"" in the wake of the Air India crash, as stakeholders are ""well aware of the impact"" any relaxation of standards can have.

""Orders for new aircraft and engines remains strong but alongside a sombre and reflective environment, where stakeholders are well aware of the impact of any relaxation of standards can have.""

""Muted"" has therefore become the word of the week in terms of commercial aviation, while defense — making up nearly half of the show's content this year — takes on a bigger-than-ever role amid roiling Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and an upcoming NATO summit at which higher national security spending will be high on the agenda. Deals in this space have included Thales' contract to build 48 of its new remote-operated artillery systems for the French government.

""The consequences, the impact of the accident of Air India"" are hanging over Paris, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC on Monday. ""Still, the momentum in the industry is very strong,"" he continued, noting particular demand for widebody aircraft which had more catching up to do following the pandemic than the narrowbody market.

Dan Taylor, head of consulting at IBA, told CNBC that the split between Boeing and Airbus this year was ""more about context than competition.""

""Boeing's recent orders in the Middle East, helped by U.S. diplomatic engagement, and its quiet stance post-Air India likely influenced its lower visibility at the Paris Air Show. This isn't a sign of weakening demand, but rather a deliberate pause amid a volatile geopolitical backdrop and possible tariff uncertainties,"" Taylor said.

""Airlines are likely busy reassessing fleet strategies given the latest crisis, but strong profitability, ageing fleets, easing debt levels, and continued GDP and travel demand growth across many regions all point to a sustained long-term appetite for new aircraft.""

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Wednesday that his country was not pursuing regime change in Iran, and its attack on Tehran was aimed at eliminating its nuclear capabilities.

Speaking to CNBC's Dan Murphy, Herzog said that regime change was ""not an official objective of ours,"" and the goal was ""to remove the Iranian nuclear program.""

Herzog, who accused Tehran of ""cheating"" and ""rushing to the bomb,"" added that a ""change in [regime] can also bring peace in the region.""

The International Atomic Energy Agency in a statement on June 9 urged Iran to ""fully cooperate"" with the agency, or else it would ""not be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.""

On June 13, Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations it said were related to the country's nuclear program. Both sides have since been trading strikes.

""One has to be tough sometimes in order to remove imminent threats. That's exactly what we're doing,"" Herzog told CNBC, adding that the strikes on Iran have had a genuine impact on its nuclear program.

U.S. president Donald Trump reportedly said on Wednesday that Iran was ""very close"" to having a nuclear bomb, putting him at odds with the testimony of his National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard gave to the U.S. Congress in March. ""The IC [intelligence community] continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,"" Gabbard said.

Earlier this week, the Group of Seven countries expressed support for Israel, while condemning Iran as ""the principal source of regional instability and terror,"" and reiterated that ""Iran can never have a nuclear weapon.""

This was in contrast to China's stance. In the aftermath of the Israeli attack, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Beijing ""explicitly condemns Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty,"" and said that it supports Iran in ""safeguarding its national sovereignty and defending its legitimate rights and interests.""

When asked if there was a diplomatic ramp off available to de-escalate the situation, Herzog said ""there is actually a lot of back channel. National talks and dialogue with world leaders is actually quite intensive.""

Urgent international calls for restraint appear to be falling on deaf ears as the world braces for intensifying conflict in the Middle East.

All eyes are on the White House, as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs carrying out direct military strikes on Iran. Such an act would represent a dramatic deepening of U.S. involvement in what has thus far been limited to attacks between Iran and U.S. ally Israel.

The Kremlin warned Thursday that U.S. intervention in Iran would set off a ""terrible spiral of escalation,"" while Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters that the world is ""millimeters"" away from nuclear catastrophe. Russia is currently mired in its own war in Ukraine, which also involves a fight over a major nuclear power plant.

In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer chaired an emergency Cobra meeting — the country's national crisis management system — as his government works to withdraw the families of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv.

The high-level intelligence meeting followed Starmer's presence at the G7 summit in Canada, during which he joined other leaders of the group in reiterating their ""commitment to peace and stability.""

But chances at diplomacy are looking increasingly bleak as Iran and Israel continue to trade increasingly deadly blows and leaders of the countries involved show no sign of stepping back from the brink.

Trump remained noncommittal in his comments on whether the U.S. would attack Iran.

""I may do it, I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate,"" he told reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday.

He added that ""the next week is going to be big.""

The president said later from the Oval Office that he likes to ""make the final decision one second before it's due… because things change. Especially with war.""

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stirred some controversy, saying in an interview Tuesday that Israel was doing the ""dirty work"" for other countries by carrying out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites.

""I can only say I have the greatest respect for the fact that the Israeli army and the Israeli government had the courage to do this,"" Merz told a German broadcaster. The foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the U.K. are set to meet with their Iranian counterpart on Friday.

Meanwhile, China's Xinhua state media service cited Chinese Premier Xi Jinping saying that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is ""an urgent priority"" and that the use of force is not the right way to resolve the conflict.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi held a phone call Thursday, during which both men strongly condemned Israel, saying the country's actions in Iran ""violated the UN Charter and other norms of international law,"" according to a Kremlin aide.

The leaders, both of whom are allies of Iran, said that military action would not resolve the issues Western and Israeli leaders have over Iran's nuclear program and that diplomacy was the only way forward.

It comes after Trump posted comments on his Truth Social platform earlier this week, demanding that Iran unconditionally surrender and warning that the U.S. has the capability to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Khamenei responded by saying that any American attack on Iran would be met with ""irreparable damage"" and spark a wider war.

Overnight, Israel and Iran traded missile barrages, with Israel striking Iran's Arak and Natanz nuclear facilities, while Iran said it hit a hospital in Israel's Negev region after aiming for a military site.

At least 30 people were injured in the strike on the hospital, authorities said, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz saying after the attack that Iran's leader ""can no longer be allowed to exist.""

This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European markets closed lower Thursday as investors reacted to the Bank of England's monetary policy decision and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed down by 0.8%, with most sectors and major bourses in negative territory. The French CAC 40 index slumped 1.3% while Germany's DAX was off by 1.1%.

By sector, travel and leisure stocks were the biggest losers, declining 2.4%. Oil and gas shares were the standout gainers, climbing 0.7% on the back of rising crude prices.

CNBC's Jenni Reid reflects on this week's Paris Air Show, taking a look at the key themes and the one major player that kept a lower profile due to turmoil at its business — Boeing.

""Muted"" was the word of the week, while defense made up nearly half of the show's content this year amid roiling Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and an upcoming NATO summit at which higher national security spending will be high on the agenda.

Airbus racked up nearly $21 billion in orders as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation.

Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate at 46% despite cooling inflation, in view of what it cited as geopolitical and trade tensions that threaten to spike prices again.

""The underlying inflation trend has declined in May"" and ""has continued to decline in June,"" the bank's monetary policy committee wrote in a statement alongside its decision announcement.

The committee noted that demand had slowed, and that ""the potential effects of geopolitical developments and increasing protectionism in global trade on the disinflation process are being closely monitored.""

""Inflation expectations and pricing behaviors continue to be risk factors for the disinflation process,"" the statement added. Inflation has been steadily declining in Turkey, and currently stands at 35.4%.

— Natasha Turak

The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.25% as widely expected, after inflation appeared to be stickier than previously expected.

U.K. consumer prices rose by 3.4% in May on an annualized basis, 0.8 percentage points higher than in March. Economists have preferred to skip over a reading from April, due to a correction in the Office for National Statistics data.

— Ganesh Rao

Norway's central bank has cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25% for the first time since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Norges Bank had in March suggested it was expecting to cut its key sight deposit rate in June, and followed through.

""Inflation has declined since the monetary policy meeting in March, and the inflation outlook for the coming year indicates lower inflation than previously expected,"" said Ida Wolden Bache, the central bank's governor. ""A cautious normalisation of the policy rate will pave the way for inflation to return to target without restricting the economy more than necessary.""

The interest rate cuts were largely expected by economists. Goldman Sachs' Sven Jari Stehn cited the central bank's guidance from earlier in the year, along with ""inflation and wage expectations appearing benign"" to accurately forecast the cut earlier in the week.

Paris-listed shares of Teleperformance have rebounded more than 3% after a violent trading day in its stock, which saw hundreds of millions of euros wiped off the value of the company.

The company presented its ""Future Forward"" strategy on Wednesday to outline how it intends to use artificial intelligence in its business to grow revenue in the medium term. However, investors appeared to be unconvinced and drove down the stock over 13%, the most since July 2024.

Analysts said the company's management ""must be feeling deflated"" over the share price reaction despite their efforts to pivot their strategy.

Teleperformance's stock has been plagued by fears over how AI is expected to disrupt the company's business model. The firm provides outsourced customer care and back office services to large enterprises, which investors believe will be displaced by generative AI being deployed directly by its customers.

In February 2024, the stock price declined by nearly 15% in a single day after a report from an unrelated Swedish fintech firm, Klarna, suggested it had successfully replaced customer service roles at that company with AI.

Teleperformance shares have lost 78% of their value since their high in January 2022.

""After three tumultuous years, the market telling management that AI is going to render their business model obsolete, and a substantial amount of prep to showcase the group's AI capabilities at the [capital markets day], the market has baulked at the plans to future-proof the business - by European close, [more than] €700m had been wiped off the market cap of the company, greater than the entire executed and planned investments in AI-related partnerships (JVs) and M&A over the 2025-28 period,"" said RBC Capital Markets analysts Karl Green and Andrew Brooke in a note to clients on June 18.

""On this basis, we think TEP needs to just get its head down and quietly deliver, either in the public market domain, or behind closed doors in the private sphere,"" they added. ""In the meantime, we continue to see the stock as a fundamentally mispriced asset, though recognise that high realized volatility poses a barrier to those with shorter investment horizons.""

— Ganesh Rao

The Swiss National Bank has cut interest rates by a further 25 basis points to 0% — adding to concerns over a potential return to negative rates.

The reduction was widely expected by markets ahead of the decision, after traders priced in an around 81% chance of a quarter-point cut and around a 19% chance of a bigger 50-basis-point cut.

While other nations continue to battle inflation, Switzerland faces deflation, with consumer prices falling by an annual 0.1% in May.

Low levels of inflation are not unusual for Switzerland — the country has seen several periods of deflation in the 2010s and 2020s. The strength of the country's currency, the Swiss franc, is a major contributor to this trend.

All major European stock markets had a negative start on Thursday, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.63% as global investors monitor tensions between Israel and Iran and the potential for U.S. involvement.

Most sectors are lower, though telecoms nudged slightly higher, with Vodafone up 1% after announcing Pilar López would join the company from Microsoft as its chief financial officer from October.

Energy stocks are also pushing higher, with the Stoxx Oil and Gas index up 0.8%, as crude prices continue to rise on Middle East uncertainty. ICE Brent Crude futures were last up 0.83% to $77.33 a barrel.

The Swiss National Bank on Thursday backed the Swiss government's proposals to strengthen the health of the country's financial system against eventual crises, including by imposing additional capital requirements on banking giant UBS.

Earlier this month, Swiss authorities proposed a new requirement for UBS — Switzerland's largest systemic lender — to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital to allay possible shocks to the Swiss financial system, in the event of the bank's collapse. UBS has been fighting such measures since its government-aided takeover of stricken domestic peer Credit Suisse in 2023, citing the erosion of its competitiveness.

In its Financial Stability Report 2025 out Thursday, the SNB acknowledged year-on-year improvements in the profitability of the Swiss banking sector led by UBS last year. It nevertheless noted integration costs linked to the Credit Suisse merger still weighed on the lender's profitability and that ""standalone capital ratios of the parent bank overestimate its true resilience.""

""It is important to address this regulatory weakness and introduce further policy measures as proposed by the Federal Council,"" the SNB said, ""also because the loss potential for UBS under the various SNB stress scenarios remains substantial.""

The central bank endorsed the Swiss government's proposal for a parent bank's participation in its foreign subsidiaries to be fully deducted from its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) capital, which is typically designed to cover losses immediately as they occur.

""From a financial stability perspective, this approach is the best solution to ensure full capital backing of the foreign participations and thus robust capitalisation of the parent bank,"" the SNB said, acknowledging that UBS already meets the ""too big to fail"" capital requirements applicable as of 2030.

The British pound is 0.22% lower against the U.S. dollar at $1.339 at 7:25 a.m. in London, and flat at a euro rate of around 0.855, ahead of the Bank of England rate decision at midday.

A rate hold is widely expected with figures on Wednesday confirming inflation remains well above the BOE's 2% target, coming in at 3.4% in May.

The Federal Reserve also kept rates on hold at its meeting yesterday, and trimmed its projection for reductions in the coming years. The greenback has been given an even bigger boost over the last week by a safe haven flight amid fears over escalating conflict in the Middle East.

ING FX Strategist Francesco Pesole, meanwhile, in a Tuesday note, pointed to signs of the euro strengthening against sterling, unless the BOE surprises with a more hawkish-than-expected message today. Higher interest rates tend to support a domestic currency.

""Geopolitical risks generally harm the pound more than the euro, and the data flow has been GBP-negative of late,"" Pesole said.

— Jenni Reid

It's a big day for central bank action on Thursday, with monetary policy decisions coming from Turkey, Norway, Switzerland and Britain.

The central banks of the latter two countries will be closely watched, with the Swiss National Bank likely to lower its interest rate to zero this week. The Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates, but investors will be waiting to see how policymakers voted and for any guidance on the rate cut trajectory, with most analysts expecting a cut in August.

There are no other major earnings or data releases in Europe. U.S. markets are closed for the Juneteenth holiday on Thursday.

Good morning from London, and welcome to CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 22 points higher at 8,862, Germany's DAX down 88 points at 23,253, France's CAC 40 lower 32 points at 7,619 and Italy's FTSE MIB dropping 105 points to 39,321.

Global market sentiment is becoming more skittish over the conflict between Iran and Israel and the possibility of further U.S. involvement.

On Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump convened his national security advisors in the White House Situation Room for the second time in two days. Earlier, Trump said he had not yet decided whether to give the greenlight to a U.S. strike in support of Israel's ongoing bombardment of Iranian targets.

Investors are also weighing the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged in a 4.25%-4.5% range, where it has stood since December.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed committee will wait to see the impact of Trump's broad-spanning tariffs on inflation before considering any adjustments to monetary policy. Still, the central bank pointed to two interest rate cuts later this year.

At U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference, the topic of tariffs — specifically, their impact on prices — was a recurring one.

""Everyone that I know is forecasting a meaningful increase in inflation in coming months from tariffs because someone has to pay for the tariffs,"" Powell said. ""And some of it will fall on the end consumer.""

Granted, recent economic data has been upbeat, suggesting the U.S. economy has been able to — and could still — escape from tariffs mostly unscathed.

In May, a better-than-expected 139,000 jobs were added and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.2%. Consumer sentiment in early June was much more optimistic than forecast, according to a University of Michigan survey. And, most crucially, inflation in May — based on the consumer price index — ticked up just 0.1% for the month, lower than estimated.

But that string of positive data might have to thank the slow process by which tariffs move through the economy.

""It takes some time for tariffs to work their way through the chain of distribution to the end consumer. A good example of that would be goods being sold at retailers today may have been imported several months ago before tariffs were imposed. So we're beginning to see some effects, and we do expect to see more of them over the coming months,"" Powell said.

And even though Fed officials, at present, ""don't see signs"" of the U.S. economy weakening, Powell acknowledged growth will slow ""eventually."" In other words, stagflation — the toxic mix of higher prices and slower growth — could be a possibility in the months ahead.

The song ""I Got Summer on My Mind"" went viral in 2022. ""I Got Stagflation on My Mind"" could be the Fed's — and market watchers' — earworm this summer.

U.S. central bank holds rates, sees two cutsThe U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December. Along with the rate decision, the committee indicated, through its closely watched ""dot plot,"" that two cuts by the end of 2025 are still on the table. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump said the fed funds rate should be at least 2 percentage points lower, and again slammed Chair Jerome Powell, calling him ""stupid.""

Fed hikes inflation and lowers growth forecastsInflation in the U.S., measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, will rise beyond 3% in 2025, according to an updated Fed forecast. The central bank had in March expected the PCE to hit 2.8%. The PCE came in at just 2.1% in April. The Fed also sees economic growth slowing to 1.4% this year, down from an earlier estimate of 1.7%. In combination, both forecasts point to early signs of stagflation.

Markets and oil prices were flat in U.S.U.S. stocks hovered around the flatline Wednesday. The S&P 500 slipped 0.03%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1% down, but the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.13%. Oil prices, likewise, were little changed. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index lost 0.36%. The FTSE 100, however, ticked up 0.11% as data showed U.K. annual inflation coming in at an expected 3.4% in May.

Trump says he hasn't decided on Iran strikesFor the second time in two days, Trump on Wednesday met his national security team in the White House amid the Israel-Iran conflict. The closed-door gathering took place as Trump insisted he had not yet decided whether to order a U.S. strike on Iran. The same day, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said evacuation flights and cruise ship departures were being arranged for American citizens seeking to leave Israel.

[PRO] 'Profound impact' on oil market: JPMorganThe current jump in oil prices because of the simmering conflict in the Middle East might not lead to a long-term price shock, according to historical data analyzed by JPMorgan. A regime change in Iran resulting from U.S. or Israeli military action, however, can have a ""profound impact"" on the global oil market, the bank said.

These are the sticking points holding up a U.S.-EU trade deal

The U.S. and European Union are running out of time to strike a deal on trade tariffs — and analysts say several key sticking points could make an agreement impossible.

Negotiations have been slow since both the U.S. and EU temporarily cut duties on each other until July 9. If a deal is not agreed by then, full reciprocal import tariffs of 50% on EU goods, and the bloc's wide-spanning countermeasures are set to come into effect.

""We're talking, but I don't feel that they're offering a fair deal yet,"" Trump told reporters Tuesday, further dashing hopes of an imminent agreement.

So what's holding things up between the two sides, which had a relationship worth 1.68 trillion euros ($1.93 trillion) in 2024?

This is CNBC's live blog covering Asia-Pacific markets.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led declines in Asia-Pacific markets Thursday, falling over 2%, as investors weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, while the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dent sentiment.

Meanwhile, mainland China's CSI 300 was down 0.82%.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.02% to close at 38,488.34, while the Topix declined 0.58% to end the trading day at 2,792.08. South Korea's Kospi added 0.19% to close at 2,977.74.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended the day flat at 8,523.7.

U.S. President Donald Trump is convening his national security advisors in the White House Situation Room for the second time in two days, as he weighs a potential military strike on Iran amid its conflict with Israel. The meeting started shortly before 5 p.m. ET on Wednesday, a White House official told NBC News.

The U.S. Federal Reserve expectedly held interest rates steady on Wednesday, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5%, where it has stood since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed committee will wait to see the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on inflation before considering any adjustments to monetary policies.

However, the Fed still pointed to two rate cuts later this year.

Overnight on Wall Street, the three major averages ended the trading day mixed. The 30-stock Dow lost 44.14 points, or 0.10%, and ended at 42,171.66. The S&P 500 slipped 0.03% to close at 5,980.87, and the Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.13% to settle at 19,546.27.

— CNBC's Sean Conlon and Lisa Kailai Han contributed to this report.

The Vietnamese dong weakened 0.13% to 26,127 against the greenback as of 11.15 a.m. local time, marking a record low.

The move also comes on the back of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in recent days. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, gained 1% since June 17.

Other Southeast Asian currencies also weakened. The Thai baht depreciated as much as 0.6% to 32.845 against the dollar, the lowest since June 2, according to data from LSEG. The Indonesian rupiah fell 0.49% to 16,375 against the dollar.

—Lee Ying Shan

Australia's unemployment rate came in at 4.1% in May, unchanged from the month before and in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters.

This is the fifth straight month that the unemployment rate has remained steady at 4.1%.

Back in May, Australia's central bank estimated that the unemployment rate would increase ""a little"" this year, putting their forecast at ""a bit below 4.5%.""

— Lim Hui Jie

Aberdeen Investments said it favored China and Europe equity markets for their ""strong"" policy tools that can offset the negative impact from tariffs, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep policy rates steady.

""China's equity market is also further supported by a multi-pronged equity market program,"" said the asset manager's Ray Sharma-Ong, head of multi-asset investment solutions, Southeast Asia.

Sharma-Ong also highlighted that South Korea's equity markets present ""attractive opportunities"" fueled by growth-oriented reforms and improving corporate governance.

—Lee Ying Shan

Shares of Japan's Nippon Steel rose 1.33% after it completed its acquisition of U.S. Steel.

U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted for weeks that the companies would form a ""partnership"" in which U.S. Steel would remain American-owned.

U.S. Steel shares stopped trading at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday after Nippon completed its acquisition, according to a notice from the NYSE.

Trump opposed Nippon's bid to acquire U.S. Steel in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election but he changed his stance after he took office, ordering a new review of the deal in April. Former President Joe Biden had blocked Nippon's acquisition in January, citing national security concerns.

—Lee Ying Shan, Spencer Kimball

The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, as was expected. However, the central bank kept its outlook for two cuts this year as the threat of stagflation has risen.

""Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" the Fed's policymaking committee said in a note. The Fed also lowered its GDP outlook and increased its inflation forecast.

— Fred Imbert

DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said Wednesday that gold could hit $4,000 soon as institutions step up their buying amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty. 

""It's a clear beneficiary of everything that's been going on. And it's the one asset class that's really doing well this year,"" Gundlach said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""I think the demand for gold is for real.""

Spot gold traded around $3,392.08 an ounce Wednesday, while U.S. gold futures rose slightly to $3,412.5.

The three leading indexes finished little changed on Wednesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 44.14 points, or 0.1%, to settle at 42,171.66. The S&P 500 ticked 0.03% lower to end at 5,980.87, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.13%, closing at 19,546.27.

SHOWTIMES:

U.S.: Sunday-Thursday, 23:00-0000 ETAsia: Monday-Friday, 11:00-12:00 SIN/HK, 08:30-09:30 India Europe: Monday-Friday, 0500-06:00 CET

Twelve months ago, India's initial public offering market was booming, with tech startups from food and grocery delivery player Swiggy to electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ola Electric at the cusp of their debut.

Many companies wanted to go public in the South Asian powerhouse, riding on the coattails of India's growth story.

This year, however, there has been a pronounced change.

There have been just 99 listings so far, compared to 147 in the same period a year ago, according to FactSet data.

Several companies, including education loan provider Avanse Financial Services, contract drug manufacturer Anthem Biosciences and LG Electronics' India unit, have put their listing plans on hold given weak investor sentiment and the bleak macroeconomic outlook, despite having received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

To add to that, the debut of electric scooter maker Ather Energy on May 6 — which came after a two-month lull in mainboard listings — failed to alleviate market concerns. The stock is down more than 3%, after opening at 328 Indian rupees ($3.79) per share — a premium of around 2% to its issue price of 321 rupees.

""The IPO market was dismal, especially in the first quarter, because of a weak rupee and global volatility from the wars and constantly evolving tariff situation,"" Peeyush Mittal, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, told CNBC's Inside India.

Additionally, foreign portfolio investments fell 220% in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to the National Securities Depository.

A more pressing problem, however, has been the impact of slowing consumption levels on corporate earnings, Rishika Chandan, managing partner at Venturi Partners, said.

Many good private equity-backed consumer brands, which would have historically posted a 35% to 40% jump in their profitability per annum, only grew 15% to 20% in FY2025 ended March, no thanks to tighter consumer purse strings, Chandan added.

""That is not a great number to go to the market with,"" she said, adding that companies have now pushed back their listing plans, in part, to capitalize on higher sales during festive seasons later in the year.

While the Reserve Bank of India's recent rate cut and the government's measures to stimulate consumption may eventually translate into higher spending, Chandan says more time will still be needed for corporates to see stronger revenue and profit numbers.

""Anybody wanting to go public will likely stretch it out and wait for the valuation markup. That will also give them higher forward value, which will allow for an IPO underwriting based on the evaluation of profitability,"" Chandan added.

As the year stretches into the second half, there has been a subtle shift in the Indian markets, leading to hopes of a pickup in listing momentum.

For instance, $6.4 billion was raised from the Indian markets through share sales in May, making it the highest monthly total since December 2024. Block trades were the biggest contributor at $5.5 billion. The sales activity shows no signs of slowing down this month, with at least 10 blocks raising $1.2 billion in just the first week, per data compiled by Bloomberg.

India's ""fundamentals are solid,"" Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, CEO of Wrise Wealth Management Middle East, says.

""With over $12 billion in SEBI-cleared IPOs and more than 130 companies in the wings, India's primary market is simply pausing before its next leap. The second half of the year will tell a very different story,"" he told CNBC's Inside India.

Sengupta foresees several listings, including that of Reliance Jio, Tata Capital and LG Electronics India.

The Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio is expected to go public later this year in an approximately 400 billion Indian rupee listing. Sengupta expects the company — which is the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries — to be ""one of India's largest ever [listings], showcasing the ambition to monetize a digital ecosystem at scale.""

Similarly, Tata Capital is reportedly slated to get regulatory approval to list for $2 billion soon. The listing of the Tata Sons subsidiary, which provides a range of personal finance and corporate loans, ""signifies how even conservative conglomerates now view public capital as strategic, not just financial,"" Sengupta noted.

Elsewhere, the wealth manager considers LG Electronics India's listing a ""game changer."" If successful, it will indicate foreign multinationals' interest in Indian markets given its ""domestic retail flows and regulatory stability,"" he added.

Among startups, Venturi's Chandan and Nicholas Cator are keeping a close eye on the listing of Lenskart, which is backed by Softbank, KKR and Temasek. The eyewear company is reportedly close to filing a draft of its preliminary proposal and may raise $1 billion from its listing.

Cator, founder and managing partner at Venturi, is curious about how much it can amass on the public market. ""Lenskart has done well as a company, and its numbers are good. So, its listing will be a good indicator for private investors on how to value companies, especially in pre-IPO rounds.""

Other listings Carter and Chandan are watching include that of cleaning and personal care services provider Urban Company, which filed its documents in April and jewelry player Bluestone, which is gunning for unicorn status ahead of its IPO.

The optimism of India's IPO market is sometimes marred by concerns over elevated valuations of its stock market.

Matthews Asia's Mittal foresees some marquee IPOs in India coming in at a 25% to 30% discount to the leading player in their space, unlike last year when many IPOs were priced at a premium.

""Everybody wanted to take the valuation higher, but our expectation is that valuations are already normalizing, largely because some of the IPOs in the tail end of 2024 haven't really performed well,"" he said, naming Swiggy and Ola Electric as such companies that are now trading below their debut price.

Going forward, Mittal and WRISE's Sengupta expect India's capital markets to be buoyant with new equity issuances and a potentially stronger listing pipeline as the country grows to soon become the fourth largest in the world.

""India today is reminiscent of the U.S. in the early 2000s and China in the post-2009 era — when IPO markets matured from speculative growth to strategic listings. India is no longer just an emerging market — it's becoming an IPO destination with depth, diversity, and discipline,"" Sengupta said.

Modi and Trump disagree on U.S.' role in Pakistan ceasefire. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday, in which he ""clearly conveyed"" that the South Asian nation ""does not and will never accept mediation"" in its conflict with Pakistan, according to a statement by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri.

India is considering expanding its production of rare earth elements. As China imposes tighter restrictions on its export of rare earths — which are crucial in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and military equipment — Indian officials are evaluating the potential of Indian Rare Earths, a government-owned company, to fill the gap in the supply chain.

'No major safety concerns' on Air India's fleet. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India's aviation safety watchdog, said Tuesday it had inspected Air India's Boeing 787 fleet and did not find any major anomalies. The airline is cutting international flights on its widebody planes by 15% for the next few weeks. An Air India plane bound for London crashed on June 12 in Ahmedabad, India, killing all 242 passengers except one.

Indian stocks were trading flat Thursday as investors weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran crisis.

Since the start of the year, the 50-stock Nifty benchmark has risen 4.58%, while the BSE Sensex has gained 3.86%.

The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield was up at 6.291%.

On CNBC TV this week, Dave Ernsberger, co-president of S&P Global Commodity Insights, discussed the necessity for India to build up its energy reserves, especially in light of potential disruptions to global oil supply. However, that goal cannot be met solely by expanding oil and gas production. ""The only way India will get energy independence, truly, is by building out domestically supplied renewable energy sources,"" Ernsberger said.

Meanwhile, Anand Gupta, managing director at Allianz Global Investors, said that although India's defense sector has a ""longevity of growth"" and will gain market share, stocks are not trading at a ""reasonable price."" There are better stock-picking opportunities in India's market, Gupta said, such as those in its consumer discretionary sector.

On Monday, the Purchasing Managers Index reports, which measure activity in India's manufacturing and services sectors, will be out. Multiple mainline companies will list publicly in the coming week, including recyclables company Aten Papers and Foam, solar pump manufacturer Oswal Pumps and construction supply company Arisinfra Solutions.

June 20: Aten Papers and Foam IPO, Oswal Pumps IPO

June 23: India HSBC flash manufacturing and services PMI for June

June 25: Arisinfra Solutions IPO

According to Columbia Business School professor Michael Chad Hoeppner, the popular idea that you have 7 seconds to make a first impression may be a tad too strict.

""I'm not going to give people quite that amount of scarcity, but the beginning really matters a lot,"" he says.

During a job interview, Hoeppner says, you have approximately 90 seconds to engage your interviewer's attention — and how you speak is key.

Clear communication isn't just about what you say, but how you say it, as Hoeppner attests in his latest book ""Don't Say Um: How to Communicate Effectively to Live a Better Life.""

The way someone delivers information ""has a lot to do with how we hear each other, and whose ideas we take seriously or not seriously,"" he says.

Here are Hoeppner's tips to make the best first impression at job interviews.

Hoeppner, who also coaches political candidates, compares the beginning of an interview to the start of a presidential debate. Some debaters make the mistake of treating the first question as a ""warm-up,"" but Hoeppner cautions that viewers often tune out after the first few minutes.

""People's attention spans are worse than they've ever been. They've been hijacked entirely, and so we tend to have less time to actually make an impression,"" he says.

The same goes for job interviews: ""You may only get one answer at all that anyone actually pays attention to, so you have to make sure that one answer counts.""

Even simple, open-ended prompts like ""Tell me about yourself"" provide crucial opportunities to make your case as a candidate.

""You have a tremendous amount of latitude with those questions, and you often can take them anywhere that you want to,"" he says.

Hoeppner recommends starting your responses with specific, vivid stories and anecdotes so that interviewers ""remember what the heck you say and actually understand what you mean.""

During interviews, Hoeppner notes that nervous job candidates often alter their natural tone and manner of speaking in an effort to seem professional.

Instead, they end up coming off as a robotic, ""less interesting version"" of themselves: ""They speak in a more monotonous voice, they restrain their hand gestures and they anchor eye contact unblinkingly forward the entire time.""

Hoeppner recommends relaxing your posture and body language, making meaningful (but not constant) eye contact, and speaking clearly and confidently.

These communication skills are crucial in all areas of work, Hoeppner says.

In the office, your communication skills can be just as important as the quality of your work. Even brilliant employees' careers can end up stagnating because they can't communicate their ideas in a dynamic way.

""What happens is then they don't get promotions to be in client-facing roles or in leadership roles,"" Hoeppner says.

The only way to get better at speaking is to practice, Hoeppner says.

To get ready for an interview, Hoeppner recommends a method he calls ""loud drafting"": giving yourself an open-ended prompt and repeatedly answering it out loud.

""The first time you do it, it will be bad,"" he says. ""That's fine. Do it again, do it again, do it again.""

The point of this exercise is to practice answering questions in a natural way, he says. Some job candidates prepare for interviews by jotting down prepared statements, but they frequently sound stiff and unnatural when said out loud.

""The way in which we speak is different than how we write,"" he says. ""Often, people open their mouths in interviews and a bunch of polysyllabic pablum comes pouring out of their mouth.""

In general, Hoeppner recommends ""flexing your talking muscles"" by chatting casually with people you meet and switching your phone calls to FaceTime.

According to Hoeppner, in-person communication skills will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology. With almost-limitless access to information, Hoeppner asks, ""what determines whose ideas get paid more attention?

His answer: ""Very likely how you say them.""

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump's administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump's so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging.

Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment.

“The Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the undisputed leader in digital assets,"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to the so-called Genius Act stablecoin bill and adding the U.S. is going to “show the world how to win” with bitcoin and crypto.

“Nobody will do it better, it is pure Genius! Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. We are talking about massive investment, and big innovation.”

The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world's biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.

This week, U.S. lawmakers in the Senate voted 68-30 to approve the bipartisan “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” known as the Genius Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians.

Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump's desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives.

House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate.

“The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean' Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.”

Meanwhile, Trump's crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.

“The float is expected to grow from $250 billion to trillions of dollars,"" Sacks said, adding he expects “blockchain-based infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system,” calling it the “payments system of the future.”

Attention is now shifting to the crypto market structure legislation known as the Clarity Act, which has been described by senator Cynthia Lummis as step two in the Trump administration's three-step plan for crypto legislation, with step three getting the bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law.

The Genius Act's passage through the Senate ""brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let's finish the job and pass market structure legislation to fulfil [Trump's] vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world,"" Lummis posted to X.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

A startup has raised $6 million in a seed round to protect Bitcoin from quantum computing. 

Project 11, which focuses on quantum computing's hypothetical threat to the leading crypto network, announced the raise Thursday, which was co-led by Variant and Quantonation, and included participation from venture capital firms Castle Island Ventures, Nebular, and Formation. 

The firm said that quantum computing is a threat to Bitcoin so ""every wallet, every account holder, every smart contract key—all of it—must upgrade to new, quantum-safe cryptography.""

Today we're announcing a $6 million seed round at Project Eleven, to build a quantum-ready future for digital assets. The seed round was co-led by @variantfund and @Quantonation with participation from @CastleIslandVC, @Nebularvc, and @formation_vc.

Why this matters: Quantum…

— Project 11 (@qdayclock) June 19, 2025



""A cryptographically relevant quantum computer will break the foundational security assumptions of Bitcoin and nearly every digital asset,"" Project 11 said in a statement.

""With rapid progress from companies like IBM and Google, that future is no longer hypothetical. It's coming fast and there isn't long to prepare.""

Quantum computing is a new type of technology that uses quantum physics to process far larger amounts of information than classical machines.

Such computers aren't available to the public yet and top tech companies like Google and IBM are working on developing them. 

But some in the crypto space have raised concerns that as tech giants make bigger strides to releasing a quantum computer, Bitcoin's cryptography could be cracked. 

The Bitcoin network is currently the world's most secure computing network—and has never been hacked. 

In order to crack the network's cryptography, a bad actor would have to take control of more than 50% of the Bitcoin network, which would require a huge amount of computing power. 

Hardcore Bitcoiners like Strategy co-founder and chairman Michael Saylor have shrugged off concerns about quantum computing, saying that when such a threat exists, other computing networks—used by the likes of banking giants or the U.S. military—will face a bigger risk. 

""I don't worry about it,"" he said. ""Microsoft and Google market their quantum projects, but they would never sell a quantum computer that cracked cryptography, because it would destroy their own companies.""

Bitcoin was recently trading at about $104,250, roughly flat over the past 24 hours.

When most healthcare companies discuss digital transformation, they typically mean electronic medical records or telemedicine platforms.

But for Prenetics Global Limited, a publicly-traded health sciences firm, going digital meant something entirely next level: a $20 million Bitcoin treasury strategy that adds its name to a growing list of companies adopting a Bitcoin acquisition strategy. 

The Nasdaq-listed genomics and digital health company disclosed Wednesday that it has acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 using Kraken's custody platform. The purchase represents the beginning of what Prenetics calls a ""comprehensive"" Bitcoin strategy approved by its board, with plans for substantial future expansion.

In a statement, the firm said the investment forms part of a plan for ""the dawn of a new era"" in which domains such as genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will ""will intersect in ways that could revolutionize"" how we think about health, wealth, and longevity, Prenetics CEO Danny Yeung said in a statement.

Beyond its treasury strategy, Prenetics plans to explore yield generation through crypto lending and structured products using institutional-grade tools. The company will also accept Bitcoin payments across its consumer health brands, creating an integrated ecosystem from treasury management to customer transactions.

The company recently raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $80-$100 million, projecting profitability by Q4. Its stock (NASDAQ : PRE) surged 23.3% on the day Wednesday trading at $9.26 after its announcement.

To guide the initiative, Prenetics recruited former OKEx chief operating officer Andy Cheung to its board. Cheung previously helped oversee billions in daily crypto trading volume at one of the world's largest exchanges.

Tracy Hoyos-López, chief of staff for strategic initiatives at Kraken, has joined the firm as an advisor, helping to guide Prenetics as it adopts the Bitcoin treasury playbook deployed by firms including Strategy and Metaplanet.

Hoyos-López was one of three people pivotal to making President Donald Trump ""orange-pilled"" by bringing him to speak at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville last year.

At the conference, Trump promised to establish a ""strategic BTC stockpile."" In March, the president signed an executive order to establish a strategic reserve ""capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government,"" according to a statement from AI and crypto czar David Sacks.

Hoyos-López fiercely advocated for Trump, who at the time faced Kamala Harris for the presidency. “Our industry as a whole will cease to exist if Trump doesn't win,” Hoyos-López said at the time, per a report from CNBC.

Decrypt reached out to Prenetics for comment on Hoyos-López' appointment.

Global tensions have shaken the financial market, and crypto hasn't been spared. Still, Ethereum (ETH) has held above $2,500—a strong sign, considering how shaky things have been.

Ethereum saw a modest rally in April, gaining some momentum early on. But that strength faded by mid-May, and since then, the price has been stuck in a narrow range, bouncing between support and resistance.

Although the token briefly moved above the $2,700 resistance, it failed to hold the breakout. The move faded quickly, and the price slipped back into its range. 

Since then, ETH has traded sideways, with buyers and sellers in balance. Holding firm in these conditions suggests strong underlying support.

The $2,500 mark has continued to act as a floor for the price. This level has worked as both a barrier and a bounce point before, and right now, it's once again being tested. If it holds, it could give the bulls some hope.

While the market has remained uncertain, Ethereum has actually done better than Bitcoin. Analyst Ted Pillows pointed out that ETH has been stronger on the weekly chart. Even with global events causing concern, Ethereum has managed to edge ahead. 

Before the crisis, Ethereum was clearly outperforming Bitcoin. Between May 8 and 13, ETH rose about 40% against BTC, moving from 0.0186 to 0.026. 

Since then, despite the worsening crisis, Ethereum has held steady, consolidating between 0.0226 and 0.0261. This resilience shows ETH's strength, and positive developments could push the price higher.

Should this trend persist, more capital may shift towards Ethereum and other altcoins, potentially supporting higher prices across the board.

Big investors are already moving in. One whale wallet, tracked by Lookonchain, bought 3,000 ETH for $7.48 million. Over four days, the same address snapped up 11,500 ETH, spending close to $29 million.

Another whale who previously earned over $30 million from ETH returned to the market, buying 15,000 ETH for $37.15 million at a price of $2,477 per coin.

Glassnode reported that for nearly a week, daily whale purchases have topped 800,000 ETH. This buying spree has pushed holdings in wallets with 1,000 to 10,000 ETH to over 14.3 million coins. 

On 12 June alone, whales added more than 871,000 ETH—the highest daily net inflow so far this year. Such intense accumulation hasn't been seen since 2017.

Ethereum's recent price movements hint at possible upside. Key technical indicators are turning positive, but a breakout remains uncertain as the asset trades in a tight range.

What to Take Note Of:

The situation remains uncertain, and Ethereum may stay range-bound for now. However, technical signs are starting to improve. If the Middle East crisis eases and confidence returns, Ethereum could be among the first to rally.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Ethereum bulls must break $2.8K: What will trigger a 'violent move'?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-bulls-break-2-8k-what-will-trigger-a-violent-move","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:46:39 GMT","

 Shrinking liquid supply, persistent ETF demand, and strong technical factors could push ETH price above $4,000. 

Key takeaways:

Spot ETH ETF net inflows totalled $861.3 million over the last two weeks.

Total ETH staked and accumulated are at all-time highs.

ETH price could rally toward the bull flag's target of $4,100 if a key trendline breaks. 

Ether's (ETH) price rose to a four-month high at $2,880 on June 11, before correcting to the current value at $2,550.

Several analysts said a key resistance remains at $2,800, and the price needs to flip this into support to trigger a “violent move upward.”

“Ethereum price price action is compressing right below this big $2.8K level,” said popular crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades in a June 16 post on X 

The trader asserted that a decisive close above this level would be a “good setup” for a move higher. 

Fellow analyst Jelle shared a chart showing ETH price compressing a tight range below a key resistance level above $2,800 and said:

Several bullish signs suggest that ETH is well-positioned to break above $3,000 in the following days or weeks.

One factor supporting Ether's bullish argument is persistent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day inflow streak before it broke on June 13, but rebounded with three consecutive days of fresh inflows between June 16-18, including over $19 million on Wednesday. These investment products have seen net inflows totaling $861.3 million over the last two weeks, as per data from Farside Investors.

As Cointelegraph reported, these inflows have been the highest since January 2025 and reflect growing confidence among traditional finance players, despite initial market panic from the Israel-Iran conflict.

Ether staked increased by more than 500,000 ETH between June 1 and June 15, pushing the total locked amount to a new all-time high of over 35 million ETH.

This growth signals rising confidence and a continued drop in liquid supply. This creates scarcity that can drive prices up if demand holds or grows.

In a June 16 QuickTake, CryptoQuan's analyst OnChainSchool also pointed out that Ether's accumulation addresses (holders with no history of selling) have also reached an all-time high, now holding 22.8 million ETH worth approximately $58 billion at current rates.

This signals strong investor confidence and minimal selling pressure, often a precursor to price rallies.

The analyst said:

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that ETH price is stuck between two key levels: the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $2,600 acting as resistance and the 50-day SMA at $2,450 as support.

ETH bulls were required to reclaim the 200-day SMA to ensure a sustained recovery toward $3,000 and beyond.

The last time the BTC price broke above this trendline, it rallied 40% from $3,130 on Nov. 9, 2024, to its multi-year high of $4,100 on Dec. 15, 2024.

The bull flag pattern, on the other hand, indicates a potential breakout toward $3,900, as shown in the chart below.  

As Cointelegraph reported, Ether's breakout from a cup-and-handle chart pattern could result in 51% gains to $4,200.

Ethereum will become more valuable than Apple and Microsoft. 

Really.

A group of the blockchain's more prominent boosters made that argument in a paper published June 12. 

They said the world's second biggest cryptocurrency will not only hit $8,000 in the short term, but that the price will eventually crest $80,000. 

At that higher price, the combined value of all Ether currently in circulation would approach $10 trillion, a figure greater than the combined present value of Apple and Microsoft, two of the world's most valuable companies. 

“Everyone has heard of Ethereum, everyone uses Ethereum,” Vivek Raman, the co-founder of Etherealize, a research firm, and one of the paper's co-authors, told DL News.

“But I feel like we've left out and sort of just had on the sidelines this asset powering [the whole DeFi] ecosystem.”

The report and Raman didn't offer any hint of what either the short-term or long-term cases were. 

Still, it's an astonishing prediction, especially in the face of other analysts' bearishness as Ether has lagged other digital assets this year.

In March, UK bank Standard Chartered projected that Ethereum's price will hit $4,000 by the end of 2025, down from a previous $10,000 prediction. 

The paper, entitled “The Bull Case for ETH,” is an attempt to change perception of Ethereum among traders who struggle to understand why they should be bullish on it. 

The problem? The case for Ethereum is harder to explain than Bitcoin's. 

The world's top cryptocurrency has a reputation as a safe haven asset thanks to its fixed supply recorded on a tamper-proof, ownerless ledger.

Countries are stockpiling Bitcoin. Traditional finance titans have launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds that have seen breakneck growth since their January 2024 debut. 

Raman and his co-authors argue that Ethereum can provide that, and more. 

Not only is Ether a commodity that works as a store of value like Bitcoin, it will also power the new generation of financial and social applications, much like the internet gave rise to social media and digital banking, they argued. 

Or, to put it another way, while Bitcoin is likened to digital gold, Ethereum should be seen as “digital oil powering the digital economy,” the paper reads. 

Seen in that light, Raman and the others argue that the $10 trillion market cap ain't that outlandish. 

“Global proven oil reserves have a combined market valuation of approximately $85 trillion,” they write. “This is a meaningful reference point for ETH given that it is on a similar trajectory, but for the digital realm.”

If Ethereum becomes the foundational software layer of the new economy — akin to an operating system, like Microsoft Windows — then that'll yield a massive boon for the network as every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain incurs a cost that must be paid in Ether. 

And things are changing, Raman said. 

While crypto advocates used to struggle to pique the interest of skeptical investors and financiers, Raman said he's found himself fielding inquiries from institutions that want to better understand the world's second largest blockchain. 

“I spent four years trying to shout into the wind about this whole ETH thing and tokenisation thing, and no one cared. Now it's gone the other way,” he said.

It's been some time since Solana was billed as the “Ethereum killer,” but Anthony Scaramucci is leaning into the narrative.

The SkyBridge Capital founder told an audience at the DigiAssets 2025 conference that, “I think SOL will flip ETH,” while conceding that “I don't really have an opinion on ETH.”

“I got into crypto late—my first crypto investment was 2020,” he said, explaining that he “didn't really get on board” with Ethereum. “Not that I have a negative opinion,” he added, “I just understand the Solana story a little bit better.”

SkyBridge has “nine figures on the corporate balance sheet in Bitcoin and Solana,” Scaramucci said, adding that, “We have probably 40% of our clients' money across digital assets,” including Multicoin Capital and Brevan Howard Digital. As well as a fund of funds, with “some digital funds in there,” he said, “We have about $300 million in what we call a coin fund, and that's probably things like Solana, Avalanche is in there, Polkadot, lots of Bitcoin.”

Scaramucci's thesis appears to be borne out—to a degree. After hitting a record high of $293.31 in January 2025, Solana has slipped to around $145, trading down 23.2% year to date. Ethereum, meanwhile, has dropped by 24.75% since the start of the year. Solana currently has a market cap of just above $76 billion while Ethereum stands at $304 billion, second in the rankings behind only Bitcoin.

The SkyBridge Capital founder didn't provide a timeframe in which Solana's market capitalization might flip that of Ethereum—and his view appears to be at odds with that of banking group Standard Chartered.

Last month, a research note published by the bank argued that Solana will underperform against Ethereum over the next “two to three years.”

Standard Chartered analysts predicted that Solana would hit $275 by year's end and $500 by the end of 2029, while Ethereum would hit $4,000 in 2025 and top $7,500 in 2029. They argued that the Solana blockchain has seen “declining usage” following a waning of the meme coin frenzy that propelled it to new heights, with scaling issues preventing it from achieving wider utility.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald, however, share Scaramucci's opposing view. Cantor is particularly bullish on Solana treasury companies—publicly listed firms that are stacking SOL on their balance sheets—and believes SOL has a bigger upside compared to ETH.

In a report earlier this week, analysts for the investment bank wrote: “If we are comparing Layer-1s, Solana's technology is meaningfully better than Ethereum across every metric.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoin ETF applications surge as SEC softens crypto stance","https://cointelegraph.com/news/etf-filings-2025-altcoin-summer","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 04:49:58 GMT","

 This year has seen an uptick in the number of altcoin ETF applications, with at least 31 filed in the first half of 2025, Cointelegraph Research found. 

Regulatory optimism in the US has led to at least 31 altcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of 2025. 

The SEC has approved futures and spot ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), but past attempts to list altcoin-related instruments have withered on the vine. Now, renewed optimism after the 2024 elections has led to several new applications that are expected to be approved.

The list includes filings from familiar names such as VanEck, which applied to list ETFs in BNB (BNB) and Avalanche (AVAX). WisdomTree and Franklin Templeton both have XRP (XRP) ETFs pending. Memecoins are also represented, with REX-Osprey applying to list an ETF of US President Donald Trump's token.

ETF and crypto analysts are optimistic that at least 10 applications will pass muster with the SEC, which has onlookers hyped about an “altcoin summer.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs were first approved in the US in January 2024. Months later, in July, spot Ether ETFs followed.

This nod was seen as a pivotal moment for the adoption of cryptocurrencies, as it gave institutional investors exposure to the market through a financial instrument they were already comfortable with: an ETF. 

Now, altcoins (any crypto that isn't Ether or Bitcoin) may be getting their shot at institutional adoption.

As shown by Cointelegraph Research, there have been at least 31 spot altcoin ETF filings in 2025. Among the applications, ETFs containing Ripple's payments-focused crypto, XRP, and the seminal memecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) appear most prominently. 

According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, a “potential Alt Coin summer” is on the way, with a Litecoin (LTC) ETF likely to be the first approved — although Solana (SOL) could be close behind. 

“[A Litecoin ETF is] def among the most likely to be out first, but Osprey forcing their Solana 40 act filing effective may have sparked the SEC to act faster on the Solana ones,” he said.

“Commission staff continues to have unresolved questions about whether the Funds, if structured and operated as proposed, would be able to meet the definition of ‘investment company' under the Investment Company Act,” the SEC stated. 

Still, Balchunas said that REX-Osprey lawyers are certain they can work things out with the commission, and the fund's legal team is pushing the envelope in an effort to be first to market.

Analysts showed further cause for optimism after the SEC reportedly asked would-be Solana ETF issuers to update and clarify filing language regarding in-kind redemptions and staking. This supposedly shows that the SEC is open to staking — a key component of many altcoin ecosystems. 

According to a Bloomberg Terminal snapshot shared by Balchunas, chances for altcoin ETF approval are good overall, tipping approval changes for 10 ETFs at 60% or above. 

Still, ETF approval does not guarantee prices going to the moon. Nearly a year after approval, ETH's price has not seen the same meteoric price action as its counterpart, Bitcoin. 

Last month witnessed positive inflows and not a single day of net outflows to ETH ETFs, but critics and observers are concerned about relatively low network fees and the Ethereum network losing ground on decentralized exchanges.

Demand for altcoin ETFs may be even less than for ETH ETFs, as Balchunas stated, “Nothing will compare to bitcoin. We have a little saying on the team: ‘The further away you get from btc, the less assets there will be.'”

Dreams for an “altcoin summer” may further dampen as altcoins' dominance wanes. Crypto market observer Daan Crypto Trades wrote in February about decreasing altcoin dominance but noted that “the decline was quicker and more severe” than previous cycles.

Two independent “altcoin season indexes” from Blockchain Center and CoinMarketCap show the indicator firmly in “Bitcoin season.” 

Still, others see an opportunity. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe wrote on June 1 that the altcoin market hasn't even begun: “The biggest bull market ever on crypto is about to happen, as the expansion after such a long bear market is going to be bigger than before.”

Even as Israel's attack on Iran shook crypto prices on June 13, van de Poppe remained optimistic of upward momentum, stating that gold breaking downward was a signal for altcoin growth. 

“Buying the dip for opportunities. This should quickly fade away,” he said in a subsequent post. 

On April 10, the SEC got its new chairman, businessman Paul Atkins, following a lengthy confirmation process in the Senate. 

Atkins' priorities were to reverse the actions of his predecessor, Gary Gensler, whom the crypto industry accused of stifling its potential.

Atkins' SEC has wasted no time reversing a number of policies and implementing new, crypto-friendly rules.

On June 12, the SEC announced that it would be “withdrawing certain notices of proposed rulemaking” made under Gensler. Among them was Rule 3b-16, which expanded the definition of the term “exchange” to include DeFi protocols. 

Related: SEC to shape crypto policy with ‘notice and comment,' says Atkins

It also axed a rule that required investment firms to hold client assets with a “qualified custodian,” a definition from which crypto exchanges and wallet providers were typically excluded. 

Atkins has also directed staff to work on a so-called “innovation exemption.” This new exclusion for certain crypto- and blockchain-related financial products would supposedly allow new onchain products to come to market more quickly. 

The SEC chair's new approach of “notice and comment” rather than “regulation by enforcement” has been lauded not just by the crypto industry but by fellow regulator Caroline Pham, acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

With regulatory restructuring just getting started — be it from new laws to agency shakeups — the crypto industry is optimistic for future growth in the US. ETFs may be set to take off in this changing landscape.

The crypto world is electric with the recent surge of momentum for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act.

The landmark legislation, which cleared the Senate with a decisive 68-30 vote and is now headed for House approval, has been lauded as a transformative step for the digital asset landscape.

President Trump himself has publicly thrown his support behind the bill, urging the House to approve it ‘ASAP – NO DELAYS' and directly to his office.

The powerful endorsement, coupled with the bipartisan Senate approval, could be interpreted by the market as a bullish signal for the entire crypto industry, catalyzing a possible rally.

The immediate aftermath of the GENIUS Act's Senate passage saw a significant uptick in the valuations of crypto companies. Coinbase, listed on the Nasdaq, closed the trading day up an impressive 16.32% to $295.29.

Even more striking was the performance of Circle, listed on the NYSE, which soared 33.82% to close at $199.59. The rapid surge has led some in the crypto community to declare the arrival of ‘Stablecoin Summer', as regulatory clarity is poised to unlock substantial institutional investment and wider adoption.

The general impression is that GENIUS will be unequivocally good for the crypto market as a whole. The stage is set for a period of accelerated growth, with many investors now looking at the best altcoins that could rally 100X as Trump praises the GENIUS stablecoin bill and the ecosystem matures.

The broader market optimism caused by the GENIUS Act is perfect for projects like SUBBD ($SUBBD), which introduce significant technological innovation and address a market need. It's well-positioned to thrive in this new era of crypto clarity.

The $85B+ content subscription industry is ripe for disruption, and $SUBBD could lead the charge. The innovative AI creator platform is designed to empower both creators and fans by integrating cutting-edge AI creation tools and token-powered experiences.

With an impressive combined following of over 250M across its ecosystem and ambassadors, and substantial benefits for token holders, $SUBBD is poised for mass adoption.



As the first AI-integrated crypto creator/subscription platform, SUBBD offers a unique value proposition. Creators can leverage an AI assistant to automate tasks like chat, editing, and monetization, freeing them to focus on content.

Meanwhile, users can generate realistic photos and short-form videos, approved by the original creator, fostering a deeper engagement.

In a market characterized by volatility and rapid movements, Just a Chill Guy ($CHILL) offers a refreshing, laid-back alternative.

This meme-inspired token gains traction by fostering a community around the viral ‘Chill Guy' meme – a nonchalant character unfazed by life's challenges.



$CHILL aims to embody this ethos, providing a cool and engaging space for crypto enthusiasts. While many coins prioritize short-term hype, $CHILL distinguishes itself by focusing on strong community engagement and long-term potential, making it an appealing option for those seeking a more relaxed crypto journey.

As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the best meme coins will seek to carve out their niche by leveraging the widespread appeal of their underlying memes and cultivating a loyal following.

If you're confident in Bitcoin's inevitable climb to $1M and beyond, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) offers an exciting and accessible entry point.

Bitcoin remains the most talked-about crypto asset when it comes to market adoption, making headlines in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve back in March of this year.

The institutional confidence and broader adoption bolstered by the GENIUS Act will see it gain even more attention, creating an even more favourable environment for Bitcoin-linked assets.

$BTCBULL, a community-driven token built on the Ethereum network, is designed to let holders earn free $BTC and $BTCBULL tokens as $BTC surges.

Unlike traditional $BTC investments, $BTCBULL allows anyone to benefit from $BTC's rise without needing to own an entire coin. It's the only altcoin that rewards holders and presale buyers with real $BTC, making it a standout.

$BTCBULL's unique mechanics are engineered for maximum holder benefit. As Bitcoin hits the $150K and $200K landmarks, $BTCBULL holders receive direct $BTC airdrops seamlessly integrated through its partnership with Best Wallet, one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets.

Furthermore, the project operates a deflationary token burn mechanism, also at key $BTC landmarks, meaning the $BTCBULL supply is permanently reduced, increasing scarcity and value.

The GENIUS Act has undoubtedly stirred excitement in the crypto market, bringing a fresh wave of optimism and transforming investor sentiment to anticipation.

The evolving landscape offers fertile ground for innovative projects, making both $SUBBD and $BTCBULL compelling options for those wanting to capitalize on the next wave of altcoin rallies in what looks to be a vibrant ‘Stablecoin Summer' and beyond.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altseason Bulls Are ‘MIA,' Analyst Warns Amid $36B Altcoin Sell Pressure","https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/altseason-bulls-are-mia-analyst-warns-amid-36b-altcoin-sell-pressure-1527219","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 07:54:00 GMT","

Altcoins are lagging as Bitcoin holds above $100,000, with key trading data showing sustained sell pressure across the broader market, analyst Burak Kesmci argues.

The 1-year cumulative buy/sell quote volume difference for altcoins — excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) — has plunged to -$36 billion as of June 2025. The figure reflects the net difference between buy and sell orders on centralized exchanges.

A negative reading signals sustained sell pressure across the altcoin market.

The last time this metric turned positive was in December 2024, coinciding with a local top in altcoins. Since then, it's been downhill, even as Bitcoin broke above six figures.

In effect, altcoin investors have disappeared, or as the data suggests, they're “MIA.”

“Even though Bitcoin is enjoying a bull run, altcoins are behaving like it's still winter,” wrote Kesmci, adding:

“Unless this metric starts rising again, expecting a full-blown altseason or altcoin FOMO might just be wishful thinking.”

Historically, strong altcoin performance has followed sharp recoveries in this metric, when net buying returns and confidence build across the market. Without that shift, expectations for an imminent altseason may be premature.

Part of the reason could be investor risk appetite.

With global economic uncertainty lingering and regulatory clarity limited in many regions, traders appear to be rotating capital into Bitcoin as a safer, more liquid asset, while sidelining altcoins with higher volatility and lower trust.

Altcoin-focused ETFs have the potential to drive renewed investor interest by offering exposure to digital assets via regulated funds. US spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum have each drawn billions in inflows and set a strong precedent.

According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the SEC now assigns 90% approval odds to Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) spot ETF filings, with XRP at 85%, Dogecoin (DOGE) at 80%, and Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polkadot (DOT) each sitting at 75%.

Key decision timelines include:

July 2, 2025: Basket-style crypto/index ETF filings are due, with Bloomberg assigning them a 90% chance of approval

Late Q4 2025: Final windows for single-asset approvals—SOL, LTC (October), XRP (November), DOGE (December), ADA, DOT, AVAX (November)

Seyffart emphasizes that while early approvals may happen in late June or early July, the more realistic time frame is Q4 2025

ETFs may increase demand for select altcoins, but may not meaningfully shift the overall altcoin market if smaller-cap tokens remain excluded. Additionally, since the CryptoQuant metric reflects spot exchange activity, ETF-driven demand must translate into real buying pressure on those platforms to have a measurable effect.

GenLayer, a startup building decentralized legal infrastructure for AI and machine agents, has launched its first incentivized testnet, dubbed Asimov. 

This marks the initial rollout of its multi-phase validator onboarding and technology validation initiative as the company moves closer to mainnet deployment. 

The testnet introduces what GenLayer calls the first Intelligent Blockchain, powered by AI models and designed to resolve subjective decisions typically outside the scope of traditional deterministic blockchains.

“Our narrative is that as we enter a world of AI agents—fast and smart—we need a new legal system because the current one is fragmented, slow, and expensive,” said GenLayer CEO and co-founder Albert Castellana, adding that GenLayer “offers a synthetic jurisdiction: a legal system for machines.”

Asimov is the first of three sequential testnets in GenLayer's roadmap, to be followed by Bradbury and Clark. 

The company aims to progressively test and scale its “Optimistic Democracy” consensus mechanism. Unlike conventional blockchain validators that simply execute code, GenLayer validators are paired with large language models (LLMs), enabling them to evaluate off-chain data and make subjective decisions—such as determining whether submitted content meets campaign requirements or whether a smart contract's conditions have been fairly fulfilled.

GenLayer positions this model as essential infrastructure for the coming age of AI agents and machine-to-machine transactions. 

According to Castellana, Asimov's launch is both a stress test and a signal of technical maturity to developers and partners.

The validator program for Asimov targets seasoned blockchain infrastructure operators. Selected participants will earn rewards for testing consensus logic, transaction handling, and model coordination. GenLayer has already onboarded dozens of validators, with more in the pipeline. Participation requires a full-time commitment during test phases.

To support builders, GenLayer is releasing a comprehensive developer stack, including the GenLayer Studio, Wallet, Blockchain Explorer, and GS Library (a Python toolkit). The testnet is also paired with a grant program to encourage early development and experimentation ahead of mainnet launch.

Coinciding with Asimov is the beta release of Rally, a decentralized marketing protocol that automates influencer and community incentive campaigns. Using AI-powered validators, Rally evaluates submitted content — such as social media posts — against campaign rules embedded in smart contracts.

“Rally is our first protocol built on GenLayer,” Castellana told VentureBeat. “It autonomously evaluates community-created content and determines compensation, opening participation beyond influencers to anyone.”

Brands define guidelines (e.g., hashtags, tone, originality), deposit funds, and let the protocol autonomously determine payouts. 

This setup avoids manual negotiation and performance disputes common in traditional influencer programs. Content creators, in turn, receive transparent, on-chain compensation if their submissions meet preset criteria.

“In the future, many influencers will be AI agents seeking opportunities to earn—this system accommodates that evolution,” Castellana added. 

Rally operates independently of GenLayer's core team and will eventually be governed by a DAO. From each campaign pool, 1% goes to the Rally DAO, while 10% of protocol fees are allocated to the developers of participating applications.

“The way I see GenLayer is like a toy factory—creating new tools and mechanisms you can't find anywhere else,” the CEO added. “Rally is just one example of what's possible.”

For technical decision makers — including brand managers, growth marketers, and digital campaign leads— GenLayer and Rally offer the ability to automate and decentralize campaign execution and quality control. Instead of manually managing influencer relationships, approving content, and disputing post-campaign performance, teams can deploy smart contracts that use LLMs to judge submissions against predefined standards.

This approach significantly reduces operational overhead, enables real-time feedback and rewards, and ensures fairness and transparency throughout the campaign lifecycle. Additionally, the use of AI agents allows for scalable campaign management across thousands of potential content contributors—human or automated—without additional headcount or vendor friction.

For enterprises that regularly invest in brand visibility, product launches, or community engagement, Rally could streamline marketing operations while offering auditable proof of campaign performance. Combined with GenLayer's broader infrastructure, brands also gain access to AI-driven decision systems for everything from grants disbursement to smart contract enforcement, potentially transforming legal and operational workflows in Web3 contexts.

GenLayer's architecture is supported by technical partners including ZKSync (for rollup-based scalability), Heurist (for decentralized model hosting), Atoma Network (for privacy-preserving execution), and Caldera. These integrations ensure that the platform remains performant, secure, and aligned with broader Ethereum-based ecosystems.

The company has raised $7.5 million in seed funding from investors such as North Island Ventures, Arrington Capital, ZK Ventures, and Arthur Hayes' Maelstrom. GenLayer sees its protocol as the foundation of a synthetic, global jurisdiction—an autonomous legal layer for the AI economy, capable of settling disputes at machine speed with greater accessibility than traditional legal systems.

Following Asimov, the Bradbury and Clark testnets will introduce validator-level LLM configuration, production-grade inference tuning, and autonomous network operations. Each phase is designed to validate system components ahead of a mainnet launch planned for later this year.

GenLayer is actively seeking professional validators and developers to participate in the testnet. Those interested can apply via the company's website. 

With applications like Rally already live in beta, GenLayer presents a new category of intelligent blockchain infrastructure — combining AI decision-making with decentralized governance to unlock more autonomous, transparent, and scalable systems for enterprise and community users alike

Quantum Blockchain Technologies PLC (AIM:QBT) told investors it is in talks with two companies to port its AI technologies onto aftermarket control boards for bitcoin miners.

The technologies, Method A and Method B, were recently demonstrated at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

“The live and off-line demonstrations of QBT's technology in Las Vegas proved to be essential in convincing some of the major players that the ability to make predictions on the behavior of SHA-256 using AI learning models is indeed, real, as it provides a practical solution to improve the quality hashing power of a miner,” chief executive Francesco Gardin said.

He highlighted the pace of progress, with the company now “finally entering into the on-site third-party assessment phase with potential customers and partners”.

Gardin added: ""We are now moving fast from the single ASIC implementations of Method A and Method B to the mining rig versions in order to deploy to potential customers and partners QBT technology, while for Method C we are working hard to integrate our product into the new versions of the ASIC chips of two Bitcoin mining manufacturers.""

Aftermarket boards are used to replace original control boards in crypto mining machines, to boost hash rate and lower energy and temperature costs.

QBT plans to release Methods A and B immediately through partnerships with board providers. It will maintain a live connection to servers that run its AI models.

The company noted that it will focus on rigs by leading Chinese manufacturers and new US producers.

QBT said it is also engaged with two ASIC chip manufacturers to begin an in-depth assessment of Method C for integration into new ASIC designs.

Ford and Iagon's PoC on Cardano aims to revolutionize legal data storage through decentralized blockchain solutions.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ford Motor Company, a Fortune 500 company, has joined forces with Iagon and Cloud Court to launch a proof-of-concept (PoC) focused on decentralized legal data storage, according to a June 18 announcement.

The project, built on the Cardano blockchain, will test decentralized solutions for managing sensitive legal records across large organizations.

Following the news, Iagon's IAG token climbed over 11% to $0.1664 at press time. According to CryptoSlate's data, Cardano's ADA token dropped 3% to $0.59843.

The collaborators noted that law firms and corporate legal departments handle massive volumes of material, from depositions and court transcripts to confidential filings.

These records are often spread across multiple teams and platforms, leading to inefficiencies, lost insights, and serious data security concerns.

As a result, this pilot scheme focuses on helping legal teams and enterprises gain control over litigation data.

According to the statement, the proposed system will use a hybrid infrastructure.

Legal data will be encrypted and stored off-chain, while Cardano's blockchain will handle permission controls, access logs, and data verification.

This setup is designed to reduce data fragmentation while providing clear audit trails, stronger security, and smoother internal collaboration.

Meanwhile, the initiative will showcase Cardano's evolving utility in enterprise environments. If successful, the project could be a model for integrating blockchain and AI in law, healthcare, finance, and public administration.

Ford will serve as an advisor for the exploratory project. The car manufacturer will stress-test the solution for large-scale enterprise use and lend credibility to blockchain-backed LegalTech.

Moreover, the company's participation is also expected to encourage other corporations to explore similar tools, especially as demand for secure and transparent data management grows.

Iagon said on X:

“Ford is interested in exploring whether blockchain-based distributed storage could address persistent challenges in legal data infrastructure. In particular, Ford sees merit in exploring how blockchain technology might deliver economically efficient storage and audit solutions for legal data management.”

The new owners of Nexus Mods have officially responded to fans' concerns about a change in the video games site's direction, after some unsettling details about the company and its plans to use tactics like microtransactions and NFTs in its business ventures.

For the first time since its inception, Nexus Mods has changed owners, with founder Robin Scott announcing that the site had been sold. What was strange about the announcement was that Scott didn't name the new owners; fans discovered that it was a company called Chosen.

 As reported by PC Gamer, it was discovered that one of Chosen's founders' LinkedIn pages mentioned a “Gaming Startup Monetization Cheat Sheet,” listing the things most gamers despise when it comes to monetization, such as NFTs.

The response to this discovery was so vitriolic that one of the new founders, nicknamed Foledinho on Nexus Mods, responded to PC Gamer and outlined the changes intended for the site. There's no intention to sell the mods, nor will players be forced to upgrade to premium accounts. However, no details were given about how the site could be monetized.

Online multiplayer games like Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Fortnite, and Final Fantasy XIV let players from different consoles and PC play together.

 The problem with monetizing a site like Nexus Mods is that game mods already exist in a strange legal area. For the most part, developers and publishers don't care about hobbyist fans tinkering with games, and will usually only step in if there's some controversy involved.

Where it becomes iffy is when money is involved. The second people start charging for mods is when companies will start cracking down on them. This leaves the new owners of Nexus Mods in an odd situation, as selling the content would be a legal doomsday, leaving ads and premium memberships as the main way to make money without incurring the wrath of the industry at large.

Perhaps if the former Nexus Mods owner had spoken about the buyers more openly, then fans wouldn't have been so quick to dig into their history. But the secret is out now, and the fate of the world's biggest mod site is more unsure than it has ever been.

In the crypto bull market of 2021, it was all about NFTs. Yes, Bitcoin smashed past its all-time highs and various alts posted insane performances as well, but the mainstream narrative surrounded NFTs. Celebrities were posting about them, starting their own NFT lines – with artists like Grimes making $5.8 million in just 20 minutes – and people were predicting that they'd change the world.

Then, surprisingly, they simply faded during the bear market and haven't bounced back this cycle. Could this mean that it's still early in the bull market? Will NFTs make a grand return after Bitcoin mania reaches all-time highs again?

Table of contents

Raoul Pal is one of the most influential figures in the crypto space, having been an early predictor of $100,000 BTC as far back as 2013. The investor has made some calls that have turned out to be true in recent times, and now expects the famous “banana zone” phase of the Bitcoin macro cycle to be taking off. Indeed, he thinks this could run until the end of 2025, when the markets will take a downturn again.

In a recent X post, Pal advised his followers to own as much crypto as possible first. After that, he says people should focus on owning as many NFTs as possible, as he believes that “art is upstream of wealth”. The crypto influencer was an early adopter of CryptoPunks, which are now selling for extraordinary sums of money. Indeed, the cheapest one available is currently 46.60 ETH, with plenty more expensive ones than that.

Despite Pal's bullishness on NFTs, the rest of the crypto community has been quiet on them during this cycle. Indeed, this time, the main attraction has been memecoins. The concept of the memecoin has existed since Dogecoin's inception in 2013, but now there are millions to choose from with more cropping up every day.  

Despite having gone quiet for a few years, there's a chance that NFTs could make a comeback. That's because they serve a purpose, and could have a greater function in the online world in the future. Some musicians, including Snoop Dogg, have already found selling their material as NFTs to be a lucrative way of giving fans their own individual products.

Indeed, along with album releases as NFTs, bands like Lords of Acid have previously released their own entire collections. These give fans a chance to gather some collectibles related to their favorite artists, providing a new way to engage with them.

NFTs could in fact serve a greater purpose across many disparate areas of the entertainment market. For instance, Netflix already proposed the idea of NFTs in video streaming with a unique idea for future TV ratings in Love, Death + Robots. This is in keeping for Netflix, who has been a major forerunner of streaming tech for some time, having made recent strides offering games and other interactive media alongside their films and shows.

The casino industry is always quick to adapt to new tech as well, with sites like online casino Betway making great use of live streaming in recent years with titles like Sticky Bandits Roulette and Football Roulette, among many others. It would not be surprising, therefore, if in the future people could be allowed to own NFTs in these virtual casinos. The NFTs that typically gain the most traction are those based on truly unique collectibles, and in games of random chance, unpredictability is part and parcel of the experience, making the tech potentially apt for the market.

Furthermore, there is much room for innovation within the VR industry for NFTs. There has long been talk of expanding VR metaverses in the near-future, where people could socialize and work. Pew Research Center expects these environments to become highly immersive by 2040, at which point VR may almost be indistinguishable from real life. In this scenario, NFTs could allow people to buy products and property within the virtual worlds with a level of security more analogous to physically owning them.

Bitcoin has been steadily rising for the last couple of years, and it recently hit another all-time high. However, there's still no NFT hype like there was around the peak of the last cycle. It could be coming soon, though, as this phase usually sees more retail investors flooding in and looking to jump on the latest trends. During this mania phase, if celebrity influencers start promoting NFTs again, they could boom like last time.

NFTs are far from over, but they have been quiet in recent times. They could potentially make a comeback in this crypto cycle but, if they don't, they should be able to bounce again in the future. This is because their potential use cases are manifold, and could broaden horizons for engagement for a lot of different industries.

Social party game Forgotten Playland is further entrenching itself in Web3, formally integrating with Beam Network, an Avalanche L1 chain, while unveiling new content and a battle pass. 

With the update and blockchain integration, most in-game assets within Forgotten Playland become freely tradeable, allowing players to exercise one of the promises of decentralized gaming and entitling them to own a piece of the game economy.

Players will be able to own two different types of NFTs on the platform, cosmetic and toybox. Cosmetics—like skins, traits and emotes—can be earned by playing the game, but also can be packaged within the battle pass or toybox features. Toyboxes act as limited-edition bundles that will only be rolled out periodically.

“These NFTs enhance the game by offering personalization, social signaling, marketplace trading, and access to exclusive content,” Zico Bakker, co-founder of Duckland Games told Decrypt. 

The NFTs and the game's Forgotten Playland token (FP) “empower a vibrant economy,” according to Bakker, who added that the blockchain and NFT implementation gives the Forgotten Playland “the freedom to work on a play-to-airdrop campaign,” which it is undertaking right now with a FLUFFY points campaign. 

In the campaign, users earn points based on the amount of cosmetics they own, their activity in the game, and the quests they complete. 

“As NFTs and FP tokens gain utility, players no longer experience purely cosmetic progression; there's financial and social motivation to engage deeper,” said Bakker.

Players will be able to engage with new content in this update and in the near future as well. 

“We have a lot of new content planned for Forgotten Playland,” said Bakker. “With this update, we introduced the battle pass feature and Toybox feature, so expect more of that. In two weeks, we will add two new party games to the mix for even more fun. After that we will focus on the Plushkyn Battle feature, which we will share more information [on] at a later date.”

In addition to new content, the latest update also adds new seasonal challenges, rewards, and full German language support.

Forgotten Playland, which spotlights abandoned plush toys in a dusty attic, joins a growing ecosystem of games on the Avalanche-powered Beam Network. It is developed by Vermillion, a collaboration between Duckland Games and the Beam Foundation. 

“Beam has believed in the project from day one and helped us raise the necessary funds to get us where we are,” Bakker said. “We share a lot of values regarding game development and pushing the crypto gaming space to the next level. And we both want to create a fun game that can be enjoyed by many players in which gas fees are low, processing is fast, and technology is progressing.”

The free-to-play Windows PC game is available for download from the Epic Games Store.

Plasma is gearing up to launch its stablecoin-optimized blockchain on mainnet by “late summer,” the company's CEO told Decrypt.

Paul Faecks, founder and CEO of Plasma, said that the blockchain will support “the largest stablecoins,” at launch based on its internal data.

“We are building a blockchain that is the best product for moving stablecoins from A to B,” Faecks added. ""Everything around it has to be in service of being that. Otherwise, it's not worth doing for us.”

At least 40 days before its mainnet launch, Faecks told Decrypt, the Plasma public pre-sale will open. The pre-sale timing is an effort to remain compliant with regulations across the globe, with U.S. participants requiring a 12-month lock-up of their tokens—which will extend past mainnet launch.

Assuming the end of Summer is September 22, the latest the XPL pre-sale would take place is August 13.

Stablecoins have become a hot topic in the crypto space lately, following the successful Circle IPO, groundbreaking legislation passing through the U.S. Senate, and big companies looking to issue their own stablecoins.

Plasma aims to build on this momentum with the launch of an EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain that's purpose-built for stablecoins, allowing for specialized optimizations.

Faecks told Decrypt that the company's focus on becoming “stablecoin chain number one” has informed its decisions around tech architecture and liquidity. “That leads to very different choices—a set of choices that a Solana or an Aptos can't really make,” he said. “I think that obviously gives us an advantage in this kind of small sliver of the world.”

At the time of writing, the total market capitalization of all stablecoins sits above $251.74 billion, with Tron and Ethereum leading the way by USDT in circulation, according to DefiLlama. However, these networks cater to a broad ecosystem with meme coin launchpads, real-world assets, and more. While Plasma's permissionless nature means that anyone is free to build those products atop its network, Plasma itself is not going to spend any time focusing on those corners of the industry, Faecks told Decrypt.

As a result, its 27-person team based in London can work solely on stablecoin-focused optimizations, such as making stablecoin transactions on the network completely gasless. Plasma is also working on a regulatory-compliant way to allow private USDT transactions, Faecks said.

“Everything we do ecosystem-wise is geared towards stablecoins,” Faecks added. “You need to be very deeply integrated into the existing payment stack and into everything around the chain itself. In the end, payments is a massive network effects business that requires a level of omnipresence and a level of integrations everywhere to actually have value.”

There will be no further increases to the deposit cap. Total deposits are now limited to $1 billion.

The goals of the deposit period were clear: enable broad, global participation through a fair process prioritizing real users over bots, and bootstrap day-one stablecoin… pic.twitter.com/ms3PiVz4KI

— Plasma (@PlasmaFDN) June 16, 2025



To date, Plasma has secured $1 billion in deposits for its upcoming XPL token pre-sale last week and raised $24 million across its Seed and Series A funding rounds in February with support from Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, and investment firms including 6th Man Ventures.

A week before the public deposit opened, Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, also made a strategic investment at an undisclosed fee, confirmed to be more than $24 million at the same valuation of $500 million FDV.

Plasma confirmed to Decrypt that it has been talking to a wide range of major players throughout the payment stack, including on-ramps, traditional finance companies, and, of course, stablecoin issuers.

Stablecoins have attracted interest from outside the crypto sector, with the likes of Walmart, Amazon, and Bank of America all reportedly making moves into the stablecoin market.

Faecks claimed that “dozens” of traditional companies have made contact with Plasma to discuss their stablecoin plans, both to launch their own token or to integrate stablecoin payments into their products—though he declined to name any of the firms in question.

Much of the recent upsurge of interest in stablecoins has been driven by the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins and digital assets. The GENIUS Act's passage could unleash thousands of stablecoins onto the market, according to some industry players—but Faecks ultimately expects one or two big players to win out.

“I'm skeptical of thousands of stablecoins working at scale,” he told Decrypt, adding that stablecoins are “very much a network effects business and that the majority of value will accrue to the largest players in the ecosystem. Those, he said, will be the ones with “the deepest liquidity and the easiest integrations everywhere.”

ICO Issues Guidance as DUAA 2025 Enacted

The Act introduces sweeping changes across lawful bases, cookies, automated decision-making, and complaints handling—alongside new enforcement powers for the ICO.

The UK's Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUAA) has now received Royal Assent, bringing with it the most substantial updates to domestic data protection law since the UK GDPR was introduced. The legislation is designed to modernise how organisations use personal information, supporting innovation and economic growth while maintaining strong protections for individual rights.

The Act introduces wide-ranging reforms across key areas, including lawful bases for data processing, scientific research, cookie consent, automated decision-making, and complaint handling. It also strengthens the powers of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to ensure more effective oversight and enforcement.

To support organisations and the wider public in adapting to the changes, the ICO has published a series of guidance materials. This includes a practical overview aimed at organisations, a detailed technical breakdown for data protection professionals, and other resources for law enforcement and individuals. Separate guidance will follow over time, as implementation is phased in.

Key Changes Introduced by the DUAA

The DUAA amends the UK GDPR, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). Among its most impactful changes:

Research and innovation: The Act clarifies when personal information can be used for scientific research, including commercial research, and confirms that individuals can provide ‘broad consent' to entire areas of study. Organisations can also reuse data for research without issuing individual privacy notices, so long as the effort required would be disproportionate and other safeguards are in place.

Automated decision-making: The Act removes previous limitations on relying solely on a person's consent or contract to make significant automated decisions. Organisations may now use any lawful basis, including legitimate interests (with safeguards), to support such processing—though special category data remains restricted.

Cookies: New exemptions allow certain types of cookies to be set without user consent, including those used for statistical analysis and to improve website functionality.

Recognised legitimate interests: A new lawful basis lets organisations use personal data for certain pre-approved purposes—like public security—without the need to weigh those interests against individual rights.

Charity marketing: Charities are now permitted to send email marketing without consent to individuals who've supported or shown interest in their work, unless those individuals opt out—similar to the ‘soft opt-in' rule already used by commercial organisations.

Data sharing: The Act shifts responsibility for deciding if personal information is needed for a public task to the requesting body, such as the police—freeing up the disclosing organisation from making this judgement.

Subject Access Requests: The legislation clarifies that organisations are only required to carry out “reasonable and proportionate” searches when responding to data access requests.

Clarity and structure: Without changing the core principles of data protection, the Act restructures parts of the legislation to improve readability. It confirms, for instance, that direct marketing can be a legitimate interest, and refines how organisations approach international data transfers.

New Obligations for Organisations

The DUAA introduces several specific responsibilities that organisations must now meet:

Children's data: Providers of online services likely to be used by children must explicitly factor children's needs into their data use. The ICO notes that those already conforming to the Age Appropriate Design Code should be well-placed to meet this requirement.

Complaints handling: Organisations must now provide mechanisms to help individuals submit complaints about how their data is used. This includes offering electronic complaints forms, acknowledging complaints within 30 days, and responding “without undue delay”.

To prepare, organisations are advised to:

Familiarise themselves with the legislative changes.

Assess whether their existing practices for children's data and complaints meet the new requirements.

Re-evaluate how they might benefit from the more innovation-friendly provisions, including those related to automation, research, and cookies.

Subscribe to ICO newsletters for updates on new and evolving guidance.

Technical Summary for Data Protection Professionals

In addition to general guidance, the ICO has issued a detailed breakdown of the DUAA's impact for those with data protection responsibilities—such as Data Protection Officers and compliance leads.

This expert-focused summary walks through each relevant section of the legislation and outlines substantive changes. These include:

Removal of balancing tests for recognised legitimate interests.

Clarification that certain data re-uses—such as for archiving in the public interest—are automatically compatible with their original purpose.

Updates to the lawful bases available for automated decision-making.

Refined language around international transfers, without altering the underlying legal standard.

The summary also flags where the DUAA alters law enforcement data rules under Part 3 of the DPA or intelligence services rules under Part 4—though most changes are relevant to general data use by businesses, public bodies, and charities.

It does not replace existing ICO guidance, which will be updated over time, but offers an interim technical reference for compliance planning.

New Powers and Duties for the ICO

The Act enhances the ICO's investigatory and enforcement capabilities. New powers include the ability to:

Compel witnesses to attend interviews.

Require organisations to produce technical reports.

Issue fines under PECR of up to £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.

The legislation also reforms the ICO's structure and introduces new transparency and accountability requirements, aimed at modernising how the regulator operates.

Information Commissioner John Edwards said the changes would allow the ICO to “continue to operate as a trusted, fair and independent regulator,” and to better “balance innovation and economic growth with strong protections for people's rights.”

Most of the DUAA's provisions will come into force within two to six months from Royal Assent, though a few may take up to a year. The government will use secondary legislation to manage this phased rollout.

In the meantime, organisations are encouraged to:

Consult the ICO's newly published guidance tailored to their role.

Identify which provisions require immediate changes to policy or practice.

Begin reviewing opportunities to simplify operations or enhance services under the new legal framework.

The Information Commissioner's Office has stepped up to the plate following the Data (Use & Access) Act 2025 receiving Royal Assent – just seven days after it was passed by both Houses of Parliament –  by publishing a raft of new guidance for businesses.
The legislation updates key aspects of data protection law, with the aim of making it easier for UK firms to protect people's personal information while growing and innovating their products and services.
Changes to the law include clarifying how personal information can be used for research; lifting restrictions on some automated decision making; setting out how to use some cookies without consent; allowing charities to send people email marketing without consent in certain circumstances; requiring organisations to have a data protection complaints procedure; and introducing a new lawful basis of recognised legitimate interests.
The Act also provides the ICO with new powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend interviews, request technical reports, and bring the penalties for breaches of PECR in line with GDPR, opening up the prospect of fines of up to £17.5m or 4% of global turnover.
It has now published information to support organisations and the public as these changes are introduced. This includes an outline what the Act means for organisations;  an outline of what the Act means for law enforcement agencies; a detailed summary of the changes for data protection experts; a new and planned guidance webpage setting out what guidance to expect and when; an outline of how it will continue its regulatory work as the Act is implemented, and, finally, a guide for the public on how the Act will affect them.
Information Commissioner John Edwards said: “The Act gives organisations using personal information new and better opportunities to innovate and grow in the UK, and further enhances our ability to balance innovation and economic growth with strong protections for people's rights.
“Today we've published a catalogue of resources to help explain what this new legislation means for businesses.  Over the coming months we will launch new guidance, open consultations, and provide practical tools to help embed the Act's principles into everyday operations. Our goal is to ensure that data can be used confidently and responsibly to deliver better services, drive economic growth, and uphold public trust.”

The legislation updates key aspects of data protection law, with the aim of making it easier for UK firms to protect people's personal information while growing and innovating their products and services.
Changes to the law include clarifying how personal information can be used for research; lifting restrictions on some automated decision making; setting out how to use some cookies without consent; allowing charities to send people email marketing without consent in certain circumstances; requiring organisations to have a data protection complaints procedure; and introducing a new lawful basis of recognised legitimate interests.
The Act also provides the ICO with new powers, including the ability to compel witnesses to attend interviews, request technical reports, and bring the penalties for breaches of PECR in line with GDPR, opening up the prospect of fines of up to £17.5m or 4% of global turnover.
It has now published information to support organisations and the public as these changes are introduced. This includes an outline what the Act means for organisations;  an outline of what the Act means for law enforcement agencies; a detailed summary of the changes for data protection experts; a new and planned guidance webpage setting out what guidance to expect and when; an outline of how it will continue its regulatory work as the Act is implemented, and, finally, a guide for the public on how the Act will affect them.
Information Commissioner John Edwards said: “The Act gives organisations using personal information new and better opportunities to innovate and grow in the UK, and further enhances our ability to balance innovation and economic growth with strong protections for people's rights.
“Today we've published a catalogue of resources to help explain what this new legislation means for businesses.  Over the coming months we will launch new guidance, open consultations, and provide practical tools to help embed the Act's principles into everyday operations. Our goal is to ensure that data can be used confidently and responsibly to deliver better services, drive economic growth, and uphold public trust.”

There was a time, not so long ago, when Donald Trump thundered: any country daring to build a future without the dollar would be punished by an avalanche of tariffs. Tax, sanction, isolate: that was the warning to anyone deviating from the green axis. But within the BRICS, the threat rings hollow. China, however, does not respond with bombs or missiles. It draws another weapon: its digital currency, the digital yuan or e-CNY. Not a currency war, but another map of global finance.

In Shanghai, the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Pan Gongsheng, set the tone. Against the backdrop of trade tensions with the USA, he wants to build a multipolar monetary system. Less dollar, more balance. At the Lujiazui Forum, he stated: 

Developing a multipolar international monetary system will help strengthen global financial stability.

The core of the system: an international management center for the e-CNY, backed by the CIPS system, an alternative to the SWIFT network. Banks like Standard Bank and First Abu Dhabi Bank have already joined.

Pan also denounces current flaws: “Cross-border payment infrastructures can be politicized and used as tools for unilateral sanctions.” Finance is no longer neutral; it becomes a battlefield.

The e-CNY allows China to secure its transactions while avoiding the dollar. It is an economic maneuver, but also a diplomatic one. Because where the United States isolates, Beijing weaves ties: Russia, Iran, Persian Gulf. The digital currency becomes an alternative to hegemony.

In the streets of China, the e-CNY is already a reality. More than 261 million users use it, with a cumulative volume exceeding 7.3 trillion dollars (Blockhead). Daily life is converting: transportation, salaries, taxes. No need for a bank account. A QR code is enough, even offline.

In Jiangsu, officials are paid in digital yuan. In Chengdu, it is used at the market. It is no longer an experiment. It is a digital reflex. Even tourists have access via a simple mobile app.

But Beijing's ambition goes beyond its borders. UnionPay, supported by the PBoC, is rolling out QR payments in Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos: the ecosystem is exported. Thanks to mBridge, transactions between Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi settle in 7 seconds, with a 98% reduced cost (Blockhead).

On X, Josh Ryan-Collins writes: 

Central bank digital currencies could increase public profits derived from seigniorage. 

More than just a technology, the digital yuan becomes a fiscal and political lever.

The digital yuan is not just a monetary gadget. It is a strategic instrument that redraws balances in regions seeking emancipation from the dollar. Beijing does not claim this. It proves it:

But the road remains winding. Capital controls still hinder the free circulation of the yuan abroad. And even if the RMB climbs, it still only represents 4% of global reserves, compared to 60% for the dollar.

China moves forward, with a discreet method but deep impact. It does not seek to dominate, but to offer an alternative. And this alternative entices Moscow, Tehran, or partners of the Belt and Road Initiative. The bet? A parallel finance, less vulnerable to sanctions, more suited to 21st-century alliances.

In the United States, Donald Trump killed any project for a digital dollar in the bud. For him, a CBDC threatens individual freedom. “We will ban all forms of central bank digital currency,” he declared as soon as he returned to power. Result: American digital finance stagnates while China builds.

With action Tuesday by the U.S. Senate to pass the GENIUS Act, the move to establish rules that would govern the burgeoning stablecoin industry now transits to the U.S. House of Representatives, where lawmakers have developed their own set of rules, the STABLE Act. Meanwhile, stablecoin-market participants are looking to the action in Congress to yield clear regulation that will lend yet more momentum to the market.



Indeed, stablecoins represent “the new bandwagon everybody wants to jump on,” says Enrico Camerinelli, a strategic advisor at the consultancy Datos Insights. Stablecoin market capitalization stood at $246 billion in May, up from $20 billion in May five years ago, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank.
While nobody can predict how the two bills in Congress will be reconciled, market participants expect clear rules will make it easier for established players to grow and for new entrants to get established. Already, “stablecoins are growing like crazy. It's easy, it's safe,” says Carlos Netto, cofounder and chief executive of Matera, a provider of technology for core banking and instant-payment technology that is working with the big stablecoin platform Circle Internet Group to speed adoption of the digital money.




Stablecoins are cryptocurrency whose value is tied to a national currency, such as the dollar. This link allows stablecoins to avoid the up-and-down swings in value other blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin are subject to. Partly for this reason, “stablecoins aren't niche any more. They're becoming infrastructure,” argues Kevin Rusher, founder and chief executive of Regnum Aurum Acquisition Corp., in an email. RAAC builds links between blockchain technology and assets like real estate.



Support in the Senate for its bill was overwhelming, as it passed by a vote of 68 to 30. Action in the House will revolve around reconciling provisions of its STABLE Act, or Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy Act, with the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) Act. The latter bill's requirements include a one-to-one reserve, openness to both banks and non-bank participants, a diversity of assets in the reserve backing coins, and a ban on use of “riskier assets,” such as corporate debt or equities. The STABLE Act maintains that federal approval of stablecoin issuers would prevail over any contrary state law, a provision not included in the GENIUS Act.



Passage of a reconciled set of rules now will be crucial to market growth for stablecoins, observers argue. “It will bring more legal clarity, and will get more people to use [stablecoins],” says Eric Grover, principal at Intrepid Ventures, a payment consultancy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Crypto's true revolution is about humanity, not technology","https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-human-case-for-crypto","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:01:10 GMT","

 Crypto isn't just about technology or speculation. It's about restoring dignity and agency to those left behind by traditional finance. Crypto offers a path to financial dignity through education and inclusion. 

Opinion by: Badi Sudhakaran, co-founder, VALR

Finance, as we know it, leaves far too many behind. This exclusion isn't just about access to banking or financial services — it's about dignity.

When people can't preserve their wealth or understand why their money loses value, they lose more than just purchasing power. They lose agency over their lives. 

Fortunately, the democratized nature of crypto offers a silver lining and a redemption arc for people. It's a way of fighting to get back what inflation has stolen.

Crypto offers a path to restore lost dignity through financial education and inclusion, which the current banking system often fails to deliver. While Bitcoin's (BTC) price movements may grab headlines, the value lies in something more fundamental: knowledge.

When people engage with cryptocurrency, they begin asking essential questions. Why does money have value? How do financial systems work? What causes inflation? 

Knowledge, as the Bahá'í Writings note, becomes “a veritable treasure for man and a source of glory.” We must, however, acknowledge crypto's challenges. The same technology that promises liberation can become another tool for exclusion. 

For many, crypto has devolved into a speculative playground, while complex interfaces and technical jargon create new barriers for those lacking technical competence. Industry participants often prioritize profit over education, exposing new and vulnerable users to risks they don't fully comprehend.

A more honest path forward for blockchain lies in building systems prioritizing human understanding over transaction speed and community benefit over individual gain. Technology alone cannot deliver dignity. It must be paired with responsible development and meaningful education.

True financial dignity comes from the applied combination of knowledge and agency. It's visible when a grandmother in rural India uses a crypto wallet over a bank-backed digital payments app because she understands its purpose and message, not because someone told her to. It emerges when a young entrepreneur in Johannesburg can participate in the global economy equally, knowing precisely what they're doing and why.

What's particularly striking is how this knowledge spreads through communities. A small study group of crypto users could quickly evolve into a local knowledge hub, where experienced users mentor newcomers, sharing technical skills and financial wisdom passed down through generations. This kind of inclusivity is common throughout blockchain circles.

Grassroots and community-led initiatives often prove more effective than formal training programs because they root new technology in a local context and cultural understanding. When it is a community delivering the education to its own people, the knowledge is passed on with greater dignity and respect. 

The crypto industry's tendency toward hype and speculation threatens to overshadow these more profound benefits. We need platforms that speak human language, not tech jargon. We need systems that protect as they empower and communities that support as they grow. This means rethinking how we design crypto platforms from the ground up. 

Instead of starting with technical capabilities, we should begin by asking human questions. How do people in different communities understand and use money? What are their fears and aspirations? What cultural factors influence their financial decisions? 

By embedding these human insights into our technical solutions, we can only create systems that truly serve everyone, not just the technically savvy or financially privileged. If we fail to address valid concerns about accessibility and regulations, the skeptics who dismiss crypto will only be given more fuel.

Wealth isn't just money; it's knowledge, dignity and connection. At its best, crypto embodies these values. It's more than a technology. It's a tool to empower, educate and unite.

The industry should champion truthfulness and excellence, ensuring crypto serves all, not a privileged few. A future where money, at last, means something more.

Iranian cryptocurrency exchange Nobitex was hacked for around $90 million on Wednesday, on the surface of it an almost routine exploit in an industry that already dealt with a $223 million exchange exploit earlier this month.

Below the surface, it was anything but. Digging a little deeper reveals this was not simply a cash grab, in fact, not a cash grab at all, but a political message that could end up being a hammer blow to one of the primary combatants in the escalating conflict in the Middle East. 

The hackers, the pro-Israel activist group Gonjeshke Darande, demonstrated their indifference to monetary gain by transferring the stolen funds to a series of inaccessible ""vanity"" wallets ladened with the words like ""terrorist,"" essentially burning those tokens forever.

""This appears to be an act of politically motivated sabotage rather than a financially motivated hack,"" Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson said in an interview. ""The use of vanity addresses seems to be motivated by wanting to send a message to Nobitex and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.""

The group, whose Farsi name means Predatory Sparrow, the following day leaked the exchange's source code, leaving any remaining tokens on the platform vulnerable to theft.

""Bypassing sanctions doesn't pay."" Gonjeshke Darande wrote on X alongside screenshots of the ""vanity"" wallets storing the stolen funds.

The regime has been under sanctions for years as due to international concerns over its human rights record and attempts to develop nuclear weapons. The European Union introduced sanctions in 2011 and has renewed them every year since, even strengthening them in the meantime. U.S. sanctions date back as far as 1979, to the Iranian Revolution.

Israel said Iran, which has has vowed to eliminate the Jewish state numerous times over the years, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Iran says its program is purely peaceful. Last week, immediately before Israel's air strikes, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had violated its non-proliferation commitments.

Gonjeshke Darande's tweet refers to allegations about Iran's use of cryptocurrency to evade the sanctions, echoing concerns Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King raised to former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2024.

Without Nobitex, Iran, a nation already hamstrung by oil and financial sanctions, may struggle to move capital around in a time of intense conflict. That could weaken its efforts to mobilize and launch attacks into Israel,.

There has been some discussion about the vanity wallets. Does the group have access to the filched tokens, or have they been burned forever?

There is ""practically zero chance attackers control these addresses,"" Yehor Rudytsia, a security researcher at Hacken, told CoinDesk. 

Creating the vanity addresses with a private key to unlock them ""is computationally trivial task and might be done in micro/milliseconds,"" Rudytsia said. But finding the 26-character private key would require as many as ~ 2¹⁵² trials. ""It is practically infeasible to find the private key which maps to such a public address."" 

Which means the money has gone.

Crypto majors slid further on Thursday and the dollar gained ground as fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East intensified.

XRP XRP$2.17, Cardano's ADA ADA$0.59292, and Solana's SOL SOL$143.79 lost over 1% in the past 24 hours, while dogecoin DOGE$0.16927 is flat on the day but down over 10% for the week, wiping out its early June rally. Ether ETH$2,503.19 lost 0.7%, reversing all gains from earlier in the week.

As such, spot bitcoin BTC$104,322.65 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. continued to attract inflows, with over $389 million in fresh buys on Wednesday, data shows. Spot ETH ETFs racked up $19 million in positive flows.

U.S. officials are reportedly weighing a direct strike on Iran, while the Federal Reserve flagged a more persistent inflation outlook, spooking investors and pushing equities, crypto majors, and commodities into choppy waters.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that tariffs and global conflict could make it harder to tame inflation. While the central bank held rates steady, Powell said the cost of tariffs “will fall on the end consumer,” and that the Fed needs to “see more” before cutting.

Altcoins, considered higher-risk bets, are typically the first to get dumped in times of macro stress.

Bitcoin continues to remains rangebound. While the largest cryptocurrency has climbed 13% year-to-date, buoyed by ETF inflows and dollar weakness, it hasn't acted decisively as either a safe haven or a risk asset this week.

“Bitcoin seems stuck between two worlds,” said FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich. “It's not reacting to rising risk appetite, nor surging like gold during heightened conflict.”

A COVID-era feature that characterized the bull run in all corners of financial markets, including bitcoin BTC$104,322.65, has made a comeback in Switzerland, one of the most financial powerhouses of the world.

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) cut its interest rate to zero on Thursday, to counter falling inflation, appreciating Swiss franc (CHF) and economic uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's trade war.

The return to zero comes as tariffs threaten to deflate nations with trade surplus, such as Switzerland and China.

The latest rate cut is bank's sixth straight move since it started reducing borrowing costs in March 2024.

The SNB's return to zero may be a sign of things to come across Europe and other advanced nations. A broad based return to zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) may bode well for bitcoin.

By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)Bitcoin BTC$104,322.65 remains stable around $105,000 after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, as expected. It hasn't traded below the psychological threshold of $100,000 since May 8, a full 42 days ago, even though the Israel-Iran conflict — now coming up for a week — would have been expected to weigh on risky investments, crypto among them.

Alongside the interest-rate decision, the Fed also signaled slower economic growth, with GDP now expected to rise just 1.4% this year, down from 1.7%, and higher inflation. The much-watched dot plot showed policymakers see fewer rate cuts through 2027 than they did in March.

What seems to be underpinning the largest cryptocurrency, and crypto markets in general, is the bitcoin treasury narrative. A notable rotation appears to be underway, with an ever growing number of companies committing to buying it as a treasury asset.

The total number of known publicly traded holders has increased to 129, and when private companies and sovereign entities are included, the total has reached 235. That's an increase of 27 entities in just 30 days. 

Geopolitical tensions remain elevated in the Middle East. Israel said it launched airstrikes on nuclear-weapons related targets near Arak and Natanz and an Iranian missile attack scored a direct hit on the Soroka Hospital in southern Israel early this morning. In response, Israel's defense minister pledged further escalation of hostilities. 

Brent crude rose 1% to $77.45, its highest level since January, adding upward pressure on global energy and food prices. European stock indexes and U.S. equity index futures fell.

 A leak of 16 billion passwords from services including Apple, Google and Facebook poses serious risks for crypto holders. 

A massive trove of more than 16 billion login credentials from leading online service providers, including Apple, Google and Facebook, was leaked, with potential consequences for crypto holders.

According to a Friday report, the Cybernews research team reviewed “30 exposed data sets containing from tens of millions to over 3.5 billion records each.” All together, that came around to “a humongous 16 billion exposed login credentials.”

“None of the exposed data sets were reported previously, bar one […] a ‘mysterious database' with 184 million records,” the report reads. Most of the databases contained an average of 550 million entries, while the smallest held over 16 million.

Cybernews warned that this could serve as the basis for “mass exploitation” by providing “fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” Most of the data was reportedly exposed by unsecured Elasticsearch or object-storage instances.

Cybernews said the data allows access to “pretty much any online service imaginable, from Apple, Facebook and Google, to GitHub, Telegram and various government services.” The data also includes infostealer dumps, including tokens, cookies and metadata, making it particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multifactor authentication.

According to the report, the original owner of the data is unclear. Still, “it's virtually guaranteed that some of the leaked data sets were owned by cybercriminals.”

The cryptocurrency industry may face serious fallout as a result of the leak. Security analysts expect a rise in targeted account takeover attempts using leaked credentials, particularly against custodial wallets or platforms tied to email access.  

Some wallets also use password-based seed-phrase backups stored in cloud services, which could allow attackers to attempt to obtain the private keys.

Depending on the extent and success of those attacks, exchanges may decide to request that users change their passwords or take more drastic measures to prevent asset loss. 

The breach also highlights persistent issues such as password reuse and weak authentication practices. Crypto users should immediately update passwords, enable 2FA, and avoid storing recovery phrases in unsecured digital environments.

 A similar OBV divergence in March–April 2025 triggered a 57% Bitcoin rally, reinforcing strong accumulation signals for the current setup. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin's OBV is rising despite price consolidation, signaling hidden accumulation.

A similar OBV divergence in March–April preceded a 57% BTC price rally.

A confirmed bull flag breakout could send Bitcoin toward $130,000-135,000 by Q3 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a range between $102,000 and $112,000 since May, but its on-balance volume (OBV) continues to trend upward, hinting at more gains ahead.

The price-OBV divergence is signaling growing “buying pressure,” according to market analyst Cas Abbé, who expects a rising OBV will assist in sending BTC's price toward the $130,000–$135,000 area by Q3 2025. 

The OBV indicator tracks volume to determine whether buyers or sellers are in control. It adds volume on days when the price closes higher and subtracts it on down days. So, a rising OBV means that total buying volume outpaces selling volume. 

In Bitcoin's case, the OBV has continued to make higher highs since early May, even as price has largely consolidated sideways ever since. From a technical perspective, such a divergence suggests that demand is building under the surface.

Historical price action shows that Bitcoin tends to break out strongly when rising OBV confirms underlying buying pressure during periods of price consolidation.

Between March and April 2025, BTC was trading sideways between $76,000 and $84,000, when OBV started forming higher lows. The divergence was followed by a 57% rally, with BTC hitting over $110,000 by May.

The fractal could validate analyst Cas Abbé's view that a move toward $130,000–$135,000 may occur in Q3 2025 if it plays out as intended.

Bitcoin appears to be forming a classic bull flag pattern, a continuation setup that typically appears after strong upward moves, followed by a period of consolidation.

On the daily chart, BTC's surge to nearly $112,000 in May from around $93,670 established the “flagpole.” Since then, price has been consolidating downward inside a parallel channel, forming the “flag.”

This structure suggests that BTC may be gearing up for another leg higher. That would place Bitcoin's breakout target around $130,000, aligning closely with Cas Abbé's forecast for Q3 2025.

The bull flag target aligns with the predictions of several market analysts, including Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz, who sees Bitcoin hitting $130,000-150,000 owing to strong institutional flows and a weaker dollar.

Analyst Stockmoney Lizards, among other analysts, anticipate the Bitcoin price to rise even higher, eyeing a year-end target of $200,000.

 Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano says Coinbase's stock surge indicates that “Wall Street wants Bitcoin and crypto assets.” 

Coinbase and Circle shares surged Wednesday after US lawmakers signaled support for clearer stablecoin regulation by pushing through the GENIUS Act for House approval.

On Wednesday, Coinbase (COIN), listed on the Nasdaq, closed the trading day up 16.32% to $295.29, while Circle (CRCL), listed on the NYSE, rose 33.82% to close at $199.59, according to Google Finance data.

The rally followed Tuesday's 68-30 Senate vote in favor of the GENIUS Act, passed just six weeks after it was introduced by Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty. 

Many in the crypto market see this as a bullish sign for the industry, marking a significant step toward creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday to get the GENIUS Act to his desk “ASAP — NO DELAYS,” while White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks thanked Trump for delivering on his “promise to make the USA the crypto capital of the planet.”

Circle, the issuer of USDC (USDC) — the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization — is set to benefit from the bill, as most of its revenue comes from interest earned on the reserves backing USDC, which it co-founded in partnership with Coinbase in October 2018.

Following the stock surge, crypto trader Genco said that the market is “slowly discovering that Coinbase gets 50% of $CRCL revenue generated from USDC [and] 100% of revenue from USDC on Coinbase platform [and] an equity stake.”

“It's a Stablecoin Summer,” Genco said, acknowledging the Genius Act being passed by the Senate. “This will be the most obvious play in retrospect. ” Crypto analyst TylerD added, “CRCL is the talk of the town.”

Meanwhile, crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano pointed to Coinbase's stock surge as a signal that “Wall Street wants Bitcoin and crypto assets.”

Coinbase stock's all-time high is $357, reached in November 2021 amid a broader crypto market rally that saw Bitcoin (BTC) hit new highs of $69,000. 

At the time of publication, Bitcoin's current high is $111,970, which it reached on May 22.

While Coinbase has been publicly listed since April 2021, Circle has only been public for a few weeks.

On June 5, Circle made a strong entry onto the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with its shares climbing 167% in its first trading session.

Some crypto market participants think this could be the start of more stablecoin companies going public, but others aren't so sure it will go well.

On Monday, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes warned that most new public stablecoin companies will be overvalued and fail. Hayes also claimed that Circle's stock price is “insanely overvalued.”

 Chainalysis's head of national security intelligence told Cointelegraph the curfew is likely an attempt to prevent people from transferring capital out of the country. 

The central bank of Iran has reportedly imposed strict operating hours on its domestic crypto exchanges following a $100 million exploit on Nobitex by a pro-Israel hacker group.

In a blog post on Wednesday, Chainalysis cited reports saying domestic crypto exchanges in Iran are now limited to operating hours between 10 am and 8 pm. 

Chainalysis's head of national security intelligence, Andrew Fierman, told Cointelegraph the curfew is likely an attempt to stay on top of any further attacks, because “incidents are easier to triage if they're not happening in the middle of the night.” 

Nobitex was hacked on Wednesday morning, according to the exchange. 

“Secondly, while the people of Iran leverage cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate cross-border transactions, the Iranian regime may want to assert more control over their citizens' transactions,” Fierman said. 

Iran's central bank has imposed restrictions on exchanges before. In December, it ordered a temporary shutdown of all crypto exchanges to prevent its national currency, the Iranian Rial, from being exchanged and depreciating further. 

Israel launched multiple strikes inside Iran on June 13. The two countries have been trading blows ever since. 

Nobitex was exploited for at least $100 million in assets based on current estimates, spanning a range of crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL). 

Pro-Israel hacker crew Gonjeshke Darande has claimed responsibility for the exploit after allegedly infiltrating Nobitex's internal systems and draining its hot wallets. 

The Chainalysis team said in the report that it appears the attacker-controlled wallets were burner addresses lacking private key access, “making them irretrievable.” 

“While hacks historically have almost always been for financial gain, this event stands out given the intent appears to have been politically motivated to take funds away from the regime,” Fierman said. 

Burning tokens means they are permanently removed from circulation. Generally, this is achieved by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. 

Following the hack, Nobitex severed all external access to its servers, the communication team said in a statement to X on Wednesday. 

“As part of Nobitex's ongoing response to the recent security incident, we would like to inform our users that the situation is now under control,” they said. 

At the moment, user access is still unavailable, but the exchange said the Nobitex Reserve Fund will cover all assets lost in the hack. 

The Nobitex technical team is also emptying the exchange's online hot wallets and sending them to offline cold storage devices to prevent further exploits and losses. 

“In addition, the internet disruptions and blocked access to external servers may result in a longer-than-usual timeline for restoring user access to the platform,” the Nobitex communication team said.

Chainalysis said it tracked Nobitex's total inflows and found it has well over $11 billion, compared to just under $7.5 billion for the next ten largest Iranian exchanges combined. 

It is the go-to platform for Iranian users seeking access to global crypto markets and is a central pillar of the country's digital asset ecosystem, according to Chainalysis.

“Nobitex isn't just a local exchange; it serves as a critical hub within Iran's heavily sanctioned crypto ecosystem, enabling access to global markets for users cut off from traditional finance,” Chainalysis said. 

The exchange also has links to a range of groups considered terrorists in the Western world, such as the Houthi rebels in Yemen, a pro-al-Qaeda propaganda channel, and sanctioned Russian crypto exchanges, Garantex and Bitpapa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","An Algorithm Designed an Engine So Efficient, It Gets You 88 Miles Per Gallon","https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a65090622/geely-ai-hybrid-car/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The AI-assisted, plug-in hybrid system will improve efficiency to extend the usage of both the engine and the battery pack.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story.

Humans are currently attempting to leverage the power of AI for everything from tracking the bathroom habits or our cats to enhancing the United States Air Force's mission effectiveness. And recently, it has been used in an attempt to optimize the engine under the hood of your car. Geely, a Chinese automaker, claims that the use of AI algorithms in its hybrid system could extend their battery pack's lifespan by up to 15 percent. 

Somewhat unsurprisingly, Geely is pretty tight-lipped about how its Leishen AI Hybrid 2.0 system leverages AI to produce such a significant increase in efficiency. Parsing through press materials from as early as 2021 only reveals that AI tech helped to extend the maintenance intervals for both the internal-combustion engine and the battery pack.

Thankfully, many other components contribute to Geely's astronomical thermal efficiency figure, including seven friction-reduction technologies, a variable displacement oil pump, and optimized intelligent thermal management. (Thermal efficiency is a way to measure how effectively a device converts thermal energy into useful work—horsepower, in this case.) The end result is a system that produces a quoted efficiency of 2.67 L/100 km, which translates to just above 88 mpg.

BYD, one of Geely's biggest competitors in the Chinese automotive industry, is currently only able to reach 46.06% efficiency with its DM-i system. For context, this thermal efficiency number means that BYD's system can only manage to eke out 6.4 L/100 km of  fuel consumption—just under 36.7 mpg. It's clear that Geely is on top when it comes to overall efficiency, but obviously, there are a number of other metrics we could use to compare the two automakers. We also have to look at factors like charge times and the list prices of the vehicles that both automakers bring to the table.

BYD's Han DM plug-in hybrid starts at just above $31,400 USD, while Geely's Galaxy A7—potentially its first production car to feature the new technology—is expected to have a much more reasonable MSRP of around $14,000. Other competitors in the Chinese automotive industry include NIO, XPeng, Li Auto, and even Tesla.

Geely's Galaxy M9 SUV will be another of the brand's vehicles to use their latest and greatest hybrid system. Along with its new AI-powered underpinnings, the M9 will also lean on AI tech to improve power delivery, allowing the hybrid SUV to sprint to 100 kph (62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds. Pretty impressive.

In the more distant future, Geely is also planning to adapt the Leishein AI Hybrid 2.0 to run on hydrogen. While hydrogen is much less accessible than gasoline, it could potentially boost the engine's thermal efficiency from 47.26 % to 48.15 %. Car News China reports that we could potentially see the hydrogen powertrain in use as early as Q4 2025.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The Earth is home to incredibly remarkable and diverse biomes that host millions of species worldwide. (George Lucas managed to create an entire galaxy far, far away for Star Wars using just the natural wonders mostly found in the state of California.) Although life appears relatively well-distributed across countries and continents—barring Antarctica, of course—a new study suggests that biodiversity isn't so much an evenly distributed blanket across the planet as it is a “core-to-transition” organization. 

This is the insight gleaned from a new article—published earlier this month in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution—analyzing how organisms are divided into biogeographical regions, or bioregions, across the planet's surface. An international team of scientists from Sweden, Spain, and the U.K. examined the global distribution maps of species across a variety of limbs on the tree of life, including amphibians, birds, dragonflies, mammals, marine rays, reptiles, and even trees. Because of this vast swath of differing types of life, the researchers expected that species distribution would vary wildly due to environmental and historical factors. 

However, what they discovered is that life all around the world proliferates through a very similar process. First, there is a core area where life appears to flourish, and from there, species tend to radiate outward—hence “core-to-transition” organization. 

“In every bioregion, there is always a core area where most species live,” Rubén Bernardo-Madrid, a co-author of the study from Umeå University, said in a press statement. “From that core, species expand into surrounding areas, but only a subset manages to persist. It seems these cores provide optimal conditions for species survival and diversification, acting as a source from which biodiversity radiates outward.”

These “core” regions are immensely important, as they only cover about 30 percent of the world's surface but contain more biodiversity than the other 70 percent. These regions likely evolved because they were originally refuges from the devistation brought on by past climatic events, such as the Last Glacial Maximum. The study also shows that overall species must be well adapted for heat and drought to colonize new areas beyond these core bioregions. 

“The predictability of the pattern and its association with environmental filters can help to better understand how biodiversity may respond to global change,” Joaquín Calatayud, co-author of the study from  Rey Juan Carlos University, said in a press statement.

Of course, this core-to-transition organization idea isn't a new one. Biogeographers have largely illustrated this phenomenon over the centuries, but this is the first time that empirical evidence has confirmed these long-standing suspicions. Understanding the relationship between life and these bioregions can help inform conservation decisions while predicting how certain species may respond to a new type of climatic uncertainty—anthropogenic climate change. 

“Our core-to-transition hypothesis and results,” the authors wrote, “show that global variations in species richness can be better understood by unravelling the genesis of regional hotspots and the subsequent filtering of species to the rest of the biogeographical region.”

Most treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) only slow disease progression. Early intervention for the neurological disease that worsens over time is therefore critical to optimize care, but that requires early diagnosis. Current tests, like clinical rating scales and neural imaging, can be subjective and costly. Now, researchers in ACS' Analytical Chemistry report the initial development of a system that inexpensively screens for PD from the odors in a person's earwax.

Previous research has shown that changes in sebum, an oily substance secreted by the skin, could help identify people with PD. Specifically, sebum from people with PD may have a characteristic smell because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by sebum are altered by disease progression -- including neurodegeneration, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, when sebum on the skin is exposed to environmental factors like air pollution and humidity, its composition can be altered, making it an unreliable testing medium. But the skin inside the ear canal is kept away from the elements. So, Hao Dong, Danhua Zhu and colleagues wanted to focus their PD screening efforts on ear wax, which mostly consists of sebum and is easily sampled.

To identify potential VOCs related to PD in ear wax, the researchers swabbed the ear canals of 209 human subjects (108 of whom were diagnosed with PD). They analyzed the collected secretions using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. Four of the VOCs the researchers found in ear wax from people with PD were significantly different than the ear wax from people without the disease. They concluded that these four VOCs, including ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane, are potential biomarkers for PD.

Dong, Zhu and colleagues then trained an artificial intelligence olfactory (AIO) system with their ear wax VOC data. The resulting AIO-based screening model categorized with 94% accuracy ear wax samples from people with and without PD. The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care.

""This method is a small-scale single-center experiment in China,"" says Dong. ""The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value.""

Astronomers have created a galactic masterpiece: an ultra-detailed image that reveals previously unseen features in the Sculptor Galaxy. Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), they observed this nearby galaxy in thousands of colors simultaneously. By capturing vast amounts of data at every single location, they created a galaxy-wide snapshot of the lives of stars within Sculptor.

""Galaxies are incredibly complex systems that we are still struggling to understand,"" says ESO researcher Enrico Congiu, who led a new Astronomy & Astrophysics study on Sculptor. Reaching hundreds of thousands of light-years across, galaxies are extremely large, but their evolution depends on what's happening at much smaller scales. ""The Sculptor Galaxy is in a sweet spot,"" says Congiu. ""It is close enough that we can resolve its internal structure and study its building blocks with incredible detail, but at the same time, big enough that we can still see it as a whole system.""

A galaxy's building blocks  -- stars, gas and dust  -- emit light at different colors. Therefore, the more shades of color there are in an image of a galaxy, the more we can learn about its inner workings. While conventional images contain only a handful of colors, this new Sculptor map comprises thousands. This tells astronomers everything they need to know about the stars, gas and dust within, such as their age, composition, and motion.

To create this map of the Sculptor Galaxy, which is 11 million light-years away and is also known as NGC 253, the researchers observed it for over 50 hours with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on ESO's VLT. The team had to stitch together over 100 exposures to cover an area of the galaxy about 65,000 light-years wide.

According to co-author Kathryn Kreckel from Heidelberg University, Germany, this makes the map a potent tool: ""We can zoom in to study individual regions where stars form at nearly the scale of individual stars, but we can also zoom out to study the galaxy as a whole.""

In their first analysis of the data, the team uncovered around 500 planetary nebulae, regions of gas and dust cast off from dying Sun-like stars, in the Sculptor Galaxy. Co-author Fabian Scheuermann, a doctoral student at Heidelberg University, puts this number into context: ""Beyond our galactic neighborhood, we usually deal with fewer than 100 detections per galaxy.""

Because of the properties of planetary nebulae, they can be used as distance markers to their host galaxies. ""Finding the planetary nebulae allows us to verify the distance to the galaxy -- a critical piece of information on which the rest of the studies of the galaxy depend,"" says Adam Leroy, a professor at The Ohio State University, USA, and study co-author.

Future projects using the map will explore how gas flows, changes its composition, and forms stars all across this galaxy. ""How such small processes can have such a big impact on a galaxy whose entire size is thousands of times bigger is still a mystery,"" says Congiu.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Winter sea ice supercharges Southern Ocean's CO2 uptake","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250618094450.htm","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 04:47:31 GMT","

New research reveals the importance of winter sea ice in the year-to-year variability of the amount of atmospheric CO2 absorbed by a region of the Southern Ocean.

In years when sea ice lasts longer in winter, the ocean will overall absorb 20% more CO2 from the atmosphere than in years when sea ice forms late or disappears early. This is because sea ice protects the ocean from strong winter winds that drive mixing between the surface of the ocean and its deeper, carbon-rich layers.

The findings, based on data collected in a coastal system along the west Antarctic Peninsula, show that what happens in winter is crucial in explaining this variability in CO2 uptake.

The study was led by scientists at the University of East Anglia (UEA), in collaboration with colleagues from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI, Germany), British Antarctic Survey (BAS, UK) and Institute of Marine Research (IMR, Norway). It is published today in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.

The global ocean takes up about a quarter of all CO2 that humans emit into the atmosphere. The Southern Ocean is responsible for about 40% of this and the researchers wanted to know why it varies so much from year to year.

Lead author Dr Elise Droste, of UEA's School of Environmental Sciences, said: ""Our picture of the Southern Ocean's carbon cycle is incomplete, and so we cannot predict whether its atmospheric CO2 uptake - and therefore its contribution to climate change mitigation - will increase, decrease, or remain the same in the future.

""Whatever it does, it will affect what our climate will look like and how fast it will change. To improve predictions, our work suggests that we need to look at how sea ice affects the exchange of carbon between the deep and shallow parts of the ocean. To do this, we need more wintertime observations in the Southern Ocean.""

Much of the Southern Ocean surrounding the west Antarctic Peninsula is covered by sea ice in winter, which disappears in spring and summer. In spring and summer, phytoplankton growth and melt water lead to low CO2 concentrations at the ocean surface. This allows the Southern Ocean to absorb large amounts of atmospheric CO2, significantly reducing the global impact of anthropogenic emissions.

In winter, as sea ice forms, the ocean underneath mixes with deeper waters that contain lots of 'natural' carbon that has been in the ocean for centuries. This can cause CO2 at the ocean surface to increase to the point where it can be released into the atmosphere.

Sea ice blocks a large amount of this CO2 'outgassing'. However, it is part of the natural seasonal cycle that some CO2 does escape the ocean. This seasonal balance means that the total amount of CO2 absorbed by the Southern Ocean within one year often depends on how much CO2 is absorbed in summer and how much is released in winter.

""We don't have a good grasp on what is driving this year-to-year variability, which is making it difficult to fully understand the system and to improve the predictability of how the ocean's CO2 uptake will change in the future,"" said Dr Droste. ""One major reason is because we have relatively little data on the Southern Ocean, particularly in the wintertime.

""It is extremely challenging to collect observations in the harsh weather and sea conditions of the Southern Ocean, not to mention sea ice cover making much of it inaccessible, even for the strongest icebreaker. However, this study takes us a step in the right direction.""

The study draws on data for 2010-2020, a time series led and maintained by BAS, which collects year-round measurements along the west Antarctic Peninsula. At Rothera, the UK's Antarctic research station, ocean scientists measured physical aspects of the seawater in Ryder Bay and collected samples for nutrient and CO2 analysis, carried out at both Rothera and UEA.

Using other physical and chemical data collected at the same time, the team was able to study why years with long sea ice duration differed from those with short sea ice duration.

Dr Hugh Venables, from BAS, said: ""A series of ocean scientists have wintered at Rothera on the Antarctic Peninsula to collect these and other samples, from either a small boat or a sea ice sledge, to build a unique time series of year-round oceanographic conditions for the last 25 years.

""This important result shows the importance of this winter sampling and will hopefully lead to more year-round sampling in the Southern Ocean, both by humans and autonomous technology.""

Prof Dorothee Bakker, Professor in Marine Biogeochemistry at UEA, added: ""The fact that this data has been collected throughout the year at the same location allows us to investigate which mechanisms are important to explain the year-to-year variability of CO2 uptake by the ocean at this particular location, but we can also use these insights to better understand how the rest of the Southern Ocean works.""

The study also involved scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography and Applied Geophysics (Italy) and University of Gothenburg (Sweden). It was supported by funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council and European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.

No matter which questions we ask an AI, the model will come up with an answer. To produce this information - regardless of whether than answer is correct or not - the model uses tokens. Tokens are words or parts of words that are converted into a string of numbers that can be processed by the LLM.

This conversion, as well as other computing processes, produce CO2 emissions. Many users, however, are unaware of the substantial carbon footprint associated with these technologies. Now, researchers in Germany measured and compared CO2 emissions of different, already trained, LLMs using a set of standardized questions.

""The environmental impact of questioning trained LLMs is strongly determined by their reasoning approach, with explicit reasoning processes significantly driving up energy consumption and carbon emissions,"" said first author Maximilian Dauner, a researcher at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences and first author of the Frontiers in Communication study. ""We found that reasoning-enabled models produced up to 50 times more CO2 emissions than concise response models.""

'Thinking' AI causes most emissions

The researchers evaluated 14 LLMs ranging from seven to 72 billion parameters on 1,000 benchmark questions across diverse subjects. Parameters determine how LLMs learn and process information.

Reasoning models, on average, created 543.5 'thinking' tokens per questions, whereas concise models required just 37.7 tokens per question. Thinking tokens are additional tokens that reasoning LLMs generate before producing an answer. A higher token footprint always means higher CO2 emissions. It doesn't, however, necessarily mean the resulting answers are more correct, as elaborate detail that is not always essential for correctness.

The most accurate model was the reasoning-enabled Cogito model with 70 billion parameters, reaching 84.9% accuracy. The model produced three times more CO2 emissions than similar sized models that generated concise answers. ""Currently, we see a clear accuracy-sustainability trade-off inherent in LLM technologies,"" said Dauner. ""None of the models that kept emissions below 500 grams of CO2 equivalent achieved higher than 80% accuracy on answering the 1,000 questions correctly."" CO2 equivalent is the unit used to measure the climate impact of various greenhouse gases.

Subject matter also resulted in significantly different levels of CO2 emissions. Questions that required lengthy reasoning processes, for example abstract algebra or philosophy, led to up to six times higher emissions than more straightforward subjects, like high school history.

Practicing thoughtful use 

The researchers said they hope their work will cause people to make more informed decisions about their own AI use. ""Users can significantly reduce emissions by prompting AI to generate concise answers or limiting the use of high-capacity models to tasks that genuinely require that power,"" Dauner pointed out.

Choice of model, for instance, can make a significant difference in CO2 emissions. For example, having DeepSeek R1 (70 billion parameters) answer 600,000 questions would create CO2 emissions equal to a round-trip flight from London to New York. Meanwhile, Qwen 2.5 (72 billion parameters) can answer more than three times as many questions (about 1.9 million) with similar accuracy rates while generating the same emissions.

The researchers said that their results may be impacted by the choice of hardware used in the study, an emission factor that may vary regionally depending on local energy grid mixes, and the examined models. These factors may limit the generalizability of the results.

""If users know the exact CO2 cost of their AI-generated outputs, such as casually turning themselves into an action figure, they might be more selective and thoughtful about when and how they use these technologies,"" Dauner concluded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The AI that writes climate-friendly cement recipes in seconds","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250619035502.htm","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:55:38 GMT","

AI paves the way towards green cement

The cement industry produces around eight percent of global CO2 emissions - more than the entire aviation sector worldwide. Researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have developed an AI-based model that helps to accelerate the discovery of new cement formulations that could yield the same material quality with a better carbon footprint.

The rotary kilns in cement plants are heated to a scorching 1,400 degrees Celsius to burn ground limestone down to clinker, the raw material for ready-to-use cement. Unsurprisingly, such temperatures typically can't be achieved with electricity alone. They are the result of energy-intensive combustion processes that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). What may be surprising, however, is that the combustion process accounts for less than half of these emissions, far less. The majority is contained in the raw materials needed to produce clinker and cement: CO2 that is chemically bound in the limestone is released during its transformation in the high-temperature kilns.

One promising strategy for reducing emissions is to modify the cement recipe itself - replacing some of the clinker with alternative cementitious materials. That is exactly what an interdisciplinary team in the Laboratory for Waste Management in PSI's Center for Nuclear Engineering and Sciences has been investigating. Instead of relying solely on time-consuming experiments or complex simulations, the researchers developed a modelling approach based on machine learning. ""This allows us to simulate and optimise cement formulations so that they emit significantly less CO2 while maintaining the same high level of mechanical performance,"" explains mathematician Romana Boiger, first author of the study. ""Instead of testing thousands of variations in the lab, we can use our model to generate practical recipe suggestions within seconds - it's like having a digital cookbook for climate-friendly cement.""

With their novel approach, the researchers were able to selectively filter out those cement formulations that could meet the desired criteria. ""The range of possibilities for the material composition - which ultimately determines the final properties - is extraordinarily vast,"" says Nikolaos Prasianakis head of the Transport Mechanisms Research Group at PSI, who was the initiator and co-author of the study. ""Our method allows us to significantly accelerate the development cycle by selecting promising candidates for further experimental investigation."" The results of the study were published in the journal Materials and Structures.

The right recipe

Already today, industrial by-products such as slag from iron production and fly ash from coal-fired power plants are already being used to partially replace clinker in cement formulations and thus reduce CO2 emissions. However, the global demand for cement is so enormous that these materials alone cannot meet the need. ""What we need is the right combination of materials that are available in large quantities and from which high-quality, reliable cement can be produced,"" says John Provis, head of the Cement Systems Research Group at PSI and co-author of the study.

Finding such combinations, however, is challenging: ""Cement is basically a mineral binding agent - in concrete, we use cement, water, and gravel to artificially create minerals that hold the entire material together,"" Provis explains. ""You could say we're doing geology in fast motion."" This geology - or rather, the set of physical processes behind it - is enormously complex, and modelling it on a computer is correspondingly computationally intensive and expensive. That is why the research team is relying on artificial intelligence.

AI as computational accelerator

Artificial neural networks are computer models that are trained, using existing data, to speed up complex calculations. During training, the network is fed a known data set and learns from it by adjusting the relative strength or ""weighting"" of its internal connections so that it can quickly and reliably predict similar relationships. This weighting serves as a kind of shortcut - a faster alternative to otherwise computationally intensive physical modelling.

The researchers at PSI also made use of such a neural network. They themselves generated the data required for training: ""With the help of the open-source thermodynamic modelling software GEMS, developed at PSI, we calculated - for various cement formulations - which minerals form during hardening and which geochemical processes take place,"" explains Nikolaos Prasianakis. By combining these results with experimental data and mechanical models, the researchers were able to derive a reliable indicator for mechanical properties - and thus for the material quality of the cement. For each component used, they also applied a corresponding CO2 factor, a specific emission value that made it possible to determine the total CO2 emissions. ""That was a very complex and computationally intensive modelling exercise,"" the scientist says.

But it was worth the effort - with the data generated in this way, the AI model was able to learn. ""Instead of seconds or minutes, the trained neural network can now calculate mechanical properties for an arbitrary cement recipe in milliseconds - that is, around a thousand times faster than with traditional modelling,"" Boiger explains.

From output to input

How can this AI now be used to find optimal cement formulations - with the lowest possible CO2 emissions and high material quality? One possibility would be to try out various formulations, use the AI model to calculate their properties, and then select the best variants. A more efficient approach, however, is to reverse the process. Instead of trying out all options, ask the question the other way around: Which cement composition meets the desired specifications regarding CO2 balance and material quality?

Both the mechanical properties and the CO2 emissions depend directly on the recipe. ""Viewed mathematically, both variables are functions of the composition - if this changes, the respective properties also change,"" the mathematician explains. To determine an optimal recipe, the researchers formulate the problem as a mathematical optimisation task: They are looking for a composition that simultaneously maximises mechanical properties and minimises CO2 emissions. ""Basically, we are looking for a maximum and a minimum - from this we can directly deduce the desired formulation,"" the mathematician says.

To find the solution, the team integrated in the workflow an additional AI technology, the so-called genetic algorithms - computer-assisted methods inspired by natural selection. This enabled them to selectively identify formulations that ideally combine the two target variables.

The advantage of this ""reverse approach"": You no longer have to blindly test countless recipes and then evaluate their resulting properties; instead you can specifically search for those that meet specific desired criteria - in this case, maximum mechanical properties with minimum CO2 emissions.

Interdisciplinary approach with great potential

Among the cement formulations identified by the researchers, there are already some promising candidates. ""Some of these formulations have real potential,"" says John Provis, ""not only in terms of CO2 reduction and quality, but also in terms of practical feasibility in production."" To complete the development cycle, however, the recipes must first be tested in the laboratory. ""We're not going to build a tower with them right away without testing them first,"" Nikolaos Prasianakis says with a smile.

The study primarily serves as a proof of concept - that is, as evidence that promising formulations can be identified purely by mathematical calculation. ""We can extend our AI modelling tool as required and integrate additional aspects, such as the production or availability of raw materials, or where the building material is to be used - for example, in a marine environment, where cement and concrete behave differently, or even in the desert,"" says Romana BoigerNikolaos Prasianakis is already looking ahead: ""This is just the beginning. The time savings offered by such a general workflow are enormous - making it a very promising approach for all sorts of material and system designs.""

Without the interdisciplinary background of the researchers, the project would never have come to fruition: ""We needed cement chemists, thermodynamics experts, AI specialists - and a team that could bring all of this together,"" Prasianakis says. ""Added to this was the important exchange with other research institutions such as EMPA within the framework of the SCENE project."" SCENE (the Swiss Centre of Excellence on Net Zero Emissions) is an interdisciplinary research programme that aims to develop scientifically sound solutions for drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions in industry and the energy supply. The study was carried out as part of this project.

A team of cognitive psychologists from the Michigan State University Department of Psychology have received a $860,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research to develop assessments for identifying people who are good at performing complex procedural tasks, even under challenging conditions like sleep deprivation and frequent interruptions.

""If we develop the right tools, we can identify people who are going to be better at performing a wide range of procedures. This is important because Navy personnel are increasingly called upon to do lots of different tasks as military systems become more complex,"" said Erik Altmann, lead investigator of the study and professor in MSU's psychology department. ""The goal is to get the right person in the right job at the right time.""

This multiyear study will look at individual differences in placekeeping, which is the cognitive ability to remember what step you are on in a procedural sequence. The researchers will also test whether incorporating task interruptions during training can help personnel develop cognitive strategies for placekeeping during deployment, when personnel may be sleep-deprived.

""We know that under conditions of sleep deprivation, people make more procedural errors, especially when they're interrupted in the middle of a task. Procedural errors can be catastrophic, so the Navy is interested in reducing them,"" said Altmann.

The research team, which also includes cognitive psychologists Kimberly Fenn and Zach Hambrick, has been funded since 2016 by the Office of Naval Research, with past studies looking at multitasking and the effect of sleep on cognitive performance.

The results of this study could improve personnel selection and classification in the Navy and in other fields where procedural accuracy is critical; results also could suggest approaches to training that make people more resilient to effects of stressors like sleep deprivation and task interruption.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Massive thread of hot gas found linking galaxies — and it's 10 times the mass of the Milky Way","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250619035510.htm","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 08:54:47 GMT","

Astronomers have discovered a huge filament of hot gas bridging four galaxy clusters. At 10 times as massive as our galaxy, the thread could contain some of the Universe's 'missing' matter, addressing a decades-long mystery.

The astronomers used the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and JAXA's Suzaku X-ray space telescopes to make the discovery.

Over one-third of the 'normal' matter in the local Universe - the visible stuff making up stars, planets, galaxies, life - is missing. It hasn't yet been seen, but it's needed to make our models of the cosmos work properly.

Said models suggest that this elusive matter might exist in long strings of gas, or filaments, bridging the densest pockets of space. While we've spotted filaments before, it's tricky to make out their properties; they're typically faint, making it difficult to isolate their light from that of any galaxies, black holes, and other objects lying nearby.

New research is now one ofthe first to do just this, finding and accurately characterizing a single filament of hot gas stretching between four clusters of galaxies in the nearby Universe.

""For the first time, our results closely match what we see in our leading model of the cosmos - something that's not happened before,"" says lead researcher Konstantinos Migkas of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. ""It seems that the simulations were right all along.""

XMM-Newton on the case

Clocking in at over 10 million degrees, the filament contains around 10 times the mass of the Milky Way and connects four galaxy clusters: two on one end, two on the other. All are part of the Shapley Supercluster, a collection of more than 8000 galaxies that forms one of the most massive structures in the nearby Universe.

The filament stretches diagonally away from us through the supercluster for 23 million light-years, the equivalent of traversing the Milky Way end to end around 230 times.

Konstantinos and colleagues characterized the filament by combining X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Suzaku, and digging into optical data from several others.

The two X-ray telescopes were ideal partners. Suzaku mapped the filament's faint X-ray light over a wide region of space, while XMM-Newton pinpointed very precisely contaminating sources of X-rays - namely, supermassive black holes - lying within the filament.

""Thanks to XMM-Newton we could identify and remove these cosmic contaminants, so we knew we were looking at the gas in the filament and nothing else,"" adds co-author Florian Pacaud of the University of Bonn, Germany. ""Our approach was really successful, and reveals that the filament is exactly as we'd expect from our best large-scale simulations of the Universe.""

Not truly missing

As well as revealing a huge and previously unseen thread of matter running through the nearby cosmos, the finding shows how some of the densest and most extreme structures in the Universe - galaxy clusters - are connected over colossal distances.

It also sheds light on the very nature of the 'cosmic web', the vast, invisible cobweb of filaments that underpins the structure of everything we see around us.

""This research is a great example of collaboration between telescopes, and creates a new benchmark for how to spot the light coming from the faint filaments of the cosmic web,"" adds Norbert Schartel, ESA XMM-Newton Project Scientist.

""More fundamentally, it reinforces our standard model of the cosmos and validates decades of simulations: it seems that the 'missing' matter may truly be lurking in hard-to-see threads woven across the Universe.""

Piecing together an accurate picture of the cosmic web is the domain of ESA's Euclid mission. Launched in 2023, Euclid is exploring this web's structure and history. The mission is also digging deep into the nature of dark matter and energy - neither of which have ever been observed, despite accounting for a whopping 95% of the Universe - and working with other dark Universe detectives to solve some of the biggest and longest-standing cosmic mysteries.

Findings from clinical trials and other studies are summarized in systematic reviews, which guide policy decisions.Credit: Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty

Scientists say they have used artificial intelligence (AI) to reproduce 12 systematic reviews in two days — slashing the time it takes to produce these ‘gold-standard' studies, which bring together the results of multiple publications and normally take many months to do.

The new system, described in a preprint posted on medRxiv last week1, could help to accelerate the production of influential reviews used by doctors and policymakers, its developers say. Using large language models (LLMs) to accelerate two laborious steps in the systematic-review process allowed the team to rapidly reproduce a dozen Cochrane reviews — a particularly rigorous type of study — and even to update a review in just 20 minutes, says co-author Christian Cao, a medical student at the University of Toronto, Canada.

“It's crazy to see that in the time I get a coffee, a systematic review would be done,” says Cao. He and two of his collaborators have started a spin-off company called otto review to turn their methods into a commercial software platform.

But other researchers are sceptical that the technology can accelerate the process as much as its creators suggest. They point out that the team has not yet automated some major tasks, and that the system needs to be tested independently — which would require more details of the study to be released. “For a scientific paper, its claims need to be verifiable — and I can't verify it,” says James Thomas, a systematic-review specialist at University College London.

Systematic reviews are important because they can make sense of many academic studies such as clinical trials by combining their results. They underlie the guidelines used in medical practice worldwide and are increasingly used to guide decisions in policy, education and elsewhere.

But doing a systematic review is a chore. It involves searching academic databases to find potentially thousands of relevant studies, screening them to pull out the handful of most pertinent ones, assessing if they could be biased or untrustworthy, and extracting and analysing the data, often using a statistical technique called a metanalysis. The process takes months — sometimes years — and costs well over $100,000 per review, according to one estimate, which is why many systematic reviews are not kept up to date.

Researchers have long used software to help, but the last few years has seen a surge of interest in using LLMs to automate parts of the task. “This field is awash with hypey claims from companies,” says Justin Clark, who builds automated review tools at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia.

Metrics details

Many countries worldwide are transitioning from fossil fuel-dependent economies to carbon neutrality, driven by the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement. However, without considering the regional distribution of essential services like water and energy, this transition could inadvertently maintain or increase inequities, threatening sustainable development. Here, we argue that spatial equity of benefits should be considered in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector interdependencies and high service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan for regionally equitable climate-compatible futures. The multisector design framework combines integrated river basin-power system simulation with artificial intelligence design tools. The utility of the framework is demonstrated for Ghana by identifying the most efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios and their implied trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance. Case-study results show that an equitable low-carbon energy transition will require increased investments in renewable energy and transmission alongside more informed infrastructure system planning. With low renewable investments, equity can be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and electricity supply curtailments.

Reducing socio-economic inequalities is integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1,2. For instance, SDG 10 aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries1, and other goals stress equitable development globally1,2. However, more than 70% of the global population is experiencing growing socio-economic inequalities3, hindering progress towards sustainable development. Nearly 650 million people in the world still live in extreme poverty4, and around 30% of the global population is food insecure5. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, and the rising cost of living disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable people, who often have limited or no access to essential services3,4,6.

Several countries are transitioning from fossil fuel-driven economies to carbon neutrality to deliver on the SDGs1 and the Paris Agreement7, intending to limit global mean temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, meeting the SDGs and mitigating climate change without considering broader socio-economic implications of interventions could exacerbate inequalities8. For instance, climate mitigation actions are expected to yield long-term benefits across multiple SDGs9,10 but might have short-term trade-offs with other goals, like poverty reduction and inequality10,11. Inadequate planning for energy transitions could increase inequalities12,13,14,15,16,17, for example in access to water and electricity. Realising the SDGs is challenged by the complexity of involving multiple disciplines, sectors, and actors in decision-making18,19. Policy decisions aimed at achieving individual SDGs could create trade-offs with other SDGs9, and thus, policymakers should aim for an energy transition that creates synergies and balances trade-offs between societal goals20,21.

Increased access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is required to achieve the SDGs1,20,22. Electrification improves the quality of life and enables human development through better-equipped facilities for healthcare, education, and business17,22,23. However, over 700 million people globally do not have access to electricity, of whom more than 75% live in sub-Saharan Africa4,24. A renewables-based energy transition can help increase access to affordable and clean energy to meet the fast-growing energy demand and mitigate climate change4,24,25,26. Most countries included renewable energy targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)27,28,29. The renewable share of electricity generation rose by almost 8% between 2011 and 2021, and reached an installed capacity of 3146 gigawatts (GW), which accounts for 28% of the world's energy generation27. However, recent reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and REN21 suggest that the share of renewables in electricity generation must increase to more than 60% to achieve energy and climate goals by 203026,27.

Energy transitions can produce regional disparities in renewable energy access and job creation in developed countries12,13,14,15,30. Strategic regional planning can help avoid these inequalities while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many developing countries (those eligible for Official Development Assistance under the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)31) currently have high levels of disparities in (water and electricity) service provision. Planning low-carbon energy transitions in developing countries offers an opportunity to reduce these inequalities. The aspiration to consider equity in energy transitions is reflected in the recovery packages for recent global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rising energy costs, and inflation28,32. The African Union Green Recovery Action Plan aims to build more equitable, greener, and sustainable economies33. The USA Inflation Reduction Act34 includes a US$ (US dollars) 370 billion fund for renewable energy, climate crisis, and equity, and the Build Back Better plan35,36 aims to invest US$ 2 trillion in green and inclusive growth, including US$ 400 billion for clean energy and 40% of investment benefits for communities that are marginalised and underserved by infrastructure services37.

Energy systems are typically embedded within complex water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) systems, in which actions in one part of the system impact the others. Jointly managing these resources allows consideration of their cross-sectoral interdependencies, trade-offs, and synergies, and subsequently, the development of more sustainable infrastructure development pathways. So far, research has assessed distributional equity in the context of individual sectors. For instance, in the power sector, power system models have been used to assess the trade-offs between least-cost and regionally equitable allocation of solar and wind power plants in Germany15 and that of decentralised renewable energy sources in Switzerland14. Others considered electrification inequality in planning national power systems in sub-Saharan Africa16,17. A few studies evaluated inequality in access to water resources38,39,40. However, despite frequently high levels of co-dependence between resource systems, to our knowledge, equity has not been considered in designing multisector infrastructure systems to reduce regional benefit distribution inequities and carbon emissions while improving overall system performance and alleviating inter-sectoral conflicts across multiple resource systems.

In this paper, we argue for considering spatial equity of water and energy services in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector linkages and service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan national-scale equitable climate-compatible futures. The framework combines interlinked water resource and power systems simulators with artificial intelligence design tools. We demonstrate the framework using a case study of planning Ghana's future water-energy system for 2030-2040, identifying infrastructure intervention portfolios with efficient trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance.

Classically, energy infrastructure planning considers goals such as minimising electricity supply curtailment, capital investment, and carbon emissions41,42. Other approaches extend the goals to include water resources and ecosystems, such as maximising hydropower generation and minimising damage to river ecosystems43,44. While such methods can design infrastructure plans that improve system performance at an aggregate level, equity in the regional distribution of water and energy services has not been considered to our knowledge. In this paper, we build on a water resource and power system simulation and design framework introduced by ref. 43 and extend it to include spatial equity of water and energy services as infrastructure planning goals. The resulting framework (Fig. 1) has three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective planning to design equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning.

The framework includes three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search for equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning.

In the first component of the design framework, equity in regional benefit distribution is added as a policy objective of infrastructure planning, alongside other goals. We use the Gini index to quantify and minimise water and electricity access inequities. The Gini index is typically used to measure inequalities – ranging from zero (perfect equality) to one (total inequality). Our application of the index is designed to account for equity. For water supply, we apply the Gini index to water supplied relative to demand. For electricity supply, since some areas have lower electricity demand due to regional disparities in economic development, if the ratio of supply to demand were used, it would easily be satisfied. Instead, we apply the Gini index to electricity supplied per capita. While this does not account for inevitable variations in regional economic activities and lifestyles, it makes the most of available model outputs and allows incorporating a spatial measure of energy service equity into the framework. Intervention options that can be used to achieve the identified equity, environmental, and system performance goals are also selected in the first component of the framework. These interventions include infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies. The selected interventions are used in the second component of the framework to generate a set of efficient multisector infrastructure and operation portfolios using a simulation-based artificial intelligence search design process.

In the second component of the framework, an integrated river basin-power system simulator is used to represent spatial WEFE nexus dynamics43. The river system is modelled using a water resource system model45,46. The river system model represents water resources infrastructure (e.g., dams) using a network structure driven by water supplies (hydrological inflows) and demands (e.g., municipal and irrigation water requirements and hydropower) and system operating rules. The power system is modelled using a direct current optimal power flow model47. The power system model simulates network connectivity, different power generation types including renewable energy generators, and high time resolution electricity demand profiles. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented simulation framework48. This framework integrates the simulators at the model run timestep and coordinates their inputs and outputs to form a single simulation. The integrated WEFE infrastructure system simulator simulates managed rivers (with river inflows, existing and planned water storage reservoirs, hydropower, municipal water supply abstractions, irrigation, and flood recession agriculture) and energy systems (solar power, combined solar and storage, wind power, bioenergy, thermal power generators, electricity transmission lines, and electricity demands). The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to identify efficient intervention portfolios43.

In the third component of the framework, machine learning models, trained based on the search outputs (i.e., values of decision variables and objectives), are combined with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)49 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity, environmental, and system performance indicators. The SHAP analysis of intervention options helps stakeholders explore how changing infrastructure and resource allocation policy options influences intervention portfolios. Further details on the analytical framework are given in the Methods.

We use Ghana as a case study to demonstrate the importance of considering the spatial equity of water and energy services in designing equitable low-carbon futures. We use the framework above to design efficient power system intervention portfolios, including bioenergy, intermittent renewables (solar and wind), solar storage, and transmission lines, using projected electricity demands for 2030-2040. Figure 2 shows the regions of Ghana defined based on equally sized population groups. These regions are used to quantify spatial equity in water and energy access and to locate the energy infrastructure expansion options currently listed in Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. The electricity mix of Ghana comes from hydro (47%), gas (30%), and oil (23%)51. The installed capacity for existing hydropower is 1,580 megawatts (MW). The Pwalugu multi-purpose dam is under construction and will add an electricity generation capacity of 59 MW. The country's total thermal power installed capacity is 4325 MW50. Ghana had an electricity access rate of around 85% in 202124. However, some challenges still exist, including power outages52 (called Dumsor in Ghana, which means “off and on”), low electricity access rates in the Northeast and Northwest regions50, high electrical transmission losses (approximately 20%50), and a high per capita energy-related carbon emission rate compared with other sub-Saharan African countries51. The government of Ghana aims to increase renewables in the power generation mix to 1363 MW53 and achieve a 45% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to business-as-usual levels54,55. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows Ghana's national power system transmission network and existing and planned water-energy infrastructure. Supplementary Table 1 provides the type and number of nodes in the Ghana multisector infrastructure system model.

a–c Ghana's power system infrastructure expansion is considered in the design process. d The regions of Ghana are defined based on equally sized populations (to quantify the electricity access Gini index). The irrigation and municipal water supply Gini indices are calculated between the northern (Northeast, Northwest, and Ashanti) and southern regions (Lower Southeast, Upper Southeast, and Southwest) due to the limited spatial data of nodes of irrigation and municipal water demands. The bar and segment colours in (a) and (b) correspond to the regions with the same colours in (d). GW stands for gigawatts. The map in (d) is based on data from Ghana Statistical Services (GSS). Source data are provided as a Source Data file via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14851474 (ref. 81).

The design formulation for Ghana includes minimising the electricity access Gini index, carbon emissions from generation, electricity supply curtailment, irrigation water supply Gini index, power system capital and operating costs, and maximising agriculture yields and flood recession agriculture benefits (eight objectives). The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including infrastructure expansion (solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines), operating rules for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and electricity and irrigation water allocation policies.

Figure 3a shows a parallel coordinates plot of the efficient infrastructure and operation portfolios produced for Ghana using the framework. Selected portfolios are indicated as thick coloured lines. The “baseline” portfolio (black line) reflects the performance of the infrastructure expansion proposed in the Ghana Power System Master Plan50. The “baseline” has high values of Gini coefficients for energy and irrigation water, carbon emissions, and load curtailment compared to the selected portfolios except for the “low energy Gini and high emissions” portfolio (magenta line). The selected portfolios (intervention bundles) show varying trade-offs between performance indicators. For instance, achieving low-carbon emissions (teal line) requires large investments in renewables and transmission lines, whereas less investment increases emissions (blue line). There is also a trade-off between power load curtailment and capital investment (teal and magenta lines). The “low energy Gini” portfolios (magenta and brown lines) improve equity by 7% compared to the “baseline” but alter emissions and curtailment depending on the level of investment. A reduction of US$ 180 million in investment compared to the “baseline” portfolio increases emissions by 7% (magenta line), whereas an increase of US$ 3,000 million results in a 5% reduction in emissions (brown line). Some Ghanaian regions have low use of electricity (e.g., Northwest and Northeast), resulting in a low electricity Gini index limit of 0.473. The “low emissions” portfolio (teal line) shows a 6% reduction in inequities in electricity access, a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, and a 1% increase in agricultural yield compared to the “baseline” while decreasing the load curtailment and irrigation water supply Gini index to zero, with an increase of US$ 7240 million investment in renewables and transmission lines. Except for a 9% increase in carbon emissions, the “low curtailment” portfolio (blue line) is comparable to the “low emissions” portfolio (teal line), with an increase of US$ 5280 million in investment compared to the “baseline”.

Figure 3b shows the distribution of infrastructure expansion (i.e., how much new intermittent renewables and solar storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines) in the selected portfolios of Fig. 3a, c, d show carbon emissions of thermal and bioenergy power plants of the Fig. 3a portfolios. The “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios include major investments in renewables (Fig. 3b). These portfolios improve system performance and decrease operating costs (by nearly 20%) compared to the “baseline”. The “low emissions” portfolio results in a high capacity of new transmission lines, whereas transmission line expansion is lower in the “baseline” and “low energy Gini” portfolios. The renewables are lower in the “low energy Gini” portfolios. Figure 3c, d show that thermal power plants are the major contributors to carbon emissions; the power system continues to partially rely on them to meet the growing electricity demand.

Results show how changes in electricity access equity are impacted by the spatial distribution of investments (i.e., prioritising underserved regions and moving resources from more developed to least developed regions to ensure equitable regional coverage of services - Fig. 4) and indicate the need for large investments in renewables to shift to a low-carbon future (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4). Figure 4 presents the infrastructure expansion by region of the selected portfolios from Fig. 3a. This figure shows how more informed infrastructure planning reduces inequities in electricity access (i.e., adding new generation and transmission capacity and changing electricity allocation priorities in regions with high existing disparities - the Northeast and Northwest regions) while maintaining the same level of emissions and investment cost (e.g., the “low energy Gini and low emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios - see Figs. 3a and 4). Results also show more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios, with higher intra-regional transmission line expansion than cross-regional transmission line expansion (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower reservoir re-operation, and better spatial planning could increase equity in the regional distribution of (water and energy) services and reduce carbon emissions while improving agricultural performance and meeting future energy service targets (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4). With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments (the “low energy Gini” portfolios - Figs. 3 and 4).

The top set of figures (a–f) show the regional distribution of renewables, and the bottom set of figures (g–l) show the regional distribution of transmission line expansion of portfolios selected in the Pareto-efficient portfolios (highlighted coloured lines of Fig. 3a). Solar, wind, solar storage, and bioenergy expansion are higher and more diverse in the “low emissions”, “low energy Gini and low emissions”, and “low curtailment” portfolios, and lower in the “low energy Gini and high emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios. The figure also shows that there is more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios and that the intra-regional transmission line expansion (sum of first six coloured bars in (g–l)) is higher than cross-regional transmission line expansion (sum of last six coloured bars in (g–l)), see Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 3b for the aggregated portfolios of infrastructure expansion. GW stands for gigawatts. Source data are provided as a Source Data file via Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14851474 (ref. 81).

The investment and resource allocation priority options show varying degrees of influence on performance indicators (Fig. 5). Some intervention options are effective at bolstering specific performance indicators, whereas others impact multiple indicators (Fig. 5a–g). The most effective option for equity in electricity access and load curtailment is investing in bioenergy plants in the Northeast and Northwest regions of Ghana (Fig. 5a, c). In contrast, equity in irrigation water supply and agricultural yield are influenced the most by irrigation water allocation priorities (Fig. 5d, e). Results show the most effective choices for improving multiple performance indicators are changing the capacities of bioenergy generation plants in the Northwest and Northeast regions and investing in the Southwest's solar power and bioenergy and Southeast's wind power (Fig. 5h).

Considering regional benefit distribution equity in multisector infrastructure planning can help guide a country toward a more equitable transition from fossil fuels to lower-emission energy sources while reducing inter-sectoral conflicts across multi-resource systems. A more equitable energy transition will accelerate transformational SDG co-benefits20 and help reach the Paris Agreement7. This paper presents a WEFE artificial intelligence-assisted analytical framework that identifies trade-offs and synergies of multi-dimensionally efficient and more equitable low-carbon water-energy infrastructure and operation portfolios. The framework can help stakeholders identify infrastructure investments and resource allocation policies and evaluate the importance ranking and positive and negative influence of different interventions in achieving energy transition policy goals. Through iterative stakeholder deliberation processes, new or modified intervention options can be set and used to revise intervention portfolios to ensure they appropriately reflect stakeholder aspirations.

Our approach aims to lower national emissions in Ghana through a balanced energy infrastructure system expansion programme (bioenergy, solar, wind, solar storage, and transmission lines), and reservoir re-operation (of Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu dams). Ghana's resulting efficient and equitable low-carbon intervention strategies show how considering equity in energy transitions allows reducing both regional service disparities and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. We show how the spatial distribution of investments drives electricity access equity and that increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower re-operation, and better spatial planning enhance equity and reduce carbon emissions while improving food production and meeting future energy service goals. With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments. Ghana's power system continues to partially rely on thermal power plants to meet the growing electricity demand despite the expansion of renewable technologies, resulting in relatively high thermal-based carbon emissions. However, adding bioenergy generation (and transmission lines) helps displace thermal power and decreases emissions while increasing equity in service provision in the Ghanaian case. Bioenergy, which uses agricultural crop and forestry residues and municipal waste as an input50, is recognised as Ghana's leading spatially distributed and dispatchable renewable generation technology. Crop residues alone in Ghana have an estimated bioenergy potential of 75 terajoules (TJ)50,56. Other studies have also highlighted the potential of crop residues for bioenergy in Ghana57,58,59. However, increasing bioenergy could compete with food production for land resources if only relying on energy crops for bioenergy60,61. Bioenergy production, therefore, could be regulated to prevent a negative impact on food security.

The proposed WEFE infrastructure design approach help analysts and policymakers plan for equitable low-carbon futures. The proposed approach considers the spatial equity of water and energy services alongside emission reduction and other aggregated national infrastructure planning goals to identify efficient, equitable, climate-compatible intervention portfolios for multisector WEFE systems. Pareto-optimal portfolios (Figs. 3 and 4 for Ghana) help identify infrastructure interventions that reduce service inequities and emissions and improve sectoral complementarities. Stakeholders can deliberate the pros and cons of a large set of efficient intervention options to help find a compromise portfolio that manages trade-offs and leverages synergies across multiple competing interests. The machine learning technique helps stakeholders understand how different interventions drive equity, emission, and other system performance targets, as shown for Ghana (Fig. 5). This allows choosing portfolios or revising intervention choices and repeating the process if no consensus can be attained. The proposed approach could be adapted for other countries planning an equitable transition to lower-emission energy sources, especially those with service inequities and interdependent WEFE challenges.

This study did not consider the potential effects of climate change and uncertainties with future projections in the equity-informed planning of WEFE systems. Climate change could impact energy generation, the demand for water and energy, and water resources management. These changes and future uncertainties could have repercussions on the equity of providing water and energy services and inter-sectoral conflicts among multiple resource systems. Addressing these limitations in future research would help identify robust infrastructure strategies for adapting to climate change.

In this paper, we argue for considering equity in shaping future multisector resource systems to reduce service inequities and emissions and better balance regional sectoral benefits. The approach can support countries in phasing out fossil-fuel electricity sources and the transition to carbon neutrality fairly and transparently. As such, it is a relevant approach for developing countries seeking to transition towards lower carbon emissions while at the same time improving services. Realising an equitable low-carbon future requires considering multiple sectors, their interactions, and the equity implications of adopting different investment and policy intervention packages. Adding equity considerations alongside goals like climate mitigation could help achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement.

The river system is modelled using Python Water Resources (Pywr)45. Pywr is an open-source Python repository that simulates resource system networks. It allows representing water resources infrastructure using a network structure driven by water supplies and demands and system operating rules. Pywr uses a linear programme to solve water allocations at every simulation time step (weekly in this study) by minimising allocation penalties subject to constraints imposed by operating rules. The Ghana river system model includes existing and planned infrastructure in Ghana. More details on the model can be obtained in the previous publications on the model43,46.

The power system model uses a direct current optimal power flow linear programme47 to minimise power system costs at each simulation time step (i.e., hourly) subject to equality constraints (power balance at each node) and inequality constraints (power generation and line limits). The power system model is an interconnected network of different energy sources, transmission lines, substations, distribution networks, and electricity demand locations. Energy generators can be represented as nodes in the network, each with their defined constraints, such as maximum power capacity and associated costs. The Ghana power system model simulates the existing and planned hydro, solar, combined solar and storage, wind, bioenergy, and thermal generators50. Electricity demand projections, generating resources, capital and operating costs of power plants and transmission lines, and hourly profiles of renewables were taken from Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. Hourly electricity demand profiles and transmission data were collected from the Ghanaian national grid operator, the Ghana Grid Company. The long-term annual peak load projections for 2030-2040 from the Ghana Power System Master Plan50 were used to scale the hourly load profile of 2018 to consider the projected growth in the electricity demand in the country (a twofold increase in the peak demand by 2030 compared to 2018). Capital costs consist of engineering, procurement, construction, start-up, and owner costs (for items like land, cooling infrastructure, administration and associated building, site works, project management, and licenses)50. The operating costs of variable renewables (solar and wind) and combined solar and storage are lower than the costs of hydropower, bioenergy, and thermal power plants50. The operating costs of thermal generators also differ depending on the technology and fuel types. Hourly power system simulations help capture the variability of intermittent renewables (solar and wind) and energy demand, as well as improve the use of hydropower based on the changing availability of renewables and other energy sources. The power system model dispatches the system's generators based on cost-merit prioritisation where solar, wind, combined solar and storage generators are dispatched first, then hydropower, bioenergy, and lastly, thermal generators. This balances energy production to align with variable energy demand and shares of different energy technologies.

The river and power systems simulators are linked to represent multisector nexus dynamics43. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented Python Network Simulation framework (Pynsim)48. The simulators run sequentially with feedback across the simulators (at hydropower generation nodes). The river system simulator runs its first simulation time step and generates the weekly average hydropower, which is then passed to the power system simulator by Pynsim as a constraint on the maximum power generation capacity for that week. The power system simulator runs for the same week at an hourly simulation time step, constrained by the information provided by the river system simulator. This process is repeated time step by time step until the simulation is completed. The integrated simulation model runs for a period of 10 years, from 2030 to 2040.

The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search algorithm (MOEA) to search for efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios43. MOEAs seek the approximately Pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimisation problems by mimicking the natural biological evolution process62,63. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the interaction between the integrated river and power system simulators and the MOEA. The MOEA generates an infrastructure intervention portfolio (i.e., a set of decision variables) and passes it to the integrated water-energy simulator. The integrated simulation model then performs a multi-year simulation to evaluate performance indicators (e.g., regarding energy transition goals) that are used as objectives to be minimised or maximised in the search process. The portfolio and values of the objectives are then stored before the next iteration, when the algorithm generates a new set of variables (a new portfolio) for the simulation model. The search algorithm learns at each iteration from the multi-objective performance of the previous iteration. The iteration between the search algorithm and the integrated simulation model continues until a stopping criterion is met. We allow up to 1.5 million iterations in this design process. Once the stopping criterion is met, a non-dominated sorting process is performed to find a set of best-performing (i.e., Pareto-optimal) intervention portfolios. Pareto-optimal solutions are efficient because they provide the best-achievable compromise among multiple performance objectives that coexist in multi-objective problems. These solutions are non-dominated, indicating no other solutions can outperform or equal them in all objectives at the same time. Stakeholders can consider these optimised solutions to find a compromise that efficiently balances trade-offs among multiple competing interests and leverages synergies. After the search, we used a machine learning method (details provided below) to assess the effectiveness of interventions in achieving performance objectives. Machine learning and interactive data visualisation tools help stakeholders understand, evaluate, and choose a preferred portfolio or iteratively revise the intervention options and repeat the process to obtain alternative, potentially better, intervention portfolios.

We used the Borg MOEA62,63 to perform the WEFE multi-objective optimisation. Borg can tackle complex nonlinear and nonconcave optimisation problems63,64. It integrates various elements from different MOEAs and introduces several new features. It uses ϵ-dominance archives and ϵ-progress to maintain a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions and monitor convergence speed62,63. It employs randomised restarts when convergence slows to revive search through self-adaptive population sizing (of solutions) and dynamically adapts the use of different recombination operators62,63 to generate new candidate solutions. The evolution process in Borg involves evolving a population of candidate solutions over generations of iterative selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The selection step uses the “survival of the fittest” principle and chooses the best population of solutions based on their performance across the optimisation objectives. The crossover step then combines the characteristics of the selected solutions (“parents”) to produce new solutions (“children”) by imitating the natural reproduction process. Random mutations are then added to the children to improve variability and adaptability in the new population of solutions. These newly candidate individuals are then evaluated, and the process continues iteratively, as explained above and in Supplementary Fig. 3.

The convergence of the multi-objective search to the approximately Pareto-optimal solutions was determined by tracking the evolution of the hypervolume65 for each of four random seeds. Each random seed uses a different starting point for the MOEA search process. The hypervolume measures the volume of the objective space above the non-dominated approximation set. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows that the hypervolume stabilises before the stopping criterion of 1.5 million iterations for all four seeds, thereby indicating convergence.

The design formulation for Ghana includes eight objectives: minimising the electricity access Gini index (Eq. (1)), minimising the carbon emissions from generation (Eq. (2)), minimising the power system load curtailment (Eq. (3)), minimising the irrigation water supply Gini index (Eq. (4)), maximising the agriculture yields (Eqs. (5–8)), minimising the power system capital costs (Eq. (9)), minimising the power system operating costs (Eq. (10)), and maximising the flood recession agriculture benefits (Eqs. (11–13)). The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including the vector of the power system infrastructure expansion, including solar, wind, combined solar and storage, and bioenergy (biomass and biogas) generators, and transmission lines, the vector of operating rules parameters (Eq. (14)) for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and the vector of the electricity and irrigation water allocation priority parameters.

where, Ginielectricity is the mean electricity access Gini index of a country, \({{\rm{RP}}}\) is a set of regions of equal population in a country, LS/capi is the load supply per capita of region i, LS/capj is the load supply per capita of region \(j\), \(\overline{{{\rm{LS}}}/{{\rm{cap}}}}\) is the mean load supply per capita of regions of equal population in a country, n is the number of regions of equal population in a country, t is the simulation time step, and T is the number of simulation years.

We calculate the average index value by dividing the sum of the values aggregated in every simulation year and the number of simulation years.

where, \(Y\) is the total irrigation yield in tonnes per year estimated using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Crop Water Requirements method66, \({{{\rm{CR}}}}_{t,n}\) is the irrigation water supply curtailment ratio, \({A}_{n}\) is the area in hectare (ha) per irrigation scheme \(n\), \({y}_{n}\) is the annual yield in tonnes per ha per irrigation scheme \(n\), \(t\) is the simulation time step, \(T\) is the number of simulation years, \({r}_{t,n}\) is the crop water allocated by the model, \({{{\rm{iwr}}}}_{t,n}\) is the irrigation water requirement for irrigation scheme \(n\), \({{{\rm{cwr}}}}_{t,n}\) is the crop water requirement per irrigation scheme \(n\), \({\alpha }_{{{\rm{ct}}}}\) is the application efficiency (assumed 80%), \({\beta }_{{{\rm{ct}}}}\) is conveyance efficiency (assumed 70%), and \({{{\rm{Kc}}}}_{t,\left({{\rm{ct}}}\in n\right)}\), \({{{\rm{ETo}}}}_{t,\left({{\rm{ct}}}\in n\right)}\), and \({R}_{t,n}\) are crop water coefficients, reference evapotranspiration in millimetre (mm) per day, and effective rainfall in mm per day obtained from ref. 67.

\(R\), \({{\rm{Kc}}}\), and \({{\rm{ETo}}}\) are used in the FAO method66 to calculate the water requirement for each crop. \({{\rm{ETo}}}\) is the evapotranspiration of a standardised reference crop, while \({{\rm{Kc}}}\) is the factor to change \({{\rm{ETo}}}\) for specific crop water requirements. \(R\) is compared with the amount of water a crop needs (\({{\rm{Kc}}}\times {{\rm{ETo}}}\)) to determine whether irrigation is required for that crop. Crops that are considered vary for each irrigation scheme and include rice, maize, sugar cane, beans, tomatoes, and fresh vegetables. The total irrigation water requirement for each irrigation scheme is calculated by assuming the overall irrigation efficiency for surface irrigation. The level of irrigation water supply compared to the water required is then used to estimate the total irrigation yield.

where, \({{{\rm{cc}}}}_{i}\) is the technology capital cost, and \({{{\rm{cap}}}}_{i}\) is the new infrastructure capacity.

where, \({{{\rm{oc}}}}_{i}\) is the operating cost of the generator technology \(i\), \({P}_{t,i}\) is the power output from the generator technology \(i\), \(t\) is the simulation time step, and \(T\) is the number of simulation years.

We used Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) to model reservoir operating rules. The use of RBFs in representing infrastructure operating rules, including reservoir storage and release decisions, have shown good performance71,72,73. The Gaussian RBF (\(\varphi\)) is defined by Eq. (14).

where, m is the number of input variables x (reservoir storage and time), n is the number of RBFs (four), wi is the weight of the ith RBF, and ci,j and bi,j are the m-dimensional centres and radius vectors of the ith RBF, respectively. The centres and radius take values in ci,jϵ[−1,1] and bi,jϵ[0, 1], and \({w}_{i}{{\rm{\epsilon }}}\left[0,1\right]\) with \(\mathop{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{w}_{i}=1\). More details can be found in the ref. 71. The time of year and storage in the reservoir are mapped to the release rule at each time step of the simulation period. This allows to dynamic adaptation of releases based on changing reservoir volumes. The multi-objective search process (MOEA) optimises the monthly storage volumes and releases (24 decision variables) for each reservoir to determine the most efficient (Pareto-optimal) operating rules. The MOEA iteratively optimises the release rules alongside infrastructure expansion, such as solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines, and energy and water allocation priorities. Hydropower reservoirs can provide flexibility and stability for power grids, and their improved operations can support the transition to clean energy43,74,75,76. The MOEA explores a range of different infrastructure interventions while also adjusting reservoir release decisions to find the best-achievable compromise among equity, emissions, and other water-energy system performance objectives. This way MOEA solutions adapt to the changing shares of different energy technologies and allocate resources to improve overall system performance (see Supplementary Fig. 3 for a description of the interaction between the integrated system model and the MOEA search).

We used the Random Forest Regression machine learning model77 from the Scikit-learn Python library78 and the SHAP49,79,80 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity and other water-energy system performance indicators. The MOEA typically yields a large set (up to thousands) of optimal solutions for large problems like the Ghana case study. While common patterns can potentially be identified from directly exploring Pareto-optimal solutions or via cluster analysis, the SHAP analysis of tree-based machine learning models49,79 helps explain the relationships between intervention decisions and the MOEA performance measures. It provides the importance ranking of different interventions and also the direction and magnitude of their influence in achieving performance objectives. The outcomes of the MOEA are used to train a Random Forest model for each performance objective. The features of each Random Forest model are the decision variables representing different investment and resource allocation priority options, and the target is each of the optimisation objectives. We divide the data into the training set (80% of the data) and the testing set (20% of the data). The training dataset is used to train 100 tree estimators, and the testing dataset is used to test the performance of the Random Forest models. We also test the performance of each model for different maximum tree depths ranging from 1 to 70 to select the best-fit tree depth for each model to avoid overfitting or underfitting models. Supplementary Fig. 5 depicts the performance of the machine learning models for the training and testing sets with different maximum tree depths and the selected maximum tree depth for each model.

Neurons in a brain structure called the paraventricular nucleus help translate stress into poor sleep and memory.Credit: Filmstax/Getty

Scientists have identified a group of neurons that might explain the mechanism behind how stress gives rise to problems with sleep and memory.

The study — published last week in The Journal of Neuroscience1 — shows that neurons in a brain area called the hypothalamus mediate the effects of stress on sleep and memory, potentially providing a new target for the treatment of stress-related sleep disorders.

Previous work has shown that within the hypothalamus, neurons in a structure called the paraventricular nucleus communicate with other areas important for sleep and memory. The neurons of the paraventricular nucleus release a hormone called corticotropin and have a role in regulating stress. But the neural mechanisms underlying the effect of stress on sleep and memory have remained elusive.

For co-author Shinjae Chung, a neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, the question of how exactly how stress affects these processes is personal, because, she says, “I experience a lot of sleep problems when I'm stressed”. She adds that “when I have an exam deadline, I have a tendency to have bad sleep that really affects my score the next day”.

To study how neurons in the paraventricular nucleus translate stress into sleep and memory problems, the researchers put laboratory mice through a stressful experience by physically restraining the animals in a plastic tube. The team then tested the creatures' spatial memory and monitored their brain activity as they slept.

As expected, the stressed mice showed difficulty sleeping and struggled with memory when tested the following day. Stimulating neurons in the paraventricular nucleus mimicked these effects, whereas blocking these neurons resulted in modest improvements in sleep, and more substantial gains in memory performance.

“People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses,” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, wrote in an aside in a long blog post last week. The average query, Altman wrote, uses 0.34 watt-hours of energy: “About what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes.”

For a company with 800 million weekly active users (and growing), the question of how much energy all these searches are using is becoming an increasingly pressing one. But experts say Altman's figure doesn't mean much without much more public context from OpenAI about how it arrived at this calculation—including the definition of what an “average” query is, whether or not it includes image generation, and whether or not Altman is including additional energy use, like from training AI models and cooling OpenAI's servers.

As a result, Sasha Luccioni, the climate lead at AI company Hugging Face, doesn't put too much stock in Altman's number. “He could have pulled that out of his ass,” she says. (OpenAI did not respond to a request for more information about how it arrived at this number.)

As AI takes over our lives, it's also promising to transform our energy systems, supercharging carbon emissions right as we're trying to fight climate change. Now, a new and growing body of research is attempting to put hard numbers on just how much carbon we're actually emitting with all of our AI use.

This effort is complicated by the fact that major players like OpenAI disclose little environmental information. An analysis submitted for peer review this week by Luccioni and three other authors looks at the need for more environmental transparency in AI models. In Luccioni's new analysis, she and her colleagues use data from OpenRouter, a leaderboard of large language model (LLM) traffic, to find that 84 percent of LLM use in May 2025 was for models with zero environmental disclosure. That means that consumers are overwhelmingly choosing models with completely unknown environmental impacts.

“It blows my mind that you can buy a car and know how many miles per gallon it consumes, yet we use all these AI tools every day and we have absolutely no efficiency metrics, emissions factors, nothing,” Luccioni says. “It's not mandated, it's not regulatory. Given where we are with the climate crisis, it should be top of the agenda for regulators everywhere.”

As a result of this lack of transparency, Luccioni says, the public is being exposed to estimates that make no sense but which are taken as gospel. You may have heard, for instance, that the average ChatGPT request takes 10 times as much energy as the average Google search. Luccioni and her colleagues track down this claim to a public remark that John Hennessy, the chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, made in 2023.

A claim made by a board member from one company (Google) about the product of another company to which he has no relation (OpenAI) is tenuous at best—yet, Luccioni's analysis finds, this figure has been repeated again and again in press and policy reports. (As I was writing this piece, I got a pitch with this exact statistic.)

“People have taken an off-the-cuff remark and turned it into an actual statistic that's informing policy and the way people look at these things,” Luccioni says. “The real core issue is that we have no numbers. So even the back-of-the-napkin calculations that people can find, they tend to take them as the gold standard, but that's not the case.”

One way to try and take a peek behind the curtain for more accurate information is to work with open source models. Some tech giants, including OpenAI and Anthropic, keep their models proprietary—meaning outside researchers can't independently verify their energy use. But other companies make some parts of their models publicly available, allowing researchers to more accurately gauge their emissions.

A study published Thursday in the journal Frontiers of Communication evaluated 14 open-source large language models, including two Meta Llama models and three DeepSeek models, and found that some used as much as 50 percent more energy than other models in the dataset responding to prompts from the researchers. The 1,000 benchmark prompts submitted to the LLMs included questions on topics such as high school history and philosophy; half of the questions were formatted as multiple choice, with only one-word answers available, while half were submitted as open prompts, allowing for a freer format and longer answers. Reasoning models, the researchers found, generated far more thinking tokens—measures of internal reasoning generated in the model while producing its answer, which are a hallmark of more energy use—than more concise models. These models, perhaps unsurprisingly, were also more accurate with complex topics. (They also had trouble with brevity: During the multiple choice phase, for instance, the more complex models would often return answers with multiple tokens, despite explicit instructions to only answer from the range of options provided.)

Maximilian Dauner, a PhD student at the Munich University of Applied Sciences and the study's lead author, says he hopes AI use will evolve to think about how to more efficiently use less-energy-intensive models for different queries. He envisions a process where smaller, simpler questions are automatically directed to less-energy-intensive models that will still provide accurate answers. “Even smaller models can achieve really good results on simpler tasks, and don't have that huge amount of CO2 emitted during the process,” he says.

Some tech companies already do this. Google and Microsoft have previously told WIRED that their search features use smaller models when possible, which can also mean faster responses for users. But generally, model providers have done little to nudge users toward using less energy. How quickly a model answers a question, for instance, has a big impact on its energy use—but that's not explained when AI products are presented to users, says Noman Bashir, the Computing & Climate Impact Fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium.

“The goal is to provide all of this inference the quickest way possible so that you don't leave their platform,” he says. “If ChatGPT suddenly starts giving you a response after five minutes, you will go to some other tool that is giving you an immediate response.”

However, there's a myriad of other considerations to take into account when calculating the energy use of complex AI queries, because it's not just theoretical—the conditions under which queries are actually run out in the real world matter. Bashir points out that physical hardware makes a difference when calculating emissions. Dauner ran his experiments on an Nvidia A100 GPU, but Nvidia's H100 GPU—which was specially designed for AI workloads, and which, according to the company, is becoming increasingly popular—is much more energy-intensive.

Physical infrastructure also makes a difference when talking about emissions. Large data centers need cooling systems, light, and networking equipment, which all add on more energy; they often run in diurnal cycles, taking a break at night when queries are lower. They are also hooked up to different types of grids—ones overwhelmingly powered by fossil fuels, versus those powered by renewables—depending on their locations.

Bashir compares studies that look at emissions from AI queries without factoring in data center needs to lifting up a car, hitting the gas, and counting revolutions of a wheel as a way of doing a fuel-efficiency test. “You're not taking into account the fact that this wheel has to carry the car and the passenger,” he says.

Perhaps most crucially for our understanding of AI's emissions, open source models like the ones Dauner used in his study represent a fraction of the AI models used by consumers today. Training a model and updating deployed models takes a massive amount of energy—figures that many big companies keep secret. It's unclear, for example, whether the light bulb statistic about ChatGPT from OpenAI's Altman takes into account all the energy used to train the models powering the chatbot. Without more disclosure, the public is simply missing much of the information needed to start understanding just how much this technology is impacting the planet.

“If I had a magic wand, I would make it mandatory for any company putting an AI system into production, anywhere, around the world, in any application, to disclose carbon numbers,” Luccioni says.

“Well,” a senior Democratic strategist tells me, “my wife and I are having a fight about me going back to the field in the midterms.”

“I would be lying if I said these aren't conversations I've been having with my family every day,” shared a Democratic candidate in a high-profile battleground state midterms race.

In a matter of days, the truly unthinkable occurred: On Thursday last week, Senator Alex Padilla of California was forcibly removed from a news conference and handcuffed by officials wearing FBI-identifying clothing when he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on immigration raids in Los Angeles. On Saturday, Melissa Hortman, a Democratic Minnesota state representative, and her husband, Mark Hortman, were shot and killed. State senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman were also shot. On Tuesday, New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was violently arrested after accompanying an immigrant from a court appointment.

Not to mention the fact that an estimated 4 to 6 million people attended “No Kings” protests this past weekend against President Donald Trump's administration.

How should Democrats be approaching this chaotic and, at times, violent moment? From lawmakers and candidates all the way down to the staff who fuel their operations, a series of events over the past week have made national Democrats reconsider their strategy. Following the shootings of the state lawmakers in Minnesota, a weekend of nationwide protests, and Democratic lawmakers in handcuffs, Democrats are trying to figure out what meeting the Trump moment really means for an out-of-power coalition that's already under fire from constituents for ostensibly rolling over. And for a number of lawmakers and strategists, that answer isn't so simple.

“I think that the hard reality is, a lot of Democrats and a lot of people say, like, why aren't we doing something?” David Axelrod, former President Barack Obama's chief strategist from his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, tells WIRED. “Well, there are a limited number of ways in a democracy to do something, short of revolution—which I'm not advocating. You win elections, you go to court.”

He says Padilla was in the right but that Democrats should exercise caution and not play into the White House's hands by rushing to get arrested or associating themselves too closely with protests that are unpredictable and prone to producing images of disorder. (Padilla's office did not return a request for comment.)

Some laws of political gravity, Axelrod argues, still apply: “As a general rule, don't do what your opponent wants.”

The issue isn't just optics though, but expectation. “I think the last thing Dems want to do is look unhinged or out of control,” a GOP strategist tells me. Right-wing media, certainly, has had a field day: a Fox News prime time segment from Jesse Watters on Tuesday night painted Democratic protesters as hysterical and ineffective.

But Democratic voters might just want a strong, “unhinged” response. “Democrats are crying out for [a] fight,” the senior Democratic strategist tells me. “They are crying out for someone who seems like they're fighting.”

Democrats have been deeply pessimistic about the future of their own party, according to polling, despite a recent rebound for the party brand in the generic ballot against Republicans, where they now lead by 2 points, their best performance since last August, according to YouGov's latest survey.

Pennsylvania state representative Malcolm Kenyatta—a newly elected vice chair of the Democratic National Committee since David Hogg stepped down—tells WIRED optics should not be the primary consideration when it comes to whether lawmakers with oversight abilities should consider risking the chance of an arrest.

“Listen, I think we have a responsibility to do our fuckin' job,” says Kenyatta, the grandson of civil rights leader Muhammad Kenyatta. “And what Senator Padilla was doing was his job.”

House Speaker Hakeem Jeffries of New York has often used the baseball analogy of not swinging at every pitch to explain how he thinks Democrats should respond to President Trump's deluge of executive actions and outlandish statements.

For emerging leaders in the party like Kenyatta, the state of play has moved beyond that point.

“Things don't become less important because a lot of them are happening,” Kenyatta says. “I don't think we have the luxury of ignoring any of the things he does that are going to make life worse for people.”

Lander, who was detained outside of an immigration court hearing in New York City on Tuesday, took that exact type of risk. For the senior Democratic strategist fighting with his wife—who requested anonymity to avoid entangling other clients, and their spouse—Lander showed fellow Democrats how it should be done. (A representative for Lander did not return a request for comment.)

“Yes, this is exactly what people should be doing,” they say. “There are people who are going to say this whole thing is gimmicky, and I get that. Put some fucking skin in the game. We've gotta draw attention to it somehow—look at all of those cameras they had to arrest him in front of.”

But there are also very real security considerations. The battleground state candidate, who also requested anonymity to discuss sensitive security conversations, said the increased security posture lawmakers are dealing with has only made it harder to be as up close with voters, as regularly, in as many places.

“It's this ugly reality where you have to look out for your safety. It is going to rob people of access to their elected officials and candidates,” they say.

This has happened already: Representative Hillary Scholten of Michigan postponed a Monday town hall in Muskegon after her name ended up on the alleged Minnesota shooter's list of lawmakers to target. (Scholten's office did not return a request for comment.)

Even so, the Democratic candidate wants their constituents to know they're not alone, and they have every right to be angry.

""I am as angry as you are about our government and our elected officials,” they say. “I'm doing the hard thing. I'm putting my name on a ballot. I'm being vulnerable. I'm asking for people to support me, which is a fuck-ton harder than buying a gun and going and threatening people.""

If you actually measure the amount of time you spend scrolling through algorithm-led social media feeds each day, it will probably add up to more hours and minutes than you'd guess. Time can quickly slip away while you're checking up on friends, celebrities, the news, and the viral memes of the day.

The term doomscrolling has sprung up to describe this behavior, which, let's face it, isn't usually the most edifying or the best for our mood. It's no surprise that the word began to gain traction at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a period of lockdowns and social isolation that we're still feeling the effects of.

There are ways to fight back against doomscrolling though, some of which are built into your phone and can be enabled with a couple of taps. See how much time and mental well-being they can help you reclaim.

(The Android instructions below apply to Pixel phones running Android 15 or later. If you're using something different, you should be able to find similar features and settings, though they might not be in exactly the same place).

News and social media alerts can drag you into apps when you weren't even thinking about checking them. Disabling notifications can keep you from getting sucked in. You can shut off notifications altogether or just quieten them.

On Android, head to Settings, then tap Notifications > App notifications. On iOS, from Settings choose Notifications to see an app list.

For a more extreme approach, you can delete these apps from your mobile devices entirely, which stops you from checking them at all. On Android, you can drag an app from the app drawer up to the Uninstall button at the top of the screen. On iOS, tap and hold on an app in the app library, then choose Delete App from the pop-up menu.

Deleting apps on an iPhone

This may just lead you to check these apps more often on the web—but you can always delete your accounts entirely. This is usually not too difficult to do: In the case of X, for example, head to the website and log in, then click More > Settings and privacy > Your account > Deactivate your account and follow the instructions.

You could consider putting your phone in a different room during parts of the day—especially at bedtime, to avoid doomscrolling when you should be sleeping.

Note that several studies have shown that just having a phone in the same room with you can have an impact on your attention and focus, even if you don't actually pick it up and use it.

Modern phones come with built-in tools that allow you to limit your screen time, so you can put restrictions on how long you use specific apps and how long you're on your phone overall. Of course, you're able to disable these limits as easily as you can enable them—it's your phone after all—but you can use them in combination with your own willpower to change your habits.

If you're on Android, you can open Settings and choose Digital Wellbeing and Parental Controls, then App limits, to put some restrictions in place. Over on iOS, from Settings tap Screen Time, then App & Website Activity. On both platforms, you get a pretty detailed breakdown of how you've been spending your time on your phone.

If you must spend time on your phone (what else are you going to do on the subway platform?), you can replace social media and news with apps like Calm for mindful meditation; Blinklist for reading summaries of books, podcasts, and talks; and Kindle for ebook reading, which will also be synced to your actual Kindle, if you have one.

Enabling a bedtime schedule on Android

Both Android and iOS now let you set a specific bedtime on your phone, the idea being that it helps you wind down properly by steering you away from opening apps and doomscrolling into the early hours. These bedtime modes put limits on incoming notifications, dim the screen, and give you the option of using a more simplified phone interface late at night.

If you're on Android, open the Clock app and switch to the Bedtime tab: You can set start and end times for the mode and access settings such as turning the screen gray at a specific hour. On iPhone, head to the main iOS Settings screen, then tap Focus, then Sleep. The next screen will show all the available options and timers.

This is iPhone only, but Adam Davidson over at How-To Geek has a neat idea: Create an iOS shortcut to generate a snarky message from ChatGPT or Claude AI that warns about the harm of doomscrolling, and have it go off every time you open certain apps. The message can be shown on screen or read aloud.

As protestors faced off against ICE agents and law enforcement in Los Angeles, game developers gathered just a few miles away for Summer Game Fest. They'd come to the annual show in early June to show off their games and make professional connections. The team at Outerloop Games was no different. But the studio, led and staffed by brown and Black developers, many of whom are immigrants themselves, had extra precautions to consider: “In case of an ICE raid,” says game director Chandana Ekanayake of the team's plan at the time, “we're gonna stay together.” Whether that meant at the event itself, or even dinner after, the team kept track of each other for the entire event.

Outerloop, creator of Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, were at the event to show off their newest project, a “spicy” narrative turn-based RPG called Dosa Divas due out in early 2026.

As the Trump administration carries out mass deportations, targets visas, disappears migrants into a foreign megaprison, and tweets “ASMR” videos of people being deported in chains from the official White House account, Outerloop is making games that find ways to connect people to different cultures through food. “That's the most accepted version of ourselves or of culture, is food,” Ekanayake says. “People are definitely willing to try food before they're willing to accept the people that make it.”

Outerloop's games have always featured food in some capacity, and Dosa Divas only ramps up its importance. Named for dosas, savory crepes popular in South India, the game stars two sisters fighting against an evil fast food empire, literally; characters in its turn-based combat have unique abilities associated with different “flavor profiles,” like sweet, spicy, or sour. To attack effectively, you need to match moves to the enemy's flavor craving.

Dosa Divas centers around three sisters—Samara, Amani, and fast food entrepreneur, Lina—the last of which has become estranged after their family restaurant closes down. Lina's quick cuisine has become so widespread that nobody really cooks anymore.

Ekanayake says that part of the game's story is about reconciliation and reconnection, especially through food. Collecting ingredients and cooking plays an important role in the game. By sharing meals with villagers, players can help repair communities and build their own reputation.

Much like Thirsty Suitors, Outerloop's previous game, Dosa Divas is set in a colorful, vibrant world that mixes fantastical elements with the everyday. In Thirsty Suitors, heroine Jala battled her exes in over-the-top fight sequences, skateboarded, and tried to make peace with her parents. Dosa Divas adds a giant mech to the mix who helps the sisters beat up lawyers.

Early reactions to the game are positive, with critics praising the game's humor, esthetics, and flavor-themed battles. Summer Game Fest had “many games set in spooky or dystopian locales that made for a weekend filled with lots of dark, shadowy worlds that felt largely devoid of color,” wrote ScreenRant. “After so much gray, to come across a bright color palette and such a visually-appealing art style in the game felt so inviting.” RPGFan said “its combat felt intuitive, its writing was witty.”

Ekanayake says he's already heard from one fan with a 10-year-old son; the family had just eaten dosas the night before, and his kid was thrilled to see a little part of his life on screen. “Food brings people together,” Ekanayake says. It's easily shared and introduced to people, even cultural neophytes, allowing anyone to easily experience life outside of their own. “Meal time and eating for a lot of cultures is also community bonding time,” he says. “There's a sense of cultural history and tradition brought down from generation to generation. There's some pride in that too.”

Outerloop's team includes people who come from regions like South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Palestine, so their games include a lot of what Ekanayake calls immigrant dishes. “In Seattle,” he says, “we still have an ethnic aisle in the grocery store—which is ridiculous to me because white people have ethnicity too.” Games, sometimes, can feel the same way. “I think there's still a stigma—that is a brown game, or a Black game,” he says. “You can make the best thing you can possibly make, but it still gets associated in the same way.”

Even well-meaning observers fall into comments that feel othering. “A lot of white folks that come up to me like, ‘oh, what you're doing is so brave,'” he says. “I cringe every time someone says that to me … I want the game to stand on its own. Yes, it has the cultural aspects, but also, is it a good game? Do you enjoy it? Tell me that.”

Ekanayake says that there's a commonality to immigrant experiences in the US, cultural aspects that Outerloop tries to get across in their games. Now, that goal is more important than ever. Growing hostility towards people of color under the Trump administration is making even an annual game event a place to be on guard. “We talk about different local laws and issues depending on where folks are, and how to stay safe,” Ekanayake says. “Especially since the start of 2025.”

Even as a naturalized citizen, he's not entirely comfortable with leaving and re-entering the US right now, whether it's to see family or attend gaming events like Gamescom in Germany. He says it's the first time since 9/11 where he's questioned, “Am I putting my family in danger, am I putting my employees in danger? Do I have to think about what I say or where I travel? That's definitely a concern right now.”

But coming back from LA, Ekanayake says he feels invigorated by the work he and his teammates do. “I feel even stronger about making sure that we keep telling stories and sharing experiences and trying to humanize Black and brown culture and experiences,” he says. “It's fucking weird and also the silliest thing to call it woke when this is who we are. It's our experiences. This nation is founded on immigration and immigrants.”

Putting aside their exorbitant cost, the trouble with prescription hearing aids is the prescription. Find a doctor. Get an appointment. Sit in a waiting room. Suffer through an hour of testing before getting the hard sell on a pair of hearing aids. Why, the indignity of it all is even worse than going deaf.

Telehealth offers a glimmer of a solution, but as everyone who's tried to show off a concerning mole to a doctor via a smartphone camera knows: Video technology can only get you so far. Audiological testing requires significant one-on-one interaction and plenty of technology to back that up. Every audiogram I've sat for has been inside a sophisticated, soundproof chamber.

Hear.com—a company that sells prescription hearing aids online and via traditional retail channels —has a workaround. It puts all the technology needed to perform a full-on hearing test in a box and mails it to you along with a set of prescription hearing aids, then walks you through the whole thing with an audiologist via a video call. I've taken Hear.com's virtual hearing test twice—this is what a tele-hearing exam looks like, should you decide to take one.

The process begins with a simple discussion. If you've never had hearing aids before, this is probably a good first step; veterans will likely skip it, especially if they know what model hearing aids they want (or how much they want to spend). A Hear.com salesperson will discuss your personal impressions of your hearing loss, any hearing aid devices you have tried, prior audiological testing, and your budget (along with any insurance you have). From there, they will suggest the best hearing aids (from their product line) to meet your needs, though you can also advocate for a specific product if you've already identified one.

Next, you'll set a time for your testing and hearing aid fitting, and a few days later, a box will arrive on your doorstep. Open it up, and the collection of hardware and the tangle of wires connecting it all may seem daunting, but rest assured, with even a modicum of technical knowledge, it all goes together quickly, and Hear.com professionals can guide you through any confusion over the phone.

Despite the significant amount of gear inside, the box is about as organized as it can get. On top, you'll find a Microsoft Surface tablet that has been stripped down to do just one thing: serve as the conduit for a video-based audiology session. After plugging the Surface into wall power, you'll find a USB breakout box to connect to the Surface's USB port. Assuming all the other devices are still properly plugged into that USB breakout box (which is far from assured; it's good to check everything is snug), you are effectively good to go. The Surface has no other functionality besides initiating the call with the audiology professional, and at the scheduled time you tap a button on the screen to get the session underway.

After greeting you, the audiologist will guide you through a series of tests. First is a physical exam of your ears, which is made possible thanks to the included USB-powered otoscope, which you probably know better as the lighted tool with the black, conical tip a doctor uses to look into your ear canal. There's no doctor to guide the tool by hand, so the audiologist will tell you how to position it in each ear so they can get a good look at your eardrum. And yes, you, too, can see what the doctor sees right on the Surface's screen. Spoiler: There is more wax inside your ear canal than you think.

Assuming you have no physical damage that would preclude hearing aid use, it's on to the traditional hearing exams. This series of tests will consume the bulk of the appointment time, and most involve wearing a pair of oversize, noise-isolating headsets like professional musicians use. The tests were very familiar to me, starting with tones played at varying frequencies and volume levels in each ear, during which you tap the Surface screen whenever you hear something.

The test is then repeated with a bone-conduction appliance that attaches to your forehead with a Velcro band for another look at the way you process sound. Lastly, a third test measures your ability to distinguish various consonant and vowel sounds—sh vs. ch, for example—which is performed by having you repeat the words you think you hear back to the audiologist multiple times.

From all of this data, an audiogram is synthesized and presented on the screen of the Surface. Quality-wise, my Hear.com audiogram was nearly identical to the last professional audiogram I received in 2023 in an office setting. Hear.com's audiogram was even more detailed, because it tested my hearing at nine different frequencies, one more than the in-person visit. After going over the audiogram with me to discuss the particulars of my hearing loss, Hear.com's audiologist moved on to the hearing aid fitting.

You'll have purchased the hearing aids you're about to put on already and will find them in the box, inside a charger that notes they are fully charged and ready to use. If for some reason these aids aren't appropriate for the hearing loss measured in the testing, Hear.com will recommend an alternative at that time, but most customers should have a set in hand that will meet their needs, based on the previous intake call.

The aids are programmed remotely and wirelessly via another device connected to the USB breakout box, and I was directed to put the hearing aids on and then put them back in the charging case repeatedly so we could tweak the sound profile to my liking. Again, this is a standard process identical to how things would be done in a doctor's office. The doctor will then train a hearing aid novice on how to insert, charge, and clean the aids and go over any lingering paperwork that needs to be dealt with.

Hear.com sells its own hearing aids under the Horizon brand, which are private-labeled Signia hearing aids in the Signia IX series. There's not an easy way to see exactly which models Hear.com offers on its website, but they range from the Horizon 1IX ($1,975) to the Horizon 7IX ($4,950), the latter of which is what I was sent to try. Monthly payment plans are available for everything, and all of its hearing aids come with a 45-day money-back guarantee.

When the hour-long session is up, you'll be directed to keep all the testing hardware for a while until you are certain the aids work for you. A follow-up call a few weeks later will check on your progress (there's a learning curve with all hearing aids) and, once you're satisfied, you'll be instructed to return the testing equipment via a prepaid shipping label in the box.

I'll need to continue testing for longer, but so far, the Horizon hearing aids work great. Even better is the way you go about getting them fitted.

Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes — always a decade away! — to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.

The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.

The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.

It doesn't hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what's known as scientific breakeven, and while it's still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.

Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.

With a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. 

Sparc's reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc's successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.

Backed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. The company has raised a total of $2 billion, according to PitchBook.

Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. 

The company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook.

Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.

Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma's own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor's magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.

The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.

Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.

The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion's funding might be massive, but the startup hasn't gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that's common in biotech.

Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it's starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn't picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it's developing necessary skills for when that time comes.

The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.

Now its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.

In an General Fusion's reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.

General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff.

Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. 

The Oxfordshire, UK-based startup's ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company's magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.

In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.

Zap Energy isn't using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.

Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.

Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.

Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.

Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma's quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.

Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry's decades of experience.

The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.

First Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. 

First Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent.

Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that's behind the National Ignition Facility's breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF's setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.

Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

When U.S. Vice President JD Vance joined Bluesky on Wednesday evening, he got banned immediately. However, his account was restored after a while, with Bluesky saying that the ban was issued after the social network's system that looks for impersonating attempts fired a warning.

“Vice President Vance's account was briefly flagged by our automated systems that try to detect impersonation attempts, which have targeted public figures like him in the past. The account was quickly restored and verified so people can easily confirm its authenticity,” A Bluesky spokesperson told TechCrunch in a statement.

“We welcome the Vice President to join the conversation on Bluesky,” the spokesperson said.

Vance's first post on Bluesky was about the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Tennessee law that bars gender-affirming care for transgender minors.

Building in a Time of UncertaintyRyan Petersen, founder and CEO, Flexport

Uncertainty is the new normal, but it's also an opportunity. In this fireside chat, Ryan Petersen, CEO of global logistics unicorn Flexport, shares his hard-won insights. With $2.3B raised, Flexport's shipping technology intersects international business and policy, giving Petersen almost prescient economic insights. He's been vocal about everything from tariff policy to AI. He's also experienced personal volatility, famously leaving his CEO role and then returning less than a year later. Founders, take notes: this is how you build when the rules keep changing. 

How to Nail Product Market FitRajat Bhageria, founder and CEO, Chef Robotics, Ann Bordetsky, partner, NEA, and Murali Joshi, partner, ICONIQ

Building a product is hard. Building one that customers are chomping at the bit to get, that's priced right, and delivers on its promises is even harder, and it's always messy. But once you hit the holy grail of product-market fit, your startup is on a fast track to growth, funding, and traction. Hear from a founder who's lived it and two investors who've helped many others get there. This panel breaks down how to test smarter and iterate with intention so you can stop guessing and start growing.

With Vibe Coding, Do Early Stage Startups Still Need to Hire 10x Engineers?David Cramer, co-founder and CPO, Sentry, Lauri Moore, partner, Bessemer Venture Partners, and a speaker to be announced

Vibe coding products have completely changed the speed, cost, and technical skill needed to build products, from prototypes to shipping. This is especially true for early stage startups. Some makers of these products have even declared that no one needs to learn to code anymore. If so, that means startups don't need to fill their early rosters with the famed 10x coders. But how much of that is hype and how much is reality? Our panelists will dive into how the developer tool world is changing and what comes next. 

Should You Hire AI as Early Employees?Caleb Peffer, co-founder and CEO, Firecrawl, and more speakers to be announced

Most startups today are using AI in some capacities: vibe coding prototypes or new features, deep research via their favorite chat before sales calls. Many are also building AI products, or at least including AI options and features. So, should you embed AI at the root operations of your businesses, like hiring AI agents instead of humans for sales? For customer support? To automate your billing? Learn how to pick the right use cases, build smarter workflows, and get the biggest impact with limited resources.

Do Startups Still Need Silicon Valley?Anh-Tho Chuong, CEO and co-founder, Lago, Heather Doshay, partner, head of talent, SignalFire, and David Hall, managing partner, rise of the rest seed fund, Revolution 

While Silicon Valley is still the startup capital, how important is access to it anymore? This panel debates whether founders must plant roots in the Valley to succeed or if opportunity is so strong elsewhere that they don't need it. Hear perspectives from investors and founders redefining what it means to build, scale, and fund a company in today's decentralized tech world.

Building a GTM Engine that Actually WorksMax Altschuler, founder and general partner, GTMfund, and more speakers to be announced 

A killer product needs a killer go-to-market strategy. This panel breaks down how early-stage startups can build a GTM function that drives growth, wins customers, and scales efficiently. Hear from founders and GTM experts on hiring, messaging, sales tactics, and the key metrics that prove your approach is working.

Not only will you gain invaluable insights from these tech giants live at Disrupt 2025 alongside 10,000+ startup, tech, and VC leaders this October, but you can also save up to $675 on your pass today. Register here to lock in your savings.

No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. 

During that period, the world's leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups.

The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It's a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) 

In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds.

Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” 

Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round.

OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker's investment was dwarfed by OpenAI's other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion.

xAI:  Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk's xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI's investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI's cap table a few months later.

Inflection:  One of Nvidia's first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection's $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI's founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.

Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.

Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.

Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.

Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June.  

Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda's business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia's GPUs.

Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere's $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.

Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data.

Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.

CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave's valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis.

Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. 

Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion.

Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.

Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.

Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.

Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.

Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ's Series E round to $450 million and the company's valuation to $5.75 billion.

Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation.

Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.

Runway:  In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce.

Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.

Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica's $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn't participate in the round.

Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data's Series E round. Nvidia hasn't invested in Vast Data since the company's Series D.

One of SpaceX's Starship launch vehicles exploded on a test stand in Texas late on Wednesday night, as the company prepared for the tenth test flight of the heavy-lift rocket system.

SpaceX said “all personnel are safe and accounted for” in a post on X, and claimed there are “no hazards to residents in surrounding communities.” The company did not provide an explanation for the explosion.

It's not immediately clear what impact this will have on SpaceX's development of the Starship rocket system. A recent advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suggested the tenth test flight could have happened as soon as June 29. 

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post seemingly related to the explosion that he considers it to be: “Just a scratch.”

ANOMALY! Just before Ship 36 was set to Static Fire, it blew up at SpaceX Masseys!Live on X and YT:https://t.co/GPjZIX1Zyd pic.twitter.com/CfZhDeSGae

SpaceX has spent the last few years aggressively developing the 171-foot Starship and the massive 232-foot Super Heavy booster that powers it into space. The company started 2025 saying this year would be a “transformational” one for the program, and the FAA recently increased its limit on Starship launches in Texas from 5 to 25.

But Starship, in particular, has had a number of problems this year. The rocket unexpectedly exploded during its seventh test flight in January, and then again in March. It failed again during its ninth test in May.

While the rocket made it further into its most recent flight in May than during the previous two tests, it still failed to deploy the dummy Starlink satellites it was carrying onboard — a crucial step in the company's plan to use the mega-rocket to grow its space-based internet service.

Musk has maintained that SpaceX is on track to try to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, giving it a “50/50” chance in a company update in May. The company is also developing a larger “Version 3” of Starship that, Musk claimed, could fly as early as this year.

Amazon said on Thursday that it would invest about $233 million in its India business to further build out its operations infrastructure, develop new tools for its delivery network, and work on employee safety and well-being programs.

The company said the investment helps it double down on its efforts to deliver to all pin-codes in the country.

“This investment will enhance processing capacity, improve fulfilment speed, and increase efficiency across the company's operations network,” Amazon said in a blog post.

As part of the investment, the company will continue work on some initiatives to support its contractors and employees, including  rest spots for delivery personnel; financial education and support; scholarships for associates' children; and healthcare support for truck drivers. 

Amazon said it is also developing new software and tools to help delivery personnel with navigation, safety, and the overall delivery process.

SpaceX's upper stage prototype, designated Ship 36, exploded in southeast Texas shortly before midnight local time on June 18 during routine preparations for an upcoming test flight.

SpaceX is in the midst of preparing for Starship's next fully integrated test, known as Flight 10. The last several tests haven't gone well, but this prototype never even left the ground. The explosion—as shown in spectacular footage from NASASpaceFlight.com—occurred at SpaceX's Massey facility, a test site located several miles from the launch mount at Starbase, Texas.

The 171-foot-tall (52-meter) Starship upper stage “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,” SpaceX said in a statement on X. “A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for.” The Starbase team is coordinating with local authorities to manage the aftermath of the incident, SpaceX said, adding that, while the company reported no threat to nearby communities, it urged the public to steer clear of the area as safety measures are carried out.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in a few hours after the incident on X, brushing off the incident as “Just a scratch.” He elaborated further this morning, saying the early data “suggests a nitrogen COPV [composite overwrapped pressure vessel] in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,” and that if this proves to be the case, it's the “first time ever for this design.” A COPV is a lightweight tank made of composite fibers wrapped around a thin liner to store high-pressure fluids, according to NASA. No further details are known, but as SpaceNews points out, Starship was being prepared for a static fire test, and the explosion happened before the rocket had a chance to fire its Raptor engines.

A June 18 advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration pointed to June 29 as a potential date for Flight 10, but that seems unlikely now. SpaceX is in a bit of a slump, with this incident adding to the pile of recent setbacks. Flight 7 in January 2024 experienced a propellant leak and fire triggered by unexpected vibrations in the propulsion system. In March, Flight 8 was cut short by a hardware failure in one of the Raptor engines, while Flight 9 in May successfully reached space, but a leak led to loss of control and the vehicle broke apart during reentry.

SpaceX's Starship megarocket is built to carry people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations around the solar system. It's a key part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the Moon by 2027, and is central to Elon Musk's stated goal of colonizing Mars.

Like it or not, large language models have quickly become embedded into our lives. And due to their intense energy and water needs, they might also be causing us to spiral even faster into climate chaos. Some LLMs, though, might be releasing more planet-warming pollution than others, a new study finds.

Queries made to some models generate up to 50 times more carbon emissions than others, according to a new study published in Frontiers in Communication. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, models that are more accurate tend to have the biggest energy costs.

It's hard to estimate just how bad LLMs are for the environment, but some studies have suggested that training ChatGPT used up to 30 times more energy than the average American uses in a year. What isn't known is whether some models have steeper energy costs than their peers as they're answering questions.

Researchers from the Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences in Germany evaluated 14 LLMs ranging from 7 to 72 billion parameters—the levers and dials that fine-tune a model's understanding and language generation—on 1,000 benchmark questions about various subjects.

LLMs convert each word or parts of words in a prompt into a string of numbers called a token. Some LLMs, particularly reasoning LLMs, also insert special “thinking tokens” into the input sequence to allow for additional internal computation and reasoning before generating output. This conversion and the subsequent computations that the LLM performs on the tokens use energy and releases CO2.

The scientists compared the number of tokens generated by each of the models they tested. Reasoning models, on average, created 543.5 thinking tokens per question, whereas concise models required just 37.7 tokens per question, the study found. In the ChatGPT world, for example, GPT-3.5 is a concise model, whereas GPT-4o is a reasoning model.

This reasoning process drives up energy needs, the authors found. “The environmental impact of questioning trained LLMs is strongly determined by their reasoning approach,” study author Maximilian Dauner, a researcher at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences, said in a statement. “We found that reasoning-enabled models produced up to 50 times more CO2 emissions than concise response models.”

The more accurate the models were, the more carbon emissions they produced, the study found. The reasoning model Cogito, which has 70 billion parameters, reached up to 84.9% accuracy—but it also produced three times more CO2 emissions than similarly sized models that generate more concise answers.

“Currently, we see a clear accuracy-sustainability trade-off inherent in LLM technologies,” said Dauner. “None of the models that kept emissions below 500 grams of CO2 equivalent achieved higher than 80% accuracy on answering the 1,000 questions correctly.” CO2 equivalent is the unit used to measure the climate impact of various greenhouse gases.

Another factor was subject matter. Questions that required detailed or complex reasoning, for example abstract algebra or philosophy, led to up to six times higher emissions than more straightforward subjects, according to the study.

There are some caveats, though. Emissions are very dependent on how local energy grids are structured and the models that you examine, so it's unclear how generalizable these findings are. Still, the study authors said they hope that the work will encourage people to be “selective and thoughtful” about the LLM use.

“Users can significantly reduce emissions by prompting AI to generate concise answers or limiting the use of high-capacity models to tasks that genuinely require that power,” Dauner said in a statement.

Nostalgia should not be enough to give any tech a passing grade. But let me come clean. I wouldn't have dropped $65 on the revitalized GameCube controller for Switch 2 if I hadn't spent my preteen years beholden to Nintendo's boxy console. With improved buttons, the new version is better than anything from 2001. After so many years, I've come to see the gamepad as a unique device that's enhanced by its limitations. Instead, it's constrained by Nintendo's own restrictions on where and how you can use it.

See Nintendo Switch 2 at Walmart

See Switch 2+ Mario Kart World Bundle at Walmart

The Switch 2 GameCube controller is exclusive to Nintendo's online storefront, and its availability keeps fluctuating to the point we can't tell when or if it will be back in stock. You can find plenty of recreations that try to emulate the look and feel of the 24-year-old controller all the way down to the nubby, yellow “C” button. Nintendo still allows adapters to connect up to four GameCube controllers on Switch 2. So why would you want the official recreation? Because it works as seamlessly as a Joy-Con or Pro Controller, and compared to many third-party emulations, this is the most pitch-perfect accurate device in terms of raw feel. The big problem is, you can't use it for any other device but the Switch 2. Sorry, you won't be emulating GameCube games with Nintendo's own tech (at least until somebody inevitably hacks it).

Nintendo GameCube Controller for Switch 2

It's an improved rendition of Nintendo's classic controller from 2001 with better buttons and wireless connectivity. I just wish I could use it on other devices.

Pros

Cons

I have hung onto the same original black GameCube and wireless WaveBird controller from my childhood—the joysticks so mangled with caustic adolescent fingers they were worn down to nubs. I'm amazed at how much attention Nintendo paid to improving the new controller while keeping the same feel as the original. I'm comparing a brand-new device to one that's nearly as old as I am, but it appears that Nintendo replaced the squishy rubber pads of the original controller's face buttons with something that's far more snappy and clicky. The switches on the D-pad are far better than on the 24-year-old controller. That directional pad is still small, so I won't be using it for a fighting game anytime soon, but it's a better option for some retro titles.

For launch, Nintendo released just three games for $50-per-year Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur II, and F-Zero GX. You can't play them on the original Switch, and you can't use the new controller on the old handheld, either. Wind Waker is a classic in every sense of the word, but it's the only game on the list that takes advantage of the controller's unique design. I would love to see deep cuts of the GameCube library make their return, like Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and TimeSplitters 2, or other exclusives like Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Nintendo hasn't offered an idea of what will come out next, but I wouldn't advise that you buy this controller in the mere hope we see the return of Killer 7.

The GameCube controller was an odd duckling in 2001 at the release of Nintendo's boxy sixth-gen console. While Sony standardized the twin-stick layout of its DualShock, Nintendo—being Nintendo—crafted a controller that forced developers to design around its oddly shaped buttons and pressure-sensitive trigger buttons. Take Metroid Prime, for example. It was a first-person shooter where that secondary nipple-like C stick went unused in favor of tank controls with a lock-on mechanic.

The design lent itself to entire gaming subgenres. Super Smash Bros. Melee's controls emphasize the “A” and “B” buttons for attacks, while the C stick was geared for hitting quick directional “smash” attacks. In competitive Smash Bros. circles, the GameCube controller is still the gold standard. Nintendo's design ethos clearly hasn't changed much in the 24 years since the original GameCube's launch. Mario Kart World is made to be played with a single Joy-Con, which only requires one joystick, four face buttons, and triggers. The only issue playing the latest Mario Kart with the GameCube controller is that the game doesn't recognize the pressure-sensitive triggers. To drift, you need to press the R button fully until it clicks.

Still, I found I preferred the GameCube controller's thick primary joystick and its octagonal restrictor for precision in Mario Kart. For this plasticky, ultra-purple controller, $65 was a hard pill to swallow. I knew going into it I couldn't use the GameCube controller for every single new Switch 2 game. In place of a proper L1 button, it has a small, flat, square-shaped bumper button. Its top portion, which used to sport a power connector, now has a Home button and “C” switch for GameChat.

It has gyro controls that work for some Switch games, but it won't really work as a stand-in for the official Switch 2 Pro Controller or any other third-party gamepad complete with all the bumpers, triggers, and back buttons you need for modern games. Trying to play Split Fiction with a GameCube controller forced me to remap several buttons to get around the lack of click-in sticks. There's no way you can play a first-person shooter like Cyberpunk 2077 without access to those extra buttons.

The GameCube controller was full of small innovations we take for granted nowadays. In 2002, Nintendo introduced the WaveBird. It was a radio frequency-based wireless controller that required you to connect it on a specific channel. There was no need for line of sight like earlier wireless infrared-based controllers, and it was so good we all cried crocodile tears when it was discontinued in 2008. Nowadays, where Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity are standardized, the wireless connectivity isn't anywhere near unique, but it's far more convenient than plugging your controller into an adapter for every play session. The addition of a Home button adds the convenience of easy access to your in-game screenshots or sleep mode.

The GameCube controller wouldn't be enough if all you used it for were just three games and the hope you'll get to play more later. The significant restrictions Nintendo placed on its functionality with other devices are more than a little frustrating. It's far less versatile than most controllers, but in a way I appreciate it more because of that. If other controllers are a multi-tool, the GameCube controller is a scalpel made for specific use cases—like beating the ever-living snot out of friends in Smash.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","David Zaslav Is Getting a Pay Cut","https://gizmodo.com/david-zaslav-is-getting-a-pay-cut-2000617738","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:15:27 GMT","

David Zaslav, the unfortunate CEO of the company formerly known as Warner Bros. Discovery (the company, which was once two separate companies but became one, is splitting up again), has often been accused of being bad at his job and, now, it would appear that the people who pay his salary may agree.

A new report from Deadline finds that Zaslav is scheduled to receive a sizable pay cut this year. Citing a recent SEC filing, Deadline notes that a new business agreement will “significantly reduce his target annual compensation, including lowering his annual cash compensation opportunity and reorienting the total pay mix toward long-term incentives.” This shift will “foster a stronger alignment with stockholders and incentivize sustained, long-term value creation,” the document says.

In 2023, Zaslav's compensation package was boosted substantially from what it had been in 2022. Zaslav received a package worth approximately $50 million. That represented a 26.5 percent increase over the preceding year in which he reportedly made a total of $39.2 million. Those payouts paled in comparison to 2021, when Zaslav technically made $246 million from stock options appended to a new, multi-year employment contract with the company.

Now, Zaslav will have his wages slashed and capped, so as to better “align” them with a “pay-for-performance” model championed by shareholders, a statement from WBD Board Chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. told Deadline. The outlet expounds on Zaslav's new pay thusly:

After the separation, Zaslav will have a contract through December 31, 2030, and a base salary of $3 million a year. His target annual cash bonus opportunity will be reduced to $6 million, with the actual payout based on the achievement of performance goals established by Streaming & Studios' compensation committee. The annual bonus payout is subject to a cap of 200% of the target amount. Zaslav will also qualify for annual equity awards following the separation under the Streaming & Studios company's equity incentive plan. The target value of the awards will be $15.5 million in the first year that Zaslav receives an equity grant from Streaming & Studios and will decline to an annual target value of $7.5 million per year thereafter.

Zaslav assumed power at Warner Bros. Discovery immediately after the merger between the two, and his strategy (which has often been criticized by consumers and fans alike) was to begin cutting expenses and projects while overseeing a large number of layoffs. The re-splitting of the company has been mocked quite a bit online, though Zaslav has put a happy spin on the development: “The cultural significance of this great company and the impactful stories it has brought to life for more than a century have touched countless people all over the world,” he said, in a statement associated with the split. “It's a treasured legacy we will proudly continue in this next chapter of our celebrated history.”

A high-tech tinkerer has managed to get Apple's iOS to run on the Nintendo Switch. Don't get too excited, though, as PatRyk on X wryly admits they have created “the world's slowest ‘iPhone'.” Booting this Nintendo ‘iPhone' currently takes 20 minutes, and all the apps they tried crash – but it's a start.

While the gaming tech world is all a flutter with the recently launched Switch 2, PatRyk spent two days attempting to shoehorn Apple's mobile OS onto the best-selling hybrid console. This enthusiast's modesty seems to be matched by their patience, as the new Nintendo ‘iPhone' takes 20 minutes to boot. We wonder how many times they waited that length of time, or even longer, for the boot process to hang or otherwise fail?

Using the mobile OS also sounds like an incredible life-sapping chore, with this ‘iPhone' in its current state. PatRyk says that the system “kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash).”

I've lost my mind (and 2 days of my life to install this)Behold: the world's slowest “iPhone” 🎉🎉Takes over 20 minutes to boot, kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash) 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/r3B3JPDUDVJune 17, 2025

At this stage, the project might sound dire, but it shows that running iOS on the original Switch is possible – it just needs optimization. But you aren't going to be ditching your real Apple iPhone for a Switch any time soon.

PatRyk reveals that their Nintendo ‘iPhone' project was only possible thanks to a version of QEMU created for the Apple iPhone 11 by ChefKissInc. QEMUAppleSilicon is a version of the open-source machine emulator and virtualizer tailored for emulating Apple Silicon devices, as per its name.

Over two days of mind-numbing hacking, PatRyk wrangled this GitHub code and the heavily locked-down Apple iOS. Eventually, the tinkering tour de force paid dividends, as PatRyk managed to coax iOS on Nintendo Switch to get out of bed and wash its face on a completely alien system powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1.

To wrap up, PatRyk doesn't indicate whether more hours or days will be devoted to this crazy sounding project. But they say to their followers that they will be back to share further adventures in code, more frequently, so stay tuned.

New overlay also features an fps graph and monitors CPU usage, clock speeds, GPU temps, RAM usage, and more.

Valve is finally working on a full in-game overlay for Steam that provides significantly more information than just frames per second (fps). The June 17th Steam Client Beta introduced an upgraded overlay that monitors hardware usage and supports DLSS/FSR frame generation monitoring.

Valve's new overlay provides significantly more information than before — enough to compete with many third-party overlays. Valve's new overlay is also one of very few monitoring solutions that allows gamers to monitor both native frame rates and AI-generated frames, often referred to as 'fake frames,' simultaneously — a feature that will only become more useful as frame generation technologies become more mainstream.

The new overlay incorporates a more advanced fps monitoring system that includes an fps graph, as well as CPU usage/clock speed monitoring, GPU temperature monitoring, GPU memory usage monitoring, and RAM usage monitoring.



The fps monitoring portion now displays fps and frame rate fluctuations within one second of time. When turned on, the overlay will display the average fps, with two numbers to the right; one is associated with a down arrow and represents the minimum frame rate, and the other is next to an up arrow and represents the maximum frame rate (displayed over one second of time). It isn't quite the same as 1% and 0.1% lows, but Valve believes this is the best way to display potential micro stutter to gamers.

The frame rate graph displays average fps values over a 90-second window with a green line. A red line will appear if major frame rate dips occur, helping gamers detect micro stutter.

The fps section now supports AI-generated frame rate monitoring (as previously mentioned) when DLSS or FSR frame generation is enabled in a game. When active, the overlay will update itself automatically, displaying either ""DLSS"" or ""FSR"" in red and showcasing the number of generated frames next to the regular frame rate counter, allowing gamers to monitor both generated and native frame rates simultaneously.

CPU performance is monitored with the same ""% process utility"" method as it is in Windows. This method measures work done on the CPU based on the chip's base frequency. Microsoft introduced this method of monitoring CPU utilization in Windows 8 to provide a clearer monitoring solution on CPUs with turbo boosting technologies that constantly vary the CPU's clock speed.

Somewhat confusingly, Valve's utilization numbers will regularly exceed 100%, due to the limitations of the aforementioned ""% process utility"" method. The overlay will provide two numbers: the left number represents total processor utility encompassing all cores, while the right number represents the processor utility of a CPU's most-utilized core. Unlike Microsoft's implementation, Valve's CPU monitoring system will take into account turbo boosting, and so utilization percentages will go above 100% regularly on virtually all modern CPUs.

Another major security event acts as a stark reminder to regularly change passwords and login credentials. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


One of the largest data breaches ever seen has recently hit the public, sharing 16 billion brand-new leaked login credentials. While major data breaches of this scale are typically full of billions of previously leaked credentials, today's megaleak is made of almost entirely previously unreported databases.

Cybernews, the team responsible for IDing and cataloging a significant number of previous major leaks, assembled the datasets making up this most recent 16B leak. Only one dataset in the breach, a 184 million-record batch reported by Wired, had been previously reported. The rest are all new from all over the world, including three distinct batches that held over 1 billion credentials each.

The datasets that make up the 16B breach are largely unconnected and have been uncovered by security researchers since January. The largest batch, sourced from Portuguese-speaking populations, contains 3.5 billion credentials, with other major batches named after Russian logins, Telegram logins, and a host of largely generic names.

Concerningly, it is not yet known who originally owned most of the data batches making up the breach. This means that clear action items to wipe your data from these collections cannot be issued, nor can researchers tell what attacks were being considered for the data.

As with all mega security breaches, the 16B mystery leak serves as a loud reminder to practice clean internet hygiene by choosing secure passwords that are changed semi-regularly. The breach has not yet hit the same notoriety as other, snappier-named breaches like the RockYou2024 breach or the 26-billion-logins MOAB breach, meaning data brokers may not have exploited the logins.

It also means that databases that serve to warn users about their compromised data have not yet been populated with the leaked accounts. Internet browsers like Firefox or Chrome that warn users of compromised credentials or third-party tools like Cybernews' data leak checker haven't yet been updated with the newly revealed stolen credentials.

Large collections of stolen credentials like the ones making up this megaleak are often used in major digital offensives like phishing scams or other attacks that scale up well. So ,beyond ensuring your passwords are safe and haven't gone unchanged in 10+ years, being wary of phishing and other likely scams is also good internet safety that should always be practiced, especially in the wake of cybersecurity events like this one.

Master pack picking mistake? Warehouse robot error? Overworked human? Viral marketing ploy? 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A lucky online shopper has taken to social media to boast how they received “a whole box of SSDs instead of one.” Redditor Ok-Middle-1360 bought one 2TB Samsung 990 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 SSD from Amazon, and was understandably surprised when a box of nine units arrived. Redditors were quick to congratulate/complain about the apparent Amazon packing error, and offer up theories as to how such obvious errors happen. It has even been suggested that Amazon randomly picks out buyers for such a ‘jackpot' as a viral marketing ploy.



Ok-Middle-1360 says they paid CAD $200 (USD $146) at checkout, but are now blissfully cradling CAD $1,800 (USD $1,313) worth of fast premium storage. Nine extra M.2 SSDs aren't going to find a home in a mainstream PC setup, though. Laptops usually top out at two M.2 storage connectors, and desktops with four or more are quite rare.

The Redditor could seek to sell-on spare drives, for a nice windfall, or perhaps buy a PCIe M.2 expansion card, or set up a NAS - if they have use for such quantities of storage/functionality. These Samsung 990 EVO Plus devices rival the best SSDs around. Perhaps wisely, though, they have decided to “ride it out” for a while, to see if Amazon reaches out regarding their obvious and expensive error.

It is interesting to pick through the comments on the Amazon jackpot being enjoyed by Ok-Middle-1360. Here you will find a range of well-reasoned theories, and others perhaps less so.

Some of the most credible explanations come from folks who seem to have background knowledge of the inner workings of Amazon's warehouses. For example, someone who currently works at Amazon indicates that this seems to be a warehouse newbie who picked a ‘masterbox' or ‘master pack' from a pallet, rather than an individual product.

Apparently, barcodes can be shared between master packs and single units. However, there should be a few other checks done after picking before a parcel is thrown in the back of a truck. One such check, of weight, would not be far out of its expected range, where tiny PC components get packed in oversized boxes in single/multiple quantities.

Redditors also offer up the hypothesis that AI-powered robotic pickers are sometimes getting things wrong. That wouldn't be such a big surprise, given the above pack nuances.

Plunging deeper into the conspiracy rabbit hole, there are several posts promoting the idea that stories like this NVMe SSD jackpot from Ok-Middle-1360 are just marketing stunts. They are “fake posts… advertisements… viral marketing,” according to some skeptics.

While the best SSD deal you can find right now would ned you an MSI 2TB SSD for 5 cents per gigabyte, this colossal Amazon gaff netted this lucky user 18TB for just $0.008/GB.

Margins or openness? Margins!


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia's recent move to partially open its NVLink interconnect through its NVLink Fusion program has triggered significant interest across the industry, as eight companies have expressed interest in developing CPUs and semi-custom silicon for Nvidia's ecosystem. However, as it turns out, Nvidia retained some of the key NVLink components closed from its partners and may even decide not to grant licenses to certain products and bar their entry into the ecosystem, reports DigiTimes.

Alchip Technologies, one of a few companies permitted to engage with the program, claims that while it can develop full-stack NVLink implementation, it warns that its customers may struggle to deploy their solutions if Nvidia denies their access to certain layers of NVLink protocols. This is because the green company keeps access to protocols (beyond certain levels) gated while controlling the whole software stack. Also, Nvidia mandates a special license from parties that want to use NVSwitches to connect to its GPUs, which further complicates adoption of the technology more or less widely.

Nvidia's NVLink Fusion program by no means makes NVLink an open industry standard. Only select companies among Nvidia's partners get access to it. For now, these are IP companies Cadence and Synopsys; contract chip designer Alchip Technologies; developer of purpose-built connectivity solutions Astera Labs; and CPU designers Fujitsu, Marvell, MediaTek, and Qualcomm. However, there is a catch: only the CPU designers seem to be able to implement NVLink both on hardware and software levels.

Technologies like Nvidia's NVLink typically use multiple protocols, including physical layer protocol (PHY), data link layer protocol, transport protocol, memory coherence protocol, atomic operation protocol, and NUMA protocol. While companies like Alchip can get access to everything related to hardware, the software layer that is responsible for initiating and configuring links is still controlled by Nvidia, and therefore, Alchip clients must get a license and approval from it.

In addition to limiting availability of NVLink Fusion IP to select partners (which is not bad per se, so to speak), Nvidia also require developers of actual platform to implement at least one Nvidia product (CPU, GPU, Switch) into their platform, which brings it additional revenue, but somewhat reduces flexibility of such inventions.

Such a heavily controlled access to the NVLink limits practical use of third-party hardware and restricts seamless interoperability that open standards tend to provide (though NVLink does not seem to be an open standard). Analysts questioned by DigiTimes argue that Nvidia's dominance in AI hardware and its vertical control over software, pricing, and supply create little incentive for genuine openness. Therefore, the NVLink Fusion program looks more like a calculated effort to maintain goodwill among select partners, expand NVLink ecosystem in a controlled manner, enable customers looking for sovereignty to build their own CPUs or special-purpose accelerators, and reduce appeal of competing platforms with UALink, which are expected to start gaining traction in late 2026 – 2027.

At the end of the day, the biggest competitive risk for Nvidia is not a single highly successful product from its rivals, but a competing ecosystem that features multiple competitive processors tailored for specific workloads. While Nvidia cannot stop such an ecosystem from emerging, it can either delay the moment it thrives, or somehow get prepared for its emergence with the help of select partners while preserving its record-high margins.

Edited by Manasi Talwadekar

Azacitidine showed potential in treating patients with VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome, offering high response rates and reducing the use of glucocorticoids. Tocilizumab and anakinra also demonstrated effectiveness, with a higher discontinuation rate seen with the latter.

“The findings of this study provide important real-world evidence to guide clinical practice and future research directions in management of patients with VEXAS syndrome,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Adam Al-Hakim, BMBS, Leeds Institute for Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, Leeds, England. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The sample size was small, which affected the ability to conduct multivariable analyses, thereby affecting the assessment of treatment effectiveness. Clinical response was based on physician opinion, increasing reporting bias and variance. The lack of standardized prednisolone tapering protocols could have influenced response assessments.

No funding was received for this study.

DISCLOSURES |  June 19, 2025  

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are a cornerstone of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment, but it's not clear whether adding chemotherapy to ICI — a common practice with younger patients with NSCLC — helps older ones.

No randomized trial has directly compared stand-alone ICI with chemoimmunotherapy in geriatric patients with NSCLC. Without strong data supporting the combined approach, oncologists may stay away from offering chemoimmunotherapy to older patients, especially to those with multiple comorbidities, given concerns about increased toxicity.

To address the evidence gap, investigators linked Medicare and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to compare outcomes between 14,249 older patients with NSCLC who received ICI alone (pembrolizumab or nivolumab) and 3432 treated with ICI and platinum doublet chemotherapy. Patients were aged 74 years, on average, and at least 66 years. The median follow-up duration was 211 days.

The team weighed the risks and benefits of chemoimmunotherapy vs stand-alone ICI to answer a key question: Is adding chemotherapy to ICI worth it for elderly patients with NSCLC?

The findings were recently published in Jama Oncology.

In the upfront setting, chemotherapy add-on reduced patients' mortality risk by 34% compared with ICI alone. Benefits were slightly more notable in women (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62) than in men (HR, 0.72).

Patients with autoimmune disease — who are often excluded from trials and who made up almost 20% of the study population — benefited the most, with a mortality risk reduction of 49%.

A similar mortality benefit was observed in patients aged 66-75 years and those aged 76 years or older, “which is notable given that immune senescence is hypothesized to lessen ICI treatment response in patients older than 75 years,” wrote the investigators, led by James Heyward, PhD, a pharmacoepidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

However, in the second or later lines of treatment, patients did not experience a significant survival benefit with chemoimmunotherapy (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68-1.03).

Adding chemotherapy in the first-line setting increased the risk for severe immune-related adverse events (AEs), which can include pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis, by 18%. Severe AEs were more common in men (HR, 1.29) than in women (HR, 1.08).

Patients aged 76 years or older had the highest risk (30%) for severe immune-related AEs.

However, older patients did not have an increased risk for severe immune-related AEs in second and later lines.

The study did not consider chemotherapy toxicities.

The team extrapolated from their data to calculate the harm-benefit trade-off of adding ICI to chemotherapy in older patients.

The researchers found that for each extra year of life gained with first-line chemoimmunotherapy, the risk for severe immune-related AEs would be 0.31. Put differently, 31% of patients predicted to gain 1 extra year of life were likely to experience one severe immune-related AE.

Past studies have found that patients are often willing to accept one severe AE for 1 year of added survival, which indicates that chemoimmunotherapy in the first line may be worth it for older patients with NSCLC.

“Given patient prioritization of survival benefits vs prevention of adverse effects, patients may prefer to initiate treatment with ICI + chemotherapy, albeit with careful follow-up for mitigation of severe immune-related AEs,” the investigators wrote.

But, the authors noted, “men experienced more harm and less benefit than women” in the first-line setting, which is consistent with previous research.

And patients with an autoimmune disorder who received chemoimmunotherapy had a slightly higher risk for severe immune-related AEs (HR, 1.22) than those without a disorder (HR, 1.16).

Still, the authors said, “the reduction in mortality was also the highest for this group of patients, suggesting that the potential benefits of treatment may outweigh the potential harms.”

In the second and later lines, the researchers found no increased risk for immune-related AEs with chemoimmunotherapy. Given the lack of statistically significant mortality benefit, the results suggest that stand-alone ICI are a better approach in this setting.

Overall, this study provides “a valuable contribution to an ongoing and complex discussion,” said medical oncologist Alessio Cortellini, MD, PhD, an immunotherapy and lung cancer specialist at Imperial College London, London, England, who was not involved in the research.

However, it will be important to closely monitor patients for severe immune-related AEs.

“While adding chemotherapy to immunotherapy may be appropriate for selected older adults with NSCLC, I remain cautious about its widespread use in frail patients,” Cortellini added. “Until we have dedicated trials in frail populations, the decision to use [chemotherapy-ICI]combinations in older adults should be highly individualized.”

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) showed a 2.6-fold higher risk for depression requiring antidepressant treatment than those without CKD. The greatest risk was observed in those younger than 60 years.

""Our findings argue against strict screening protocols for the detection of depression in all patients with CKD. Though, some awareness should be raised for younger patients, given that depression risk was highest in this subgroup,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Andreas Kommer, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. It was published online on June 12, 2025, in Clinical Kidney Journal.

This study relied on diagnostic codes, which could have led to miscoding or undercoding. The database lacked information on how depression was diagnosed. Additionally, laboratory values were not available for every patient, making it impossible to track the progression of CKD and the initiation of renal replacement therapy.

This study did not receive any grant or funding. Two authors reported receiving support through the Clinician Scientist Fellowship, Else Kröner Research College. One author reported being an employee of IQVIA.

 June 19, 2025  

MILAN — Is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression primarily driven by genetic mutations or by external cues from the tumor microenvironment? Despite major strides in targeted therapies, CLL remains incurable, prompting renewed scrutiny of whether intrinsic genetic alterations or extrinsic cellular forces hold the key to more effective, lasting treatment. 

This central question took the spotlight at the 2025 European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress, sparking a lively debate among leading CLL researchers. 

Most therapies have targeted intrinsic molecular features of leukemic cells, such as BCL2 and BTK. But the lack of robust responses to immunotherapy suggests that external factors such as the tumor microenvironment may also play a role.

“The debate dates back to at least 1999,” said session chair Silvia Deaglio, MD, PhD, director of the Immunogenetics and Transplant Biology Service, City of Health and Science of Turin, Italy in an interview with Medscape Medical News. “That year, two landmark papers showed that mutations in IGHV [immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region] genes were a favorable prognostic marker, supporting a genetic model. But those same studies also identified an unfavorable prognostic marker in a molecule linked to how CLL cells interact with their environment, suggesting a role for the microenvironment as well.”

Eugen Tausch, MD, PhD, researcher at the University of Ulm, Germany, argued in favor of genetics as the primary driver. “All CLLs have at least one genetic driver, and IGHV mutation status is a fundamental and stable biomarker,” he said.

This mutation status affects multiple cellular mechanisms, including immune evasion, anti-apoptotic signaling, and B-cell receptor function. It also modulates how cells respond to cues from their environment, reinforcing the need to consider IGHV when studying microenvironmental influences.

But IGHV is just one piece of the puzzle, Tausch added. More than 200 genetic drivers have been identified in CLL. Roughly 90% of cases harbor at least one gene mutation or chromosomal aberration that affects DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, metabolism, RNA processing, and intracellular signaling. “These alterations have clear clinical implications,” he said. “Resistance to BTK and BCL2 inhibitors often arises through mutations at the drug-binding site, establishing a direct link between genetics and therapy failure.”

Understanding and tracking clonal genetic evolution is thus key to risk stratification, treatment planning, and anticipating disease trajectory, he concluded.

Although CLL has long been seen as a genetically driven malignancy, new data suggest a more nuanced picture in which the tumor microenvironment influences early clonal dynamics.

“We know mutations drive disease progression, especially under therapeutic pressure, but the triggers of these mutations are less clear,” said John Gribben, MD, DSc, Hamilton Fairley Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, UK, who argued in favor of the microenvironment. Accumulation of mutations with age, oxidative stress, antigenic stimulation, and rare inherited factors have all been proposed, but these likely act in concert with tumor microenvironment signals to promote early clonal expansion, he explained.

In lymph nodes and bone marrow, CLL cells interact with a milieu of stromal and nurse-like cells, dysfunctional T cells, and dendritic cells, along with a variety of cytokines and chemokines. Recent studies have shown that early clonal evolution primarily occurs in lymph nodes and is associated with a suppressed T-cell inflammatory response. A small subpopulation of lymph node-activated CLL cells engages with the microenvironment to drive disease progression and possibly influence mutation patterns.

Moreover, therapies that disrupt microenvironmental interactions have shown efficacy by blocking B-cell receptor signaling and impairing chemokine-mediated trafficking.

Even while advocating for the microenvironment's role, Gribben proposed a hybrid model. “Genetic lesions set the stage, but microenvironmental forces shape their emergence and survival. Early on, extrinsic factors dominate. Later, clonal evolution and genetic resistance take over.”

Both speakers emphasized the need to move beyond binary models of CLL progression. “The data support a dynamic interplay,” Deaglio told Medscape Medical News. “The long-term coexistence between leukemic cells and their environment in CLL alters both cell behavior and immune function.” She noted that the T-cell compartment becomes tolerogenic, showing expansion of regulatory T cells and memory effector cells, among other markers.

The debate also touched on the progression from monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis to CLL and on Richter transformation, reinforcing the need for an integrated understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic disease drivers.

Deaglio underlined that researchers are now exploring whether treatment-resistant patients could benefit from new drugs or combinations and whether therapy could eventually be administered for fixed durations rather than continuously until progression.

“Progression is genetically driven,” said Deaglio. “But single-cell sequencing shows that some leukemic cells carry the features that enable future expansion a long time before the disease is diagnosed. Why some clones grow while others do not may depend on the environment they find themselves in.”

Gribben concluded, “To treat CLL effectively, and maybe reach a cure, we'll need to combine immune-based approaches with current targeted therapies.”

Deaglio reported no relevant financial relationships. Tausch reported industry affiliations with AbbVie, BeiGene, Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche, and Janssen-Cilag. Gribben reported research funding from AstraZeneca, BMS/Celgene, and Janssen; clinical trials with AbbVie, Celgene, Epizyme, Gilead, Genmab, Janssen, Merck, MorphoSys, Pharmacyclics, Regeneron, Roche/Genentech, and Takeda; consultancy for AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, BSM/Celgene, Janssen, Kite Gilead, and Takeda; and honoraria from AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, BSM/Celgene, Janssen, Kite Gilead, and Novartis.

DISCLOSURES |  June 19, 2025  

Individuals at risk for sexually acquired HIV have a new injectable option for preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) approval of lenacapavir, according to a press release from manufacturer, Gilead.

Lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo, is the first twice-yearly injectable to be indicated for PrEP for adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (approximately 77 lb).

Lenacapavir is administered via an injection into the subcutaneous layer of fat in the abdomen. The resulting “drug depot” may feel like a bump or nodule but resolves or shrinks before the next injection, according to the company. 

The approval was based on data from a pair of studies, PURPOSE 1 and PURPOSE 2. In the PURPOSE 1 study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, lenacapavir was 100% effective in preventing HIV infection compared to background HIV incidence in cisgender women and significantly more effective than daily oral combination therapy of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada). Notably, the study included pregnant women and adolescents, and the drug was generally well tolerated.

In the PURPOSE 2 study, also published in NEJM, lenacapavir was similarly effective for HIV infection prevention in a population of cisgender men and gender-diverse persons, with only two infections in the more than 2000 individuals randomized to lenacapavir. 

Overall, the injection was well tolerated but is contraindicated for individuals who test positive for HIV; a negative test is required before each injection, according to the company.

The specifics of cost and insurance coverage for lenacapavir remain to be seen, but Gilead's Advancing Access medication assistance program will provide the drug at no cost to eligible patients, according to the press release.

Lenacapavir was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in October 2024 and was approved under the FDA's Priority Review process. Gilead has submitted a marketing authorization application with the European Medicines Agency and filed for regulatory approval in multiple countries worldwide including Australia, Brazil, Canada, and South Africa.

The PURPOSE 1 and 2 studies were funded by Gilead.

Your patient has waited 4 weeks for a 15-minute visit, and you're double-booked and distracted. As physician shortages collide with rising demand, wait times have increased, and appointment delays are the norm, not the exception. Patients are frustrated, and physicians are overwhelmed.

In fact, according to a new survey conducted by AMN Healthcare, the average physician appointment wait time in 15 major metropolitan areas has increased by 19% since the survey was last conducted in 2022 and by 48% since it was first conducted in 2004. This translates to patients waiting 31 days on average to book time with a healthcare provider, up from 26 days in 2022 and 21 days in 2004.

Medscape continually surveys physicians and other medical professionals about key practice challenges and current issues, creating high-impact analyses. For example, Medscape's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Adoption in Healthcare Report 2024 found that

One big surprise about the survey is that appointment wait times weren't even longer, Jeff Decker, president of AMN's physician and leadership solutions division, told Medscape Medical News, adding that in Boston, wait times were the longest (65 days), while Atlanta had the shortest wait times (12 days).

“Anecdotally, we've heard of physician appointment wait times that commonly extend 2 or 3 months or more rather than a few weeks or 1 month,” Decker said. “We think this may be a result of medical practice consolidation, where more physicians are part of large medical groups than has been the case in the past.”

In addition, wait times can vary based on whether (or not) the physician accepts Medicare or Medicaid and tend to be even longer when new patients book an appointment with a specialist. The survey found there was a 42-day wait for obstetricians and gynecologists (ob/gyns), a 40-day wait for gastroenterologists, and a 36.5-day wait for dermatologists, something Dara Spearman, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in private practice in Fort Wayne, Indiana, said sounds accurate.

“There are fewer than 10 dermatologists in Fort Wayne, so this creates quite a backlog,” she said. “Because dermatologists can treat over 3000 diseases, I'm trying to triage a bit and see if we can overlap with other specialties, like having pediatricians or primary care start treatments for a patient with acne, to leave room for patients who need to see us immediately.”

Appointment times for serious cases, such as the skin cancers she sees among her farmer patient population, are Spearman's greatest priority.

“When you're talking about melanoma, time is of the essence,” she said. “Patients have to get in quickly to get it recognized, and the earlier you get it out, the less likely it is to spread. That's why I use the Secure Chat feature on Epic. This way, when primary care reaches out about something they're worried about, I can get that patient in as fast as possible.”

Like Spearman, physicians around the country are coming up with other unique solutions to make sure they can get patients into the office as quickly as their schedules will allow.

For one, partnering with other professionals can open up patient appointment slots, and many medical practices today, both in primary care and in specialty areas, are using advanced practice professionals to do just that.

“Medical practices are using locum tenens physicians to extend services and patient access, particularly during peak usage periods,” AMN's Decker said. “Working alongside nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) will also ease their workload and free up their time.”

Partnering with NPs was exactly what Ashish Nanda, MD, director of Stroke and Neuro-Interventional at Providence Health System in Orange County, California, proposed to his hospital as he sketched out the creation of a stroke clinic there, which will open in August 2025.

“I realized that our stroke patients were getting discharged but needed follow-up to prevent another one from occurring,” Nanda said. “The only way to do that was to see them in clinic, so I proposed a dedicated stroke clinic staffed by one specialist and one NP. With two clinicians, we can see more volume and make sure appointments are easier to book.”

Another way to boost efficiency is to “divide and conquer” health conditions within your own practice.

“For example, one partner in the practice can do skin cancer evaluations while the other can focus on complex dermatology procedures,” Spearman said. “That can be boring for some physicians, but this can really help with scheduling.”

This is something Spearman has observed among her ob/gyn colleagues.

“As ob/gyns get older, many are done with the OB life of being on-call,” she said. “They can opt to focus instead on pelvic disorders or endometriosis. By rethinking how your practice is run, you can streamline the process for patients, too.”

Ultimately, the physicians Medscape Medical News spoke with agree that technology will be the ultimate solution to the extensive physician wait times patients are currently experiencing.

“Right now, physicians are spending 50% of their day on administration, whether it's writing notes, following up on labs, and documenting visits, which means they can't see the many patients that need to be seen in a day,” Nanda said.

In turn, if AI can cut that administrative time down to 10%, it means a physician can double the number of patients they see, which will ease the current bottleneck, added Samuel R. Browd, MD, PhD, professor of neurological surgery at the University of Washington and attending neurosurgeon at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle.

“Our hope is that the emergence of new technology that's clumped under AI is going to create the ability to have more efficiency within the system and allow the current number of providers to be able to scale what they're able to do,” Browd said. “I'm doing clinic today and probably spend half of the time, if not more, managing Epic, doing paperwork, and documenting visits instead of engaging with patients.”

The goal is for AI-powered documentation tools to become more and more of a norm in the hopes that this will help lessen administrative tasks.

“The more burdened we are, the less quality care we can deliver,” Browd said. “The hope is that with AI and other emerging tools, we can create a better work environment, too.”

Happily, Browd says technology is moving rapidly, which may mean that within the next 3-5 years, it will become increasingly easier to make a doctor's appointment — quickly and efficiently.

“If you fast forward to 5 years down the road, what we do day-to-day will be significantly different and will be beneficial in terms of enabling patients to have better access to care,” he said.

This will improve the caregiving experience for physicians, too.

“My hope is that this will also change the work environment for doctors in a positive way,” Browd said. “This will allow us to get back to being doctors, back to the things that brought us into the field in the first place — like taking our time to care for and listen to patients.”

Intense itching of the upper arms following sun exposure is often dismissed as a harmless skin reaction. However, this may indicate a neuropathic condition.

Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a rare and frequently overlooked cause of pruritus, typically localised to the arms and triggered by ultraviolet (UV) radiation in patients with underlying radiculopathy. BRP is a subtype of neuropathic pruritus that occurs most often in fair-skinned women.

A 41-year-old White woman with a past medical history of generalised anxiety disorder and sunburns presented to her general physician (GP) with complaints of sunburn to the bilateral arms, pins and needles, and extreme itching sensation in the bilateral upper arms.

The patient reported that the rash worsened with heat and improved with ice. She also endorsed changes in colour to the rash, hot to touch, tender, mild swelling, and significant nighttime awakening related to the pain associated with the rash.

Earlier treatments with lotions, over-the-counter cortisone cream, and oral Benadryl failed. Only ice application provided brief relief.

The patient's vital signs were stable. Physical examination revealed dark erythema on the sunburned areas of the bilateral upper arms and an atypical skin rash. She was referred for both dermatological and neurologic evaluations.

The dermatologist performed a punch biopsy and allergy test, which showed a nickel allergy. The biopsy report showed sparse lymphohistiocytic, superficial, perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates; features were non-specific, with suggestions that they may be seen in some drug or viral exanthems, gyrate erythema, urticaria, tumid lupus erythematosus, pigmented purpuric dermatosis, and post-inflammatory pigmentary alteration.

The neurologist recommended an MRI of the cervical spine that was normal. The patient was diagnosed with abnormal skin changes and sensory disturbance in the right lateral upper arm with a C5 dermatomal distribution, with recommendations to have dermatology refill topical pain medication (gabapentin 6%, ketamine 4%, and lidocaine 3% cream) and have the GP titrate up the gabapentin dose.

Based on the overall clinical picture and through exclusion of other causes, the GP diagnosed BRP.

The treatment involved a topical formulation containing gabapentin, ketamine, and lidocaine, with oral gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Within 1 month of initiating therapy, the patient experienced marked improvement in both the rash and associated symptoms.

The aetiology of BRP is unknown. It has been attributed to prolonged solar radiation exposure in the summer months, exacerbating underlying cervical spine issues, and is associated with cervical nerve root injury in the setting of osteoarthritis or trauma, resulting in the compression of the nerve root.

Multiple studies have found that BRP is associated with cervical radiculopathy in approximately 57% of patients. The itch and rash associated with BRP are mostly located on the dorsolateral aspect of sun-exposed forearms and are exacerbated by sun exposure. In 75% of cases, both arms were involved.

Other neuropathic conditions, such as notalgia paresthetica, similarly involve spinal abnormalities with dermatomal localisation of itching.

One theory proposes that UV radiation damages peripheral nerve endings and may also lead to neuropathic BRP in individuals predisposed to cervical spinal disease. Most patients describe itch as picking, prickling, burning, or plain itch involving the unilateral or bilateral dorsolateral forearms, which are neuropathic features, suggesting that BRP can be associated with a neurogenic origin.

Patients with BRP report that the application of ice packs provides relief from itching. This is called the ice-pack sign, a key diagnostic indicator of BRP, which is pathognomonic for BRP. This sign was evident in the present case, with itching worsening upon exposure to sunlight and being relieved when ice packs were placed on her forearms bilaterally.

Treatment for BRP has been difficult, but some reported treatments include oral gabapentin, topical capsaicin, oral carbamazepine, cervical spine manipulation, neck traction, physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory medications, surgical resection of the cervical ribs, and sunlight avoidance.

In this patient, symptoms improved significantly within 1 month following treatment with oral gabapentin and a topical containing gabapentin, ketamine, and lidocaine.

Early recognition and diagnosis of BRP by taking a thorough history and physical examination and the utilisation of the ice-pack test are critical for prompt management and avoiding unnecessary workup. Thorough history taking, focused physical examination, and use of the ice-pack test are critical diagnostic steps.

In patients presenting with sunburn to the bilateral arms, pins and needle sensation, extreme itching sensation in the bilateral upper arms, neuropathic dysesthesia of the dorsolateral upper extremities, a visible rash, and stating improvement of pruritus with cold compresses, BRP should be considered as a top differential.

Many of your patients are arduously shifting their diet habits, boosting exercise, and making lifestyle tweaks to shed pounds. Even with these actions in place, they may not be losing weight. During your discussions, they may express their frustration regarding how they are trying their best but not reaching weight loss goals. One culprit that could be standing in the way for your patients is sneaky liquid calories. It's important to discuss how excess liquid calories could be sabotaging well-intentioned patients. Here's how to start the conversation and what to suggest.

Practical advice is the first approach, and this should include a discussion about healthy eating habits and incorporating exercise. In addition, a discussion about setting attainable goals should be addressed.

“Make sure that the roadblock is not because of unrealistic expectations,” said Elisabetta Politi, a registered dietician and certified diabetes educator at the Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center in Durham, North Carolina. “If this is the case, I help them set more attainable goals, encouraging them to continue their journey while emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach.”

Even with the best intentions, your patients may not recognize or realize how liquid calories in their diet could be sabotaging their weight loss goals. This can result from misinformation, as well as failing to understand how some drinks are high-caloric. It can be helpful to point out these liquid calories to patients:

Fruity drinks: Even if some boast vitamin C or other nutrients, their effect on weight loss should be called out. “Although they don't satisfy hunger, they are lower in fiber than fruits and high in sugar — watch especially the added sugar,” Politi said.

Coffee drinks: Despite the health benefits of coffee, knowing the ancillary effects is important for patients to understand. “The combination of sugar, caffeine, and cream can be a powerful appetite enhancer,” Politi said. In fact, your patients may not realize the fancy coffee they drink in the morning contains upwards of ≥ 50 g of added sugar. The American Heart Association suggests that we try to keep our intake of added sugar to a minimum, with a goal of ≤ 36 g for men and 24 g for women, said Amy Bragagnini, MS, RD, CSO, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Alcohol: An occasional drink isn't going to make or break a weight-loss plan, but a discussion about moderation is warranted. “Alcohol may affect commitment to health goals by lowering inhibition,” said Politi. “Besides, calories from alcohol are metabolized fast, which makes weight loss more challenging.”

Regular sodas: These picks present empty calories, excessive sugar, and no nutritional value, Politi added.

Smoothies: Refreshing and trendy, smoothies can go from protein winners to sneaky calorie culprits. “They can become calorie bombs, especially when mixed with fruits, sugary syrup, and ice cream or cream,” cautioned Politi.

Protein drinks: These can be tricky, so reading the label is vital. “It is one thing to have a little protein powder mixed with milk or water, but it's an entirely other thing when one is choosing a ‘protein smoothie' that is more like a milkshake than anything else. I would urge caution to anyone purchasing a protein smoothie topped with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles,” said Bragagnini, with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

To assist your patients, discuss how these liquid calories could be hampering their goals. 

“To those (patients) who don't seem to be interested in making changes, I point out that research has clearly shown that liquid calories are one of the main obstacles to weight loss, no matter the approach they are following,” Politi said. “In a weight loss world with several conflicting recommendations, abstaining and limiting liquid calories is an advice everyone agrees with.”

In her work with patients, she said many are curious to see if reducing liquid calories can help their weight loss journey. To springboard, it could be advisable to suggest scaling down sweetened drinks or diluting them with water or another unsweetened beverage.

The beverage industry has introduced alternatives to sweetened beverages, ranging from carbonated to flavored to infused water and drinks with beneficial prebiotics and probiotics, said Politi.

Bragagnini, with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, discussed how “satiety” plays when we eat or drink certain things. “Take an orange, for example. It may take a while for you to fully peel, separate, and eat the orange, but it may only take a few seconds for you to drink a small glass of orange juice,” she said.

It may be effective to explain to patients how both options may deliver the same number of calories and natural sugar; the process of peeling and eating the orange will likely lead to you feeling more satisfied after consuming it, she said.

Sugar spikes are a cause for concern. Politi, with Duke Lifestyle and Weight Management Center, said this should be brought to the attention of patients with diabetes. “I tell patients with diabetes that one 12 oz can of regular soda contains as many as 10-11 tsp of sugar, which will be rapidly absorbed in their bloodstream, causing a rapid rise of their blood sugar,” she said.

It's important to discuss blood sugar levels with patients. 

“Simple sugars are quickly digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, which can cause rapid increases in blood sugar levels. This can be dangerous for someone with diabetes, as it can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar and potentially damage nerves and blood vessels,” Bragagnini said. “I advise folks to begin checking both food and beverage labels and get familiar with how much added sugar is in the various products they choose.”

DISCLOSURES |  June 19, 2025  

People with both diabetes and asthma appear to face greater metabolic risks than those with either condition alone, according to new observational data.

In a study of more than 18,000 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2001-2020, individuals with both asthma and diabetes (most presumed to have type 2 diabetes) had significantly greater impairments in glucose regulation, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism compared with those who had only one condition alone or neither.

Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) were also elevated in the comorbid group, “supporting a hypothesis of a shared inflammatory mechanism,” Sixtus Aguree, PhD, assistant professor at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington, and colleagues wrote in a poster presented at NUTRITION 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition.

The findings “emphasize the need for integrated clinical strategies that simultaneously target both inflammation and metabolic dysfunction in patients with asthma-diabetes comorbidity,” the authors wrote. “Routine screening for insulin resistance and inflammatory markers in [these] patients may aid in early intervention and risk reduction.”

This points to the need for integrated clinical care, Aguree told Medscape Medical News. “For managing these comorbid conditions, healthcare professionals need to work together. I think that's a better way to treat the person than working in silos.”

Commenting on the findings, Tianshi David Wu, MD, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told Medscape Medical News that these findings align with current evidence.

“Diabetes and asthma have a bidirectional relationship,” Wu explained. “Population studies have shown that patients with diabetes are at higher risk of developing asthma later on, and vice versa. What's still unknown are the mechanisms that explain this finding.”

Wu added that the researchers had put forth a reasonable hypothesis — that systemic inflammation may play a key role in this association.

“The best way to prove this would be with a trial that specifically targets the type of inflammation you think is driving both asthma and diabetes to see how it affects these conditions.”

As a possible blueprint, he pointed to cardiology, where patients with heart failure and diabetes are preferentially treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, which are effective at treating both conditions.

“In the asthma world, I don't think the evidence is there yet to recommend any specific diabetes medication, but there is plenty of real-world data suggesting some benefit, and there are two clinical trials ongoing testing semaglutide and metformin to see if they can improve asthma,” Wu said.

The study included 18,370 nationally representative US adults. Among them, 8.2% had diabetes without asthma, 7.4% had asthma without diabetes, 83.3% had neither (controls), and 1.2% had both. BMI was highest in the combined asthma-diabetes group (35.9 kg/m2 vs 28.2 kg/m2 in controls, P < .001), as was waist circumference (117.6 cm vs 97.3 cm, P < .001).

Insulin resistance, defined as a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) > 2.5, was present in 41% of controls, 46.8% with asthma only, 77.3% with diabetes only, and 85.6% with both conditions.

The HOMA-IR score in the asthma-diabetes group was significantly higher than in controls (9.85 vs 2.96, P < .001).

Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the odds of insulin resistance were nearly eight times higher in the asthma-diabetes group than in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 7.89; P < .001), even after adjusting for BMI, sex, and medication use.

“We didn't expect insulin resistance to be that much higher in the combination of asthma and diabetes. That shocked us,” Aguree said.

Asthma alone was not significantly associated with insulin resistance (OR, 0.76; P = .220), “underscoring the additive impact of coexisting diabetes,” the authors wrote in their poster.

Absolute values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were 115.9 mg/dL and 114.5 mg/dL, respectively, for controls and asthma only, vs 98.9 mg/dL and 104.8 mg/dL for diabetes only and asthma-diabetes groups, respectively. The lower value in those with diabetes is likely due to greater use of statins, Aguree noted.

In contrast, compared with controls, those in the asthma-diabetes group had significantly lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, while triglycerides and the triglyceride/HDL ratio were higher (P < .001 for all). Systolic blood pressure was also significantly higher in the comorbid group (P < .001), as was diastolic blood pressure, although to a lesser extent (P = .012).

A1c levels were 5.41% in controls and 5.46% in the asthma-only group, both significantly lower than levels in the diabetes group (7.34%) and the comorbid group (7.11%), Aguree said.

Log-CRP values were 0.530 units higher in the asthma-diabetes group than in controls (P < .001), as were hs-CRP (1.70 mg/L vs 0.60 mg/L, P < .001).

Aguree and colleagues are now expanding their analysis to include longitudinal data and evaluate integrated interventions, such as combined anti-inflammatory and glucose-lowering medications, as a means of reducing the burden of both conditions.

Aguree had no disclosures. Wu declared receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health and the American Lung Association.

DISCLOSURES |  June 19, 2025  

Problematic patterns of digital media use — including compulsive social media scrolling, gaming, or phone checking — may be more harmful to adolescent mental health than overall screen time, new research suggested.

Investigators found that teens with high or increasing levels of addictive digital use were more likely to report symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In contrast, total screen time showed no consistent link to mental health outcomes.

The findings support emerging evidence that addictive screen use may be a more salient risk factor for suicidality and mental health in adolescents, the researchers, led by Yunyu Xiao, PhD, Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine/New York Presbyterian, noted.

The study was published online on June 18 in JAMA.

Previous research has largely focused on total screen time rather than longitudinal addictive use trajectories.

To address this gap, the investigators analyzed 4 years of data from 4285 children (mean age, 10 years; 48% women) participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study.

Validated self-report questionnaires were used to assess and track addictive use of social media, cell phones and video games, including compulsive habits, distress when not using these platforms, and failed attempts to cut back.

The researchers used latent class linear mixed models to identify different trajectories of addictive screen use and classify adolescents into subgroups based on their screen use patterns over time.

They found that nearly one third of participants had an increasing addictive use trajectory for social media or mobile phones starting at age 11 years.

In adjusted models, increasing addictive use trajectories were associated with higher risks for suicide-related outcomes than low addictive use trajectories. Increasing addictive use of social media had a risk ratio of 2.14 for suicidal behaviors.

Likewise, high addictive use trajectories across all screen types were associated with suicide-related outcomes. High-peaking addictive use of social media conferred a risk ratio of 2.39 for suicidal behaviors.

Adolescents with high-peaking or increasing social media use or high video game use also had more internalizing symptoms such as depression/anxiety or externalizing symptoms such as aggression and rule-breaking.

Notably, there was no significant correlation between baseline total screen time and any suicide-related or mental health outcomes.

The authors of a linked editorial noted that adolescence is a vulnerable time for addictive behaviors in general and that young adolescents are particularly susceptible to screen addiction.

They pointed out that the current study underscores the “growing concern” around addictive screen use and its significant impact on the mental health of young people.

“While most interventions focus on limiting or monitoring screen time, the current study suggests that preventive strategies may also target trajectories or patterns of addictive screen use,” wrote Jason Nagata, MD, Christiane Helmer, MPH, and Abubakr Al-Shoaibi, PhD, with University of California, San Francisco.

“These results emphasize the importance of addressing not just screen time but also addictive behaviors in adolescents” and the need to “conceptualize screen time and addictive use as separate constructs, particularly when examining associations with mental health outcomes,” the editorialists added.

Several experts offered perspective on the study in a statement from the UK nonprofit Science Media Centre.

Lisa Henderson, PhD, head of the Department of Psychology, University of York, York, England, called the study “critical and timely” and one that contributes a “much-needed large-scale longitudinal analysis to the debate on digital harms in young people.”

The fact that 1 in 2 adolescents had a high addictive use trajectory for video games, 1 in 3 for social media, and 1 in 4 for mobile phone use, is “alarming, although some caution should be taken in extrapolating these findings to now given this study spanned the pandemic,” Henderson commented.

She also noted that the study did not directly address “bidirectionality — that young people at greater risk of mental health problems may be more likely to turn to digital activities such as video gaming and social media, with this in turn feeding a further downward spiral in mental health.”

Chris Ferguson, PhD, professor of psychology, Stetson University, DeLand, Florida, highlighted two takeaways from the study — one is that time spent on screens does not predict mental health, and the other is that for some kids overusing screens can be a red flag for other problems.

Ferguson said it would be “a mistake to think that removing screens would solve those problems…; this study doesn't show that. However, screen overuse can be a sign that kids are stressed in other areas. Other studies suggest this typically comes from schools and families, not the screens themselves.”

Amy Orben, DPhil, with the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England, said the study “importantly highlights that why and how young people use technologies, and how they feel technologies affect their lives, may matter more to their mental health than the time spent online. As those reporting such issues are not a small proportion of the population, supporting them should be taken seriously.”

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Google. Xiao and the editorial writers, Henderson and Ferguson, reported no relevant disclosures. Orben is a paid member of the Digital Futures for Children Centre Advisory Board and has received payment for lectures from SWGfL and Apple University, and consulting fees from Innovate UK through Opalescent Ltd.

Knee braces, water therapy and exercise are the most promising non-drug therapies for treating knee osteoarthritis, according to a new meta-analysis publishing June 18, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Yuan Luo of the First People's Hospital of Neijiang, China.

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common and often debilitating condition that affects millions of older adults, causing pain and stiffening of the knee joint. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory drugs, which are linked to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events.

In the new study, researchers examined the current evidence on non-drug therapies for treating KOA. They looked at data from 139 clinical trials involving nearly 10,000 people to compare 12 different non-drug treatments. These included laser therapy, electrical stimulation, braces, insoles, kinesiology tape, water-based therapy, exercise, and ultrasound. By combining results from all these studies into a powerful network meta-analysis, the team could rank the therapies based on how well they worked.

Knee braces came out on top across most categories, including reducing pain, improving function, and relieving stiffness. Hydrotherapy-exercises or treatments performed in warm water-was particularly effective at easing pain and general exercise was also consistently effective, improving both pain and physical function. High-intensity laser therapy and shock wave therapy showed some benefits, while ultrasound consistently scored the lowest in effectiveness.

The authors caution that differences in study design, small sample sizes, and variability in treatment duration between the 139 included studies may limit the precision of the rankings. However, they conclude that physical therapy has promising effects on KOA, offering potential treatments without the risks of anti-inflammatory drugs. Future studies should examine the clinical efficacy of combined therapies, as well as their cost-effectiveness.

The authors add: ""Knee braces, hydrotherapy, and exercise are the most effective non-drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis. They reduce pain and improve mobility without the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks linked to common pain medications. Patients and clinicians should prioritize these evidence-based options.""

""Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions.""

How do living things evolve? What is the myriad of processes by which generic variations in a population affect organisms' survival and allow reproduction in an ever-changing environment? Why do these processes often crawl over millennia and yet, sometimes, rapid and substantial evolutionary changes occur?

Utah State University evolutionary biologist Zachariah Gompert explores chromosomal arrangements, where large chunks of chromosomes are inverted, moved, deleted or duplicated as a possible source of large-scale macromutations.

Adaptive evolution is driven by natural selection, which generates populations better adapted for survival and reproduction. A current focus of debate is whether adaptive evolution relies on many mutations with small and roughly equal effects or if it is driven by one or a few mutations that cause major changes in traits and Darwinian fitness.""

Zachariah Gompert, associate department head and professor in USU's Department of Biology and the USU Ecology Center

To pursue this question, Gompert was awarded a five-year, $1.85 million Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA) from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health.

Gompert, who has long studied fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including pursuing case studies of the genetic basis of adaption in stick insects (Timematidae) and butterflies (Lycaenidae), will continue study of these organisms, along with seed beetles (Chrysomelidae).

He says the NIH funding will create multiple opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students to receive thorough education in basic research experimentation while exploring genomics research, and developing skills and experience in such areas as molecular biology and whole genome sequencing.

""We'll generate whole genomes and identify chromosomal variations that tie into evolution and trait variation,"" Gompert says. ""Through this research, participants will gain skills that are transferrable across diverse scientific disciplines. This expertise has application to biomedical research on the role of genomics in health sciences, as well as application to applied research in agricultural genetics - both of which are rapidly growing fields.""

In addition, he says, student researchers will develop knowledge of computational data analysis, ranging from traditional computational approaches to innovative methods in machine learning.

""As an affiliated faculty member in USU's new Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, I anticipate collaborations with scholars beyond the Department of Biology who wish to pursue varied data science projects data generated from our efforts,"" Gompert says. ""The NIH award opens great opportunities for our research here at Utah State and for our students and community partners.""

Most treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) only slow disease progression. Early intervention for the neurological disease that worsens over time is therefore critical to optimize care, but that requires early diagnosis. Current tests, like clinical rating scales and neural imaging, can be subjective and costly. Now, researchers in ACS' Analytical Chemistry report the initial development of a system that inexpensively screens for PD from the odors in a person's ear wax.

Previous research has shown that changes in sebum, an oily substance secreted by the skin, could help identify people with PD. Specifically, sebum from people with PD may have a characteristic smell because volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by sebum are altered by disease progression - including neurodegeneration, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, when sebum on the skin is exposed to environmental factors like air pollution and humidity, its composition can be altered, making it an unreliable testing medium. But the skin inside the ear canal is kept away from the elements. So, Hao Dong, Danhua Zhu and colleagues wanted to focus their PD screening efforts on ear wax, which mostly consists of sebum and is easily sampled.

To identify potential VOCs related to PD in ear wax, the researchers swabbed the ear canals of 209 human subjects (108 of whom were diagnosed with PD). They analyzed the collected secretions using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques. Four of the VOCs the researchers found in ear wax from people with PD were significantly different than the ear wax from people without the disease. They concluded that these four VOCs, including ethylbenzene, 4-ethyltoluene, pentanal, and 2-pentadecyl-1,3-dioxolane, are potential biomarkers for PD.

Dong, Zhu and colleagues then trained an artificial intelligence olfactory (AIO) system with their ear wax VOC data. The resulting AIO-based screening model categorized with 94% accuracy ear wax samples from people with and without PD. The AIO system, the researchers say, could be used as a first-line screening tool for early PD detection and could pave the way for early medical intervention, thereby improving patient care.

This method is a small-scale single-center experiment in China. The next step is to conduct further research at different stages of the disease, in multiple research centers and among multiple ethnic groups, in order to determine whether this method has greater practical application value.""

Humans have tens of thousands of genes, many of which produce proteins essential to basic bodily functions. The KCNT1 gene, for example, codes for a protein that maintains normal electrical activity in the brain and helps neurons communicate.

But genes don't always function perfectly.

For many people, a mutation of the KCNT1 gene causes no symptoms. For others, it can lead to dysfunction of neuronal activity causing learning disabilities, difficulty communicating, and a lifetime of treatment-resistant seizures.

Epileptic disorders caused by mutations in KCNT1 affect an estimated 3,000 children in the United States. Associate Professor Matthew Weston and his team with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC want to bring that number to zero.

With a grant from Actio Biosciences, Weston is testing whether an Actio KCNT1 inhibitor that modulates potassium levels can reduce seizures. If successful, the inhibitor could offer a treatment for an aggressive form of epilepsy that significantly reduces life expectancy.

The mutations cause abnormal amounts of potassium to flow through the ion channel. So the idea is: If you give people a blocker that will limit that potassium flow, could you improve the disease?""

Matthew Weston, Associate Professor, Virginia Tech

The research is in its early stages, but initial results indicate that the KCNT1 inhibitor reduces seizures in mice.

Given favorable pre-clinical data, Weston said the best-case scenario is that ""the drug enters clinical trials and works not just to stop seizures, but maybe even improve some of the other symptoms.""

The inhibitor is on track to enter clinical trials, which would allow patients to receive the investigational drug as early as 2026.

Actio Biosciences is a San Diego-based precision medicine company focused on drug development for genetic and rare diseases.

Weston is a scientific advisor to the KCNT1 Epilepsy Foundation, which seeks to advance research that could lead to cures for KCNT1-related epilepsy.

A major study finds that workers who stick to traditional or modernized Japanese diets report fewer symptoms of depression, highlighting the mental health power of culturally tailored nutrition.

Association between the Japanese-style diet and low prevalence of depressive symptoms: Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health Study. Image Credit: rocharibeiro / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, a group of researchers evaluated the association between adherence to traditional and modified Japanese dietary patterns and the prevalence of depressive symptoms in a working Japanese population.

Depression affects over 280 million people globally and is a major contributor to disability and economic loss. Among working adults, mental health challenges can hinder productivity and increase absenteeism. Nutrients such as vitamin D, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids play individual roles in maintaining mental health.

Researchers have been studying individual roles, but there is now growing interest in how overall dietary patterns affect our mental health. The Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) have shown consistent associations with reduced depressive symptoms in Western populations. However, research in Japan has yielded inconsistent results, partly due to the use of sample-specific diet scoring systems. Hence, further research is needed using culturally grounded dietary measures.

This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health (J-ECOH) study, which was collected between 2018 and 2021 across five companies and six study sites. A total of 12,499 participants completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and an 11-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-11).

Dietary scores were calculated for both traditional and modified Japanese diets. The traditional score included white rice, miso soup, soy products, cooked vegetables, fish, salty foods, mushrooms, seaweed, and green tea. The modified score replaced white rice with whole or minimally processed grains, reversed scoring for salty foods, and added raw vegetables, fruits, and dairy products. Participants were classified into quartiles based on their respective adherence scores.

Multilevel Poisson regression with robust variance was used to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) for depressive symptoms, demographic and lifestyle factors, and treating study site as a random effect. Sensitivity analyses excluded participants with known mental disorders and examined effects by COVID-19 periods and survey method.

Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, education, working hours, alcohol intake, smoking, and body mass index. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05, and analyses were performed using Stata Multiprocessor (MP) version 18 statistical software.

Among 12,499 participants, 30.9% were identified as having depressive symptoms. The average participant age was 42.5 years, and women were 12% of the sample. It was observed that individuals with higher adherence to both traditional and modified Japanese diets were older, married, better educated, and more physically active. They also reported lower rates of smoking and long working hours.

There was a clear inverse relationship between diet adherence and depressive symptoms. For the traditional Japanese diet, the chances of having depressive symptoms decreased as diet scores increased, with adjusted PRs of 1.00 (reference), 0.94, 0.91, and 0.83. A similar trend was observed for the modified Japanese diet, with values of 1.00 (reference), 0.94, 0.83, and 0.80. In both cases, the trend was statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001).

These results remained consistent after excluding participants with a history of mental disorders. Both diets showed similar protective associations, despite the modified version including additional nutrient-dense foods.

Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger association among participants with higher educational attainment, possibly reflecting better health literacy. Interestingly, no significant associations were found among those working more than 46 hours per month, which the authors suggest may reflect stress and fatigue overriding any potential dietary benefits. The relationship held steady across the pre-coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and COVID-19 periods, indicating resilience to external stressors.

Mechanistically, the Japanese diet's protective effect may stem from its nutrient-dense components. Folate in seaweed and vegetables may support the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish are thought to have anti-inflammatory properties and support brain function.

Antioxidants found in green tea and vegetables may help reduce oxidative stress, while dietary fiber from soy, mushrooms, and seaweed may promote the health of the gut microbiota, which in turn influences mood through the gut-brain axis. Additionally, umami-rich foods like miso and fermented soy may help promote relaxation by reducing heart rate and stimulating the body's parasympathetic nervous system.

Although the modified Japanese diet was designed to address deficiencies, such as low calcium and fiber, and high sodium, in the traditional version, both diets had similar impacts. This may be because between 62% and 84% of participants consumed the added components, such as dairy and whole grains, less frequently than the dietary score thresholds.

Overall, the findings emphasize the potential mental health benefits of holistic dietary patterns deeply rooted in cultural eating habits. The results may have significant implications for mental health strategies in workplace wellness programs and public health policies.

To summarize, this large-scale cross-sectional study demonstrated that higher adherence to both traditional and modified Japanese dietary patterns is associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms among working adults.

While causality cannot be assumed due to the study's design, and the findings may not be generalizable to all populations since participants were primarily from large, urban companies, the present findings align with previous research suggesting that culturally specific diets play a positive role in supporting mental health.

By incorporating nutrient-dense, whole foods commonly found in Japanese cuisine, individuals may experience psychological benefits. These insights may support the development of dietary interventions and public health strategies aimed at reducing depression through culturally relevant nutrition.

New research reveals that people infected with COVID-19 in California prisons face a lasting, higher risk of diabetes, even months after recovery, underscoring the urgent need for targeted healthcare strategies in vulnerable populations.

Study: COVID-19 Increases the Rate of Incident Diabetes: A Case-Control Cohort Time-to-Event Study. Image Credit: Anatoliy Cherkas / Shutterstock

*Important notice:  medRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

A recent study posted to the medRxiv preprint* server reported that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the rate of incident diabetes mellitus (DM). Most COVID-19 cases have not been fatal worldwide, albeit many involved symptomatic illness, hospitalization, and significant comorbidity.

The long-term effects of COVID-19 are poorly understood. Long COVID refers to a diverse range of conditions and symptoms lingering for over three months after acute COVID-19. Studies suggest an increase in the incidence of chronic conditions post-COVID-19, including neurological and cardiovascular conditions and DM.

However, the evidence base for increased DM incidence post-COVID-19 has various limitations. That is, despite the high rates of both DM and COVID-19 in the United States, minorities, especially non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations, are underrepresented in many studies, limiting generalizability. Further, some studies were not designed to exclude and ascertain preexisting DM or confounding diagnoses or medications that may increase blood glucose.

In the present study, researchers in California, U.S., examined the extent to which the first COVID-19 diagnosis increases DM risk. A key strength of this research is its large, racially and ethnically diverse population, which addresses a significant limitation in prior studies. First, they identified individuals who were continuously incarcerated in 31 California state prisons between January 2019 and February 2020 (pre-pandemic period) and who were at least incarcerated for one day during the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning March 2020).

Individuals with prior DM, history of confounding medication/diagnosis, those lacking measurements of body mass index and blood glucose before the pandemic, and those without COVID-19 and DM testing during the pandemic were excluded. The primary outcome was the time to incident DM, and the exposure was severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. All participants contributed a non-exposure observation time.

Subjects with a positive COVID-19 test before DM diagnosis started exposure time at day 31 after the positive sample collection date. Censoring events were death, release from prison, positive COVID-19 test, confounding medication/diagnosis, and termination of observation (March 1, 2023). Cox proportional hazards models assessed the relationship between COVID-19 and incident DM, adjusted for gender, age, ethnicity, baseline clinical characteristics, and healthcare system use patterns.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of estimates by modifying the definition of the exposure period to 0, 61, and 91 days after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive. Additional analyses were performed to determine whether variations in DM diagnostic intensity following a positive COVID-19 test would explain the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the DM incidence rate.



The Figure shows the predicted cumulative hazard of incident diabetes mellitus over time (lines) and associated 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals (shaded regions) of these predictions under two scenarios: a) no one in the study cohort was infected with COVID-19 (dashed line, blue shaded region); b) everyone in the study cohort was infected with COVID-19 (solid line, red shaded region).

A total of 29,470 individuals were included in the analyses. Of these, 58.3% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the diagnosis of DM or censoring. These subjects contributed to over 15.8 million days and 8.9 million days of pre-exposure and exposure periods, during which 690 and 429 individuals were diagnosed with DM, respectively. This corresponded to crude DM rates of 17.6 and 15.9 per 1,000 person-years in COVID-19 and uninfected populations, respectively.

The COVID-19 population was older and had lower testing rates than the overall population. COVID-19 was associated with a significantly increased rate of incident DM, with a hazard rate ratio of 1.17. COVID-19 increased the cumulative hazard of DM at one-year and two-year follow-up periods.

Specifically, the study projected that if the entire cohort had been infected with COVID-19, the 2-year cumulative risk of a new diabetes diagnosis would have been 3.2%, compared to 2.7% if none had been infected. Modifying the exposure period definition to 61 or 91 days after a positive test yielded consistent findings.

However, while the magnitude and direction were similar for the zero-day definition, the association was no longer significant. Besides, while modifying the definition of the exposure period changed the number of people with COVID-19, the crude DM rates with COVID-19 were still greater than 17 per 1,000 person-years. Further, confounding due to variations in DM diagnostic intensity post-COVID-19 implied that the effect would be halved, with an estimated adjusted HRR between 1.08 and 1.10.

In summary, the findings suggest that the first COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased rate of incident diabetes mellitus. This increase in incident DM due to COVID-19 lingers for months, even after excluding the three months after acute infection.

These findings have specific health policy implications and raise questions for future research. The authors suggest that clinical systems providing care to incarcerated populations should be aware of the elevated DM risk post-COVID and emphasize the importance of linking individuals to health insurance and accessible healthcare upon their release. It will be crucial to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 variants have similar effects on the incidence of DM and whether prior infection and vaccination may modify the elevated DM incidence.

The authors also highlight important caveats regarding the study's setting. Generalizing findings from a carceral population to the non-incarcerated population is not straightforward, as incarcerated individuals experience unique stressors, different nutritional standards, and higher rates of premature aging.

Furthermore, the impact of the pandemic was more severe in prisons, with infection and mortality rates 3-5 times higher than in the general community. These factors may indicate that the magnitude of COVID-19's impact on diabetes risk may differ in other populations.

Gotham FC vs. Bay FC

See you on Sat 6/21

JERSEY CITY, N.J. (June 19, 2025) - Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham has been named to the 20-player U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team roster for two upcoming friendlies against Japan.

The first match is set for Friday, June 28, at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, with kickoff scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET. The game will stream live on Max in English and in Spanish on Telemundo Deportes' Facebook and YouTube channels.

The second meeting between the two sides will take place on Monday, July 1, in a closed-door scrimmage at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center in Riverside, Missouri — the training facility of the Kansas City Current. The two-match series serves as preparation for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, set for this November.

Whitham is one of four NWSL players named to the U.S. roster.

A native of California, Whitham made her NWSL regular-season debut earlier this year, entering as a substitute in Gotham FC's season opener against Seattle Reign FC. At 14 years old, she became the youngest player to appear in an NWSL regular-season match.

This season, Whitham has made five regular-season appearances for Gotham FC, totaling 58 minutes.

by

World Cup champion and National Women's Soccer League legend Meghan Klingenberg announced her retirement from professional soccer on Wednesday in a letter shared on social media. 

The post, which was a collaboration with the U.S. women's national team and U.S. Soccer, started, “This isn't a surprise. But it still feels big to say. It's time – I'm retiring from football.”

She also added a cheeky caption which read, “Now available for charity matches, Sunday brunches and pool parties… preferably all in the same day.”

A post shared by Meghan Klingenberg (@meghankling)

Klingenberg, 36, most recently played with Portland Thorns FC, but elected to depart the club at the end of the 2024 season. She spent eight years there and won two NWSL championships as well as two NWSL Shields.

After winning two national championships at North Carolina, Klingenberg was selected by the Washington Freedom in the 2011 WPS Draft. She was traded to the Boston Breakers and later played for the Western New York Flash, as well. 

Klingenberg spent the 2012 and 2013 seasons with Tyresö FF in Sweden, then joined the Houston Dash of the upstart NWSL as a 2014 expansion draft selection. She played there until a 2015 trade sent her to Portland.

For country, Klingenberg represented the U.S. at the U-16, U-17, U-20 and U-23 levels. She retires with 75 caps earned between 2011 and 2018. She was a key fixture in the 2015 World Cup title run, playing every minute for the U.S.

Later in the day, Klingenberg sat down with former teammates Becky Sauerbrunn and Lindsey Horan to discuss her decision on the first episode of the new U.S. Soccer Podcast, which she will co-host alongside David Gass and Alejandro Bedoya.

In addition to joining the podcast, Klingenberg is also a founding partner in lifestyle brand and media company Re-inc., alongside Tobin Heath, Christen Press and Megan Rapinoe.

Micayla Johnson Named to United States Under-17 Women's National Team Training Camp Roster

Chicago Stars Julia Grosso, Micayla Johnson and Natalia Kuikka will join their respective national teams for the June/July international window. Grosso returns to Canada's roster and Kuikka will represent Finland, while Johnson is set for training camp with the United States Under-17 team.

Julia Grosso returns to the Canadian Women's National Team (CANWNT) for the fourth time in 2025, joining her country for a pair of friendlies. Grosso scored twice on international duty this year and most recently joined Canada for a pair of friendlies against Haiti. In the June/July international window, Grosso and the CANWNT will first take on Costa Rica in a friendly match at BMO Stadium in Toronto, Canada, June 27 at 6:30 p.m. CT. The Canadians then head to the United States, facing off with the U.S. Women's National Team at Audi Field in Washington, D.C., July 2 at 6:30 p.m. CT.

Natalia Kuikka joins Finland for the first time since February, making her return to the Helmarit after recovering from an anterior knee sprain suffered during international duty earlier this year. Finland will first host a training camp before heading to a friendly against the Netherlands June 26 at 1 p.m. CT, taking place at Cambuur Stadion in Leeuwarden, Netherlands. Kuikka's long-awaited return to the Helmarit comes just before Finland begins their 2025 UEFA Women's EURO campaign against Iceland July 2.

Micayla Johnson rejoins the United States Under-17 Women's National Team (USWNT U-17) training camp roster for the first time since the USWNT U-17 qualified for the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup in April. Johnson scored a team-high four goals in the three qualifiers, with a goal against Trinidad and Tobago, a goal and an assist against Honduras and a brace and an assist against El Salvador. Altogether, the USWNT U-17 scored 17 goals against their opponents in the matches, and kept clean sheets against all three, as well. In preparation for the FIFA Under-17 Women's World Cup, taking place in October, the USWNT U-17 will host Japan for two friendlies in Kansas City, Missouri. The first match, held at CPKC Stadium June 28 and kicking off at 6:30 p.m. CT, is open to the public, while the USWNT U-17's second meeting with Japan will be a closed-door friendly.

Before Grosso, Kuikka and Johnson depart for international duty, they will head to Portland, Oregon, with Chicago Stars FC. The club's last match before to the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) midseason break will see the Chicago Stars take on Portland Thorns FC June 21 at 9 p.m. CT at Providence Park. During the NWSL break, the Chicago Stars will participate in the Teal Rising Cup alongside hosts, Kansas City Current, and Brazilian clubs, Corinthians SC and Palmeiras, in Kansas City, Missouri, July 12 and 15. The Stars return to regular-season action at home August 1, hosting Gotham FC for the club's Bark in the Park match at SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview, Illinois, kicking off at 7 p.m. CT.

Training camp will open Monday ahead of two friendlies against Ireland and one vs. archrival Canada in Washington.

Two players absent from the U.S. women's national soccer team for an extended time because of injuries will return for three summer friendlies, Coach Emma Hayes announced Wednesday.

Washington Spirit midfielder Croix Bethune and Gotham FC midfielder Rose Lavelle were among 25 players invited to training camp ahead of two matches against Ireland this month and a July 2 showdown with archrival Canada at Washington's Audi Field.

Bethune, the 2024 NWSL rookie of the year, will report to the top-ranked United States for the first time since being part of the gold medal campaign at the Paris Olympics. A few weeks after returning from France, she tore her meniscus during a ceremonial first pitch at a Washington Nationals game and missed the Spirit's run to the NWSL final.

The 24-year-old sat out the first five games this season before appearing in seven straight. She has started four in a row and on June 8 logged her first 90-minute game.

The Sports Moment newsletter

Lavelle, 30, last played for the national team Dec. 3 against the Netherlands before undergoing ankle surgery. She returned to Gotham this month for a pair of substitute appearances totaling 28 minutes. With 110 U.S. appearances, Lavelle is the most experienced player named to a roster averaging about 18 caps.

Training camp will open Monday ahead of the team's June 26 match against No. 25 Ireland in Commerce City, Colorado. The rematch will take place June 29 in Cincinnati.

“We want to continue to improve our understanding of how we want to play and widen the player pool,” Hayes said in a statement. “On this roster, we have players with a varied amount of experience, and my priority is to deepen the exposures required for international soccer. These are three challenging matches and as always, we want to win, but also to make sure we are ready for the next steps.”

Hayes gave the summer off to all but one of the Europe-based players who just completed club seasons, including Lindsey Heaps, Crystal Dunn and Emily Fox. The exception is center back Naomi Girma, who, because of injury, made just seven appearances for English champion Chelsea since her record-setting transfer from the San Diego Wave in January.

Defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza received their first call-ups, joining goalkeepers Angelina Anderson and Claudia Dickey in seeking to make their debuts. All but six invitees have fewer than 10 appearances.

At 18, Bugg is the youngest on the roster, joining Olivia Moultrie, Claire Hutton and Gisele Thompson, who are 19.

Hayes's integration of young players is part of her plan to strengthen the pipeline between the youth squads and the senior team ahead of the 2027 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. On Friday, the U.S. Soccer Federation will name an under-23 squad, featuring almost entirely NWSL players, for a Colorado camp.

Goalkeepers: Angelina Anderson (Angel City), Claudia Dickey (Seattle), Mandy McGlynn (Utah).

Defenders: Kerry Abello (Orlando), Jordyn Bugg (Seattle), Naomi Girma (Chelsea), Lilly Reale (Gotham), Tara McKeown (Washington), Avery Patterson (Houston), Izzy Rodriguez (Kansas City), Emily Sams (Orlando), Emily Sonnett (Gotham), Gisele Thompson (Angel City).

Midfielders: Croix Bethune (Washington), Sam Coffey (Portland), Claire Hutton (Kansas City), Rose Lavelle (Gotham), Sam Meza (Seattle), Olivia Moultrie (Portland).

Forwards: Lynn Biyendolo (Seattle), Michelle Cooper (Kansas City), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston), Emma Sears (Louisville), Ally Sentnor (Utah), Alyssa Thompson (Angel City).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","soccer"

With World Cup 2026 on the horizon, the team has been reluctant to weigh in publicly as one of their pillars is politicized

Los Angeles will be in the spotlight during the 2026 World Cup. It's where the US men's national team will begin their World Cup campaign, and it's where they'll wrap up the group stage. It's a city in the news lately due to the Trump administration's deployment of Ice and the national guard, but it's also a metro area synonymous with diversity. This US men's national team, more than ever, reflects that diversity.

“It's not that there's a record or anything of how many minorities have been on the national team before, but I feel like this has been the most diverse generation of national team,” said center back Chris Richards, who is poised to be a leader along the backline for the US next year.

During most periods of the USMNT's modern history, Richards saying this would be a political non-factor. But today, as the Trump administration openly discourages talk of diversity in public life, it means something. Against the backdrop of polarization at home and mounting pressure to make a deep run at the World Cup, a team mostly based abroad has been careful about commenting on social and political issues in the United States.

Diversity, though, remains foundational.

“When we had Gregg [Berhalter] as the coach, and we had to pick our anchors for our team, and we talked about picking ‘diverse' as one of those anchors, we started to look around the room, and you really start to realize how every single person on our team comes from such a completely different background,” said midfielder Tyler Adams, who captained the US at the 2022 World Cup. “It was the first time I started to realize, ‘Wow, we just have a very, very diverse team.'”

Adams and others mean “diversity” in the truest sense of the word: Age, race, culture, birthplace; it is seemingly all there, in one roster.

“This team is a microcosm of what the United States is,” said Tim Ream, who at 37 is the oldest player by far on an otherwise young and mid-career team. “It's representative of the entire country. So many backgrounds, different cultures, different ways of doing things, different beliefs, and that's OK, and we all get along just fine.”

Adams, who is black, wasn't really thinking about diversity as a kid growing up in Wappingers Falls, New York. He's biracial, raised by his mother (who is white) and eventually his stepfather (who is also white) along with his three stepbrothers, who he refers to as his father and brothers. Looking back, Adams said he had a lot of black friends and a reasonably diverse school, but his youth soccer environment was different.

“A lot of white kids play soccer in the neighborhoods I grew up in,” said Adams, who noted that youth national teams provided an early, eye-opening experience.

“A lot of the kids that were getting called in from California obviously have a Latin [American] background. And right away you could tell how diverse just America in general is,” he said. “It was a really cool thing. You become friends with people that on the west coast that you may have never met through the game, and you start to understand a little bit of the culture and why they fall in love with the game, why you fall in love with the game, and how your geography kind of dictates that.”

St Louis, the New York area, and California are historic hotbeds of soccer in the US. Former US defender and notoriously opinionated pundit Alexi Lalas recently reiterated his view that the men's national team could be better served by being more “exclusive” and concentrating player development resources on such hotbeds.

But to do so would be to exclude Birmingham, Alabama – Richards' home town. The Crystal Palace defender says he was typically the only black player on his team growing up before he joined the FC Dallas academy. During 2022 World Cup qualifying, he noticed how much the national team had changed.

“I remember at one point it was Antonee Robinson, Mark McKenzie, myself, and Sergiño Dest, and I was like, ‘Oh, this is like an all black back line,'” he said. “Zack Steffen was in goal … Weston [McKennie] was playing in the midfield, we had Timothy Weah on the wing, Yunus [Musah] was playing. So that's eight starters right there that are black, and we were just like, ‘This is kind of crazy.' Me personally growing up, I never saw it. I know Yunus probably did because he grew up in London, but for me, it was really rare. I never experienced something like that until playing with the national team.”

Richards didn't really think about the diversity of the national team when he was younger. Today, he said it gives inspiration to his little brother, and his best friend.

“His dad was like, ‘You have no idea how big this is, not just for kids in Birmingham, but kids of color in Birmingham,” Richards said. “It's something that they never had seen on TV and something that they never really aspired [to] because they'd never seen it before.”

When it comes to political expression, November 2020 was a turning point for the US men's national team. After the Covid-19 pandemic had precluded the full squad from convening for a year, much of its emerging, European-based talent was on display in a 0-0 draw against Wales. So too was the team's diversity: ten out of the 11 starters were black or Hispanic, with four born and raised abroad.

Their participation in the social justice movement was also beginning to emerge. In their first game since the murder of George Floyd and ensuing protests that prompted messages of social justice solidarity throughout the sports world, the players and coaches wore jackets emblazoned with the words “Be The Change” across the front. On the back, they had the space to send their own personal message.

“Whether you supported what was going on or not, it was the time to stand with your principles,” Richards said. “So some people put different messages on the back of their jackets, and whether it was a Black Lives Matter quote, whether it was just an equal rights thing, we all have something that we stand for.”

Eighteen months later, under the banner of the “Be The Change,” the team sent a very direct message to Congress regarding gun legislation and wore orange armbands in a friendly against Uruguay to raise awareness.

Weighing in on a social or political issue like this is the product of extensive dialogue and consensus, but with the spotlight on soccer in the US shining brighter and overlapping more with politics, it will be more challenging for American players to keep their distance or calibrate their response. On Wednesday, Weah and McKennie were among the members of Juventus invited to the Oval Office on the eve of their Club World Cup opener in Washington DC (Weah later told reporters that he had no choice but to go). With McKennie, Weah and others as a backdrop, Trump answered all sorts of questions from the press. At one point, he turned to them to ask if a woman could play for Juventus – a reference to the culture war surrounding the battle over transgender rights. None of the visitors took the bait.

“I was kind of like, I just want to play football,” said Weah, whose father is the former president of Liberia and Ballon D'or winner.

Ream and Adams both underlined that the US team isn't having deep discussions about politics at the dinner table during their limited time together. If commentary is to come from the team, they said, it can't be counter-productive, engendering awkwardness or discord.

“If I'm going to say something, I'm going to say something because I feel like it can bring people together and bring people closer,” Ream said.

And while athletes today have their own megaphone at their fingertips, sharing their opinion or engaging with others on social media carries plenty of risk.

“It's gonna get misconstrued one way or another so there's no point,” Adams said.

Adams also stressed that ultimately, technology can only compensate so much for physically being on the other side of the Atlantic, where he and other players spend most of their time during the club season. There's a disconnect from the reality back home that is increasingly difficult to digest.

“It's an interesting time we're living in,” he said. “A lot of decisions that are made almost seem like they just happened in a blink of an eye. It's hard to fathom sometimes exactly what's happening and have a complete understanding.”

The US men's national team's naming of diversity as one of its pillars didn't seem out of the ordinary in 2020. Now, five years later, the backlash to diversity, equity and inclusion, accelerated by a second Trump administration, has changed the landscape. It is intertwined with the administration's immigration policy, built by Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.

To him and others in the administration, the concept of diversity as a strength on its own is a political statement – the very thing the team tries to avoid without full buy-in and a lot of thought and collaboration among the group.

“Within the last few years, particularly the last year, it's been a very tough time for the country. With change, with the new president, with things like that,” Richards said. “I felt like we were moving forward with certain things, with uplifting minorities. And I feel like in the last few months, it's felt like it's gone backwards.”

At the moment, the US appreciate their diversity but don't feel the need to celebrate it publicly. In camp they're curious to learn about each other's lives, and let their performances elicit pride in their identity.

“When you play well, you're like, ‘Look at that team. Look how diverse.' You take so many positives away from what our team stands for,” Adams said. “So that's important as well, and we'll get back to that way, because that's what makes us great.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup continues as the U.S. Men's National Team takes on Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas at Q2 Stadium (8:15 p.m. CT / 9:15 p.m. ET; FS1, ViX).

The USA kicked off the tournament with a 5-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago in San Jose, Calif., and may face a stiffer challenge in Saudi Arabia. Both the Americans and the guest nation are vying for the top spot in Group D. A USA win combined with a draw or loss by Haiti would advance the United States to the quarterfinals.

PREVIEW | BEST MOMENTS

Here's what you need to know about the USMNT's second group-stage match:

The USMNT didn't take its foot off the gas pedal in the first its Gold Cup group match. The Americans scored three first-half goals — two from Malik Tillman and another off Patrick Agyemang. Then Brenden Aaronson and Haji Wright subbed on in the last 20 minutes and provided a spark and two more goals. Aaronson found the back of the net just two minutes after entering the game.

The USA hopes to build on that energy in its second group-stage match. The USMNT trotted out a starting lineup with an average of 15 caps against Trinidad and Tobago. Momentum can be key for a young squad's confidence.

“It's definitely huge,” midfielder Jack McGlynn said. “I think we started off the way we wanted to, and it was a good win for everybody here. Obviously, the two losses before don't feel great, so to get a win last game and hopefully continue, that would be huge.”

Diego Luna made his Gold Cup debut and the midfielder created significant opportunities for the USA. It felt like Luna was everywhere on the pitch, from picking off balls to generating breakaway scoring chances. Luna assisted on two goals in three minutes, all in front of friends and family near his hometown of Sunnyvale, Calif.

Luna came on the senior team scene in 2024, earning his first cap in last year's January camp. He got another spot in the developmental camp and found his way, impressing Mauricio Pochettino and the coaching staff into a starting role. He's only just beginning to find his stride with the National Team less than 10 appearances in.

This Saudi Arabia team is perhaps best known for shocking the world and upsetting the eventual FIFA World Cup winners, Argentina, in the group stage of the 2022 tournament in Qatar.

The Al-Suqour are not to be taken lightly. Pochettino, an Argentine native, uniquely understands this.

“I think it's going to be a very good test,” Pochettino said. “Again, a very good team. They beat Haiti, and we both have three points, and I think it's important for us to win the game but knowing that it's going to be a really tough game.”

The USMNT has faced Saudi Arabia seven times with an overall 3-2-2 record. These nations last met in 2022 in an international friendly in Spain, which ended in a 0-0 draw. Before that, every other encounter happened in the 90s. Two of the matches have been in tournament formats — the FIFA Confederations Cup (1992, 94), where each team got a win.

As of now, the U.S. Men's National Team leads Group D ahead of Saudi Arabia based on goal differential. Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago round out the group, in that order. The top two teams from each group move on to the next round.

Saudi Arabia beat Haiti 1-0 in its first group match. Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti face off before the USMNT's game at 6:45 p.m. ET. A USA win combined with a draw or loss by Haiti would advance the United States to the quarterfinals, which take place from June 28-29 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minn. and State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.

The first Concacaf Gold Cup was in 1991 when the USMNT claimed the inaugural crown in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The U.S. has won seven total times in 1991, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2021.

The USA has advanced past the group matches in every iteration of the tournament and only once failed to reach the semifinals in 2000 when the Americans lost to Colombia in a penalty shootout.

The USMNT has collected the second-most trophies after Mexico, which has won the tournament nine times, including as reigning champions in 2023. USMNT legend Landon Donovan holds the record for most goals in the biennial competition with 18 goals. Check out the USA's best Gold Cup moments here.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is off and running.

The tournament got started this past weekend in the United States and continues with group stage play currently underway for all 16 teams involved.

Coming into the Gold Cup, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) was in rough shape. The team had a four-match losing streak and doesn't have key players in the lineup for this tournament such as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah.

During that brutal stretch, the USMNT were shutout twice and outscored, 8-3, in a pair of international friendlies earlier this month and in Concacaf Nations League games back in March.

The United States responded in a big way in their Gold Cup opener by taking care of business in a 5-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago last Sunday night in San Jose, California.

The shutout victory must be a sigh of relief for head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who's dealing with a lot of pressure of getting this team on the right track before the World Cup arrives in North America (United States, Mexico and Canada) next summer.

Saudi Arabia also won its opening match of the Gold Cup, earning a 1-0 victory over Haiti.

Here's everything you need to know about USMNT's group stage game against Saudi Arabia on Thursday night:

...

AUSTIN, Texas — Weeks after the U.S. men's national team named its initial summer roster, the dominant conversation was not about who made the squad — but who didn't. Most of the core group was absent due to injuries, Club World Cup duties, or, in Christian Pulisic's case, a hotly debated need for rest.

In their place, head coach Mauricio Pochettino refreshed the roster not just to evaluate fresh faces, but to ignite more competition in his player pool. A 4-0 loss to Switzerland in the team's final Gold Cup warm-up suggested Pochettino's omissions — the “football decisions,” in his words — had backfired. But a commanding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago to open the tournament paused early doubts.

Pochettino's project, however, runs deeper than scorelines. After March's deflating Nations League defeats to Panama and Canada, Pochettino began challenging the team's internal standards.

“What we want to create in our national team is people desperate to come, desperate to perform,” he said. “To perform means follow the rules, create [a] good atmosphere, be part of the team, be able, in every single aspect, [to meet] our [federation's] demand and understand that it's possible (for it to) be the last [opportunity] to be with us.”

Then he made his point clearer.

“If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend — is that the culture that we want to create? No, no, no, no, no. What we want to do is to go to the national team, arrive and be focused. And spend all my focus and energy on the national team. Because we need to create this culture about winning.”

Pochettino insisted he wasn't punishing individual players for the Nations League losses. But collectively, he clearly sought to adjust their approach to camp. It was always going to be a tricky balance after he inherited a veteran-heavy squad from Gregg Berhalter, one with a European pedigree that is unprecedented in USMNT history. And for players who spend most of their year abroad, coming back to U.S. soil — and U.S. camps — often means carving out time for family and friends.

“When we speak about the mentality of the national team, and you look at the most successful teams in the world, a lot of them go in to camp, and they stay at one place the entire time and travel to games,” midfielder Tyler Adams said the day before a friendly against Türkiye in Hartford, Connecticut, just 90 miles from his hometown in New York. “Based off the geography of the country, we're traveling all over the place. We're obviously playing abroad, and we come back home and it is nice to see your families. But we have to find the right balance.”

Adams, who captained the squad at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, will again be central to building that culture over the next year. So will center back Chris Richards, who has emerged as a leader this cycle and wore the armband against Türkiye.

“There's a line that we kind of need to teeter-totter,” Richards said in Nashville, a few hours from his hometown in Alabama. “Sometimes in our off time, we'd want to go hang out with family a lot more than the guys are at the camp. But again, I think if you need to make this new culture with new guys, that you have to spend time with each other outside of the pitch. … It's finding the line between friends and family, but also blending both of them, so that we have a good culture both on and off the pitch.”

Walker Zimmerman, a Georgia native and Nashville SC center back, echoed that view after starting against Switzerland.

“He's just stressing the point that we need to be focused each and every day, especially in training,” Zimmerman said. “But I also think this staff is really good about, ‘Hey, when you have the day off, you can have the day off.' You gotta have a work-life balance and enjoy it.”

And to a certain extent, Pochettino agrees. Before the Switzerland friendly, he emphasized the point with a typically lengthy response.

“I am the first person with my coaching staff who likes the players to be able to have free time,” he said. “ … They're young boys, the young boys need to have different possibilities to be able to do things that are in this moment, when you are young. What I always say is when you have your work done, when your responsibilities are covered, after, yes, we can do all that we want. What we can't do is not have all those things covered and I go out for a walk. If I don't have my work done, I can't go for a walk in Nashville to see the city. I do my work, and then I go to see Nashville.”

The Argentine circled back to an earlier comment he had made that drew attention: his criticism of golf outings and dinner plans during camp. What he's really after, he stressed, is a fight-to-the-death level of intensity and energy on the field.

“I want 11 lions. Or wolves. Or the animal that you may like the most — the most aggressive. [I want players] on the field that may fight as if there had been death,” Pochettino explained. “But if we do all of that and enjoy life but after we don't fight like a team, a true team, we raise a lot of doubts. It means there's something that isn't well, that isn't balanced. The balance is the most important in all the soccer teams.”

Adams summed it up more succinctly:

“He talks about balance quite a lot, and mak[ing] sure that we understand that we need to be top professionals. That's the most important thing.”

Pochettino believes that there is a specific psychological uniqueness to soccer compared to other team sports in the U.S., and he is not trying to create an overly regimented environment.

“This isn't a closed system, it's not the navy, it's not a military camp,” he said. “It's a soccer team that has to prepare itself to compete against another soccer team.”

Zimmerman added: “It's not like we're locked down at a hotel or anything like that, but from a culture standpoint, yeah, we're focusing on the intensity in trainings, the intensity in the games and being competitive as a group.”

And when the Gold Cup began, the natural constraints of tournament life reinforced the shift.

“Everybody's been focused on maximizing rest,” center back Mark McKenzie said. “Preparing ourselves with the training sessions, preparing ourselves with little things you do after the training sessions. And then when we get back to the hotel, kick your feet up. We got a player's lounge and what not. So guys have time to laugh and joke and be together, continue to build on what we're doing, but most important is making sure we're ready for the next match.”

It won't be the same group traveling throughout the U.S. next summer during the World Cup. But there could be more players on this Gold Cup roster than expected who will crack the squad or have a substantial role, and they'll all have been part of a process Pochettino is prioritizing — calibrating a culture — that is definitely on a tight schedule.

“We're all professional,” midfielder Brenden Aaronson said ahead of Thursday's group stage match against Saudi Arabia. “We all know what we're gonna do and what's needed of us and how we're gonna approach every situation. So for us, it was like, we're gonna go out there and be really, really focused on the tournament. I think we always are, but for him to say that, and he had something to say about it, so for us it was just tunnel vision. Tunnel vision and just gonna come here and not do any of that type of stuff, and be really focused.”

This is Pochettino's only tournament prior to the World Cup, and if the U.S. makes a deep run next summer, the intangible progress toward a winning culture will be spun as its legacy.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

When the U.S. Soccer Federation turned to Mauricio Pochettino in 2025, it wasn't just hiring a tactician—it was making a statement. A marquee name for a program with rising ambitions and unfinished business.

Fresh off stints at PSG and Chelsea, the Argentine manager arrived with pedigree, pressure and a paycheck to match. The deal marked a shift in how the soccer federation values international leadership and what it's willing to pay for it.

His salary has drawn attention both at home and abroad, sparking comparisons with past USMNT coaches and global heavyweights. But beyond the numbers, it's the expectations that truly define the contract.

Mauricio Pochettino inked a two‑year contract when he took charge of the U.S. Men's National Team back in September 2024, with his term running through the 2026 World Cup on home soil. So, he still has a little more than a year left.

The deal was carefully structured: FIFA's build‑up schedule around the World Cup gives him just enough time to implement his high‑intensity style while leaving room for renewal if he delivers on expectations.

Behind the scenes, U.S. Soccer inserted a sizeable buy‑out clause to protect against poaching by a major European club, signaling their intent to keep him through the tournament cycle.

Mauricio Pochettino earns a reported $6 million per year, making him the highest‑paid head coach in USMNT history—nearly triple the $2.3 million earned annually by predecessor Gregg Berhalter, according to ESPN.

This hefty sum is underpinned by the Federation and donors: hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin and partner Scott Goodwin funded much of the package as part of a “philanthropic leadership gift” earmarked for elite-level coaching.

The investment marks a sharp turn for U.S. Soccer, reflecting a strategic commitment to elite leadership and signaling that they're willing to pay top dollar for international pedigree.

The U.S. men's national team will look to build on its opening win in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup when it takes to the field against Saudi Arabia in Austin, Texas, today in the second match of the group stage.

The Green Falcons are the lone non-Concacaf team in the championship and will serve as a crucial test for Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT.

But this isn't an unprecedented move: non-member guests have long been a part of Concacaf's tournament, and Saudi Arabia is now the eighth invitee to have debuted in the event.

But why is Saudi Arabia traveling nearly 9,000 miles to Q2 Stadium to compete in the tournament?

Here's all you need to know…

The Concacaf Gold Cup is an international competition for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. But the competition has a history of inviting guests from around the world into the mix.

Guests to the tournament date back to 1996, when Brazil became the first non-Concacaf nation to enter the fray. Brazil (1996 and 2003) and Colombia (2000) reached the final, but no invited team has yet won the tournament.

There was a 16-year period during which the competition was exclusive to regional teams, but guests resumed participation in 2021. Last year, Concacaf tweaked its guest team policy for the Gold Cup, with the hope that invitees would help expand the competition even more.

In 2018, Concacaf established a partnership with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) — which Saudi Arabia is a member of — setting up “a framework to strengthen collaboration, encourage knowledge exchange and further develop football in their respective territories.” This was specifically intended to increase competitive opportunities between the confederations.

In 2021, Qatar became the AFC's first team to compete in the Gold Cup (and lost 1-0 to the USMNT in the semifinals; also in Austin, coincidentally). Last year, Saudi Arabia received an invitation to join the biannual Gold Cup this year and also in 2027.

Saudi Arabia is also a country with geopolitical pull in the world of sport, specifically soccer. It will host the men's World Cup in 2034, considered a controversial decision for various reasons. The country, through its Public Investment Fund (PIF), is also a visible sponsor of this summer's Club World Cup competition, which features Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal.

Last year, Saudi's PIF also signed a multi-year deal with Concacaf. That investment followed Aramco, one of the world's largest oil companies that is majority-owned by the Saudi government, becoming Concacaf's “official energy partner” for all its teams and competitions.

A match against Saudi Arabia might not be as easy as it sounds. Just ask Argentina, whose only loss in their run to World Cup glory in 2022 was in its opening game against Saudi Arabia (1-2).

Historically, the Saudi Arabian national team is considered one of the most successful national teams in Asia, having won the AFC Asian Cup three times. It has reached a joint record of six Asian Cup finals and become a regular in the men's World Cups since debuting in 1994. It is currently ranked 58th in the world by FIFA.

Led by head coach Herve Renard, the Saudis will be without some of their biggest stars, much like the Americans, thanks to the Club World Cup taking place simultaneously this summer in the U.S..

Several Saudi players are competing for Al Hilal, most notably Salem Al Dawsari, long established as one of the stars of Saudi soccer.

While the U.S. enjoyed a dominant 5-0 win against Trinidad & Tobago in its opening match of the tournament, the team was up against a poorer version of its regional rival. It means this match on Thursday could serve as more of a litmus test.

All teams, minus Saudi Arabia, have qualified for this year's Gold Cup through the latest edition of the Concacaf Nations League or the 2025 Gold Cup prelims.

The tradition of inviting non-Concacaf guests into the competition dates to 1996, when the confederation invited then-defending world champion Brazil as its inaugural “guest nation.” Brazil sent a U-23 squad, falling in the finals to Mexico. Brazil was a regular guest through 2005, even featuring a young Kaká in 2003.

The guest list for the Gold Cup has also featured Colombia, Peru, South Korea, Ecuador, South Africa and Qatar. These teams have regularly made deep runs in the tournament, which may have eventually led to the decision by Concacaf to make the 2007 competition exclusively a regional one to provide local teams with more opportunity to compete as the tournament expanded.

That was true until 2021, when, after a 16-year hiatus, Concacaf resumed inviting guests into the competition. The first guest to receive that invite was Qatar in 2021, ahead of the nation hosting the men's World Cup in 2022. Qatar reached the semifinals of the Gold Cup that year and returned to the competition in 2023, exiting in the quarterfinals 4-0 to Panama.

As successful as guests may have been in the competition, the Gold Cup still has only ever produced three champions: Mexico (nine titles), the United States (seven) and Canada (one).

In the same way that this Gold Cup is serving as a crucial test for the three regional hosts the U.S., Canada and Mexico ahead of next year's men's World Cup, the competition offers Saudi Arabia a meaningful bout of international experience ahead of 2026, too.

The team also has plenty to prepare for as hosts of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup and the 2034 World Cup. The more exposure to diversity in competition, the better, especially considering Saudi Arabia has already signed on as guests for the Gold Cup in 2027 as well.

It also gives Saudi Arabia, the nation, exposure to the American market at a crucial time when nearly every federation, league and sports promoter is hoping to profit from the exploding commercialization of soccer in the U.S.

The two have a brief history, most recently playing in September 2022 in Spain as a final tuneup before the 2022 World Cup (0-0 draw). Six players who featured for the U.S. that day are part of the current squad. It was the first meeting between the teams in 23 years.

Overall, the U.S. is 3-2-2 against Saudi Arabia.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The videos keep rolling across your social feeds: Boca Juniors fans on the beach in Miami, while Palmeiras fans light up Times Square. You'll hear it in the stands and see it in the scenes, too: River Plate fans belting out songs in Seattle and Flamengo supporters roaring during the individual player introductions.

The FIFA Club World Cup may be a global tournament, but in the United States, it feels unmistakably South American.

All six CONMEBOL clubs -- the above quartet, plus Fluminense and Botafogo -- avoided defeat in their opening matches (three wins and three draws), but the South American fan bases have also been the most boisterous, showed up in the biggest numbers, and deservingly drawing all the attention.

It shouldn't be a huge surprise. Many of their UEFA counterparts shrug with apathy at the shiny new expanded tournament, noting its lack of history. Teams from other regions look happy to be there, intrigued by the massive prize pots and eager to find international legitimacy. But in South America, this tournament provides an opportunity to recapture some of the past glories.

Fans know the dates by heart. You see them on banners, hear them in chants, and read them in club publications.

Palmeiras in 1951 were crowned Copa Rio champions after beating Nice, Red Star Belgrade, and Juventus. It was the first intercontinental club tournament featuring teams from Europe and South America. In 1981, Flamengo dominated Liverpool 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup, a match featuring the champions of the Copa Libertadores and UEFA Champions League. River Plate did the same in 1986, overcoming Romania's Steaua București.

""In 1950, Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay, and it was a huge blow. 1951 brought that back up and was celebrated not just by Palmeiras but also supporters of other teams,"" said Paulo Roberto, the leader of the U.S. chapter of Palmeiras supporters' group Mancha Verde, to ESPN. ""Up to today, it's something we value because it's history, and you cannot erase history.""

Those international trophies are huge sources of pride for the teams in South America who have them. Similarly, participation in the tournament now known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup occurs, where the most recent champion of each confederation competes in a tournament. This year, Real Madrid topped Concacaf's Pachuca 3-0 in the final.

""This tournament brings together the elite of global football, and it's an honor to once again see the name of River among the leading figures,"" River Plate Secretary Stefano Di Carlo said. ""It will be our third time participating in the Club World Cup in the last 10 years, which reaffirms our status as top representative in the region.""

While the entire sextet of CONMEBOL teams would love to make history by once again winning -- and testing their rivals' openness to celebrating a title -- the likelihood is that the champion will come from UEFA, as it has in the last 11 times the tournament was conducted in its previous format.

The economic realities of the current ecosystem mean South American clubs often are parting ways with their talent early, transferring off top academy players to keep funding the club and watching as they go on to stardom for big European clubs.

""Players who used to play in our team are now playing in Liverpool, Manchester United, etc.,"" said Juan Pablo Pacheco, the leader of River Plate Texas. ""We see them with the bright lights of playing in Europe, but kind of forget what it's like playing in South America. We're eager to play those teams and show that we still have it, even though our best players immigrate to Europe.""

But the games don't always go according to script. Benfica's Argentine duo -- Ángel Di María and Nicolás Otamendi -- ended Boca's hopes of a win early with a pair of goals in a 2-2 draw in Miami. Di María, who scored from the penalty spot, clarified after the match that his hand gesture wasn't an apology to Boca fans, but a simple greeting to his family.

And family is a thread that runs through all of this, another reason the tournament matters so much to South American fans.

Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only).

""It's very special, especially for me. I'm going with three generations, with my dad, who is a big Flamengo supporter, and also my oldest son. It's three generations of being Flamengo,"" said Renato Silva, a Flamengo fan who used to live in the U.S., but once again lives in Rio de Janeiro and is traveling for the tournament. ""For us, it's very important. These are always part of conversations in society. I think it's much more important for us than European teams.""

All those factors are important, but there's something else about the Club World Cup that shouldn't be underrated by those working to understand why these six clubs seem to care so much more than some of their fellow CWC hopefuls.

There are many South American fans living and working in the U.S. who still keep up with their team, perhaps track it even more closely for that feeling of home when they're far away. Seeing the team in your city? Having old friends come visit to go see matches in gleaming stadiums? It's a party.

""It means a lot for us who have been abroad for a long time,"" said Mariano Bossana, the president of the Boca Juniors Consulate in Washington, D.C. ""It's not only a pleasure and an opportunity to see Boca Juniors playing nearby, but also a source of pride to compete with some of the most respected teams around the world. It brings Boca back to the international stage.""

Of course, for the clubs, the tournament presents not just the chance for supporters to have a good time or for the team to seek on-field revenge. Being on the big international stage also is a huge opportunity to put their brand in front of fans all over the world, and crucially to do so in the U.S., where nearly every team -- Asian, European, African -- has put together activities to connect with existing fans and try to win over new ones. But South American clubs have stood out in both scale and passion.

That's partly because, traditionally, many have done little compared to their European counterparts to try to reach new markets. Botafogo has a space near Venice Beach called Venice House, where it hosts events, and supporters can drop by to hang out and meet fellow fans.

A Botafogo House em Venice Beach já é sucesso dentro e fora de campo! 🌴⚽ Em parceria com a Secretaria de Turismo do Rio de Janeiro e a TurisRio, estamos promovendo os atrativos turísticos do nosso estado em plena Copa do Mundo de Clubes da FIFA.Turismo e futebol juntos,... pic.twitter.com/DzUYiFtqHC

""Botafogo House will be a special place to honor everything we've built here,"" CEO Thairo Arruda said in a statement. ""We want to share our essence and show everyone what it is to be Botafogo.""

In addition to on-site activations, clubs are also trying to reach new supporters online. River launched their English-language social media channels under the River Plate Global umbrella just before heading to the U.S. for the tournament, which opened with a 3-1 win over Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday.

It's a key part of that club's strategy to continue converting new fans, as the club works through many of the financial issues that clubs in South America must deal with, ones that European teams backed by billionaires or private equity may not need to be concerned about.

""River's internationalization couldn't just be a goal, it had to be the result of an integral growth. Since 2013, the club has gone through a deep transformation. We've tripled our annual income, going from $50 million to more than $180 million,"" Di Carlo said. ""The path is to keep making River grow in all dimensions, so that participating in the Club World Cup isn't an arrival point but rather another step in a sustained project to consolidate River among the great clubs of the world.""

It's possible that these six CONMEBOL teams, already among the powers in the region, could use the prize money earned, the increased exposure and the experience on the field to even further accelerate their growth. Other clubs, surely, are fighting for the Libertadores for the eternal glory of being the tournament champion, but the potential trip to a Club World Cup and the cash influx it provides is a bonus of not insignificant amounts.

It's a motivation that will push many more South American teams forward. Although, as the fans of the teams qualified for the first expanded edition have shown, their team simply being here is more than enough for them to express their excitement and take over the tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

MIAMI — Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club said Thursday.

World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever.

Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday. But his hospitalization casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States.

Madrid said Mbappe would “undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment.”

Mbappe's absence is a blow to the tournament, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino hopes will be one of the elite events in soccer and rival competitions like the Champions League and Premier League in popularity and value.

After Lionel Messi, Mbappe is arguably the biggest star in the show, with Madrid one of the favorites to lift the trophy in the inaugural edition of the tournament.

But a crowd of more than 62,000 at Hard Rock Stadium missed out on a rare chance to see him in person in the U.S. when he was unavailable for Madrid's surprise 1-1 draw by Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Gastroenteritis is also known as stomach flu and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea.

Mbappe's hospitalization comes almost exactly one year after he sustained a broken nose at the European Championship and had to wear a face mask to continue playing in the tournament.

Frenchman is in the US with the Real Madrid squad at the Club World Cup; Mbappe missed Real Madrid's opening match against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Thursday 19 June 2025 15:06, UK

Kylian Mbappe is in hospital receiving treatment for gastroenteritis, Real Madrid have announced.

Mbappe missed Real Madrid's opening Club World Cup match against Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal on Wednesday.

The statement read: ""Our player Kylian Mbappé has acute gastroenteritis and has been hospitalized for various tests and treatment.""

Mbappe has been instrumental for Real Madrid this season, scoring 31 LaLiga goals since his high-profile summer move from Paris St Germain.

Real Madrid enter the tournament as one of the favourites, having dominated European football over the last decade, winning five of the last 10 Champions League titles but did only draw 1-1 with Al Hilal without Mbappe.

According to the NHS website, gastroenteritis is a common mild stomach bug characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting, often related to food poisoning. It typically lasts less than a week.

City breached rules in nine league matches last season

CEO Soriano excited by global impact of Club World Cup

Manchester City have been fined more than £1m by the Premier League over delayed kick-offs or restarts related to nine matches last season. The league entered into a sanction agreement with the club over the breaches of its rules, which occurred between October and February.

The longest delay was two minutes and 24 seconds before the resumption of the Manchester derby last December. The league said City had accepted and apologised for the breaches, with the fines totalling £1.08m. The club have 14 days to make payment from the execution of the sanction agreement.

A league statement said: “Rules relating to kick-offs and restarts help ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard and provides certainty to fans and participating clubs. It also ensures the broadcast of every Premier League match is kept to schedule.”

City, who were fined more than £2m last summer for 22 breaches of the kick-off and restart rules, are playing at the Club World Cup and their chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has said he is excited by the way the revamped 32-team tournament is driving football's globalisation. The Spaniard believing City can embrace the expanded format and still be relevant to their domestic fanbase.

Pep Guardiola's side beat Morocco's Wydad 2-0 on Wednesday in Philadelphia in their opening group game as they began their defence of a title claimed two years ago in the competition's last seven-club iteration.

Soriano said of the new format: “We are very excited by it. It's something that was very much needed. Soccer is a global sport and we have to make it global. You have to have teams like Manchester City playing teams from Morocco, Korea or wherever. That's part of the globalisation of the No 1 sport in the world. It's a great initiative and we are very happy to be here.

“It's very important to be here because we are a global football club. We have our roots and we are proud of them. But you can be local and relevant and faithful to the history of the club and the fans that support you, but you can also be global and show what we do – which we believe is beautiful football – to the world. It's a combination that works very well and we are proud.”

Goals from Phil Foden and Jérémy Doku secured the defeat of Wydad as Guardiola gave debuts to Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, two of his eight new recruits in the past two windows.

Soriano said: “I'm happy with the work that we did. This is part of multi-annual planning. Last summer we only bought one new player [Savinho, while Ilkay Gündogan returned on a free transfer] but this year between the winter and the summer it will be eight new ones.

“It's part of the annual cycle, the renewal of the squad. We accelerated some of it and now we are very happy with the squad we have. It's part of the game [to refresh]. We look for stability, the fact that Pep is going to be with us for 10 years shows that we are a stable club.

“But the squad needs to be renewed. It's something that happens naturally. We've had fantastic players like Kevin De Bruyne who spent a decade with us. That's a testament to his quality but also our stability.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

AC Milan know Tijjani Reijnders' quality, but now others are seeing it in a more mainstream view, due to his move.

Since joining Milan, most knew that Reijnders had a bit of something special about him. This season, that feeling only increased, as he became a more complete midfielder. In fact, he was, for a while, the best goalscoring midfielder in Europe.

For this reason, many were frustrated by the manner of his exit and the fee that the Rossoneri received. However, we cannot reminisce too much. After all, the club have greater problems to solve.

The Dutchman has spoken heavily about his belief that Pep Guardiola can further him as a player; he has a track record when it comes to midfielders. However, the Spaniard utilised the former Diavolo last night in the Club World Cup, and despite not contributing, the manager was impressed, as he told Sky (via Milan News).

“Rayan [Cherki] has incredible skill near the penalty area, incredible vision and passing, he has many, many qualities. Today was just the first game in very difficult conditions, but I am really happy that he is here. Tijjani Reijnders also played very well.”

That is what mediocre management is good at. Now Milan look up to Man City and others in the Football Eco system. Selling your best player for cheap,in order to manage accounts. What a pity.

Where was ManCity before OilMoney took over?

Were you around when Berlusconi sold Kaka to Real Madrid to “balance the books”?

And Shevchenko before that. How do you sell the second best striker in club history for a mere 45M and our last Ballon D'Or winner for a mere 65M? We're also not under investigation for 100+ violations of league financial rules. Some people are completely mentally deficient.

Kaka was sold for Europe record then do your findings

Really happy we handed them Reinjders for 55mill. Maybe Napoli will pay the same for Musah….

in that game Cherki was a flop, and Tij show quality. and Tij not just played “very well” but he's an engine for the team like he did for us. i dont know if we can replace him with somebody with the same quality

Its like yesterday that all these same cry babies were saying oh no we sold Tonali yhis guy will never be able to replace him….. First time i saw him i knew not inly he will but will be better then Tonali. 

I yhink we should have asked at least 70+ for him, but oh well, Jashari can be better in long term.

The same people here who keep saying that the management is mediocre for seeling Rejnders are the same people who called the management mediocre when they bought him and kept saying he was average all last season before he moved to City. At that time they were saying he was a mediocre player, and that he was nowhere close to Tonali. Now all of a sudden they

The Cardinale Cucks out in full force defending the stupid decisions of this management. Where did we finish last year?

The Real Madrid, France international forward Kylian Mbappe is being treated for gastroenteritis at FIFA Club World Cup.

Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalised with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club says.

World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the FIFA Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever.

Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday.

Mbappe's hospitalisation, however, casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States.

“Our player Kylian Mbappe is suffering from an acute case of gastroenteritis and has been admitted to hospital in order to undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment,” Madrid said in a statement on Thursday.

Gastroenteritis is also known as the stomach flu, and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhoea.

Real drew the match with Al Hilal 1-1 and missed the chance to seal all three points when Federico Valverde missed a late penalty.

Mbappe had trained with the Madrid squad in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, on Sunday but was absent from the final session on Tuesday before the match.

The forward's last match was France's international against Germany in the third-place playoff at the UEFA Nations League.

France were eliminated by Spain in a 5-4 thriller in the semifinals, where Mbappe netted his side's opening goal.

Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. (2:07)

The videos keep rolling across your social feeds: Boca Juniors fans on the beach in Miami, while Palmeiras fans light up Times Square. You'll hear it in the stands and see it in the scenes, too: River Plate fans belting out songs in Seattle and Flamengo supporters roaring during the individual player introductions.

The FIFA Club World Cup may be a global tournament, but in the United States, it feels unmistakably South American.

All six CONMEBOL clubs -- the above quartet, plus Fluminense and Botafogo -- avoided defeat in their opening matches (three wins and three draws), but the South American fan bases have also been the most boisterous, showed up in the biggest numbers, and deservingly drawing all the attention.

It shouldn't be a huge surprise. Many of their UEFA counterparts shrug with apathy at the shiny new expanded tournament, noting its lack of history. Teams from other regions look happy to be there, intrigued by the massive prize pots and eager to find international legitimacy. But in South America, this tournament provides an opportunity to recapture some of the past glories.

Fans know the dates by heart. You see them on banners, hear them in chants, and read them in club publications.

Palmeiras in 1951 were crowned Copa Rio champions after beating Nice, Red Star Belgrade, and Juventus. It was the first intercontinental club tournament featuring teams from Europe and South America. In 1981, Flamengo dominated Liverpool 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup, a match featuring the champions of the Copa Libertadores and UEFA Champions League. River Plate did the same in 1986, overcoming Romania's Steaua București.

""In 1950, Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay, and it was a huge blow. 1951 brought that back up and was celebrated not just by Palmeiras but also supporters of other teams,"" said Paulo Roberto, the leader of the U.S. chapter of Palmeiras supporters' group Mancha Verde, to ESPN. ""Up to today, it's something we value because it's history, and you cannot erase history.""

Those international trophies are huge sources of pride for the teams in South America who have them. Similarly, participation in the tournament now known as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup occurs, where the most recent champion of each confederation competes in a tournament. This year, Real Madrid topped Concacaf's Pachuca 3-0 in the final.

""This tournament brings together the elite of global football, and it's an honor to once again see the name of River among the leading figures,"" River Plate Secretary Stefano Di Carlo said. ""It will be our third time participating in the Club World Cup in the last 10 years, which reaffirms our status as top representative in the region.""

While the entire sextet of CONMEBOL teams would love to make history by once again winning -- and testing their rivals' openness to celebrating a title -- the likelihood is that the champion will come from UEFA, as it has in the last 11 times the tournament was conducted in its previous format.

The economic realities of the current ecosystem mean South American clubs often are parting ways with their talent early, transferring off top academy players to keep funding the club and watching as they go on to stardom for big European clubs.

""Players who used to play in our team are now playing in Liverpool, Manchester United, etc.,"" said Juan Pablo Pacheco, the leader of River Plate Texas. ""We see them with the bright lights of playing in Europe, but kind of forget what it's like playing in South America. We're eager to play those teams and show that we still have it, even though our best players immigrate to Europe.""

But the games don't always go according to script. Benfica's Argentine duo -- Ángel Di María and Nicolás Otamendi -- ended Boca's hopes of a win early with a pair of goals in a 2-2 draw in Miami. Di María, who scored from the penalty spot, clarified after the match that his hand gesture wasn't an apology to Boca fans, but a simple greeting to his family.

And family is a thread that runs through all of this, another reason the tournament matters so much to South American fans.

""It's very special, especially for me. I'm going with three generations, with my dad, who is a big Flamengo supporter, and also my oldest son. It's three generations of being Flamengo,"" said Renato Silva, a Flamengo fan who used to live in the U.S., but once again lives in Rio de Janeiro and is traveling for the tournament. ""For us, it's very important. These are always part of conversations in society. I think it's much more important for us than European teams.""

All those factors are important, but there's something else about the Club World Cup that shouldn't be underrated by those working to understand why these six clubs seem to care so much more than some of their fellow CWC hopefuls.

There are many South American fans living and working in the U.S. who still keep up with their team, perhaps track it even more closely for that feeling of home when they're far away. Seeing the team in your city? Having old friends come visit to go see matches in gleaming stadiums? It's a party.

""It means a lot for us who have been abroad for a long time,"" said Mariano Bossana, the president of the Boca Juniors Consulate in Washington, D.C. ""It's not only a pleasure and an opportunity to see Boca Juniors playing nearby, but also a source of pride to compete with some of the most respected teams around the world. It brings Boca back to the international stage.""

Of course, for the clubs, the tournament presents not just the chance for supporters to have a good time or for the team to seek on-field revenge. Being on the big international stage also is a huge opportunity to put their brand in front of fans all over the world, and crucially to do so in the U.S., where nearly every team -- Asian, European, African -- has put together activities to connect with existing fans and try to win over new ones. But South American clubs have stood out in both scale and passion.

That's partly because, traditionally, many have done little compared to their European counterparts to try to reach new markets. Botafogo has a space near Venice Beach called Venice House, where it hosts events, and supporters can drop by to hang out and meet fellow fans.

""Botafogo House will be a special place to honor everything we've built here,"" CEO Thairo Arruda said in a statement. ""We want to share our essence and show everyone what it is to be Botafogo.""

In addition to on-site activations, clubs are also trying to reach new supporters online. River launched their English-language social media channels under the River Plate Global umbrella just before heading to the U.S. for the tournament, which opened with a 3-1 win over Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday.

It's a key part of that club's strategy to continue converting new fans, as the club works through many of the financial issues that clubs in South America must deal with, ones that European teams backed by billionaires or private equity may not need to be concerned about.

""River's internationalization couldn't just be a goal, it had to be the result of an integral growth. Since 2013, the club has gone through a deep transformation. We've tripled our annual income, going from $50 million to more than $180 million,"" Di Carlo said. ""The path is to keep making River grow in all dimensions, so that participating in the Club World Cup isn't an arrival point but rather another step in a sustained project to consolidate River among the great clubs of the world.""

It's possible that these six CONMEBOL teams, already among the powers in the region, could use the prize money earned, the increased exposure and the experience on the field to even further accelerate their growth. Other clubs, surely, are fighting for the Libertadores for the eternal glory of being the tournament champion, but the potential trip to a Club World Cup and the cash influx it provides is a bonus of not insignificant amounts.

It's a motivation that will push many more South American teams forward. Although, as the fans of the teams qualified for the first expanded edition have shown, their team simply being here is more than enough for them to express their excitement and take over the tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

SEATTLE — As the Emerald City prepares to host thousands of soccer fans for the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup and the upcoming FIFA World Cup next summer, local leaders and community organizers are spearheading a city-wide initiative to beautify Seattle.

Outside Lumen Field this week, the influx of tourists is evident as fans from around the globe arrive to witness the FIFA Club World Cup matches. Business owners and local leaders are determined to ensure Seattle leaves a lasting impression on its visitors. To achieve this, they are organizing over 50 beautification events throughout the city next month.

Community leaders and members of the Seattle FIFA World Cup 2026 Organizing Committee are rallying volunteers for the ""One Seattle Day of Service."" This all-day event on Saturday, July 12, will feature 55 volunteer activities across the city aimed at beautifying Seattle.

""Many of the [volunteer events] are in the Chinatown-International District, South Seattle, North Seattle, West Seattle,"" said Mayor Bruce Harrell. He emphasized the importance of the cleanup efforts, stating, ""The point of the cleanup efforts is to build community, and after we do the 'One Day of Service,' our crews and our community-based organizations do more. It's just keeping the momentum. We're going to keep that momentum up to the FIFA World Cup.""

As excitement builds for the FIFA World Cup, the initiative is seen as beneficial for the local economy and hospitality sector. ""It's great to have all this going on and the energy it brings. It's good for the economy, the hotels. It's exciting,"" said Boyd.



Sounders legend Steve Zakuani encouraged participation, saying, ""Get out there, grow your sleeves up and get involved and help make our community as great as it already is - even better.""

This marks the fourth consecutive year Seattle has organized this all-day volunteer effort, which includes not only trash collection but also graffiti removal, planting new flowers, and weeding out invasive vegetation.","{'href': 'https://komonews.com', 'title': 'KOMO'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Commentary: How Trump could sabotage L.A.'s World Cup and Olympics","https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-19/how-trump-could-sabotage-l-a-s-world-cup-and-olympics","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Organizers of major sporting events always have a lot to worry about — logistics, transportation, security and weather, to start. The organizers of two major events scheduled to take place in Los Angeles next year and in 2028 would be well advised to worry about one additional factor: Donald Trump.

Trump has made public statements endorsing the Olympics and identifying himself with their successful outcome. L.A. won the 2028 games in 2017, during his first term. In a 2020 meeting with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, he claimed to have played a role in securing the games: “From the day I took office,” he said, “I've done everything in my power to make sure that L.A. achieved the winning bid.”

As recently as January, just before his inauguration, he delivered another expression of support. “These are America's Olympics,” he told Casey Wasserman, the chair of the local organizing committee, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago reported by Axios. “These are more important than ever to L.A. and I'm going to be supportive in every way possible and make them the greatest games.”

The current U.S. administration's abusive immigration policies ... threaten the inclusivity and global nature of the World Cup.

— Amnesty international

But Trump has a habit of withdrawing his favors as abruptly as he bestows them — as onetime associates such as Elon Musk have discovered — and upending his own policies on a whim. 

Over just the last week, for example, he ordered immigration authorities to cease their raids on agricultural and hospitality sites, evidently on appeals from his own supporters who cited their need for immigrant laborers. But he reversed himself days later, ordering the raids to resume.

Two administration initiatives in particular could directly affect the World Cup and Olympics. The first is Trump's crackdown on immigration. Up to now, the policy has been haphazardly applied, through scattershot raids on locations such as Home Depot parking lots. 

Immigration agents have been acting as though they have carte blanche to detain people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, conducting raids that have sometimes  swept up American citizens. 

It's easy to see what a Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics has to offer the International Olympic Committee. 

Customs and Border Protection and other federal immigration authorities have been accused of detaining foreign visitors and refusing them admission to the U.S., without explanation. 

Immigration roundups across the U.S. have instilled fear in immigrant communities, prompting many to stay home from work or school.

The second initiative is Trump's travel ban, which bars individuals from 12 countries from entering the U.S. Those from seven other countries face restrictions, though not complete bans. 

According to a widely-reported memo, Trump is contemplating the addition of 36 more countries to the travel ban. Of those countries, 25 are in Africa, but countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific are also named. 

The memo, according to reports, asserts that the countries on the expanded list lack a credible “government authority to produce reliable identity documents,” keep unreliable criminal records or are beset by “widespread government fraud.” Countries could “mitigate” the U.S. concerns, the memo says, if they're willing to accept deportees from the U.S.

Although the international lineup for the 2028 Olympics has not been established, every country on both lists sent athletes to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.

At a news conference last week, Wasserman said the White House understood the need to be “accommodating” on visa issues with those in the Olympic bubble — “It has been the case to date and it will certainly be the case going forward through the games.” He spoke confidently, but that he felt the need to speak about it at all tells the real story.

In 2018, when FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, was judging bids to host the 2026 World Cup, Trump assured FIFA that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” But concerns remain that family members of participating athletes might face restrictions on entering the U.S.

Those concerns could hardly be assuaged by a comment from Vice President JD Vance, chair of a government task force overseeing preparations for the World Cup, at a task force meeting attended by FIFA president Gianni Infantino.

Vance said the U.S. wants foreign visitors “to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up, we want them to go home, otherwise they will have to talk to Secretary Noem.” 

The Special Olympics capitulated to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, dropping a vaccine mandate in hopes of escaping a $27.5-million fine.

He was referring to Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, whose agency has been conducting the immigration raids and border detentions.

Just last week, Customs and Border Protection, a subagency of Homeland Security, stated in a social media post that it would be “suited and booted, ready to provide security for the first round of games” of FIFA's Club World Cup preliminary tournament. The authority of immigration agents to provide security or conduct civil law enforcement activities is legally uncertain. Homeland Security later deleted the post.

“U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event,” a Homeland Security spokesperson told me by email. The White House didn't respond to my request for comment.

There already are signs that Trump's immigration crackdown is suppressing ticket sales for international soccer games in the U.S. That appears to be the case with an opening game of Club World Cup, scheduled for Saturday between Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer club featuring Lionel Messi as player-captain, and the Egyptian team Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium outside Miami.

The cheapest seats for the contest, which are priced according to demand, have fallen from $349 in December to less than $80 last week, the Associated Press reported.

Notwithstanding his statements of support for the Los Angeles Olympics, since taking office in January, Trump's feelings for L.A. have turned distinctly negative. On June 7, he called in the California National Guard and subsequently mobilized the Marines to quell street protests in downtown L.A. against immigration raids. 

Trump stepped up his battle with local authorities on Sunday, when he posted a statement on his Truth Social platform pledging to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.”

What Amnesty International labels “escalating attacks on human rights and civil freedoms” prompted the organization to urge FIFA to “exert its leverage and demand concrete, legally binding guarantees that human rights won't be further sacrificed for the sake of the game.” The organization said “the current U.S. administration's abusive immigration policies, including enforced disappearances under the Alien Enemies Act, travel bans, increased detention, and visa restrictions, threaten the inclusivity and global nature of the World Cup.” 

 Olympics 

We asked back in December whether the Sochi Winter Olympics, which formally begin Friday, were heading for disaster, what with terrorist threats, an uncooperative climate, cost overruns and corruption on a scale imaginable only in Russia. 

Los Angeles has a lot hanging on successful World Cup events and the Olympics, though it's hard to pinpoint how much, financially speaking. Projections of economic gains from major sporting events are typically optimistic, euphoric, chimerical or conjectural. The standing estimate for the economic impact for L.A. County from next year's Cup events is $594 million. That's based on expectations of 180,000 out-of-town visitors arriving for the eight matches, which include the opening match for the U.S. men's team.

That estimate, however, comes from the L.A. Sports and Entertainment Commission, which is responsible for attracting major sporting events to the county and might not be inclined to minimize the potential take. 

The Olympic gains are even tougher to estimate. My colleagues Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Dakota Smith reported recently that local Olympics organizers have expressed confidence that they'll reach their goal of $2.5 billion in sponsorship revenue and about as much coming from ticket sales and other commercial income. All told, the organizers say they'll be able to cover the estimated $7.1 billion in Olympic costs. 

The organizers also waved away concerns that foreign fans might be discouraged from coming to the U.S. for the games, since they expect most ticket sales to be domestic.

As my colleague Steve Henson reported in March, Wasserman has assured the International Olympic Committee that “irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics. L.A. is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.” He said he had made “significant strides” in getting assurances from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that obtaining visas shouldn't be a problem.

Are those assurances reliable? Trump's policymaking record is inauspicious. Whether the product of deliberate policymaking or whim, Trump's capacity for sabotaging the World Cup and Olympics is vast. 

Promoters of major international sporting events always maintain that the games are “nonpartisan” and nonpolitical. That's true up until the point that they're not, as was demonstrated when former President Jimmy Carter ordered a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics to protest Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Russia retaliated by boycotting the 1984 games (in Los Angeles). 

Will Trump's politics poison the upcoming soccer and Olympic events? It's not clear at this moment, but the organizers are undoubtedly crossing their fingers.

Tebas said it was his “goal” to ensure that there were no more editions of the month-long, 32-team version of the tournament, which is currently being staged in the U.S.

Spanish top flight clubs Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are both involved in the tournament, which Tebas has called on FIFA to “eliminate” from the football calendar.

“My goal is to ensure there are no more Club World Cups, that's very clear,” said Tebas, speaking on Tuesday at an event marking the 10-year anniversary of the centralisation of La Liga's audiovisual rights.

“There's no need for another competition that moves money to a sector of clubs and players,” Tebas said. “There's no more money here; we have to maintain the ecosystem and eliminate this.”

The 62-year-old has long been at odds with Real president Florentino Perez over a multitude of issues, most notably the Super League project that was strongly promoted by Madrid.

Tebas said his issues with Perez were “not personal” but added: “He is from a completely different industry model. He defends a Super League that would destroy the national leagues.”

The Spanish league president said that “piracy” and “new competitions” were the two main threats facing his organisation.

In April 2024, Tebas insisted that he wanted to stage La Liga matches abroad by 2025-26, saying that a match in the U.S. would “strengthen our position in the North American market”.

Rio Ferdinand believes that Victor Osimhen is “waiting for Manchester United” after snubbing a big-money transfer to the Saudi Pro League.

Al-Hilal, who are currently competing at the FIFA Club World Cup, reportedly reached an agreement with Napoli for Nigeria international Osimhen to make his way to the Middle East. The 26-year-old frontman subsequently snubbed such a switch.

It is claimed that he, after a 37-goal loan spell at Galatasaray in 2024-25, is looking to compete at the highest level in Europe. Osimhen is said to come with a £64 million ($86m) price tag despite having only a year left to run on his contract in Naples.

United, amid the struggles being endured by Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, remain in the market for another No.9. They missed out on Liam Delap, as he headed to Chelsea, while Sporting sensation Viktor Gyokores is being heavily linked with Arsenal as he wants to play Champions League football in 2025-26.

Quizzed on who the Red Devils should be looking at, former United defender Ferdinand told his Rio Presents YouTube channel: “No.9? They already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen!

“It looks like he's turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United. I don't know if Manchester United are going to come. That's the problem.”

Ferdinand added on United's recruitment efforts so far, with £62.5m ($84m) forward Matheus Cunha already through the door at Old Trafford: “I'm happy with Cunha, he's one of the ones I mentioned on my list. I hope it goes well for him.

“The problem is that I've been happy many times in transfer windows and it's gone wrong. I'm hoping he's not going to be added to that list. If they get [Bryan] Mbeumo, I'd be very happy.”

United remain an attractive proposition to big-name additions despite finishing 15th in the Premier League last season and missing out on European qualification. Ruben Amorim is overseeing another rebuild that is intended to get a fallen giant back on its feet.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Fenway Sports Group are facing scrutiny back in the United States over another controversial MLB trade, while the Reds are flying high in England

The perceptions of Fenway Sports Group (FSG) as an ownership group could hardly differ on the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean. For football fans, they are the streetwise conglomerate that have overseen Liverpool's most successful period in the modern era. Baseball fans, however, aren't as convinced with their credentials, even in spite of bringing glory to the game.

In over two decades of presiding over the Boston Red Sox, FSG have overseen various playoff runs and even championships, but their work across the last seven years has come under major scrutiny. Now, the people of Massachusetts and New England are in revolt.

The online footballing community in Europe was taken aback in recent days after it became overwhelmed by irate Red Sox supporters lashing out at Liverpool's impending signing of Florian Wirtz for a package worth up to £116 million ($156m).

Manchester United-linked Gianluigi Donnarumma has delivered a “no problem” update on his contract talks with Paris Saint-Germain.

The Italy international goalkeeper, who helped PSG to a historic Champions League triumph in 2024-25, has just 12 months left to run on his current deal at Parc des Princes. That situation has led to inevitable questions being asked of his future.

Reports in France suggest the 26-year-old shot-stopper has been given a “sign or be sold” ultimatum, with PSG not prepared to run the risk of seeing their commanding No.1 work his way towards free agency in 2026.

Premier League giants in Manchester have seen moves for Donnarumma speculated on, with United and City said to be monitoring his situation, but no official approaches have been made and the Euro 2020 winner continues to hold discussions with PSG officials.

Donnarumma told reporters at the FIFA Club World Cup when asked for an update on his plans, with fresh terms on the table in Paris: “We're advancing, we're advancing. My agent (Enzo Raiola) is speaking with the club. I'm focused on the match, on the trophy (Club World Cup), but there is no problem.”

Ex-AC Milan star Donnarumma joined PSG in 2021. He has made 155 appearances for the Ligue 1 heavyweights and is considered by many to have restored his status as the best goalkeeper on the planet.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Premier League clubs are being urged to take a transfer “gamble” on Mason Greenwood despite the “baggage” that he brings.

One-cap England international Greenwood, who remains in the process of switching allegiance to Jamaica, severed ties with Manchester United in the summer of 2024. He registered 22 goals during his debut season at Marseille.

It has been suggested that the 23-year-old, who spent time on loan at La Liga side Getafe in the 2023-24 campaign, is feeling a little homesick and would like to return to his roots. It is claimed that “at least two Premier League teams are weighing up an approach”.

Any team making a move for Greenwood would be taking a calculated risk, given the headlines he has generated off the pitch, but there is no doubting his ability. With that in mind, ex-Three Lions star Gazza would like to see the winger back in the English top-flight.

Former Tottenham and Everton midfielder Gascoigne told Express Sport, courtesy of Esports Insider, when asked if Greenwood should form part of a Premier League transfer package in 2025: “If he went abroad and he's more comfortable coming back and with the goals he's scoring, then yeah, come back.

“I don't know if he brings quite a bit of baggage. [But] if you're going take a gamble on him, take a gamble on him. You have got to give him a chance, even if it's just half a game. Sometimes, with these friendlies, you can play 11 [players] in one half and then the other 11 in the second half. Give the guy a chance.”

Marseille have Greenwood tied to a contract through to 2029 and would be reluctant sellers as they prepare to grace the Champions League next season. If a deal were to be done, then Premier League giants United are due 50 per cent of any fee generated.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Nakashima – Draper: 20.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 1-2

Brandon Nakashima has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Stuttgart, Zverev defeated him in the quarterfinals in tight straight sets. Last season in London, Nakashima lost against Musetti in the 1/8-Finals. This week, the American defeated Mpetshi Perricard in the opening round in three sets. Nakashima turned the match around after losing the opening set 6-7. In the 1/8-Finals, he won against Evans in straight sets. The American handled the pressure better than the Brit and deservedly won.

Jack Draper has won four of his last five matches. His last match before the Queen's Club was at the French Open when he lost against Bublik in the 1/8-Finals. This week in London, the Brit defeated Brooksby in the opening round in straight sets. He served great throughout the match, not offering any breakpoints. In the 1/8-Finals, he won against Popyrin in three tight sets after losing the opening set 3-6. Draper successfully fought off the heat. The Brit served well once again, hitting 14 aces.

According to the bookies, Draper is the big favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. He looked exhausted in the second round against Popyrin. Looking at the head-to-head meetings, it was always tight between Draper and Nakashima. We expect Nakashima to deliver his best tennis and keep this match tight.

That being said, Nakashima winning at least one set is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Brandon Nakashima +1.5 sets @+105 @FanDuel

Rune – Bautista-Agut: 20.06.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 3-0

Holger Rune has won four of his last five matches. His last match before the ATP Queen's Club was at the French Open, where he lost against Musetti in the 1/8-Finals. This week in London, Rune defeated O'Connell in straight sets in the opening round. He was great under pressure, saving all three breakpoints he offered. In the second round, the Dane defeated McDonald in three sets. After losing the opening set 2-6, Rune turned the match around. In the second and third sets, Rune served exceptionally well, not offering any breakpoints.

Roberto Bautista-Agut has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Hertogenbosch, the Spaniard lost against Hurkacz in straight sets in the opening round. His last appearance in London was in 2016, when he lost in straight sets against Raonic in the quarterfinals. This week in London, the Spaniard defeated Borges in three tight sets after losing the opening set 6-7. In the second round, he won against Mensik in three tight sets after spending over two hours on the court. After losing the opening set 3-6, Bautista-Agut turned the match around.

According to the bookies, Rune is the favourite in this matchup, and we agree. Bautista-Agut struggled against Mensik in the second round and already spent a lot of time on the court this week. We expect Rune to be a better player and be rested for tomorrow.

That being said, Rune winning in straight sets is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Holger Rune winning 2-0 @2.00 @bet365

Naomi Broady has been keen to quash one story about the Queen's Club Championships which has proved plenty of people wrong.

Offering a round-up of the women's event earlier this week, the former world number 76 was delighted by their return to these grounds after nearly 40 years.

It marked a landmark moment for the event, who did take a risk in expanding it out over two weeks.

Arguably the biggest fear that arose from these plans was how the grass courts might have held up, especially heading into the latter stages of the second week during the men's tournament.

However, Broady has emerged to assuage those fears.

She sought to dispel this rumour though, speaking on Tennis Channel, instead suggesting that the women's tournament has only added to the preceding men's event.

Broady claimed: ‘It's not and actually I think a lot of people were maybe expecting the men to say that they weren't happy about it, but I can report back that they don't mind at all. In fact, they're quite pleased about it. 

‘We heard Dan Evans say earlier this week how, yes, and he was just saying how he really preferred the atmosphere. There was a real buzz around the tennis. Normally, when the men arrive here, the public aren't allowed in, so, it's a members' club. 

‘So he said for sort of the women's quarterfinals, semifinals and finals day, there was a real buzz around the centre, because so many people were here on grounds passes or with the centre court tickets to watch the women, so they pop out and watch the men warm up and get their practices in too. 

‘And also, they're actually preferring how the courts are playing, the baselines, which are usually really slippery the first few days of grass court tennis have already been worn in nicely. 

‘So whilst they're not kind of down to the dirt yet, they're not muddy, that top, fresh, slippery layer has been taken off, so the men are really happy to be here, in the atmosphere the women have brought in, and last week was a really successful tournament.'

Laura Robson even admitted she was surprised at how well the Queen's courts have held up.

Amidst growing claims that the grass-court season should have a Masters 1000 event, Queen's is doing a phenomenal job of reinforcing that case.

After all, adding the WTA to its roster only solidifies the stature of the tournament, proving that a two-week festival of tennis is more than possible without the standard of the surface deteriorating.

Already many saw Queen's as one of the best events on the entire calendar, with it routinely being voted as the best ATP 500-level event.

But with this year's addition of the women too, it only goes from strength to strength.

If people and players continue to lobby for a grass-court Masters tournament, surely this London-based one will be top of the list for a well-earned upgrade.","{'href': 'https://tennishead.net', 'title': 'Tennishead'}","tennis"

Reporter/Editor, Breaking News


	The ATP and Emirates have extended their sponsorship agreement through 2030, and the Dubai-based airliner will pay 70% more than it did under their previous pact, according to the tennis tour.


	With the renewal, Emirates remains the official airline partner of the ATP, and its branding will be placed on-site at nearly 60 ATP events, including on court nets.


	Emirates, a global airline that primarily brings passengers to the Middle East, began to sponsor ATP events in 2013 and has twice renewed the partnership. The fresh extension begins in 2026, at which point Emirates' financial commitment to the ATP rises from the previous sponsorship cycle of 2020-2025, according to the ATP.




	Daniele Sano, the ATP's chief business officer, said Emirates continues to see value in tennis' more affluent fan base both at the courts and through live event broadcasts.

	











	“They have decided to continue with us is because they think that tennis is the right sport that aligns very well their target audience, which is a more affluent audience compared maybe to other sports,” Sano said in a video interview.


	There was also a matter of competition in the skies with Qatar Airways, and concerns that Emirates could lose, as Sano termed it, “its absolute position in tennis.”


	“One thing that they lost two years ago, and that's probably when they realized that they had to be careful, is they lost Formula 1 in favor of Qatar Airways, which is their main competitor,” Sano said. “So again, probably [in] tennis, they didn't want to leave the door open to Qatar Airways, which is also investing quite a lot in sports sponsorship globally.”


	Emirates sponsors competitions in a wide range of sports like horse racing, cricket, golf, cycling and Australian Rules football. The airliner is the kit sponsor of some of the most prominent soccer clubs in the world—Arsenal, AC Milan, Real Madrid, Olympique Lyonnais and Benfica—and is the title sponsor of England's FA Cup.


	In the ATP, Emirates will continue to have brand activations and host premium hospitality suites throughout all the tour events on the calendar, which include the Grand Slams and ATP Masters 1000, 500 and 250 tournaments. The airliner will also work with players to create digital marketing campaigns that will incorporate stories about life on and off the court.


	One new wrinkle to the partnership is that the Emirates logo will now appear on the uniforms of the ATP chair umpires; the airliner has done the same with referees and officials in the NBA, SailGP, World Rugby and the International Cricket Council (ICC). The logo placement was negotiated through the tour, as the umpires are employees of the ATP and not aligned under a union like counterparts in other sports.

	











	The men's tour has racked up several major sponsorships of late. In May, Verizon signed a multiyear pact in the U.S. to become the official telecommunications partner of both the ATP and WTA. That deal was negotiated by Sinclair Broadcasting, which owns Tennis Channel, and it gives Verizon prominent ad on the network's linear and digital platforms, including its editorial site Tennis.com.


	The ATP also struck a global sponsorship agreement with Stella Artois through 2028, making it the official beer partner of the tour and its end-of-season finals, and Quint, the North Carolina-based premier hospitality company. In April, the ATP agreed to European-centric sponsorship deals with crypto platform Bitpanda and Purina's Pro Plan product line.


	While there was a long-held belief that the retirements of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal would drain interest in men's tennis, the ATP countered that notion with record global attendance last year. Around 5.5 million fans attended ATP events, up from 4.8 million in 2019. The tour also reported a cumulative global linear and streaming audience of 988 million viewers across all of its media partners.


	Sano said sponsorship interest could bring more money to players. He cited the ATP's “OneVision” strategic plan, which was designed to guarantee a 50-50 split of tournament profits between players and tournament organizers. The strategy has led to renovation of tennis grounds for several Masters 1000 events in Cincinnati, Madrid, Rome, Paris and Shanghai.


	“So, if more money comes in automatically, the prize money for the players will increase automatically,” Sano said. “It has a kind of positive virtuous cycle where more money is coming in, more money is going to be redistributed. And therefore, the events are getting better, more people on site, more money, more sponsors, and more money for players as well.”


	Those windfalls are likely being followed closely by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), which is suing the ATP, WTA, International Tennis Association and International Tennis Integrity Agency.

	











	The PTPA alleges that the four bodies have conspired to suppress players' earning opportunities. The ATP is seeking a dismissal, and was recently ordered to not retaliate or threaten to retaliate against players who may join the lawsuit.

Legendary tennis player John McEnroe favoured Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner to come out on top in a hypothetical scenario against Rafael Nadal at the French Open. However, McEnroe's claim was bluntly rejected by Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou.

The 2025 Roland-Garros final was a long battle between Alcaraz and the Italian tennis sensation. Sinner came into the final after winning two major titles, the US Open 2024 and the Australian Open 2025. Alcaraz, on the other hand, was a long-time favourite who was looking to defend his Roland-Garros championship. While Alcaraz dropped the first two sets, he came back to beat Sinner 4-6,6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), and 7-6(2). Alcaraz won the French Open for the second time.

Mouratoglou rejected McEnroe's claim and shared why Nadal, who has won 14 French Open titles, will forever be at the top.

Rafael Nadal won his first Roland-Garros in his tournament debut at 19 and claimed his last win in 2022 at 36 years old.

Rafael Nadal shared a heartwarming message for fellow tennis player Richard Gasquet through an Instagram post.

After playing on the clay court of the French Open for 20 years, Nadal was honoured by the Roland-Garros at the 2025 French Open.

Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill has revealed how it was Novak Djokovic who helped turnaround Sinner's game in 2022 with his honest feedback. Djokovic had told Cahill that Sinner has “no variation”, “no height over the net”, “doesn't try to bring me to net” and “not attacking my serve”. 

It was Cahill who had sought out the Serbian star after Djokovic had beat Sinner in the quarter-finals of the 2022 Wimbledon, around the time he had joined Sinner's coaching team. Djokovic had beaten Sinner 5-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. 

Cahill decided to approach Djokovic for his views.

“Hits the ball great, but there's no variation. So you know, there's no shape on his shot. There's no height over the net. Doesn't come to the net. He's not trying to bring me in, I know that he returns well, but he's not attacking my serve on the return of serve,” Cahill recalled the feedback on the podcast ‘Served with Andy Roddick'. 

“Novak got used to his ball, got used to the shape, got used to the pace and then just locked in, like Novak does, and doesn't miss. And won the last three sets reasonably easily,” Cahill says about that 2022 match. “And I saw Novak, and he's always great with this, he's always been incredible when you tap him on the shoulder. And I said, ‘Hey listen, I've just started with Jannik, don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me, but can I ask what you were feeling out there?' And he was incredible.” 

Cahill then took the feedback to Sinner who was inspired to change his game. “So he went through his whole game and broke it down. It wasn't like it was revelations to what we didn't know about Jannik and what we were trying to change in his game.

“But when you take that conversation and sit down with a young man like Jannik Sinner and say,' Hey, listen, I just spoke to Novak and this is what he thinks', that leaves a big impression on a young player. So for Jannik it's: ‘Right, give it to me. Let's start doing these changes'.”

Sinner's ranking at the end of that year 2022 was 15; he is now world no.1.","{'href': 'https://indianexpress.com', 'title': 'The Indian Express'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Coco Gauff falls in first match since French Open win, beaten by Wang Xinyu in second round of Berlin Tennis Open","https://www.olympics.com/en/news/coco-gauff-falls-first-match-since-french-open-beaten-wang-xinyu-berlin-tennis-open","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 17:16:00 GMT","

Wang looked confident in her 6-3, 6-3 triumph over the world No.2, who was playing her first match of the grass-court swing in the lead-up to Wimbledon. 

Coco Gauff's French Open triumph caught up with her on Thursday (19 June).

The world No.2 fell in her first match of the grass-court swing in the second round of the Berlin Tennis Open, upset by world No.49 Wang Xinyu of the People's Republic of China, 6-3, 6-3.

It marks a career-best win for the 23-year-old Wang, and snaps the American superstar's seven-match win streak she accumulated in Paris.

Wang, a qualifier in Berlin at the WTA 500 event, next faces Spain's Paula Badosa in the quarter-finals. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka is also through to the quarters in Berlin on the opposite half of the draw.

""After I won the first set, I told myself, 'Let's take a minute and enjoy this... I won the first set against the French Open champion,'"" a smiling Wang told Andrea Petkovic in the on-court interview following her upset.

""I was really happy with how I played today,"" she added. ""I was serving good. I was putting pressure on her second serve with my return. It was a tough match, [but] I'm happy that I hung in there in the tough moments. I'm really happy to get through today.""

Wang was down in her very first qualifying match of the week, needing three sets to advance before scoring wins over Ons Jabeur (to make the main draw) and Daria Kasatkina (in the first round).

""During my first match in qualifying, that was so tough... it just wasn't working,"" she reflected. ""My team told me, 'Just fight for every point. And believe that you can do it.' So that's what I've tried to do.""

Gauff served at just 38 percent of first serves in for the match (22 of 58) while hitting seven double faults in the one hour, 15-minute encounter. She led by a break in the first set, but relented that lead and never looked to re-settle.

The opening-match loss leaves Gauff in a lurch with Wimbledon set to start on 30 June. There are two WTA events for next week, though Gauff is not entered in either of them as of Thursday.

Days go by and in the minds of many tennis fans, that historic final at Roland Garros between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner still lingers. The Spaniard saved three match points and came back from two sets down to claim his second Roland Garros title, his fifth Grand Slam, leaving behind one of the best finals in recent years. While all the joy was taken by the Murcian, sadness and pain fell on the side of the Italian and his team. The image of Alcaraz, celebrating with tears of emotion with his group contrasts with that of Sinner, standing lost and on the verge of tears on the bench. But that's tennis, and that's life.

It wasn't just the world number one who suffered a hard blow but also his team, among whom was Darren Cahill, his coach alongside Simone Vagnozzi. The Australian revealed on Andy Roddick's podcast how the moments after the final in Paris were experienced: ""The disappointment was immense, absolute silence. Jannik sat for twenty minutes without saying a word, and each of us hugged him. As a coach, I couldn't ask for more. It was a brilliant and serious tennis match, with great respect between the two players. It was a true honor to be there,"" he stated in remarks published by Ubitennis.

Cahill delved into the feeling of disappointment that his pupil was experiencing and confessed that a defeat like that takes time to heal but can also be of help: ""There was nothing to say. After all he had given on the court, it was right to leave him alone with his thoughts. He shed some tears, not just him. It was tough on everyone. I must say that even hours later, he still hadn't processed it, and he never will. You carry a match like that with you throughout your entire career, but it can become a turning point,"" he expressed.

Proud of how his player fought until the end

Both he and the rest of the team are very proud of the level shown by the world number one, who was a machine in the first two sets, and despite not converting the three match points, he didn't give up and stayed engaged in the match until the end: ""After Roland Garros, I felt very proud of him. The entire team was incredibly proud, not only of how he played but also of how he conducted himself, how he fought in the deciding set. Even in the way he spoke after the match, he showed incredible maturity,"" Cahill mentioned.

But the defense of his player didn't end there: ""Jannik has an incredible work ethic, great resilience in moments of pressure, and knows how to handle it. He always keeps calm on the court. He's a problem solver and likes to ask many questions. He's very curious about how he can improve, what he needs to grow, and isn't afraid to take risks. I think his awareness is truly special and is a fundamental quality for a great tennis player. He keeps his feet on the ground, knows who he is as a person, and is very humble. He doesn't get too excited after a win and accepts losses with great respect. His maturity is impressive, Italy is very lucky to have him!,"" he asserted.

Additionally, the Australian had no doubt that Sinner would turn the page and praised his ability to bounce back from defeats: ""He has a great self-awareness. He understands the importance of a tennis match, knows that you have to face victories and defeats more or less the same way. And he does it well. He has an amazing work ethic, resilience, a well-defined purpose. He loves tennis, plans to play until he's 37-38 years old. He has a different perspective: he knows his career could last a long time and invests accordingly. And that resilience, after Paris, will be tested; it doesn't matter if he wins or loses in the upcoming tournaments: the key will be how he reacts, how he keeps pushing forward,"" Cahill remarked.

The former coach of Andre Agassi believes that the Italian will use the pain of the defeat against Alcaraz to turn it into strength and motivation: ""I think it will help us improve. We will try to use that disappointment to take a step forward. Jannik has already started over. The next day, he had already changed his attitude. Of course, he hasn't forgotten it, and he won't: he has moved past it. He has a great ability to assign the right importance to everything and understands the value of a match compared to real life. There are much more important things that have happened and will happen than winning or losing a tennis match,” Cahill concluded.

It is worth mentioning that, despite the great level displayed in Rome and Paris, Sinner is coming off a three-month break due to the suspension agreement for his positive test for clostebol. His return on clay, his least favorite surface, and the lack of competition rhythm made Cahill and the rest of the team believe that getting back into the circuit would be much slower and gradual than expected: ""In the initial training sessions before Rome, we weren't so optimistic. We thought: 'let's hope he wins at least a couple of matches'. Instead, he made it to the final. One of the amazing things about Jannik is that he always surprises us. By now, it has become the norm. He has accustomed us to it.”

He also disclosed the difficulties they faced in training during the suspension, which started on February 4th and ended on May 4th. ""Finding courts and training partners during the suspension was very challenging. Everything had to be approved by the ITIA. In the end, we trained on a clay court provided by a sponsor, near Monte Carlo, but at that time, tennis was nearly secondary. The priority was physical preparation,” he explained.

During the interview with Roddick, one of the topics that worries Sinner the most was also addressed: Cahill's continuity. The Australian confirmed earlier this year that this would be his last season, but despite rumors placing Carlos Moyà in the world number one's team for the next season, the Italian persists, both publicly and privately, for his coach to continue. Cahill is leaving the door open to continue.

""He has 'persisted' quite a bit, let's say, but I enjoy it too much. This year I will turn 60. At the end of 2025, I may retire; we talked about it, he mentioned it by mistake in a press conference in Melbourne. If I retire, it will be for his own good. Sometimes, having a fresh voice, new energy, can be good. I think a new coach wouldn't hurt him, so the plan is still to part ways at the end of the year; we still have many months ahead, we'll see...,” Cahill concluded, who is now less certain about quitting coaching Sinner, who, along with Alcaraz, will feature in many finals like those of Roland Garros.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Lois Boisson told exactly why she does not deserve to be given a wildcard into Wimbledon","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/lois-boisson-told-exactly-why-she-does-not-deserve-to-be-given-a-wildcard-into-wimbledon/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The 2025 French Open will live long in the memory of French player Lois Boisson. 

The rank outsider was handed a wildcard for the event, 12 months on from a cruel ACL injury sustained just one week before the 2024 Roland Garros extravaganza. 

Boisson set about making amends for the year she missed by flying through the draw all the way to the semi-finals, where she eventually lost to Coco Gauff. 

The 22-year-old defeated Jessica Pegula, Mirra Andreeva and Elise Mertens en route to the last four, and it really was a fairytale tournament from her perspective. 

Any new fans she picked up at the French Open might have been hoping to see Boisson at Wimbledon, but now that prospect is firmly in the balance after she was overlooked for a wildcard. 

CoCo Vandeweghe is a former player who called time on her career back in 2023. 

This decision not to give Boisson a wildcard by the Wimbledon authorities has caused a stir, but the former world number nine doesn't agree. 

She believes the fact that her exploits on the clay in France shouldn't earn her an automatic wildcard pick for Wimbledon. 

She said on the Tennis Channel: “CoCo Vandeweghe: No. Because it was on clay and not on grass.

“This is a wonderful Cinderella story, but there has been no data that Lois Boisson would ever do anything on the grass courts.

“That is what I always enjoyed about Wimbledon. Usually, they would give a wildcard to somebody who did well in the weeks leading up to Wimbledon.

“I thought honestly that Victoria Mboko would get one, she is a youngster coming up, she has won and beaten a lot of players in a couple of tournaments.

“She went on a crazy 20-match win streak without losing a set, leading into Rome and then continued that on until she lost to Coco Gauff.

“I think there are plenty of deserving players, I just don't think Boisson is one of them.

The French star could head to qualifying next week to try and earn a place in the main draw. 

However, after producing the goods at the French Open, she might choose to skip the grass court season and instead prepare for the US Open. 

Boisson is now the world number 67 after rising through the ranks after her semi-final run in Paris, but the cut-off for Wimbledon came before the tournament. 

It would be a shame to see Boisson not even attempt to qualify for Wimbledon, but switching from clay to grass isn't easy even for the great players on the tour. 

After her run in France, Boisson's confidence must be sky high and it will be intriguing to see whether she decides to play or not. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Grass Season

Petra Kvitová, the two-time Wimbledon champion and former world No. 2, has announced she will retire after this year's U.S. Open.

Kvitová, 35, won the Billie Jean King Cup six times with the Czech Republic and has 31 singles titles to her name. She returned to the tour in February, after a 16-month break following the birth of her first child, Petr. Wimbledon has given her a wild card for this year, and with her ranking down at No. 572, she will be reliant on one for entry into the U.S. Open and the events leading up to it. She has won one match in seven events since coming back to tennis.

“While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment!” Kvitová wrote Thursday in a post published on X. “I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face — the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career. Through all these years, I am so incredibly thankful for the unwavering support of my family, my closest friends, my team, and all the incredible fans that have always supported me around the world over all these years.”

With her swinging leftie serve and ability to get forward, Kvitová's game is perfect for grass. She won her first Wimbledon title in 2011, aged 21 — beating Maria Sharapova in straight sets in the final. Three years later she thrashed Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 to win her second title, having only dropped one set throughout.

During matches like that, Kvitová appeared unbeatable — and the expectation was that she would win many more Grand Slams. But her career was cruelly halted in December 2016 after a home invasion apartment in Prostejov, Czech Republic. Kvitová needed an emergency four-hour operation to repair damage to tendons and nerves in her left, playing hand and there were fears that she would never play again.

She confounded expectations by returning five months later at the 2017 French Open, then reaching that year's U.S. Open quarterfinals as she worked her way back to the top of the sport. In January 2019, she lost a thrilling Australian Open final to Naomi Osaka, which was the closest she ever got to lifting a third Grand Slam title. Winning that match would also have made Kvitová the world No. 1, which eluded her during her peak.

Kvitová reached the semifinals at the following year's French Open, before going through a quieter period in which she didn't go beyond the fourth round of a major in three years. She went on hiatus in early 2024.

“Growing up in my hometown of Fulnek and hitting the first tennis balls with my father on the local courts, I never imagined becoming a professional tennis player, being able to travel the world, and playing in the most beautiful stadiums around the world,” Kvitová wrote Thursday.

“I could not have asked or wished for anything more — tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.”

She will be given a warm farewell at this year's Wimbledon, where she is the only multiple women's champion other than the Williams sisters since 1996. The main draw begins June 30.

When Jodie Burrage arrived at Wimbledon in 2022, it seems unlikely that she expected to heroically provide some medical assistance.

The Brit was making her second appearance at the All England Club following her debut outing a year beforehand.

Burrage entered as one of seven wildcards alongside the legendary Serena Williams, a seven-time champion at Wimbledon.

A first round match against Ukrainian star Lesia Tsurenko awaited on Court 18 as the 135th edition of the tournament got underway.

Tsurenko won the first set 6-2 and started strongly in the second by leading 15-0 during her opponent's serve.

Burrage had the ball in hand ahead of her second serve but wasn't quick to resume the action in search of a comeback.

One of the ball boys positioned behind her didn't appear to feel too well and had to sit down on a nearby chair.

Whilst Tsurenko remained on the other side of the court, Burrage rushed over to the bottom of the umpire's chair for a sports drink.

She then grabbed something from her bag, which later appeared to be an energy gel that's commonly used by tennis players.

A tournament official seemingly explained the delay to Tsurenko as the ball boy remained sat and drank from the bottle given to him.

Soon enough, a member of the crowd also jumped to his aid with a bag of the popular Percy Pigs from Marks & Spencer.

Burrage held the packet open in her hand and offered them to the poorly ball boy.

Play was paused for around ten minutes as a result of the worrying scenes in SW19.

However, Burrage and two officials helped him rise from his chair and slowly walk alongside the court before being taken out to recover.

The crowd applauded and the Percy Pigs were returned to the owner following the selfless act of kindness at Wimbledon.

Burrage went on to lose 6-2 6-3 to Tsurenko but it's a match that will be remembered for her heroism.

Speaking afterwards, she said: ""He just said he was feeling really faint, he actually couldn't really even talk.""

""It was quite distressing to see so we went to get some Gatorade and gel,"" Burrage added.

""The gel's not the nicest thing so we managed to find some Percy Pigs somewhere along the line in the crowd which he got down and started to feel better. Hopefully he's feeling better now.

""It didn't affect me too much, I actually came out and hit a great serve, probably the best serve I hit in that match after that, so if anything it helped me.

""I've fainted a few times. I actually had a panic attack once in juniors here so I've been where he is. I kind of know how he was feeling and just tried to help as much as I could.""

Val Shand was in the crowd for the match and gave a glowing review of Burrage's response to the ball boy falling ill.

""He was either too hot or he hadn't had enough to eat, he just looked like he needed sugar or water,"" she told the PA news agency.

""He wobbled. Jodie Burrage was really sweet, she went and got him water and sweets. She was really good, really nice to him.

""He sat for a while looking like he was about to pass out. If I was his mum I would have been over there, but fortunately for him I wasn't. I felt for him.""

Her friend Laura Middleton also said: ""He was wilting and his glasses were off as well. The game just stopped. 

""It was at the end of a point and he sort of just crumbled. Tsurenko handed over some sweets or gummies for him to eat as well. It seemed a little while before somebody came to get him.

""It felt like longer because we were distressed for him, because it didn't look like he was going to get back on his feet without help.""

Burrage returned to Wimbledon in 2023 and beat Caty McNally to reach the second round, but didn't not feature last year.

“Growing up in my hometown of Fulnek and hitting the first tennis balls with my father on the local courts, I never imagined becoming a professional tennis player, being able to travel the world, and playing in the most beautiful stadiums around the world,” Kvitová wrote Thursday.

“I could not have asked or wished for anything more — tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.”

She will be given a warm farewell at this year's Wimbledon, where she is the only multiple women's champion other than the Williams sisters since 1996. The main draw begins June 30.

The Czech returned to competition this year after a 15-month maternity break. The 35-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 and reached the Australian Open final in 2019, will compete at this year's Wimbledon and US Open for the last time.

Kvitova, who has won 31 titles over nearly two decades and reached a highest ranking of number two in the world, said the 2025 season would be her last.

Kvitova's career was marked by resilience, most notably her recovery from a serious injury sustained during a home robbery in 2016.

""I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me,"" she wrote in a statement.

""I could not have asked or wished for anything more - tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.""

Since her return at the ATX Open in Austin, Kvitova has lost six of her seven matches, with her only win coming in the first round in Rome. She also competed in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, the French Open and the Queen's Club Championships in London.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","tennis"

Wake Forest's Stefan Dostanic and Stanford's Valerie Glozman capped their standout NCAA tennis seasons by earning 2025 US Open wild cards Wednesday at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Fla. By winning the American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs without dropping a set in men's and women's singles, respectively, both champions booked their Grand Slam debuts in the New York main draw.

 

Graduate transfer Dostanic, the top seed in the men's singles playoff as the world No. 404, capped his college career by beating Michigan State's Ozan Baris and Columbia's Michael Zheng, the reigning NCAA singles champion, in the four-player shootout. World No. 944 Glozman, who just finished her freshman year, was seeded fourth and battled past UC Santa Barbara's Amelia Honer and Texas A&M's Mary Stoiana.

 

Zheng and Stoiana are also headed to New York, with the finalists receiving US Open qualifying wild cards for their efforts in Lake Nona.

For Dostanic, who won the NCAA team title with Wake Forest last month, the US Open wild card brings a close to what he called a ""roller coaster college career"" that began in 2019 at USC.

 

""It feels surreal,"" the 23-year-old said, looking ahead to his US Open debut. ""This is definitely a dream and goal of mine I've had for a long time. Everyone wants to play in the US Open as an American. To go through college and to get a wild card, I couldn't be more thrilled and thankful to the USTA.""

 

After a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Baris in Monday's opening round, Dostanic punched his ticket to New York with a 6-1, 6-4 win against Zheng on Wednesday. Two weeks earlier, Dostanic beat Zheng, 7-6(3), 6-4, at an USTA Pro Circuit and ATP Challenger Tour event in Tyler, Texas.

 

After navigating the drama of the playoff format, the California native hopes the experience will help him on the major stage.

""It was nerve-wracking for sure,"" he said. ""It's high-pressure situations and I think it's great preparation for the US Open. A lot of people are going to be watching, so [I'm] getting used to it a little bit. I think I handled the pressure pretty well and had a great time at this event.""

 

Glozman has already experienced the US Open Qualifying Tournament three times, reaching the second round each of the past three years dating back to when she was 15. Having turned 18 in November, the Stanford star can finally look forward to the main event.

 

""I'm super excited,"" she said. ""I've always wanted to experience the main draw, so I've really pushed myself this week and the weeks leading up to this for training, as soon as I heard I was selected [for the playoffs]. I'm really grateful that the hard work paid off.""

Glozman followed a 6-1, 6-2 win over Honer with a 7-6(8), 6-3 result against Stoiana in Wednesday's final. In a nearly three-hour battle of attrition, the drama peaked in the opening-set tiebreak when Glozman saved a set point with a brilliant lob at 6-7. After breaking new Grand Slam ground with her victory, she credited her past US Open experiences with helping her build her game over the years.

 

""The level is super high at the US Open, so I have to put it all out there and it really pushes me to the next level,"" explained the 5-foot-4 product of Bellevue, Wash. ""It exposes a lot of my weaknesses, so I'm able to work on them in practice, and now that I'm in college, work on them throughout the season.""

 

Glozman was an NCAA singles quarterfinalist in the fall and received ITA All-American and ACC Freshman of the Year honors for her freshman season at Stanford. Dostanic, who did not play college tennis in the fall, was named Most Outstanding Player at the 2025 NCAA team tournament after going a perfect 5-0 at No. 1 singles to help Wake Forest claim its second Division I title.

The American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs will conclude Thursday with the men's and women's doubles finals. For more information, visit the event's homepage on the USTA National Campus website.

Tennis ace Sebastian Korda has released a statement after pulling out of Wimbledon. The American, who hails from a mega-successful sporting family, is ranked 26th in the world and once dubbed himself one of the “favourites” for the Wimbledon title despite only having two ATP Tour titles to his name.

But it was announced on Tuesday that the former Australian Open quarter-finalist won't be competing at this year's championship, having picked up an injury during a recent French Open clash against Frances Tiafoe. He managed to complete the match against his countryman, despite losing all three sets and has since taken to social media to issue an update on his situation.

Posting on Instagram, the tennis star said: “Unfortunately no Wimbledon for me this year. Stress fracture in my shin during the clay. Been a tough 12 months, but better days ahead.”

It means Korda will have to wait at least another year to fulfil his self-prophesied Wimbledon destiny, having previously claimed he was in contention for the title. Speaking back in 2023, Korda said: ""I'm very confident in myself on a grass court. I move really well, I definitely have a game that not very many people have. I'm an aggressive player, like to come to the net, I have good hands. I definitely feel as if I'm one of the favourites at Wimbledon.""

Korda struggled to make an impact at Wimbledon that year, losing his opening match against Jiri Vesely. Things didn't go any better for him last year, with Korda once again dumped out in the first round, this time losing to Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

It means he's still waiting for that sweet taste of success, something his immediate family members know all too well about. The tennis star's dad is a former Grand Slam champion, with Petr Korda winning the 1998 Australian Open.

His mother, Regina, was also a tennis player, although she didn't achieve such success on a Grand Slam stage. Whereas his two sisters, Nelly and Jessica, are both professional golf players.

Such is the sporting ability in the Korda household that Sebastian has previously joked that he's the “worst athlete in the family.” Speaking earlier this year, he said: “I love playing in Australia, as does my family. My dad won the Australian Open 25 years ago, and my sister won the Australian Open in women's golf!

“I don't know what I'm going to be ranked [after victory], but my mum's career high was 26, my dad was two, my sister Nelly was No. 1, my elder sister Jessica was six... so I'm definitely the worst athlete in the family so far!""

Andy Murray has hinted at a frosty split with Novak Djokovic as the tennis legend was asked about his brief spell coaching the 24-time Grand Slam champion.

Murray, who retired after the Olympic Games in Paris last year, was a shock appointment by Djokovic in November.

He worked with Djokovic through the Australian Open, where the Serbian star reached the semi-finals before being forced to retire injured against Alexander Zverev.

The 38-year-old, however, struggled for wins on the ATP tour under Murray's coaching and a split was announced in May.

Murray was asked about the experience as he began a four date theatre tour, which started at the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow on Wednesday.

‘We had a chat on the phone and he asked me if I would consider coaching him, which I wasn't expecting,' Murray said, as per The Times.

‘I think it was a pretty unique opportunity.

‘I was really enjoying being at home but I thought I should give it a go and see whether I enjoyed it.'

Murray reportedly paused before adding: 'I'm not sure if I did.'

The comment may have been another wry joke from Murray, who had broken the ice with his former on-court rival when they reunited for Rafael Nadal's farewell at the French Open.

Djokovic had revealed how Murray had congratulated him after winning the Geneva Open just days after their split.

‘He did congratulate me, and he said, Now that you have a proper coach, you're winning tournaments,' Djokovic said.

‘Of course he was joking, but, I think I have said enough but I will say it again: Andy is just an amazing person.

‘For him to join my team and for us to give a shot to this player/coach relationship was really an incredible thing for tennis and for both of us. I was very privileged and honoured. 

'I was enjoying myself very much regardless of the fact that we haven't had maybe the success we both wanted or people expected us to have.'

Despite his short time in Djokovic's camp, Murray revealed earlier this month he expects to coach again in the future.

'I would do it again at some stage, I don't think that will happen immediately,' Murray told the BBC.

'You also learn a lot about how to work with a team. As an individual athlete, you have a team of people around you, but you're the focal point whereas when you're coaching an individual, you're working with a physio, physical trainers, agents, and you need to know how to get your message across to the player and find out what makes them tick.

'That was the thing I learned and something I need to work on if I want to do it again in the future.

'It was a brilliant opportunity for me. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court. Results weren't as we wanted but we gave it a go.

'We'll see about coaching in the future but I don't think that will happen for a while.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Jamie Murray pays tribute to brother Andy at Queen's Club: 'He often found a way'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jamie-murray-on-andy-murray-london-2025","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:22:30 GMT","

Andy Murray may not be swinging a racquet this week, but his legacy is present at the HSBC Championships in London. In a fitting tribute to the former World No. 1, the centre court at the historic Queen's Club has officially been renamed the Andy Murray Arena.

Murray made his debut at Queen's Club in 2005 and went on to etch his name in the history books by lifting the trophy a record five times. On two of those occasions, 2013 and 2016, he carried that momentum all the way to Wimbledon glory.

No one has had a closer seat to that journey than his brother, Jamie Murray, a 34-time tour-level doubles title and now the tournament director of the ATP 500 event. Jamie sat down with ATPTour.com in London to reflect on Andy's Queen's Club career.

“My biggest memory of Andy here was when he played [Thomas] Johansson. He cramped up, fell down, did that sort of swan dive thing. I remember sitting in the crowd behind the court, being genuinely concerned because I'd never seen that happen before,” Jamie recalled. “I also remember him beating [Milos] Raonic in the final one year. He probably shouldn't have won that, but he did, he often found a way.

“It's obviously been a successful tournament for him. He loved playing here. He really enjoyed grass and the crowd always gave him great support. It was also important for building confidence and getting matches after [Roland Garros], with the quick turnaround. He always seemed to find his footing on grass better than most.”



Alongside his singles exploits, Murray teamed with brother Jamie on two occasions in west London. The Scots defeated Scott Lipsky and Sam Querrey en route to the second round in 2010 before they lost their opening match in 2011.

“I remember one year we played on Centre Court on a Monday evening.  I remember we won a round and that was fun. I remember losing on Court 1 to Mardy Fish and Mark Knowles and then one year we got pumped by Ken Skupski and Xavier Malisse.”

Jamie is still very much active on Tour, highlighted by his semi-final showing at the ATP 500 event in Dubai alongside John Peers. This week, though, the 39-year-old is taking a break from the match court to run proceedings as Tournament Director.

“I still enjoy playing and competing. The tournaments keep getting better each year, better infrastructure, player services, overall experience,” Murray said. “We're looked after well and go to nice events, so my motivation's still there. As long as I'm enjoying it and my ranking's good enough to play these events, I'll keep going.

“Last year [being tournament director] was weird, suddenly showing up in a suit after spending 30 weeks a year with the same guys. Now I feel like I blend in more. I'll still have to wear a suit at some point this week, but I enjoy it.

“At Queen's, we try to say yes to players. If they need extra badges, tickets, we sort them. They've got food all week, so no stress about access. There's less stress in general. It's a smaller draw, lots of practice courts, and of course, it's grass, a short season. Players want to get in as many matches as possible.”

The HSBC Championships began on Monday, with the final on Sunday at 2p.m. BST. The grass-court event has been recognised as the ATP 500 Tournament of the Year for three consecutive years.

The ATP and Emirates have renewed their iconic global partnership, with the airline continuing as Premier Partner and Official Airline of the ATP through 2030. First joining forces in 2013, the ATP Tour and Emirates have built one of the longest standing and most recognisable partnerships in professional tennis.

Through the renewal, Emirates will continue to showcase its premium hospitality at close to 60 ATP tournaments spanning six continents each season. The airline's signature net branding will remain a distinctive part of the viewing experience for millions of fans worldwide. Emirates will also continue to receive prominent marketing rights and high value brand visibility across the season, maintaining one of the broadest footprints in tennis.

From 2026, Emirates will further expand its brand presence by becoming the ATP's first ever umpire sleeve patch partner. The initiative builds on Emirates' proud association with sport officiating across its major sponsorships, including the NBA, ICC, World Rugby, EPCR and SailGP.



Daniele Sano, ATP Chief Business Officer, said: “Emirates has been a constant presence on the ATP Tour for over a decade, and this renewal is a big moment for both of us. It speaks to the strength of our relationship and everything we've built together. Right now, the Tour is in a really exciting place. We're seeing record attendance, growing commercial interest, and real momentum across the board. We're proud to keep building with a partner, and a truly premium brand, that shares our belief in the future of the sport.”

Boutros Boutros, Emirates Executive Vice President, Corporate Communications, Marketing and Brand said: ""The ATP Tour's expanding international influence and reach creates an exceptional platform for Emirates to connect with tennis fans worldwide and build a consistent, authentic brand association with the sport. Through exceptional hospitality and strategic on-ground activations at the world's most prestigious tournaments, we're strengthening engagement with our loyal customer base to remain top-of-mind. We're committed to working closely with the ATP and leveraging this partnership further as we continue expanding Emirates' global tennis footprint.""

In addition to leveraging the ATP's digital and social channels, Emirates will begin collaborating with players on digital promotions through a dedicated activation programme – integrating some of the sport's biggest stars into its brand campaigns. The ATP Tour connects Emirates with a billion global viewers and 5 million fans on-site each season, underscoring the global reach of both tennis and the world's largest international airline.

Beyond the ATP Tour, Emirates is a proud sponsor of all four Grand Slam tennis tournaments: the Australian Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open.

With 31 titles, two Wimbledon trophies and six Fed Cup crowns, Petra Kvitova has built one of the most durable careers of her era. Now, after returning from maternity leave, she's confirmed this season will be her last.

For nearly two decades, Petra Kvitova has been a steady presence near the top of women's tennis, winning often, winning big and rarely drawing attention to herself while doing it. A two-time Wimbledon champion and the winner of 31 titles and more than 600 matches, she also spent 27 weeks ranked No. 2 in the world.

She's long stood as one of the game's most respected and formidable competitors. Now, she's begun the final stretch. After returning to competition this season following a 15-month maternity leave, Kvitova announced her intention to retire at the end of the 2025 season. She will play Wimbledon one final time, and plans to close out her career at the US Open later this summer.

""While no such decision is ever easy to make, for me this is a happy moment!"" Kvitova wrote in a statement Thursday. ""I will leave the sport with the biggest smile on my face -- the same smile you've seen from me on and off court throughout my whole career.

""Through all these years, I am so incredibly thankful for the unwavering support of my family, my closest friends, my team, and all the incredible fans that have always supported me around the world over all these years.

One Czech lefty legend on another: Navratilova's tribute to Kvitova

Her comeback began in Austin, Texas back in February, where she was joined by her husband and coach, Jiri Vanek, and their seven-month-old son, Petr.

“I don't expect anything, basically,” Kvitova said at the time in Austin. “I'm here, that's already a big deal for me. Sometimes I'm really surprised by myself. Like, why I [came back]. But I think I would have regretted it if I didn't come back.”

Since returning, Kvitova is 1–6, with her lone win coming in the first round of Rome. She's traveling selectively and planning her schedule around family. Kvitova has accepted her best tennis may be behind her.

""I could not have asked or wished for anything more,"" Kvitova wrote. ""Tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.""

Until then, her focus now is on the grass-court season -- the surface where she first made her name -- and closing out her career in a way that feels right. What she's already left behind, though, is a quietly dominant and enduring resume. Here are a few of the moments that defined it:

At just 21 years old, Kvitova won her first Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, defeating Maria Sharapova 6–3, 6–4 in the final. She became the first player born in the 1990s to win a major. Her ability to take time away from opponents with flat, early strikes set the tone not only for that match, but for the rest of her career.

That same year, Kvitova swept through the WTA Finals in her first appearance, winning all five of her matches, including a straight-sets victory over Victoria Azarenka in the final. It was the clearest statement that her Wimbledon title had not been a one-off, and that she belonged at the top of the sport.

Three years after her first Wimbledon title, Kvitova returned to the final and delivered one of the most dominant performances the tournament has seen in a championship match. She defeated Eugenie Bouchard 6–3, 6–0 in just 55 minutes, winning 82% of her first-serve points and losing only seven points on serve in the entire match. It was a display of precision and authority, sharp angles, clean winners and no let-up from the opening game to the last.

From 2011 to 2018, Kvitova helped lead the Czech Republic to six Fed Cup titles, serving as a dependable anchor in both performance and team culture. She posted a 30–10 singles record across 21 ties, often playing in high-stakes rubbers and setting the tone for one of the most dominant national runs in recent memory.

Despite often calling clay her least favorite surface, Kvitova found consistent success in Madrid's altitude-friendly conditions, winning the title three times -- in 2011, 2015 and 2018. No other woman had won the trophy there more often, until current World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka matched her with a third title earlier this year. In total, Kvitova captured nine career WTA 1000 titles.

Kvitova's 30th career title came at the Miami Open, where she beat Elena Rybakina in a tight high-level final to capture her first WTA 1000 title since 2018. It was a late-career milestone and a reminder that, even in her 30s, she could still hold her own against the game's best. She added one more title later that summer in Berlin, a straight-sets win over Donna Vekic on grass, bringing her career total to 31.

With 31 titles, two Wimbledon trophies and six Fed Cup crowns, Petra Kvitova has built one of the most durable careers of her era. Now, after returning from maternity leave, she's confirmed this season will be her last.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Coco Gauff is a superstar in every sense of the word, and she has taken tennis to new heights with her play and off-court endeavors. The American has lived up to the enormous expectations placed on her as a teenager and continues to conduct herself with class and elegance in every setting. It all started with family, as her parents Corey and Candi Gauff instilled the key ingredients to becoming a good person in their daughter long before she picked up a tennis racquet.The patriarch of the family joined Tennis Channel 2's “Second Serve” program on the heels of his daughter's Roland Garros championship, which was a signature moment in career that's just getting started.Gauff was very candid about his team's work to bring out the best in his oldest child, and why the best really is yet to come.

It had been three years since Coco Gauff first reached the Roland Garros final, and though the match did not go her way, that experience served her well the second time around. Her triumph in 2025 showcased how far the American has come as a player and person.“There was too much celebration over trying to get to the final and not complete the task. And I think the second time, certainly she was mentally stronger,” Corey Gauff explained. His daughter has built a Hall of Fame resume at age 21, but the focus for Team Gauff remains less on accolades and more on self-actualization.“We put a racquet in her hand so she could be the best version of herself she could be,"" he added. ""If that's winning lots of Grand Slams, then so be it. But as long as you're being the best version of yourself and proud of yourself, that's what really matters.”

Former World Champion Nico Rosberg gives his take on the controversial McLaren clash at the end of the Canadian Grand Prix.

Nico Rosberg has shared his reflections on a dramatic Canadian Grand Prix weekend, which saw his former outfit Mercedes emerge victorious with a dominant display and McLaren experience their first intra-team clash of the season.

George Russell charged to both pole position and the race win at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, where Mercedes introduced a new rear suspension aimed at better managing tyre temperatures, with team mate Kimi Antonelli backing him up to score a maiden F1 podium.

It came after McLaren duo Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri dramatically made contact in the closing stages of the encounter, eliminating the former from the race while the latter took the chequered flag fourth to extend his championship lead to 22 points.

Rosberg, F1's 2016 World Champion and a 23-time Grand Prix winner, was present in Montreal as a Sky Sports F1 pundit, and spoke exclusively to F1.com about the various twists and turns of the race that set up an intriguing second half of the campaign.

Asked for his reaction to what unfolded, Rosberg said: “First of all, Mercedes, are they back? That's the question mark, because they dominated the weekend.

""We know that this track does suit them, but they also have a new geometry, so is the new geometry maybe the solution for them?

“Then, in the World Championship fight, I think now Piastri has become the favourite. He's just solid, he doesn't mistakes, always delivering 100% – that's super impressive. This weekend, suddenly, I think he's become the favourite for the championship.”

Rosberg went on to review the collision between Norris and Piastri along the start/finish straight – the German having experienced his own internal battle for the title alongside Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes across the 2014, 2015 and 2016 seasons.

“It's just a misjudgement,” said Rosberg. “A strange one… a strange misjudgement. But you know, at the end of the race there… it's a very tough race mentally and your concentration struggles, and that I think led Lando into a misjudgement.”

While Piastri is Rosberg's favourite for the crown, he is not yet ruling out Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who stayed out of trouble to split the Mercedes drivers in second position and make up some ground in the championship standings.

With 10 rounds of 24 completed, Verstappen is 43 points behind leader Piastri, and 21 points adrift of Norris – the Dutchman pushing to make it a record-equalling five successive world titles next to Michael Schumacher's 2000-2004 run.

“This helps Max to still hang in there for now, but he needs a better car,” Rosberg added. “I don't know if Red Bull's going to be able to deliver that. He's obviously… he's the best driver for me out there, but he needs a better car.”

Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer picks the bones out of the most dramatic moment from the Canadian Grand Prix.

So the long anticipated clash of the McLarens finally happened: Lando Norris hit the back of Oscar Piastri and retired from the Canadian Grand Prix. It was clearly Lando's error and the Briton immediately admitted that he was to blame, but let's take a look at how it all came about.

Norris was generally faster than Piastri in Canada. While the McLaren car didn't look as overwhelmingly competitive in Montreal as it has at most other venues this year, Lando was still able to find competitive lap times in practice, before running well in the first two parts of Qualifying.

Meanwhile Oscar was looking slightly scrappier and was struggling to get time out of the car.

But it all changed when the pressure was added to the mix. Searching for a pole lap, Norris' first flying lap saw him cut the chicane at the final corner, and his second new tyre effort saw him understeer off towards the barrier on the exit of Turn 7 and lose any chance of a respectable starting position.

His best effort ended up being a banker lap he did on a second run on his first set of tyres.

It looks to me like Lando is struggling more with the pressure of the big moments. The McLaren front suspension upgrade for him in Canada was an attempt to give him more feel in the car, yet he's still making errors that I haven't really seen from him in Qualifying until this year.

In the race it looked like it was another misjudgement, under a self-imposed pressure.

Again Norris was the stronger of the two McLarens on Sunday, charging through from seventh on the grid to get within striking distance of his team mate, who was having one of his more lacklustre races having started third.

It was a battle for fourth position. There wasn't even a spot on the podium available for the winner of this particular fight – and only a minor points gain – so really there was little need for a big risk. It still felt important to see if Norris could overcome Piastri though. Had he got by it would have given him a four point swing out of his team mate – and more importantly, given him a big confidence boost.

But overtaking looked pretty difficult for those without a big tyre advantage, and so when Lando managed to force the issue with a tidy lunge on the inside of Oscar at Turn 10, he would have known this was it, his one opportunity.

Oscar is a fantastic wheel-to-wheel racer. We've seen it routinely now, and he defended well at the final chicane, holding it late on the brakes and keeping position, but compromising his exit.

This was Lando's final shot. If you can't make it through at Turn 1 there are no more overtaking opportunities until Turn 10, and he could be certain that Oscar would be more aware of that attempt now that Lando had shown his hand.

It looked to me that it was this feeling of a desperate last chance that led Lando to chase a gap on the inside that was never there and ruin all of the good work of his race. From the outside it looks like one of the more clumsy errors from a title contender, and there's no denying it is.

From inside the cockpit though these moments play out quickly. You are sitting low down to the ground, with a racing heart rate and adrenaline coursing through your veins. This is the moment you've been waiting 66 laps for – a chance to have a crack at your title rival and make the difference on track.

Lando said he thought he saw Oscar move to the right-hand side slightly and expected the Aussie to move more, thus affording him space for the inside at Turn 1.

Obviously in hindsight, he should have stayed to the right, had the shorter run to the braking zone and a possible chance to go around the outside of his team mate, but having just been quelled at the previous turn, it was clear that he was determined to get to the inside come hell or high water.

It was as if he was just willing a space to open, when in reality Piastri is too smart a racer to allow that.

Some people have drawn a comparison to the other Montreal McLaren clash between Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button in 2011. A brief look at both incidents tells the same story, however the way they came together is critically different.

Hamilton had an overlap on Button in 2011 and therefore was entitled to some space next to his team mate. Norris was desperate to force that same move, but the space was never there and Lando was never alongside. He simply drove into the back of Oscar.

In 2011 the move was more contentious and the result quite different. Despite having a puncture, Button went on to win one of Formula 1's most dramatic races, while Hamilton retired with damage.

In 2025 I think McLaren – and probably even Norris – will be pleased that the incident didn't take both cars out, even though it has ended up costing Lando 12 more points in the championship. The fact that Oscar actually benefitted from it, and Lando immediately held his hands up, means that the team will probably get away without civil war just yet.

Nonetheless it's a real signal of intent as to the risks Norris will take in racing his team mate now. It shows that the time for any pretence of teamwork is over and it is most definitely gloves off for the rest of the season. Piastri takes his biggest points advantage yet to the next race and Norris has another week of regret to think about what he might have done differently.

The silver lining for him is that the pace was there. This looked like Norris' best race drive of 2025 until the contact and he'll take confidence from that. It's just in the pressure moments that we are seeing too many errors.

His Abu Dhabi win last year was under Constructors' Championship pressure though and you don't get a more intense Qualifying than Monaco, where he took pole, so we know he can do it, he just needs to find some momentum. This was another blot, but the championship is most certainly not over yet.

Racing Bulls faced a challenging weekend at the Canadian Grand Prix, with Isack Hadjar ending the race in P16 while Liam Lawson was forced to retire.

Isack Hadjar saw his run of points results come to an end at the Canadian Grand Prix after finishing a difficult race down in P16, while Racing Bulls team mate Liam Lawson also acknowledged that it had been a “tough weekend” as he recorded a third DNF of the season.

After starting on the medium tyres from P12 on the grid – having received a three-place grid drop for impeding Williams' Carlos Sainz during Qualifying – Hadjar ran a one-stop strategy but lost further positions during the race.

A final result of 16th place meant that the Frenchman failed to score points for the first time since the Miami Grand Prix in May.

Reflecting on the struggles that affected his afternoon at the Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve, Hadjar explained: “I think we just pitted a bit too late. We had high graining at the start of the race and we lost a few positions in the pits.

“After that it was just a DRS train and towards the end I was lacking so much pace compared to the cars around. I just got overtaken by everyone.”

When quizzed on why the weekend had seemingly been a particularly challenging one for the Racing Bulls squad, Hadjar conceded that he had not felt content with the VCARB 02 from early on in the event.

“I think since the start of the weekend, even [on Saturday] I was not happy with the car,” the 20-year-old said. “I feel like on the one lap I can kind of make a difference, but over 70 laps there's no chance.”

It was also a tricky few days in Montreal for Lawson. The New Zealander started the race from the pit lane after changes were made to his car under parc ferme conditions, including a new power unit being fitted.

However, this did not prove to be enough to move him up the order and he eventually retired on Lap 53 owing to a cooling issue.

“It's disappointing,” the 23-year-old commented. “I think obviously it was going to be a very difficult race anyway from the pit lane, but we had a cooling issue at the end so unfortunately we had to retire. It's just been a tough weekend, which is a shame.”

Like Hadjar, Lawson gave his take on why the weekend in Montreal had proven particularly tough for Racing Bulls and admitted that the squad now need to regroup.

“[It] was a pretty specific thing we struggled with in Qualifying, but the pace of the car was actually quite good,” said Lawson.

“And then obviously what happened in the race today is a little bit out of our control, so it's a shame but obviously we've just got to keep resetting and looking ahead.”

The team will now set to preparing for the upcoming double header of Austria and Great Britain, with the former kicking things off at the Red Bull Ring on June 27-29.

Yuki Tsunoda gave his honest reflections after ending the Canadian Grand Prix in P12 as he continues to get to grips with the Red Bull.

Yuki Tsunoda has admitted that he feels “a lot of pressure” amid another weekend without points in Canada, with the Japanese driver still in the process of adapting to the Red Bull following his switch to the squad earlier in the season.

Tsunoda's prospects for race day took a hit on Saturday when he was handed a 10-place grid penalty for overtaking McLaren's Oscar Piastri under red flag conditions in Free Practice 3, meaning that – after qualifying in 11th – he would start from the back of the field.

The 25-year-old ran a long opening stint on the hard tyre before switching to the mediums – and while he made gains from his original starting slot, Tsunoda ultimately ended the race in P12, meaning that he has gone without points for the last three races.

Asked if the result had been the maximum that was possible from where he started – particularly given the traffic that he faced at times – Tsunoda conceded: “Yeah, pretty much, that's it.

“The pace was okay, not amazing but still not too bad. Other than that, pretty much that's it really. At least [a] positive is the car performance now, and the pace in the car felt a bit more normal or better than last previous races, so at least there's a bit of motivation there.”

Since moving to Red Bull from Racing Bulls at the third race weekend of the season in Japan – as part of a driver swap with Liam Lawson – Tsunoda has been open about the challenge of getting to grips with the RB21, having at one point compared it to “a science room”.

While there have been positive moments during this process – with points coming in Bahrain, Miami and Imola – Tsunoda acknowledged in Montreal that it also brings pressure, though admitted that he hopes to use this as an opportunity to prove himself.

“[Saturday] was a tough day with the 10-place nonsense penalty,” the Red Bull driver said. “[I] lost a lot of time in FP3, especially with the new upgrades when you want to especially learn about the car.

“Still with our team, you want to be as high as possible, but I enjoy this challenge I guess. [In] these moments I'm having a lot of pressure, sometimes I'm not enjoying them that much but it's part of the time that [is] an opportunity to improve myself and prove myself more.”

Tsunoda will be hoping for better when F1 heads to the Red Bull Ring for his team's home event, the Austrian Grand Prix, on June 27-29.

Opinion is sharply divided as to how high the superhero pic can fly when it hits theaters, with some suggesting a much lower range of $90 million to $120 million. 


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	With three weeks left to go, James Gunn and DC Studios‘ Superman is tracking to open in the $135 million range at the domestic box office.


	If that forecast is right, Superman would land high up on the list of DC openings, although it would lag well behind the $166 million domestic debut of 2016's Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, it would come in safely ahead of the last solo Superman movie, Zack Snyder's 2013 film Man of Steel ($116 million).




	Opinion, however, is sharply divided as to just how high Superman can fly.

	The $135 million stat is from leading tracking service the National Research Group, according to sources with access to the data. NRG always provides a range in addition to a solo number; in this case, the range for Superman's domestic opening is $125 million to $145 million. 


	Tracking is hardly a science, and projections have been notably off in a number of instances from all the services. To that end, insiders at DC Studios and Warners are being more conservative in suggesting $90 million to $125 million (although anything less than $100 million might be seen as a blemish).


	On the opposite end of the spectrum, some box office experts who monitor social metrics speculate that Superman could open to as much as $175 million, which would supplant Batman v Superman as DC's biggest opening. As of now, the next two biggest openings belong to Christopher Nolan's final two Batman movies, 2012's The Dark Knight Rises ($160.9 million) and 2008's The Dark Knight ($158.4 million). If opening to $135 million, Gunn's Superman would take the next spot, ahead of 2022's The Batman ($134 million) and 2016's Suicide Squad ($133.7 million), unadjusted.

	











	The highly anticipated summer tentpole is a seminal moment for Gunn and Peter Safran, as it's their first homegrown release since being tasked with restoring the luster to DC and making a stab at catching up with Marvel Studios. The movie, which kicks off their DC Universe, opens July 11 in North America, timed to its release around the world, meaning DC and Warners have three weeks to make their final marketing push.


Superman stars David Corenswet in the titular role opposite Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor. In this latest rendition of a story that's been told on the big screen numerous times, Superman grapples with his powers while trying to balance everyday life as journalist Clark Kent  after being sent to Earth from his home planet Krypton. (One new addition is the dog, Krytpo).


	The cast also includes Skyler Gisondo (Jimmy Olsen), Sara Sampaio (Eve Teschmacher), Edi Gathegi (Mister Terrific), Terence Rosemore (Otis), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl) and María Gabriela de Faría (The Engineer).

The ruling comes after sparring over whether the communications are relevant to the case. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Justin Baldoni can obtain messages between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift that relate to the filming of It Ends With Us, a court has ruled.


	U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman found on Wednesday that the information is relevant because Lively identified Swift as a person in her orbit who would likely have knowledge about complaints or discussions regarding the working environment on the set of the movie.




	Lively had moved for a protective order relieving her from producing the information Baldoni's lawyers sought, arguing that the communications are irrelevant.

	The court disagreed. It pointed to Lively citing Swift as possibly having information that can be used in the case.


	“The requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively's harassment and retaliation claims,” Liman wrote.


	The communications Baldoni can obtain will be limited to messages about the movie and the legal battle, according to the ruling. 


	Discovery in the case remains ongoing. Lively's legal team has said it will produce all documents that Baldoni's lawyers seek, except for communications with Swift, by the end of the week if they turn over all video footage related to the movie and unredacted versions of communications cited in their revised complaint. The offer was refused.


	Swift's involvement in the dueling lawsuits relates, in part, to suggestions from Lively that Baldoni altered a rooftop scene at the beginning of the film. Lively invited the director to her New York City home in 2023 to discuss the script changes. Once there, Baldoni was surprised to see Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and close friend, Swift, according to his lawsuit, which cites communications that include the name “Taylor.” The megastars praise Lively's version of the scene, pressuring Baldoni to accept the revisions, he alleged.

The Grammy winner pleads with people — again — to respect his boundaries. 


							By 

	Lexi Carson



	The Biebs is setting his boundaries.


Justin Bieber recently posted a personal text exchange on Instagram between him and an unnamed someone with whom he's cut ties, saying his former friend doesn't understand where his “anger” comes from.




	“I will never suppress my emotions for someone. Conflict is a part of relationship. If you don't like my anger you don't like me,” he wrote. “My anger is a response to pain I have been through. Asking a traumatized person not to be traumatized is simply mean.”

	The recipient replied: “I'm not used to someone lashing out at me. It's not that I don't see and feel your anger,” to which Bieber responded: “Ouch. This friendship is officially over. I will never accept a man calling my anger lashing out. I enjoyed our short lived relationship. I wasn't kidding when I told you I didn't need you as a friend. I have good friends. Who will respect these boundaries.”

	Then, the “What Do You Mean?” singer told the person to leave him alone and that he was blocking him.


	The next day, Bieber posted a statement on Instagram that said, in part: “People keep telling me to heal. Don't you think if I could have fixed myself I would have already? I know I'm broken. I know I have anger issues. I tried to do the work my whole life to be like the people told me I needed to be fixed like them. And it just keeps making me more tired and more angry. The harder I try to grow, the more focused on myself I am. Jesus is the only person who keeps me wanting to make my life about others.”

	











	The posts come after his unusual behavior on social media as of late, like when he went live on Instagram rapping to a song with gaunt eyes a few months ago, leading to fans becoming concerned.


	On Thursday, just three days before Father's Day, the Grammy winner was harassed — again — by paparazzi. In a video that's now gone viral, the photographers were surrounding his car. Bieber repeatedly told them to “get out of my face” and “stop asking me how it's going.” After they said “Happy Father's Day” to Bieber and continued to take photos and stay on his property, he said: “I'm a real dad with a real family. And you're really in front of my face.”


	“I'm just demanding respect. You confuse my anger with disrespect. It's anger because you're disrespecting me you don't get to disrespect me and get away with it,” he continued. “You don't get to force questions in people's face and take videos out of context and use it against people, that's mean.”


The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Bieber's reps for comment.

Palme d'Or winner Jafar Panahi and the Oscar-nominated Mohammad Rasoulof signed an open letter in France's Le Monde, calling on Iran to end uranium enrichment and for the killing on both sides to stop.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Iranian directors Jafar Panahi (It Was Just an Accident) and Mohammad Rasoulof (The Seed of the Sacred Fig) have signed an open letter calling for an end to the war between Iran and Israel and for the Iranian regime to shut down its nuclear program.


	Palme d'Or winner Panahi and the Oscar-nominated Rasoulof added their signatures to the op-ed published Wednesday in French newspaper Le Monde. Other prominent Iranian signatures included those of Nobel Peace Prize laureates Narges Mohammadi and Shirin Ebadi and human rights activists Sedigheh Vasmaghi, Shahnaz Akmali and Abdolfattah Soltani.

	“We demand the immediate halt of uranium enrichment by the Islamic Republic, the cessation of military hostilities, an end to attacks on vital infrastructure in both Iran and Israel, and the stopping of massacres of civilians in both countries,” the open letter reads. 


	Iran's enrichment of uranium has for decades been a cause of tension with the West and Israel. The latter justified its attacks on Iran last Friday, which sparked the current conflict, arguing Iran was close to building an atomic bomb, something Tehran denies.


	“We believe that continuing uranium enrichment and the devastating war between the Islamic Republic and the Israeli regime neither serves the Iranian people nor humanity at large,” the Le Monde letter continues. “Uranium enrichment is in no way in the interest of the Iranian people. They must not be sacrificed for the nuclear or geopolitical ambitions of an authoritarian regime,” they said.

	











	The signatories also called on Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to step down. “The current leaders of the Islamic Republic lack the capacity to resolve Iran's domestic crises or its external tensions. The only credible path to preserve this country and its people is for current authorities to step down.”


	In a post on his Instagram account, Panahi said he has been stranded in Australia since the invasion. The director was visiting the Sydney Film Festival when the conflict started. “Since that day, I have been looking for a way to come back home [to] my family and especially my mother,” Panahi wrote on his Instagram post, according to the Farsi to English translation.


	“This situation is deeply painful and deadly for me; not only because of the inevitable distance from home, but because of the feeling of incapability to face the suffering of the people who are sacrificed every day in the heart of this war. When the fate of a nation comes hostage to high-flying and power seekers, what is left for us is nothing but anger, grief and the heavy responsibility of telling the truth to future generations.”


	Panahi returned to Iran last month after winning the Palme d'Or for It Was Just an Accident. He has been able to travel freely since 2023, when Iran's Supreme Court overturned an earlier travel ban. Rasoulof, who received an Oscar nomination for The Seed of the Sacred Fig, fled Iran last year and currently lives in Germany. 


	The Israel-Iran conflict continues unabated, with Israeli media reports that Iran fired dozens of 30 ballistic missiles at Israel on Thursday morning. 

	











	U.S. President Donald Trump has called for Iran's “unconditional surrender,” but, so far, has not said whether the U.S. military will join Israel's ongoing attacks.

Judge Lewis J. Liman says the pals' discussions of the working environment on the set of It Ends With Us are relevant to Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation claims. 


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's text messages will have to be handed over in litigation over the movie It Ends With Us, with a judge determining that the friends' conversations about the working environment on set are relevant to Lively's sexual harassment and retaliation claims against co-star and director Justin Baldoni.


	Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, prevailed Wednesday (June 18) on the issue of Swift's text messages, which have taken center stage in Lively's It Ends With Us lawsuit over the past month. Baldoni first tried to get the texts directly from Swift herself, but then dropped his subpoena on the pop superstar, opting instead to seek the messages from Lively in the normal discovery process.


	Lively's lawyers fought that request last week, saying the actress' texts with Swift have no place in court and Baldoni is just trying to make headlines. But Judge Lewis J. Liman says these messages are indeed relevant, citing Lively's own discovery disclosures that identified Swift as someone who would know that Baldoni sexually harassed her on set and then orchestrated a retaliatory smear campaign after she complained.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Given that Lively has represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film, among other issues, the requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively's harassment and retaliation claims,” writes the judge.


	As for Lively's claim that Baldoni is only involving Swift in the case to prop up a public relations narrative, Judge Liman says “this concern does not justify denying the Wayfarer parties relevant discovery.”


	“A motion or request may be, and in this case often has been, both a legitimate litigation tactic and an attempt to maneuver in the broader court of public opinion,” writes the judge. “The mere fact that the request has been discussed in the press does not render it illegitimate.”


	A spokesperson for Lively reacted to the decision on Wednesday by noting that the actress has “produced far more documents in this case” than Baldoni. Lively's rep also says Baldoni and his publicity team have been trying to “drag Taylor Swift” into the debacle since they launched their alleged retaliatory smear campaign last summer.


	“We will continue to call out Baldoni's relentless efforts to exploit Ms. Swift's popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing,” adds Lively's spokesperson.


	A rep for Baldoni declined to comment on the decision.


	Swift's reps did not immediately return a request for comment on the matter. In a previous statement from May, the singer's team said she had no involvement in It Ends With Us and that Baldoni's subpoena against her was “designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.”


	The exchange of documents in Lively's harassment and retaliation lawsuit, which has also dragged in Swift's public opponent, Scooter Braun, is geared towards preparing for a trial in 2026. Baldoni has tried to bring a countersuit accusing Lively and her inner circle of defamation, but Judge Liman threw out those claims as legally invalid last week.

Sabrina Carpenter concerts could look a little different in the future, with the star revealing she's open to the idea of banning phones at her shows.


	Carpenter's comments appeared in a recent article from Rolling Stone, who shared quotes that didn't make it into their recent cover story with the singer. One of the previously-unpublished revelations was that Carpenter indeed open to asking fans to pocket their devices at her gigs.

	“This will honestly p–s off my fans, but absolutely,” she explained, noting she was inspired by a Las Vegas show from Silk Sonic which required her to lock her phone up.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I've never had a better experience at a concert,” Carpenter explained. “I genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies — wasn't alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone's singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.”


	Notably, Silk Sonic's 2022 Las Vegas residency even featured Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak crafting a song to underline the lack of devices. “We took your phones away,” they sang. “What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.”


	“I've grown up in the age of people having iPhones at shows,” Carpenter continued. “It unfortunately feels super normal to me. I can't blame people for wanting to have memories. But depending on how long I want to be touring, and what age I am, girl, take those phones away. You cannot zoom in on my face. Right now, my skin is soft and supple. It's fine. Do not zoom in on me when I'm 80 years old up there.”

	











	The topic of banning phones at gigs has been a contentious one over the years, with artists wishing for fans to live in the moment, and fans desiring a chance to memorialize their concert experiences.


	In 2015, Jack White shared a verbal plea for no phones during his Lazaretto tour, and by the time The Raconteurs toured in 2019, attendees were told to put their devices in locked Yondr pouches.


	“We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time.


	Other acts, such as Tool and A Perfect Circle have been noted for asking fans to observe such a practice, with the latter having made headlines for reportedly ejecting concert attendees who violated the request.


	“You ever go to a play or a movie?” A Perfect Circle guitarist Billy Howerdel asked in 2018. “If you've ever been to a play or a movie, it's kind of similar: you don't take out your phone and start filming, and let the people behind you stare into your screen.”


	More recently, Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood put out a request to fans to put down their phones during the band's Run for Your Lives World Tour. “We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood explained. 


	“The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers,” he added. “We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band.”

	Pop-punk icons Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley reunited onstage over the weekend for a surprise performance of Sum 41's “In Too Deep” during Lavigne's headlining set at the Vans Warped Tour stop in Washington, D.C.

	Eight songs into her June 15 set, Lavigne brought out her ex-husband — and Sum 41 frontman — to deliver one of the most iconic anthems of the genre. “What do you say we bring one of the OG Warped Tour bands back out here tonight to join me right now?” she told the crowd. “Let's hear it for Deryck from Sum f—ing 41!”

	Whibley, who had recently announced his retirement from music following Sum 41's final album Heaven :x: Hell, responded with his signature smirk: “Holy s—, goddamn. I thought I f—ing quit music. But how the f— can I miss the Warped Tour, right? I've come out of my three- or four-month retirement for two reasons: to be with the Warped Tour family, and to be with the one, the only, the motherf—ing princess.”

	The two, who were married from 2006 to 2010, launched into the 2001 hit backed by Lavigne's live band, creating one of the most buzzed-about moments of the Warped Tour's comeback weekend.


	After the show, Lavigne posted a carousel of photos from the set with a caption celebrating the reunion: “This legend @deryckwhibley from @sum41 joined me for one of the best pop punk anthems of all time ‘In Too Deep.'”

A post shared by Avril Lavigne (@avrillavigne)


	The moment marked Whibley's first return to the stage since Sum 41's retirement announcement earlier this year. The band wrapped things up following the release of their double album Heaven :x: Hell, citing Whibley's health issues and a desire to go out on a high note.


	The performance also came after a turbulent year for the frontman, who filed a lawsuit against former manager Greig Nori with claims of abuse. Nori denied the allegations and countersued.


	Still, in D.C., none of that overshadowed the shared nostalgia onstage. Lavigne summed it up best: “Headlined Vans Warped Tour last night and it was everything I would have expected and more!”

The superstar is only the second artist to perform for Spotify's Billions Club Live.


													By
												

	Lyndsey Havens



	As fortunate fans spilled into the intimate and sweaty Maxim's de Paris on Wednesday night (June 18), no one knew exactly what to expect. Vocals? For sure. Fashion? Absolutely. This is Miley Cyrus, after all.


	But when the superstar combined two of her biggest hits – none other than “The Climb” and “We Can't Stop” – into a special one-off medley, fans were floored. “We put this together just for all of you tonight,” shared Cyrus, in her first of two Mugler looks.

	











	The special and career-spanning fusion – reminiscent of two distinct times in the pop star's life – was fitting for an equally special evening. Cyrus hadn't performed in Paris for over 10 years, and she made sure her grand return was well worth the wait. The evening's set was for Spotify's Billions Club Live, making Cyrus only the second artist, after The Weeknd, to ever earn a Billions Club concert. (As Spotify previously confirmed to Billboard, Cyrus' Billions Club Live show was filmed to be released later this summer.)




			Trending on Billboard		







	Despite such a massive milestone, Cyrus stayed true to form and kept the setting and guest list rather intimate, with only a few hundred fans packed into Maxim's downstairs venue. But unlike her famed Chateau Marmont sets in Los Angeles or her recent performance at an equally intimate New York space — all in support of her latest album, Something Beautiful — Wednesday night was perhaps the most wide-ranging setlist fans have enjoyed for some time. 

	











	Thanks to the nature of Spotify's Billions Club Live, Cyrus' set was a tight hour (including an outfit change) of her biggest hits on the platform — all of which, yes, have reached more than 1 billion streams. (On the pre-show playlist, deep cuts including “Cattitude” off her She Is Coming EP satiated superfans.)


	“Being a part of the Billions Club is only a part of me – it's an honor, but in no means is it holistic,” Cyrus said. “Each of you are a piece of a billion, and without each of you, the billion doesn't even exist. That's how important and crucial you are to the success in my life. The confidence and goals that I have achieved [is] because of you and your support. And I've never really been too interested in numbers because math is done from the mind, but true authentic beauty is from the heart.”


	During her set, Cyrus demonstrated just how much of her heart has always been in her hits – and is likely what has pushed these in particular to become some of her biggest. During opener “Flowers,” she emphasized and riffed on the line “no regrets, baby” while holding up a bouquet of flowers gifted by a fan. And while introducing “The Climb,” she shared that the song is “inspired by the effort and the struggles that it takes to become the person you want to be. … I truly believe the most authentic version of yourself is deep within the struggle. … Everything in my life that I can stand here and be proud of at one point was towering over me like a mountain.” (The mere mention of a mountain elicited emphatic cheering.)


	And before performing her Plastic Hearts hit “Angels Like You” accompanied by nothing more than a piano, Cyrus told her fans: “You are the earth angels that make my life heaven.” And in another unexpected twist, she performed the impassioned “Wrecking Ball” next while still backed by only keys.

	











	After an outfit and hairdo change – from teased waves and a Mugler dress dripping with crystals to an updo with a Mugler crystal corset and suit jacket – Cyrus returned to the stage alongside her full backing band, which included a four-person string section and guitarist Maxx Morando. A front-row fan declared that Cyrus looked “super French,” to which Cyrus replied that they've actually been discussing what to name her current backing band, before concluding that “Super French” was the best idea they've heard yet.


	Cyrus then closed the show with a one-two punch of Something Beautiful standouts: “End of the World” and “More to Lose.” Before performing the latter, she said, “A lot of my songs are about resilience, and I'm very proud of that,” noting that the theme of resilience is one not only personal to her and her music, but that is universally felt – and desperately needed right now.


	Halfway through “More to Lose,” she turned to Morando and said she's tired of crying and wanted to do something a bit more fun. The solution? “Easy Lover.” Cyrus performed the song with an extended outro, during which she strutted from one side of the small stage to the other, blowing kisses to fans who were within arm's length before returning to its center to take a bow.


	And after showing off her outfit one last time, Cyrus seamlessly disappeared behind thick red velvet curtains, as if bringing her “End of the World” lyric to life: “Let's go to Paris, I don't care if we get lost in the scene.”


	As the wide-eyed expressions across the room proved, there's hardly a better scene to get lost in.

Creator Cylla Senii says T.I.'s conduct is ""ironic"" in the wake of the rapper's intellectual property court victory against toymaker MGA.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



T.I. has been hit with an intellectual property theft lawsuit over his upcoming movie Situationships, with a web series producer claiming the title is lifted from her own project of the same name.


	The rapper (Clifford Harris Jr.) faces trademark infringement claims in a complaint filed Wednesday (June 18) by Featherstone Entertainment, an Atlanta-based production company run by a creator named Cylla Senii.


	Senii has made two seasons of the scripted web series Situationships, which chronicles the ups and downs of millennial dating. The show launched on YouTube in 2016 and has since been distributed by BET Digital, Amazon Prime and Tubi.




			Trending on Billboard		







	According to the complaint, Senii worked between 2019 and 2024 to develop both TV show and movie versions of Situationships. But in the fall of 2024, she says, she was shocked to learn that T.I. and his company, Grand Hustle Films, were about to start filming their own comedy film called Situationships, written, directed by and starring the rapper.


	“Defendants are engaging in a common scheme and effort to take advantage of the public's association of Featherstone's ‘Situationships' brand by marketing their own film and entitling it ‘Situationships,'” writes Senii's attorney.


	The lawsuit claims T.I.'s alleged infringement is intentional. Senii's lawyer notes that one collaborator she worked with to develop her Situationships show is a close friend of T.I.'s family, and that another producer with whom she discussed the project is now working on the rapper's movie.


	Senii says this behavior is “ironic” after T.I. and his wife Tameka “Tiny” Harris' recent $71 million trial win in their long-running intellectual property battle against toymaker MGA, which took issue with dolls supposedly modeled after their teen pop group OMG Girlz.


	“Unfortunately, T.I. is engaging in the same conduct he fought so vigorously to protect himself from in his own intellectual property lawsuit,” writes Senii's lawyer.


	The lawsuit says Senii sent T.I. a cease-and-desist letter in December 2024, but he never responded. Senii has also challenged T.I.'s numerous attempts to obtain a trademark for “Situationships,” with one of T.I.'s applications getting preliminarily rejected in May after an examiner found there was a likelihood of confusion with the web series mark.


	Senii is now levying a slew of claims against T.I. and Grand Hustle Films for trademark infringement, unfair competition and civil conspiracy. She's seeking an injunction that would bar him from releasing his movie under the moniker “Situationships” as well as unspecified financial damages.


	Reps for the rapper and Grand Hustle Films did not immediately return a request for comment on the lawsuit.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Superman, the first movie under the new DC Studios headed by James Gunn and Peter Safran, arrived on tracking with $125M-$145M outlook on NRG. However, various distribution sources believe the real range for the Gunn-directed movie is more in the $90M-$125M vicinity.


	Because he's a brand name, Superman pops on unaided awareness (that's the category where those moviegoers polled automatically cite a movie they want to see, without being prodded by a pollster). With a 30 in unaided awareness, it's higher than Top Gun: Maverick ($126.7M). But is that the right comp? 


	Better to look at first choice, the definitely must-see category for those willing to get off their couch.

	In first choice, Superman is below such post Covid superhero movies as Thor: Love & Thunder ($144.1M opening), The Batman ($134M opening), and Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($118.4M). 


	Here's the rub: first choice for Captain America: Brave New World is higher than Superman‘s by 71% at the same point in time. That movie opened at $88.8M. In addition, Superman‘s first choice is 64% behind that of Matt Reeves' The Batman. 


	We already told you that Superman is the best advance ticket seller YTD in its first 24 hours, the pic's Amazon Prime Early Access paid screenings flying off Fandango's portal. Those screenings are on Wednesday, July 8 (7PM local time), three days before the pic's July 11 opening. Superman‘s presales outstripped that of Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps. 












	Sources say that when it comes to Superman‘s opening weekend outlook, it boils down to reviews. Ok, why this film above all others like Deadpool & Wolverine in the post pandemic landscape? Because everyone is familiar with Superman, and they'll make their decision to go based on strict word-of-mouth. 


	While these tentpole movies begin their advance drumroll months in advance with trailer drops (Superman dropped its first teaser just before Christmas), like all big event movies, the majority of Superman‘s P&A spend will be in the final days leading up to opening.   


Superman through seven movies (not including Justice League, but definitely including Batman v. Superman) have minted $2.56 billion at the global box office. Batman v. Superman opened to $166M, an Easter holiday record, and legged out to $330.3M domestic, $874.3M worldwide. 2013's reboot, Man of Steel, opened to $116.6M, and ended its U.S./Canada run at $291M, $670M WW. Both of those movies were directed by Zack Snyder.

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: John Morton's British sitcom series that has satirized the 2012 Olympics and the inner workings of the BBC is heading Stateside for a fictional soccer tournament.


	The BBC has officially greenlit Twenty Twenty Six, with Hugh Bonneville reprising his iconic role as Ian Fletcher from previous shows Twenty Twelve and W1A. 


	He'll be joined by a cast mixed with British and North American talent featuring Paulo Costanzo (Designated Survivor, Royal Pains), Chelsey Crisp (Fresh off The Boat, Ten Percent), Stephen Kunken (Billions, The Handmaid's Tale), Nick Blood (Day of The Jackal, Slow Horses), Jimena Larraguivel (Patience and RSC), Alexis Michalik (A Love Story) and Belinda Stewart-Wilson (The Inbetweeners, Stay Close).

	Bonneville has previously played Fletcher in Twenty Twelve and W1A, which satirized the organizers behind the London 2012 Olympics and the the working culture at the BBC via a pair of critically-acclaimed, BAFTA-winning comedies. Clarkson's Farm maker Expectation has taken over producing from BBC Studios for the new show.




			Watch on Deadline		







	In Twenty Twenty Six, former BBC Head of Values Fletcher heads to the U.S., Canada and Mexico to help with a highly anticipated soccer tournament. He takes on a new role as Head of Integrity for the Twenty Twenty Six Oversight team, made up of a set of new and colorful characters played by the fresh cast.


	Big names attached include Kunken, who played Ari Spyros in Billions; Costanzo, who has been in Road Trip and Joey; and Crisp, who played Honney Ellis in ABC's Fresh off the Boat.

	











	Given the setting and American talent attached, Twenty Twenty Six could be ripe for landing a U.S. co-production partner, but no word on that front yet.


Twenty Twenty Six was first mentioned by W1A star Sarah Parish on a podcast last year. No clarity on whether W1A favorites such as Parish, who played the robotic Head of Output Anna Rampton, or Jessica Hynes, who played Brand Consultant Siobhan Sharpe, will return for the Twenty Twenty Six series as of yet.


	Creator Morton said: “I'm thrilled and hugely grateful to the BBC for giving me the chance to follow Ian again, this time all the way to Miami, and I literally can't wait to see what happens.”  


	Nerys Evans, Creative Director, Scripted at Expectation, added: “I've been a fan of John's writing for such a long time, especially seeing the different challenges he creates for poor Ian Fletcher, so beautifully portrayed by Hugh Bonneville. We're thrilled to be collaborating on Twenty Twenty Six, I can't wait to see what he's got in store for Ian this time.” 


Twenty Twenty Six is being made for BBC One and iPlayer with additional support from OKRE regarding climate and health expertise. The series was commissioned by Jon Petrie, BBC Director of Comedy. The series is written and directed by Morton. The producer is Catherine Gosling Fuller, and the executive producers are Paul Schlesinger, Evans and Morton. The BBC Commissioning Editor is Emma Lawson. 


	BBC Studios, which has a minority investment stake in Expectation, will handle global sales.

	As Ryan Coogler works to bring MCU fans a third installment in the Black Panther franchise, casting speculation grows around the superhero movie.


Damson Idris recently offered a playful “yes-no” in response to whether or not he's been in contact with Marvel Studios about a role in an upcoming Black Panther movie following recent rumors.


	After Today‘s Craig Melvin asserted his response means “yes,” Idris teased, “It could mean no.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	When asked if he'd accept the role if it's offered, Idris gave a definitive “yes.”


	Chadwick Boseman first played the role of T'Challa, appearing in 2016's Captain America: Civil War, followed by the Black Panther feature film in 2018. The actor reprised the superhero role in 2018's Avengers: Infinity War and 2019's Avengers: Endgame.

	











	Boseman was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016 and died in August 2020. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was released in 2022 and dedicated to his memory. The film picked up following the death of T'Challa, with Letitia Wright's Shuri taking over the heroic title.


	In November 2024, Denzel Washington let it slip that he is being considered for a role in the third installment of Black Panther. During an interview in Australia promoting Gladiator II, he said that Coogler was “writing a part for me,” which the director has since confirmed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Waterfront tries—and fails—to capture Ozark's spirit","https://www.avclub.com/the-waterfront-review-netflix-tv","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The Waterfront bears a distinct resemblance to Ozark, another Netflix original that hinged on a reckless family's illegal shenanigans. While the Brydes ran a drug smuggling operation from a casino in Missouri in that Emmy winner, The Waterfront‘s Buckleys supply cocaine through their massive fishery business in a coastal North Carolina town. And the members of this clan also communicate with acrimony and anger, ready to betray or save their loved ones as the show's trope-laden plots and predictable twists dictate.   

This series tries very hard to be gritty when, in fact, it is stuffed with melodrama. The soapy flair is likely courtesy of creator Kevin Williamson, who also brought us Dawson's Creek and The Vampire Diaries, YA shows that thrived on cheesy dialogue, characters, and relationships. These elements don't transfer well to a wannabe serious tale that touches on themes about moral and financial corruption, PTSD, and intergenerational trauma over eight hour-long episodes. Hell, a man is almost fed to sharks in the premiere—and no, that is not the last torture scene involving aquatic creatures. 

These conflicting tones don't allow most of the actors to fine-tune their performances, with many of them feeling like they're on different shows. It's jarring to see older son Cane (an unconvincing Jake Weary) trapped in a mind-numbing Joey-Pacey-Dawson love triangle with his wife and ex, while his sister Bree (Melissa Benoist) struggles with the shattering consequences of her substance abuse. Ironically, Bree's family of smugglers continually chastise her about her inability to stay sober but put her in charge of training their restaurant's new bartender. That makes total sense, huh? Plus, her teen son is obnoxious, her ex is on a warpath, her current boyfriend is complicated, and she's still getting over a tragic childhood incident while being emotionally isolated from her own parents. Suffice it to say, there is too much going on with her. 

Still, she is The Waterfront‘s most layered character. And Benoist's commanding screen presence makes it easy to get invested in Bree's roller-coaster journey. The Supergirl actor is unflinching in the depiction of the physical and mental toll of recovery and self-discovery, whether it's through a complete breakdown, a rage-fueled outburst, or heartfelt one-on-ones with her kid, an annoying TV teen à la Homeland and 24. But unfortunately, and similar to last year's atrocious The Girls On The Bus, Benoist alone cannot elevate this material. 



This isn't to say that The Waterfront doesn't have other prominent performers who are worth sticking around for. Mindhunter‘s Holt McCallany is magnetic enough as patriarch Harlan, who is aptly described as “if John Wayne had a baby with Marlboro Man” by another character. And he shares crackling chemistry with Maria Bello, who plays Harlan's smooth-talking wife. Together, Harlan and Belle—clearly embroiled in a toxic marriage rife with affairs and lies but also, somehow, true love—try to rule over an operation that is slowly but surely slipping from their control.

The Buckleys' deep debt leads them into the open arms of an opioid supplier named Grady (Topher Grace), a villain who jovially says things like “I'm a hugger” and “Yay, let's go kill things.” While Grady is a cool curveball for the Buckleys, the disastrous results of their partnership can be seen coming from a mile away. The same can be said for practically every other cliffhanger, shootout, or turn of events in The Waterfront. It's also disappointing that POC actors like Rafael L. Silva and Humberly González—who portray the aforementioned bartender and Cane's ex-girlfriend, respectively—are sidelined. 

There's not much to be gleaned from The Waterfront overall. It's a basic dynastic drama about people whose motivations and actions are powered by money and blind loyalty. (You may feel an urge to shake Bree by her shoulders and tell her to get out of dodge throughout.) At least Ozark delivered a breakout star in Julia Garner and some wrenching family dynamics. The same can't be said for The Waterfront, which imitates that Netflix series down to its drab color palette. The show throws some intriguing chum in the water with Harlan's backstory, Belle's desire for power versus her maternal instincts, and Bree's surprisingly resonant crisis. But ultimately, the bait isn't enough to hook you in.     

The Waterfront premieres June 19 on Netflix

Food Network star Anne Burrell tragically passed away at the age of 55 in her home in Brooklyn, New York, on the morning of Tuesday, June 17.

The night prior, Burrell was at an improv show, PEOPLE reports. 

“Everyone said she was so great last night and so happy,” a source told the outlet. 

Another source added that she “was in great spirits last night during and after the improv show. Typical fun, outgoing Anne, having a blast.” And with that, people are “shocked and confused” because she appeared to be okay when she left the improv show. 

TMZ reported that Burrell was found unresponsive inside her home, and when paramedics arrived, they were unable to revive Burrell. She was pronounced dead at the scene. An autopsy will be conducted to determine her official cause of death.

A post shared by Entertainment Tonight (@entertainmenttonight)

On June 9, Burrell posted two photos, stating that she had been exploring the world of improv. And she invited people to swing by and check out her show. 

“Sooooooo… as I have mentioned I have been taking Improv classes @thesecondcitytc and having an ABSOLUTE blast!!! My class and I are coming to the end of this term and we get to do an actual show!!! If anyone is interested in stopping by on Monday June 16 at 9 pm @thesecondcity in Brooklyn please feel free!! We are a small but SUPER fun bunch!! #ilovewhatido #luckygirl @ashleymariebirdsall @joyfuljojo22 @j_margles @golfiinos @thesecondcity,” she wrote on Instagram. 

A post shared by The Second City NYC (@secondcitynyc)

Second City NYC was where Burrell was taking her improv classes, and after the news of her death broke, they posted a heartfelt tribute to her on Instagram. 

“We're are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend and student, Anne Burrell. She will be missed and remembered as a vibrant part of our Second City New York Training Center community. Anne brought joy, boldness, and an unwavering “yes, and” spirit. Her enthusiasm was contagious, her presence unforgettable. Our thoughts go out to Anne's family and loved ones,” Second City NYC wrote. 

Food Network also posted a kind message about Burrell. 

“We are deeply saddened to share the news that beloved chef, Anne Burrell, passed away this morning. Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent – teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring. Our thoughts are with Anne's family, friends and fans during this time of tremendous loss,” the network posted on Instagram.

On June 17, friends, family, and fans of chef Anne Burrell were shocked at her sudden passing. The magnetic Food Network personality was beloved by many. One of the most emotional tributes was from her close friend and fellow chef, Rachael Ray. 

“I can't quite believe it — such a strong, vibrant, fearless woman, so full of life and love, could be gone so soon,” she wrote. Bobby Flay, friend and fellow “Worst Cooks in America” chef, has also posted his praise of the star. He also says she gave him “the greatest gift” that will last forever.

On June 18th, Bobby Flay took to his Instagram stories and posted a photo of Anne Burrell sitting in a chair with the biggest smile on her face. Her two Maine Coons in her lap: Nancy and Marcia. 

“Worst Cooks in America was the funnest show on TV,” Flay wrote in the caption. “All of your co-hosts (me included) were just alongside for the Anne Burrell ride.”

“The greatest gift I got from AB was turning me on to a world of Maine Coon Cats (including Nacho)… a gift that I'll have forever.”

The photo he used was one that Burrell had posted in July 2024, before Marcia died. In October, she posted a picture of the newest member of the family, Lady Lorraine Periwinkle.

Burrell loved her Maine Coons and often posted photos of them on her social media, chasing shadows or just being cute. The last time was on May 16, when she posted an adorable Instagram video of Nancy grooming her husband, Stuart's, head.

Bobby Flay's love of Maine Coons has been well-documented over the past decade. In 2015, he brought home Nacho, the first cat companion he'd had in 30 years. 

“I often wonder if I wasted three decades without a cat around my home,” he told CBS in 2017. “Especially when I look into Nacho's eyes and I can almost hear his thoughts. He knows when I'm feeling a little under the weather, or I'm having a case of the blues. 

“He makes me a softer and more understanding person, and just by his presence and affection,” he continued. “The world has a way of giving you what you need, and sometimes, a new best friend shows up when you need him the most.”

He even took his love for Nacho and created a line of cat food: Made by Nacho. While Nacho sadly passed away in 2023, he still regularly posts photos of his current Maine Coons: Conelo and Stella. He has also never forgotten Nacho and posts about him, as well.

Johnny Depp brought a little pirate magic — and a lot of smiles — to young patients at Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital in Madrid.

The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star surprised kids on Monday, June 16, by arriving in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume during a break from filming his latest project, “Day Drinker,” in Spain. 

Here are pictures and videos:

Photos from the visit captured sweet moments of Depp — completely in character — laughing with children, touching pinkies with them in their rooms, and brightening their day with a swashbuckling dose of joy.

This isn't the first time Johnny Depp has donned his beloved pirate costume to bring joy to children in need.

In September 2024, while attending the San Sebastian Film Festival, Depp made a special visit to Donostia University Hospital in San Sebastian.

There, he visited young patients in the Pediatrics and Oncology ward — staying in full Jack Sparrow character the entire time, laughing, joking, and lifting spirits throughout the visit.

Over the years, Depp has brought this same kind of magic to children's hospitals around the world — from Vancouver, Paris, and London to Brisbane, Australia, and cities across the U.S., always surprising young patients and hospital staff with his heartwarming visits.

Depp first brought Jack Sparrow to life in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003, starring alongside Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.

He reprised the role in four more films: Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017).

Following his highly publicized 2022 trial with ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp has been making a carefully orchestrated return to Hollywood, starting with his 2023 film, Jeanne du Barry.

The future of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has remained unclear since the release of “Dead Men Tell No Tales”.

In May 2024, franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer told Entertainment Weekly, “If it was up to me, [Johnny] would be in it.”

“I love him. He's a good friend. He's an amazing artist and he's a unique look,” Bruckheimer, 81, said. “He created Captain Jack. That was not on the page, that was him doing a little Pepé Le Pew and Keith Richards. That was his interpretation of Jack Sparrow.”

Though a rep for Depp denied reports of his return in 2022, a source close to the actor told PEOPLE in July 2023 that a comeback could still be possible.

As of December 2024, Variety reported that Bruckheimer was developing two versions of a sixth Pirates movie, leaving the door open for Depp to reprise his role, possibly. 

Whether or not he returns to the high seas in another Pirates adventure, Johnny Depp is keeping the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow alive — and for the young patients he visits, that magic means more than any blockbuster.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","What The Critics Are Saying About '28 Years Later'","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/what-critics-are-saying-28-years-later/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 13:52:34 GMT","

“28 Years Later” is one of the most highly anticipated films of 2025. This is especially the case when it comes to zombie movies. It's been almost 20 years since the second movie in the horror franchise, and many are wondering if the new installment will be worth the wait. 

So far, director Danny Boyle's “28 Years Later” is doing quite well in regards to early reviews. It currently holds a certified fresh 95% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. At the time of writing, this is based on 95 reviews. 

One top critic from the site, Perri Nemiroff, said, “Not only is 28 Years Later well worth the wait, but the story benefits from the lengthy gap between installments. It delivers big with Rage Virus-sparked tension and action, but also takes an unexpected turn that's staggeringly refreshing and effective.”

According to Bill Goodykoontz, “Boyle controls every frame — don't let the mind-bending chaos of the chase scenes fool you. This is a technical marvel.”

Still, some critics don't believe “28 Years Later” ranks among the best zombie movies. Stephen Silver remarked, “There are several things wrong here, from a cruddy visual style to incoherent action scenes to a listless lead performance.”

Another reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes, Hilary A. White, said, “Boyle and Garland[the writer] are obviously entitled to add a smirk or two, but they can have no complaints if the muddled tone flies over the heads of audience members.”

People who have already seen “28 Years Later” are remarking on its visual quality. Some love it, and others think it looks a bit dated. However, what many may not know is that at least some of the film was shot using Apple iPhones.

This information was confirmed to Wired, and the production specifically used the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Of course, this isn't the first film in the series to use unconventional cameras. The first one, “28 Days Later,” utilized a Canon XL-1, which was valued at approximately $4,000 at the time. 

Other well-known productions have also utilized the Apple iPhone for filming. “Tangerine” from 2015 and “Unsane” from 2018 used the popular smartphone for their productions. Notably, Lady Gaga used an iPhone for the music video for her 2020 single, “Stupid Love.”

Like several movies these days, there is a follow-up to “28 Years Later.” This one, “28 Years Later: The Bone Temple,” will hit theatres on January 16th, 2026. The film is also from Sony Pictures Releasing, but Nia DaCosta directed it. Reports say the two films were shot back-to-back. 

“28 Years Later” hits theatres on June 20th.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","'Bewitched' Star Celebrates Turning 61 With a Brand New Selfie","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/bewitched-star-celebrates-61-new-selfie/","Thu, 19 Jun 2025 02:42:47 GMT","

The “Bewitched” TV series is considered an American classic. Much of this had to do with Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York, who played Samantha and Darrin, respectively. However, who can forget their daughter, Tabitha? 

Two actresses played Tabitha in the “Bewitched” TV Series. Notably, they are twin sisters, but one, Erin, recently highlighted her birthday on social media. She took to her official Instagram account to celebrate her 61st birthday. She said in the post, “Rise & shine, it's my birthday! This is 61.”

In the photo, Erin appears to be sitting on a couch, wearing a black, short-sleeved shirt.  Of course, she's also wearing a smile on her face. Naturally, several loved ones and adoring fans of the “Bewitched” TV series took to the comments to wish Erin a happy birthday. 

A post shared by Erin Murphy (@erinmurphybewitched)

According to the Daily Mail, Erin and Diane Murphy began playing Tabitha on the “Bewitched” TV series in 1966. The twin sisters shared the role for more than 20 episodes. However, Erin took it over until the series ended in 1972. The character was introduced during the show's second season. 

So, why did two actresses play the role? In a nutshell, television shows depicting characters as young as Tabitha have to find ways to be in accordance with the child labor laws. Each girl could only work a certain number of hours, so having two cast members did the trick. 

Notably, this is the exact reason why both Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen played Michelle on “Full House.” The “Little House on the Prairie” series employed the same tactic to comply with child labor laws. 

For Erin, there was an interest in continuing as an actress after the “Bewitched” TV show ended. In fact, she still has the actress title in her Instagram bio. Following the show, she continued to pursue her passion and even appeared on the “Lassie” TV show. 

A post shared by Erin Murphy (@erinmurphybewitched)

Additionally, Erin has been in more than 100 commercials and was also a model for the Hang Ten swimwear line. She has also worked as a casting director, makeup artist, and fashion stylist. According to her Instagram, she also recently competed in the Ed Asner Celebrity Poker Tournament. 

Regarding Diane, she doesn't seem to have been interested in acting beyond the “Bewitched” TV show. As of 2019, she was the Associate Executive Director of Shelter Services for Women. She holds degrees from the University of California and Golden Gate University, Santa Barbara.

On May 13, production, financing, and distribution company StudioFest filed a copyright lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court alleging that Alison Brie and Dave Franco had turned down an offer to star in the studio's film “Better Half,” and then developed their own concept of a body horror movie based on a co-dependent relationship, “Together,” with WME.

Now the director of “Together,” Michael Shanks, is firing back in a statement released via the X and Instagram accounts of the film's distributor, Neon, which bought the completed feature for $17 million out of Sundance earlier this year, the biggest deal of the festival. The film had premiered to raves, with its sharp insights into what it means to be in a long-term relationship somehow then translated into grisly body horror visuals. Franco's Tim and Brie's Millie have been together for years and just at the moment that their relationship seems to have hit the rocks, something happens to cause them to start literally sticking together — to be incapable of leaving each other's presence.

Shanks called the accusation of idea theft “entirely untrue,” “devastating,” and that it had “taken a heavy toll” in the remarks that laid out his long relationship to this story. WME had previously told IndieWire that the lawsuit was “frivolous and without merit” and that the agency would “vigorously defend ourselves.”

“Have you ever been in a relationship so long that the line between you and the other person starts to blur?” Shanks said to kick off his statement. “I've been with my partner for over 16 years — almost half my life. That entanglement of identity, love, and co-dependence is what inspired TOGETHER. It's not just a script; it's a reflection of something deeply personal. Tim's story, his love for Millie, his relationship to his family, his relationship to unfulfilled ambitions as a musician, is completely rooted in my own personal life. I lost my father at a young age in the same way our main character does, his trauma is rooted in my own. To have this called into question is not only deeply upsetting but entirely untrue.”

“I wish I didn't have to clarify this, but I completed the first draft in 2019 and registered it to the Writer's Guild of America that same year. In October 2020, I received development funding from Screen Australia to further the project. In 2022, my agent at WME introduced me to Dave Franco. From the very first meeting, we bonded over our love of horror, and I pitched him TOGETHER — a script I had been trying to get into production for years, with no luck. Soon after, he and Alison Brie came onboard to act in and produce the film. To now be accused of stealing this story — one so deeply based on my own lived experience, one I've developed over the course of several years — is devastating and has taken a heavy toll.”

Legacy has been top of mind for Uma Thurman: It's the primary reason she all but entirely avoided the action genre since “Kill Vill Vol. 2” came out in 2004.

That's about to change with her appearance in Netflix's “The Old Guard 2,” as the villain Discord. It took a particularly special film to get Thurman out of action-movie retirement, she said on “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” June 17.

“I never really followed ‘Kill Bill‘ up with action because I didn't kind of want to be in a whole bunch of ‘B' action movies,” Thurman said. “When you do ‘Kill Bill,' you never stop hearing about, you know, it's like, ‘Oh, got to be very careful about what I do next.' So I did other stuff.” 

 








Related Stories Diego Luna Is Still Offered Drug Dealer Roles, but Before ‘Rogue One' That Was All He Got To Make Venice Winner ‘Familiar Touch,' Sarah Friedland Turned a Retirement Home Into a Radical Indie Film Set 

That meant, post-“Kill Bill,” Thurman appeared in the musical “The Producers,” rom-coms like “Playing for Keeps,” and auteur projects such as Lars von Trier's “Nymphomaniac” and “The House that Jack Built” and Paul Schrader's “Oh, Canada!” But never really action again, until “The Old Guard 2.” The first movie, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood and starring Charlize Theron, who returns for the sequel, impressed Thurman with its “depth” and by being “quite moving.” In fact, she had such regard for Theron's work on that film that when Fallon asked her if being in this movie gave Thurman an opportunity to “show everyone how it's done,” she had a pointed response.

 










“I didn't think I was going to show anybody how it's done after I saw Charlize in ‘Old Guard 1,'” Thurman said. “This one seemed different [from other action movies she was offered] because in ‘Old Guard 1' Charlize was just so epic in it. And so I thought, ‘Well, I could go do this for her in that. Where she's kind of taking the genre there. I'll go support her and fight her and battle her out.'”

“Putting her toe” into the action genre again, as she put it, didn't come quite as easily to Thurman as one might have thought, in part because she came aboard the project late and didn't have time for training beforehand.

“Oh, if only I could have trained,” she said. “No, I came on to do it kind of at the end. So I had no training. I was like, ‘Oh yeah, a sword. I think I hold it like this.'” 

Sounds like someone needs a return visit to Hattori Hanzo.

Diego Luna is the title character in one of the most acclaimed TV series of the past few years with “Andor” — not to mention that the Tony Gilroy-created show is one of the most acclaimed “Star Wars” projects in the history of the franchise.

But that doesn't mean Luna still doesn't get offered roles as drug dealers. Thankfully, though, his years with “Star Wars” dating back to 2016's “Rogue One” have resulted in drug dealers not being the only type of role he's offered.

“Before ‘Star Wars,' the only projects I'd get offered would be drug dealers,” Luna told The Hollywood Reporter, as part of their drama actors roundtable. “And then I could be the nice drug dealer and not the vicious one but still a drug dealer. Because the system wasn't even sending messages of, like, ‘Yes, you could find a way to be yourself and still work in those projects that you're looking at and hoping to see yourself reflected in.' But I do think that's changed, and the middleman between the audience and us is not there anymore. There's no guy with a cigar saying, ‘You! You're gonna be a star, boy.' People just click now, and suddenly it's like, ‘Shit, they're watching a Mexican show.' You can be as far away as you can from the system, and the system will go and search for you if there's a need to hear your story.”

But to clarify, Luna then added, “Oh, I still get a lot of drug dealers. It's just I'm not looking for what they want me to play. I can look for the stuff I want to do. It's that freedom that comes with understanding that people today care about specificity.” 

 










Luna played the “boss of all bosses” and founder of the Guadalajara Cartel Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo for two seasons of “Narcos: Mexico” from 2018 to 2020. The actor also recalled how often he'd be told to lose his Mexican accent in order to play a wider variety of roles earlier in his career.

“I remember being asked, ‘Are you going to clean up your accent?' That's not part of the conversation anymore. But when I was 20, it was like, ‘Man, you're great, and if you work with your accent, you'll be doing what this person or that person is doing.' And you go, ‘Why would I like to do that? This is what makes me unique.'”

Thankfully, the powers that be at Lucasfilm agreed. Hearing a Mexican accent from a member of the Rebel Alliance in “Rogue One” was quietly revolutionary in its own way. Sometimes leaning more into how you are can bring greater specificity and depth to a character. And TIME magazine certainly agreed recently, when they named Luna to the TIME 100.

Last night, Model/Actriz made their TV debut playing the Pirouette song “Cinderella” on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. As to be expected, the New York-based industrial post-punk band threw itself into the performance with plenty of panache, with frontperson Cole Haden fist-pumping, dancing, and twirling down a runway of blue strobe lights. Watch a replay below.

Model/Actriz released Pirouette, their second studio album and the follow-up to 2023's Dogsbody, last month. It includes the singles “Doves,” “Diva,” and the aforementioned “Cinderella.” The LP was co-produced and mixed by Seth Manchester and mastered by Matt Colton, both of whom worked on Model/Actriz's debut.

Although Model/Actriz churned their way through a spring tour already, they've recently announced an extensive run this fall, too. In addition to headlining slots at major cities in North America and Europe, they're also playing music festivals like Kalorama, C2C, and Down the Rabbit Hole.

							By 

	Stephen Rodrick




M
atty Matheson is driving down memory lane in a green 1963 Ford Galaxie. The skies above Fort Erie, Ontario, are gray, obscuring the Buffalo skyline across the lake. He points out some of the town's landmarks.


	“That building over there is where I was served my first beer,” says Matheson, clad in flannel shirt, trucker cap, and slip-on shoes. The clothes semi-cover his comprehensively tatted body, which recently found room for the names of his three kids, MacArthur, Rizzo, and Ozzy. 


	The chef and restaurateur turned Vice star turned The Bear producer and actor grew up here, but now lives with his wife and three kids in neighboring Ridgeway, about 10 minutes away. It's an important distinction. Fort Erie bursts with American tourists in the summertime, but today is empty on a gray May morning. We pull into a parking space in a desolate part of town formerly dotted with strip clubs, not far from the factory where his mom once worked debriding airplane wings.

	











	 “The kids from Ridgeway would come here on the weekends,” says Matheson. “We knew everybody, so they stood out. My brother and I would fight with them every weekend.” He cracks a grin, remembering days of drugs, booze, and getting pepper sprayed by the cops. “We weren't bullies, we were just scrappy.”

	Matheson speaks in a quiet, thoughtful way. It is the vox opposite of the frenetic and high-pitched Neil Fak, the happily incompetent handyman who provides comic relief amidst the Michelin-starred angst on The Bear (Season Four is streaming now).  

	











	Matheson bought the Galaxie last year. He loves it despite some manic pixie car quirks, a.k.a. windows that won't open, possessed blinkers, and audio provided by an iPhone and portable JBL speaker that was not a factory option.


	 “I think it's bitching,” says Matheson. I search for and do not find seatbelts in the worn upholstery. “It's a great family car. My kids love it. It's a classic.”

	You could say Matheson has returned to the classics after years on a gravel-road joy ride that made and nearly ended him. More on that later. Now, Matheson is remembering his childhood on Prince Edward Island where his Grampy Matheson ran the Blue Goose, a roadside diner on the Trans Canada Highway. Grampy only had a one-bedroom apartment attached to the restaurant, so Matheson and his siblings would sleep on the banquettes on summer and holiday visits while his parents crashed on a pull-out sofa in the diner's office. 


	“I remember him making fresh dinner rolls every day,” says Matheson. “He made all his chowders and bisques and soups and their turkey dinner. It opened at 6 a.m. so we had to wake up early. There really wasn't any separation between the restaurant and family.” Matheson smiles at the memory. “And I loved it.” 


	MATHESON'S TWENTIES READ like the lyrics to a metal punk band song. Matter of fact, Matheson's friends in the metal band Cancer Bats wrote a song about him called “Dead Set on Life”: “The day the doctor told me, Son, you're gonna die/If you continue to live like this /You've got another year at best.”


	Matheson moved to nearby Toronto at 19 and tried to recreate the Grampy lifestyle with a new family jerry rigged from the geniuses and misfits in the Toronto food world. He went to culinary school, played in punk bands — he has a WWDD tattoo on his finger for “what would Dee Dee Ramone do” — and consumed massive quantities of brown liquor and unlicensed pharmaceuticals. Eventually, it became impossible to separate his kitchen and partying skills; they were Siamese twin components of Matheson's Falstaffian personality.

	It all worked until it didn't, and Matheson suffered a heart attack at 29. The health crisis initially provided him with a let's say counterintuitive revelation: Life is short, so I'd better enjoy the fuck out it and party even harder. Bottom was hit two years later, in 2013, when he happily accepted a bag of coke from his dealer in front of customers at Toronto's Parts & Labour restaurant, where Matheson served as executive chef. Thankfully, his wife, Trish, Matheson's high-school sweetheart, stood by him, and his few remaining restaurant friends staged an intervention not long after. Matheson has now been clean for almost 12 years.

	











	The initial challenge, besides staying alive, was figuring out how to still be “Matty Matheson” without all the potions and powders. It was especially tricky since Matheson's party monster persona had started to pay the bills. He was moving into video, winning a best cheeseburger contest on a Canadian competition show called Burger Wars, and then on YouTube shows including Hangover Cures, where Matheson would get trashed with his friends and then concoct, yes, a hangover cure meal. 


	Now, he had to do it sober. It wasn't as hard as he thought it would be. He went to work for Vice and created Dead Set on Life for Viceland, the title taken from the Cancer Bats song. The show featured Matheson traveling the world in various Matty-out-of-water scenarios that included Matheson dancing with indigenous Canadians in full war dress. He was still Matheson, a wise clown dropping f-bombs — a Toronto magazine counted 150 in a single episode — and branching into video-Hunter S. Thompson territory covering a Canadian federal election.


	“If you watch my first few cooking videos, there is no persona,” Matheson tells me as he steers the Galaxie toward Rizzo's House of Parm, Matheson's Italian joint named after his daughter and located just a few miles from his home. “There is no nothing. It's just me. I figured out if I built this thing, then I can turn it on and turn it off. I can say, ‘OK, I'm in front of a camera. I can become loud. I can say stupid stuff.'” 


	Matheson says all this in a quiet voice that battles with the Galaxie's engine. “The way I am today is the way I am in real life.” He chuckles. “Also, now I have three kids. I'm forty-fucking-three.” 


	THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER landing in a Toronto ICU unit, Matty Matheson was wearing a tux in Hollywood and holding an Emmy as The Bear won Outstanding Comedy Series. Matheson was given the honor of making the acceptance speech, which was momentarily delayed by co-star Ebon Moss-Bachrach planting a lengthy kiss on his lips. 


	Then he spoke.


	“I just love restaurants so much — the good, the bad,” Matheson said. “It's rough. We're all broken inside, and every single day, we've got to show up and cook and make people feel good by eating something and sitting at a table, and it's really beautiful.” 


	Matheson's remarks are a good distillation of The Bear, which centers around Carmy Berzatto, played by Jeremy Allen White, returning home to Chicago from a globe-trotting life working at Michelin-starred restaurants. Carmy takes over the family's Italian beef restaurant after his brother's suicide. The show was created by Christopher Storer, whose sister Courtney is a chef. Courtney knew Matheson from the restaurant circuit and asked him to consult on the show. 

	











	“At first, it was mostly about making the restaurant seem real,” says Matheson. “The restaurant is struggling, so I told them, ‘No way they have this many pans or their freezer would be so full, they wouldn't be able to afford it.'” 


	Friends of mine who have worked in restaurants marvel at how The Bear gets the culinary ecosystem just right; the temperamental geniuses, the adrenaline-junkie moments in the kitchen at 8 p.m. on a Saturday, the shedding of family and relationships in service of an all-consuming lifestyle. I ask Matheson what he meant by saying “we are all broken” in his Emmy speech.


	“I think the show that we're making is a perfect example of that,” says Matheson. “Carmy's brother took his life. [So Carmy is] put in a situation of life on life's terms. He's not in control. None of us are. The downfall of Carmy is that he goes home when he doesn't really want to go home, but it also saves him. The team at the restaurant believe in him but also are like, ‘What the fuck are you doing?' And that creates accountability.” 

“I missed funerals, weddings, fucking birthdays. I missed every single Mother's Day. Because I wanted to be a chef.“


	Matheson grimaces a bit. 


	“I can relate to that.”


	This is all true and poignant, but let's face it, this is television, and viewers love Matheson not for his culinary fact-checking, but for the manic lovability he brings to Fak. Though Matheson had never acted before, the creative team almost immediately got the idea to cast him. Matheson had one condition: “I just didn't want to play a chef.” Everyone agreed, he says, “that playing a guy who doesn't know how to use a screwdriver would be funny, since I don't know how to use a screwdriver.” This stipulation granted, Storer and company trusted Matheson enough that he appears in the pilot's first moments. The performance channels his video persona. “The first scene I shot, they said ‘action,'” Matheson says, “and I just started laughing because it all seemed so absurd.”


	On the show, Fak is sometimes pressed into front-of-house duties. There's a scene where a petrified Fak carries broth and two bowls out to a table on a tray. He ceremoniously pours the broth into two bowls as the diners look on with anticipation. He then returns to the kitchen with the bowls, having forgotten to leave them for the patrons. I ask him if something like that had ever happened at one of his restaurants. 


	“Not really, but once we plated a salad and took it out to the table. A few seconds later, we hear a scream,” says Matheson. “Turns out there was a tiny praying mantis that just blended in and no one caught it.”

	











	Each season, Matheson gets a little more screen time, especially after the introduction of Teddy Fak, his onscreen brother. Teddy is played by Ricky Staffieri, a Chicago local who started on the show as a crew member. “I love Ricky so much,” says Mattheson, who was leaving Fort Erie in a few days for Los Angeles, where he would be producing and financing a short film by Staffieri. While many of Neil and Teddy's scenes seem like improvised riffing, Matheson insists it is all pre-written by Storer and his team.


	He is proud of one contribution. The show's iconic episode is Season Two's “Fishes,” a flashback to a profoundly dysfunctional Berzatto Christmas dinner that won Emmys for guest stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Jon Bernthal while also featuring Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, and John Mulaney. Amongst all the dross and angst, Neil and Teddy try to talk everyone into investing in a baseball-card trading venture that might generate $500 in profits after a year. (Mulaney's character agrees to invest solely on the premise that the stories of how the Fak brothers lost his money will be hilarious.)


	“We pitched that,” says Matheson with pride. “We were like, ‘Yo, what if we just started pitching every character to get in on our baseball hustle?' Chris loved it, and it turned into a bit. We're like, ‘We'll do Bernthal, we'll do Mulaney.' We turned it into something that evened off a lot of tension. We've become this velvet hammer within the chaos of this family. A lot of that is Ricky. He changed my life.”


	One of the recurring themes of The Bear is artist chefs forgetting why they got into cooking in the first place, replacing solid good meals with magical-realist creations that bear only a passing semblance to actual food. On the road, Matheson and I are not far from one of his touchstones, the Robo Mart, a combo gas station-sandwich shop where he would religiously place the same order: a chicken-finger sandwich smothered in sauce.


	“When I was 27, at the height of me being this chef in Toronto, I would never put a chowder on [the menu] and just make a basic chowder that was really good,” says Matheson, rolling his eyes. “I'd have to throw a bunch of stupid shit in there, just ego-driven shit. Now I try to take the ego out of everything and just be like, ‘What do people genuinely want to eat?' And I think it's simple things.” Like his chicken-finger sandwich. “So it becomes, how can I make these simple things great every time.” 


	I mention a scene in The Bear where a notorious chef urges Carmy to “subtract.” 


	“Yeah, it's all about restraint,” says Matheson. “If it doesn't add to the story, it takes away.”


	We pull into Rizzo's, one of six restaurants that Matheson owns. Matty happily cops to having ADHD, but he's replaced the adrenaline-pursuing deathtrap of getting high with more positive endeavors that include but are not limited to the television show, bestselling cookbooks, and a clothing line for larger men. Oh yeah, he's also playing dates as lead singer of the hardcore band Pigpen. 


	The restaurant in The Bear is driven and nearly destroyed by dysfunctional behavior. That's not Rizzo's. There's a noticeable lack of tension as the staff preps for the dinner crowd. Matheson says hello and grabs some fresh bread and olive oil from the kitchen. 

	











	“The older I get, the more when I get to a town I want to find the oldest steakhouse where I can eat and hang out with my friends and family,” says Matheson. “I'll just go to the same three restaurants where I feel comfortable and happy.” 


	Rizzo's is that kind of place for his family. 


	“My kids love it here,” he says. “Rizzo likes to get dressed up as a princess when we come here.”


	He goes quiet for a moment. “Mental health is a tough thing that now we can talk about,” says Matheson, referencing his dark years. “I come from a place where nobody talked about it. Even as loving and amazing as my parents are, I never had sit-downs about ‘how do I feel' with my father. He was endlessly encouraging and stuff like that, but we never had heart-to-hearts.” He smiles. “I have heart-to-hearts with my kids every day, sometimes here.”

“I try to honor the people that are in my family, who helped make me. All my restaurants now are based on everyone in my life.”


	Matheson seems to be in a good place, but he knows that the path from Toronto culinary bad boy to family man has not come without a cost.


	“I cooked every day for 15 years,” says Matheson. “I missed funerals, I missed weddings, I missed fucking birthdays. I missed every single Mother's Day. I missed every single thing.” 


	His eyes well with emotion but without tears.


	“I asked my chef to take time off to go to my grandfather's funeral in Prince Edward Island,” says Matheson. “He said, ‘If you go, you're done.' And I called my parents, like, ‘I need this job. I don't have a financial security blanket.' And I missed his fucking funeral because I wanted to be a chef.”


	Whenever Matheson is on Prince Edward Island, he visits Grampy's grave to “say ‘what up.'” He pays respect to Grampy in other ways: The organic farm behind his Ridgeway house is called Blue Goose Farms, and Bar Clams, a Matheson restaurant in Toronto, has seafood dishes based on his grandfather's recipes.


	“I think that's a part of me honoring him,” says Matheson. “I try to honor the people that are in my family, who helped make me.” He gestures at Rizzo's. “This place honors Tricia. She's Italian. All my restaurants now aren't some idea I conjured up but are based on everyone in my life.”


	A few minutes later, Matheson tells me has to go. He's leaving Rizzo's to go see the actual Rizzo sing a Wicked medley with her glee club.


	“I can't miss that,” says Matheson.


	Grampy lives.

	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office requested “a passive approach to Juneteenth messaging” for the holiday on Thursday commemorating the end of slavery, according to an email obtained by Rolling Stone. The news was relayed by the Pentagon's Office of the Chief of Public Affairs, which said it wasn't planning to publish Juneteenth-related content online, per the email. 


	Juneteenth marks the day in 1865, after the Civil War ended, when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, and announced that the enslaved Americans in the state had been freed. June 19 was made into a federal holiday under a law signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and with broad bipartisan support in the U.S. House. 


	Asked for comment, a Pentagon official says the Department of Defense “may engage in the following activities, subject to applicable department guidance: holiday celebrations that build camaraderie and esprit de corps; outreach events (e.g., recruiting engagements with all-male, all-female, or minority-serving academic institutions) where doing so directly supports DoD's mission; and recognition of historical events and notable figures where such recognition informs strategic thinking, reinforces our unity, and promotes meritocracy and accountability.”

	











	The White House did not respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment.


	Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, the administration has led a crusade against the concept of diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI. Hegseth has dutifully carried out Trump's anti-diversity purge, declaring in a handwritten directive, posted to X, that “DEI is DEAD” at the Department of Defense. “Those who do not comply will no longer work here,” he added. 

	











	In a Senate hearing Wednesday, the former Fox News host said in his prepared testimony, “DEI is dead. We replaced it with a colorblind, gender-neutral, merit-based approach, and the force is responding incredibly.” Hegseth has claimed that “DEI & social/gender theories directly undermine meritocracy and standards. Which, in the military, makes us less ready — and gets troops killed.”

	Hegseth banned the Defense Department from using official resources to celebrate heritage months — like Black History Month, the day before it began. And in late February, a top Hegseth deputy ordered the Pentagon to remove all “news and feature articles, photos, and videos that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.” This has meant deleting the historic achievements of Black, Latino, and women veterans — and occasionally backtracking under scrutiny. 


	The following month, the Defense Department temporarily removed an article highlighting the accomplishments of Jackie Robinson, who served in World War II and was the first Black player in the modern history of Major League Baseball. 


	The Air Force temporarily took down a basic-training class featuring videos of the Tuskegee Airmen, known for being the first African American pilots in the U.S. military. “This will not stand,” Hegseth said, pledging to fix it. Yet, the Arlington Cemetery went on to delete a webpage honoring the graves of several famous Tuskegee Airmen. On the Arlington Cemetery website's page highlighting notable graves, all references to African American history, Hispanic American history, and women's history were deleted.


	The anti-DEI purge has also come for content relating to Juneteenth.


	Last year, the Army published an article on its website titled, “Juneteenth: Celebrating freedom, honoring those who fought for equality.”

	The post stated, “Juneteenth is an integral part of Army life. It is a time to reflect on the crucial role the Army played in the Emancipation Proclamation and ending segregation in the U.S.”


	The article, which called on readers to “honor those who fought and sacrificed to ensure the Constitution fulfilled its promise to all Americans,” has since been removed from the Army's website.

W
hen the pandemic brought the live-music industry to a complete stop in 2020, Bruce Springsteen found himself at home with a lot of free time on his hands. He decided to make good use of it by poring over his massive vault of unreleased music, pulling out seven complete records he shelved between 1983 and 2018, and packaging them together as Tracks II: The Lost Albums, which features an astounding 74 songs most hardcore fans have never heard. 


	“If you look at them as a group, they're sort of genres that I haven't quite dived into as of yet,” Springsteen says via Zoom from his home in Wellington, Florida, noting that the albums touch on everything from Western swing to Burt Bacharach-inspired Sixties pop. “They were all these sort of outliers, and what do you do with them? I don't know. So this is how we ended up solving the problem.”


	A high percentage of these songs were recorded in the Nineties, often seen as a lost period for Springsteen since he released only a single studio record, 1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad, between 1992 and 2002. “That was for a variety of reasons,” says Springsteen, who is touring in Europe this summer, and spoke to us before his anti-Trump remarks on opening night of the tour sparked a tense back-and-forth with the president. (Springsteen declined to comment on the exchange.) “Our children were very young at exactly that moment. And also I didn't have any interest, really, in working with the band. I felt just burned out on it at that particular place in time. But I was working on music all the time. I just wasn't releasing it.”

	











	In a wide-ranging interview, Springsteen delves deep into Tracks II: The Lost Albums, explains why he was never happy with Born In The U.S.A., reveals that he has a new album in the can for next year, drops a revelation about the fabled Electric Nebraska tapes, and explains why he still believes in America.

	











The box set starts with L.A. Garage Sessions '83. Nobody knew you recorded an entire album between Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A. I enjoyed the recording and the experience of Nebraska, and thought I might continue in that vein with a small rhythm section, still very lo-fi, and a new group of songs. At the time I wasn't sure where I was going with Born in the U.S.A. I had half the record, but I didn't have the other half. And so it was just a record that happened in between those two records.

Prior to Nebraska, you'd never cut an album outside of a studio before. It must have been really freeing.I was a lot less inhibited, so I was a lot more experimental. If you go to the studio, the whole band is there, all the producers are there. It's a very formal environment, and I found it tended to make me conservative in some ways. And so, Nebraska really broke through that ceiling where I brought in an element of risk that I hadn't previously to my recording process. I wanted to continue that, to continue to feel that freedom in the studio, and so I began to simply record at home more often.


You say in the liner notes that you “weren't happy” with Born in the U.S.A. and that it didn't “connect” like your other albums. Why not? It was a record I put out. It became the record I made, not necessarily the record that I was interested in making. I was interested in taking Nebraska and making a full record that had somewhat that same feeling. If you hear “My Hometown” and you hear “Born in the U.S.A.,” they were sort of the bookends I intended. And the rest of the stuff was … just what I had at the time. Those were the songs I wrote. Those were the songs I recorded.


	From conception to execution, it was not necessarily the record that in my mind I had planned on, but that's the way creativity works. You go in the studio, you have an idea. It's not necessarily what you come out with. So that was just the situation of that record for me personally.

I'm a little surprised to hear you say that. I always heard Born in the U.S.A. as dispatches from various people left behind by Reagan's America. As a listener, it felt cohesive. I guess, it was to a lot of other people too. I suppose maybe I was looking for something darker. But outside of that, the themes of Nebraska are in there — in “Downbound Train,” they're in there, they're disguised somewhat into pop music.


Did you feel any label pressure after “Hungry Heart” to create music less like Nebraska and more radio-friendly?No, I've been lucky in my relationship with Sony for all the years that I've been on there. I've never received any pressure to do anything other than what I've exactly wanted to do.

	











“The Klansman” is a chilling song. It's in the same vein as “Johnny 99,” where you write from the perspective of someone truly villainous.I do that from time to time. That was “Nebraska.” And this was a particularly risky choice. I'm singing in the voice of a member of the Klan. The song is about the way that hate and toxicity is passed down from generation to generation. 


I want to briefly talk about your albums Human Touch and Lucky Town. When you got inducted in the Hall of Fame in 1998, you said, “I tried to write happy songs in the early Nineties, and it didn't work. The public didn't like it.” Can you elaborate on what you meant by that?On the fan sites in general, Human Touch particularly is a record that doesn't get a lot of respect, even though I actually like it quite a bit, and it has got some great songs on like “Roll of the Dice,” “Human Touch,” and “Real World.” I think people had some second thoughts about the production, and maybe they were right, maybe they weren't. I don't know, but it is what it is.


	 So, I sort of was making light of the fact. Actually, Lucky Town came out pretty much precisely the way I wanted it to, and I think that's a very good record. But I was making light of just its public perception.


	And I think recording without the E Street Band also affected a lot of fans perception of it, so that had something to do with it also. The records weren't timed well, I would say.


There's an entire album of songs on Tracks II built around drum loops. What drew you toward that sound? “Streets of Philadelphia.” I set up a small drum loop on that. I liked the way it worked. It interplayed with synthesizers, which was an instrument I was beginning to write on. And so the natural thing to do after that was, I said, “Well, I'm going to try and create a whole album with the basic sound of a synthesizers and drum loops.” And so, that's what I did.


How were the loops created?Some of them I created myself, and some of them were just off CDs that my engineer brought in and we listened to, and I'd say, “Yeah, that's a cool one” or “That's a cool one. Let's try that. Let me try to write to that.”


It's been called your “hip-hop album” by fans in the past, but that's a real misnomer.Yeah, it's not that. I do use the drum loops, but I think when they heard drum loops, they jumped to hip-hop. But no, it's basically a record that uses loops and synthesizers.

	











How did the drum loops change your writing process?Drum loops are trance-like, I find, and so a lot of the music on that record is a little bit trance-like, very dreamy. The combination of the synthesizers and the loops made for a sort of dark, dreamy sound. And there's quite a bit of that on the record.


Why didn't the record come out?Bob Clearmountain mixed it. I had it at home. I was in the process of sequencing it. But I could never quite get the sequence correct, and I felt…. I've had a conversation going with my fans for 50 years now, which I try to honor as best as I can; and one of the ways I honor that conversation is by trying to keep its context open. And I said, “Well, gee, I'm not sure.” After the three records I wrote about relationships and the nature of the record, I just said, “I'm just not sure. Is this too closed off at this moment? Is it the right time?” A lot of releasing records for me comes down to timing, and it was one of the records where, for better or for worse, I didn't think the timing was right.


A lot of the lyrical content is pretty dark, which is interesting because this was a pretty happy time in your life.Yeah, those things don't go together. People tend to think that singer-songwriters are always writing autobiographically. Certainly in my case, that's not the point. I'll go to some completely different geography in my head, I'll strike a vein that I find that is rewarding to write in, and I'll just work in that vein for a while.


Somewhere North of Nashville was made at the same time as The Ghost of Tom Joad. How did that work?I'm recording that in the afternoon often, and Tom Joad, the darker material, was recorded in the evening, assuming they were both going to be part of the same record.


How did you realize you could only release one?Well, obviously if you listen to “Repo Man,” it doesn't back up against the “Straight Time” very well. So, it became obvious pretty quickly that I was in the process of making two records. And when I tried to put them together to make either a double album or a single album, it just didn't work. And so, I cut the material down to the music that felt like it worked well together, which was The Ghost of Tom Joad album.


Marty Rifkin does amazing work on this one.Marty Rifkin is a badass steel guitarist, one of the absolute best in the country. He played with me on the Seeger Sessions tour. He plays tremendously on this album. He's a real secret resource. He's an incredible musician, a wonderful guy, and he really comes to the fore and shows what he can do on Somewhere North of Nashville.

	











So much of this music was made in the Nineties, but I don't really hear any “Nineties” sounds on this record. A lot of your peers were incorporating elements of grunge and alternative. You never went even near the trends of the day.I believe you are who you are. And chasing trends, for me anyway, it never fit with who I was. It's just not the way that I operate. I work from the inside out, not from the outside in. And I believe that's what gives my music its intensity and its personalness.


It means the music isn't stuck in the amber of any particular time. You can play “Racing in The Street” next to anything on Tom Joad or anything that I've written since, and it'll slide right in. So, I've always wanted to write about themes that were timeless: family, work, spirituality, love, sex, just things that are always in people's lives. And that's the trail that I've always followed. I still follow it to this day. And like I said, I work from the inside out.


What drew you to the mariachi sounds on Inyo?We've had a farm since the early Nineties, and I was writing a few songs that were set in Mexico, and I had an assistant who would occasionally help me researching some details. He said, “Hey, there's a charro that moved into New Jersey in the apartment above me.” I said, “Really?” He says, “Yeah. A girl from New Jersey went to Mexico, met the 1994 All-Around Mexico Charro, and moved him back to New Jersey. I mean, this is one of the most incredible horsemen and guy with a rope I've ever seen.”


	So I said, “Well, bring him over to the house.” So he comes to the house and he ends up working on the farm with me for five years. And he taught us how to ride, a little bit of roping, rope tricks. 


	He was an incredible guy. When we would have our harvest parties, he said, “Man, I know this great mariachi band.” And I said, “Bring them down.” So he brought down these incredible mariachi bands, and they would play at our harvest parties. And so, I just got into the music sort of like that. And I had a few songs that I felt they would work well on, and that's how they ended up on the record.


How close did you come to putting this one out?Not that close. I did get Devils & Dust out [with some songs from this era], but I still had a large group of material left over. And I knew the songs were good. Once again, the timing wasn't right, so they were there in the vault. And so that one sat until I had time during the pandemic to go and put it together.

	











On Perfect World, there's a bunch of songs you co-write with Joe Grushecky. He's one of the few songwriters you've ever collaborated with. What drew you to him?Well, I always like his songs and I felt we had something in common in our roots, coming out of the working class, and he wrote about that a lot. And also, Joe was just very persistent. He would just send me lyrics. I think most of them I wrote for him to record, and I produced his record [American Babylon]. And so, he'd send me lyrics, I'd write the music, and send it back.


	He was just a persistent guy, and we became very close friends, as we are to this day. We haven't done a lot of writing together, but we've done some, and it's always fun. I tend to not write with others.


By the end of the E Street Band reunion tour, you were playing new songs in the set. You had “American Skin,” “Land of Hope and Dreams,” and some of the songs with Joe like “Code of Silence.” Were you planning another E Street record around 2000 or so?Once we did the reunion tour, my next thought was, “OK, now we've got to make a record if we're going to continue.” I did go into the studio with “American Skin,” “Land of Hope and Dreams,” a few other things, and we did do some recording, and it just wasn't good. 


	The production team I'd used for many years, really, we'd done the work we were going to do, and it was time for somebody else to come in with some fresh ideas, and to give us more of a current sound for the times we were working in.


	And that of course, was Brendan O'Brien, who was and is a tremendous producer, great guy. I've had wonderful times working with him, and he really was deeply responsible for giving us our modern recorded sound. And then I've worked with Ron Aniello — also an incredible producer and great guy — since then also. Once I started working with Brendan, the songs came, and The Rising came out of it. And then Magic and Working on a Dream. And he also assisted me in finishing Devils & Dust.


Unlike the others here, Perfect World wasn't a completely finished record at the time.Yeah, that was the one record that I didn't conceive of as a record. It was just material that I had, not sure where it was going to go. And so, when I thought of this particular project, I said, “Gee, there's a lot of stuff on here, but there's no rock music. And I know I've got some rock music fans out there.” So I said, “Well, maybe I'll try and put something together.” And I had that selection of material, and I put that album together from the material that I had.

	











Do you have any regrets that you didn't put out any of these albums back in the Nineties?Well, it's fun putting them all out at once with this project because it's unusual, and I actually believe it's the correct context for them to come out in. So, I don't regret it. No.


Was there any point in the Nineties where self-doubt started to sink in that maybe your career was slipping away? Not really. I always used to say, when I was in the middle of some of the big lawsuits [in the mid-Seventies], “OK. Well, somebody can take your publishing and somebody can take your records or take your songs or take whatever money you've made out of the thing, but you can drop me out of an airplane anywhere in the United States or most parts of the world, I'll land and I'll find the nearest roadhouse and I'll light up somebody's night.”


	And so, that's something that's in me. You can never lose it. And so during the Nineties, I understood that. And I even had a conversation with Jon Landau at one point where I said, “Gee, this record didn't do as well. Jon, it's just not our time. Somebody else's time.” If you're ever going to have a long career, hey, it's going to be your time and it's going to be not your time sometimes, and you got to be OK with that and you just got to carry on, work on.


Did any part of you think that the Born in the U.S.A. period simply got too big? There were seven hits off that record. You were almost as big as Michael Jackson. The red hat, blue jeans, and the flag became this iconic image of you that remains with many people to this day.I wasn't interested in carrying on with that. I did it at the time, but I wasn't interested in trying to catch those horses again. I always looked at it like, “Well, that was one of a thing,” and I immediately returned to my singer-songwriter roots and made Tunnel of Love. And so, I wasn't under any illusion that that was going to be my career. 


	And also, I didn't have any real desire for that to be my career, and I wasn't concerned about selling less records because I wasn't concerned about selling that many records in the first place.


	So, it was just an interesting moment in time. It was challenging. I generally had a great time during most of it. And to this day, if somebody is imitating me, they'll generally put that uniform on. I still see it at my shows. I see young men in their twenties come in with the bandanna and the sleeveless shirt. It is charming at this point, and I don't regret any of it. It was a great experience, but it wasn't something I considered a career.

	











And after that, there was no way to go any bigger. Wisely, you didn't even try.My attitude is I was never interested in going bigger. I was always interested in going deeper. That's how I've conducted my career.


Tell me about Faithless. This one really came out of nowhere. Nobody knew it existed.That was an unusual record. I was contacted to write a small group of songs for a film that was a Western. I was down here with my daughter in Florida in about two or three weeks, and I believe I wrote the whole record. And then I went home and I recorded it in, I don't know, a week or two weeks maybe, something like that, very, very quickly in the living room of the house next door to my house, which I was using as a temporary studio. And that was it. 


	I sat on it waiting for the moment when perhaps the film would get in the production, and it just didn't happen. So, I figured after about 20 years, “Well, maybe I would put this out myself, and who knows, maybe it'll still get made.” But I figured I put it out in this collection because Patti always loved this particular record and said, “You got to put that out.” And so, it's a really unique little selection of songs, and I'm glad it's in this particular package.


How'd you get in the mindset of these characters? Did you read a screenplay?There was a book, and there was a screenplay.


I imagine that you don't want to say the name of the director or anything, right?Correct.


Let's talk about Twilight Hours. There's obviously a lot of commonality with the songs on Western Stars, but they're distinct.Well, if Western Stars tilted a little more towards your Jimmy Webb and country music, Twilight Hours tilts more towards the Burt Bacharach and classic American songbook songwriting. 


	If you listen to “Sunday Love” or “September Kisses” or “Late in the Evening,” many of those things you think Sinatra could have sung, or Andy Williams or Jack Jones or any of the crooners from the early Sixties or Fifties. That's material they could have used. It's sort of in that Mad Men vein of pop music. So it differs quite a bit from Western Stars in that sense. But a few songs like “High Sierra” could have gone on Western Stars, and maybe “Sunliner.”


	I was using chord changes that I had not previously used, and that allowed me to investigate slightly more sophisticated types of chordal structures and songwriting than I've used in most of my other music.

	











Did you think about releasing Western Stars and Twilight Hours as a double album?I did, and I decided against it. Usually, when I write a lot of material at once, particularly if you're talking about 40 songs or something you wrote at one time, I always go, “Well, maybe this should be a double album.” But I usually end up opting for something that's more compact and intense.


“High Sierra” is a stunning song. Can you talk a bit about that one?I probably should have got that onto Western Stars somehow, and I almost did. I kept trying to squeeze it in this way, squeeze it in that way, and for one reason or another, it just didn't happen. I suppose there were a lot of other things in that with the same mood. There was a lot of those characters dealing with American isolation. I had “Drive Fast (The Stuntman),” “Western Stars,” “Tucson Train,” and “Stones.” 


	It was a lot of these singular characters dealing with American loneliness. It might've just tipped the balance a little too much, or I figured it might have not been as appreciated as much as I felt it might be in the context of this other record. It's one of my favorite songs in the whole package.


You played the entirety of Western Stars in your barn for the concert film, but you've never done any of them in public. Might you bring some of them into the set at some point?If I was going to do that, I'd go out on probably a smaller tour, where I might engage an orchestra and play those records specifically. When I go out with the E Street Band, I go out to do a rock show. I want to come out, put the pedal to the metal for three hours, and exhaust you, myself, and anybody in the immediate 20-mile vicinity. And so, there's certain things that mix and certain things that don't mix for me, and that's sort of the way I look at the work that I do with the band.


You've been photographed a lot on the set of your upcoming biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere, which centers around the creation of Nebraska. What's it been like to watch an actor play you? I'm sure it's much worse for the actor than for me. Jeremy Allen White was very, very tolerant of me the days that I would appear on the set. I said to him, “Look, anytime I'm in the way, just give me the look and I'm on my way home.” So the days that I got out there, he was wonderfully tolerant with me being there. And it was just fun. It was enjoyable.


	I mean, there's some unusualness to it because the movie involves, in some ways, some of the most painful days of my life. But it was a great project, and Jeremy and Jeremy Strong [who plays manager Jon Landau] were both fantastic, terrific in it as were all the other actors. Stephen Graham plays my dad, and he's out of this world, but everybody that was engaged in the film, they were all tremendous.

	











Watching actors re-create your childhood right in front of you must have been really intense emotionally.Well, some of the scenes I wasn't at. If there was a scene coming up that was sometimes really deeply personal, I wanted the actors to feel completely free, and I didn't want to get in the way, and so I would just stay at home. If Scott Cooper, the director, wanted or needed me there for something, I would try to make it. But I was on tour in Canada for the whole first month or so of the filming, and so I was out really out on the road quite a bit and working at that time.


	Hey — a shout-out to my Canadian audience, who was incredible on that tour, just the best Canadian tour we ever had.


Speaking of Nebraska, fans are fascinated by the idea of a full-band Nebraska. It's become this mythical thing over the years. Well, I can tell you right now, it doesn't exist.


Really?No, we tried to do a few songs with the band for a few minor electric versions of “Nebraska,” maybe something else, I'm not sure. But that record simply doesn't exist. There is no electric Nebraska outside of what you hear us performing onstage.


Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan have talked to me about running through a lot of the songs in the living room of Roy's house. I have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there's nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska.


	[Note: About a month after this interview took place, I turned my phone on after a plane ride and saw a missed call from an unfamiliar number in Freehold, New Jersey. I had a text from that number too: “Hey Andy! Bruce Springsteen here. Just wanted to give you a heads-up. I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record though it does not have the full album of songs. All best, Bruce.”]


Fans have fantasized about some sort of special show before the release of the movie where you play Nebraska straight through, which you've never done before. Is that possible?I doubt I'll do it, but I could possibly go out and play that record straight through one day. I think that would be fun to do, and the fans would get a kick out of it. That's not off the table.


We talked last time about Only the Strong Survive, Volume 2. Is that in the can?Yeah, that's finished, done. It's been finished for quite a while. Once again, timing. The covers records are things I make for my own amusement and entertainment when I'm not writing. It was just a project that I had a lot of fun doing. And I love all that music, I love all those songs and those singers. So I do have another one, and there's other covers things I've done that were not necessarily soul-related, so it's another project.

	











Are you writing songs now or thinking about your next record?Yeah, I have a record finished.


Is it with the E Street Band or is it solo?It's a solo record.


Is there anything you can say about it?No.


Do you think it'll be out next year?I would imagine it will come out in '26 sometime.


Besides Broadway, you haven't done a tour without the E Street Band in 19 years. Do you think you might do another solo tour at some point?Well, Broadway was 240 shows or something like that. But yeah, definitely, I will be doing that again at some point. I'm not sure what the music will be, but I'll have a lot to draw on because I'm making a lot of records. But at some point, I'd like to do that.


Is this summer run in Europe the end of the E Street Tour you started in early 2023?Yes. This next 15 or 16 shows are the official end of our 130-date E Street Tour. That's something debatable. Rather than do a 130-show stretch, which we did this time because we had been off for six years, so I had to get back in touch with my audience, and it was fun playing with the band … in the future, I think we'll probably play more often and less dates.


The fans in Australia are dying to see you down there.I'm doing my best as we speak to get down there, hopefully next year sometime. And I feel bad. I apologize to my Australian fans for not getting down on this stretch, but I want them to know that we are planning to get down there as soon as feasible, probably in the next year sometime.


The show you did last summer in Asbury Park was just an unbelievable night.Well, I put that in one of the top five or three shows we've ever done. That's how special it was for me anyway. And partly because I was in that town when there was no one there, when it was a ghost town. I mean, Asbury Park was a complete and utter ghost town for 30 years, and me and the guys were there. So to be there for its rebirth and when it came back to life, and to see that happen on that beach in front of us on a beautiful September night was one of the loveliest performing experiences of my life.


Is Tracks III happening?Yes. Still a lot of music in the vault, and that's something that I've finished and is ready to be released. It's just a question of when we have time to put that out, considering that I have a variety of other things that I'm interested in releasing soon also. But you won't be waiting 25 years for the next Tracks album. I suppose it'll come out in the next three years or so.

	











Are there other full, unreleased albums on there?No, there are no complete albums. This is all music from different points in my work life that I've made, some with the band, without the band, some that go way back. At that point, the vault will be not completely empty, but virtually empty. There will be really not more, which I'm sort of excited about doing, finally getting all the music that I have and have recorded out to my fans.


During the George W. Bush presidency, you wrote a lot of songs about the agony and insanity of that time. Are you tempted to write songs about this political era we're living through?Well, I think I'm inspired to sing about it. As of yet, I haven't been inspired to write about it. Whether I will or will not be, I don't know. But obviously we're living through an American tragedy, and I believe we will come out intact. The country is not like other countries that have had authoritarian histories. We have a democratic history, and I believe that will rear its head again. That is not a tradition that I believe is going to disappear overnight regardless of how hard somebody tries to subvert it.


You're not losing hope?No, no, no. Got to have hope, man. I got to have hope.


When we spoke a little over 10 years ago, you said that “the light from the oncoming train focuses the mind?” Do you feel that even more at this age?Yes. You realize time is finite, and your performing time is finite now. And I feel like if you come to see the band, you see a band at the top of their game. We played different in 1980. We played different in 1975. There was a different youthful energy that you have at that particular moment. But the depths and resonance and experience that we've had over the past 50 years of playing together has really come to the fore right now in our performance. And the band is just completely badass onstage at this moment. So, it's very exciting to play with the E Street Band now, and I'm looking forward to doing a good deal of it in the future. But that future is finite.


There are nights I look at Max near the end of the set and I think “How on earth is this man still going?”Well, Max, I believe has refined a technique where he is able to do that, which is amazing to me. I tell people, “Look, I come out and I have a brief breath in between songs because I like to keep the show just constantly moving.” Max doesn't get that because I say, “Max, while we're taking these five seconds, keep playing.” So the guy comes out and plays basically for three hours straight without stopping. He stops, maybe there's 30 seconds where he gets to take a sip of water twice, two or three times during the night. So Max is a human marvel, and he's a great blessing in my life and in my work life.

	











I often think about the crazy luck of putting an ad in the Village Voice looking for a drummer and keyboardist, and Max and Roy show up.Yeah. And they really defined an enormous part of the band sound where Roy Bittan's keyboards are very distinctive to E Street Band, as is Max's drumming. So, you got to have a little luck with you when you're going for the long haul also. I had some good luck. Those were some lucky days.


Do you hope to be like Pete Seeger and still be onstage in your nineties playing your music?Oh, absolutely. I mean, I knew Pete, and Pete had a lot of energy. And when his voice began to go, he simply found another way to do it. I think, was it his cousin or something who would play alongside him? Pete understood that people were coming to experience his spirit, which was as strong as could be.

So these guys, they're a little in front of me, and they're showing, “Hey, it's not time to sleep yet. There's many miles to go.”


So there will be no farewell tour?No.

Bruce Springsteen confirmed the long-rumored existence of an electric, full-band version of his celebrated acoustic record Nebraska — after insisting it didn't exist during a new interview with Rolling Stone. 


	The electric Nebraska has become a mythical object for Springsteen fans over the years, and there's been a lot of evidence suggesting the tapes do exist. For instance, in past interviews with RS, E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg both separately recalled those sessions, with the latter even remarking, “It was all very hard-edged. As great as it was, it wasn't what Bruce wanted to release.”


	But when asked about the full-band Nebraska during a recent chat about Tracks II: The Lost Albums — Springsteen's massive compendium of unreleased material recorded between 1983 and 2018, out June 27 — the rocker insisted, “I can tell you right now, it doesn't exist.”


	He added, “We tried to do a few songs with the band for a few minor electric versions of ‘Nebraska,' maybe something else, I'm not sure. But that record simply doesn't exist. There is no electric Nebraska outside of what you hear us performing on stage.”

	











	After being told about Bittan's and Weinberg's memories of those sessions, Springsteen replied, “I have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there's nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska.”


	About a month later, however, Springsteen texted Rolling Stone's Andy Greene with a remarkable correction: “Just wanted to give you a heads up. I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record, though it does not have the full album of songs.” 

	











	Springsteen did not say which Nebraska songs were recorded, nor whether the collection would get a proper release at some point. There is another upcoming vault project, Tracks III, and while Springsteen said it's already finished and “ready to be released,” it may not arrive for another few years because of all the other projects he wants to release, too.

	The musician also didn't rule out the possibility of one day doing a full live run through of Nebraska. While he probably won't do it in connection to the upcoming biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere, which centers around the recording of Nebraska, he didn't dismiss the idea entirely. 


	“I could possibly go out and play that record straight through one day,” he said. “I think that would be fun to do, and the fans would get a kick out of it. That's not off the table.”

	Items from David Lynch's personal estate and archive sold for a total of over $4.5 million at a white-glove auction hosted Wednesday by Julien's Auctions and Turner Classic Movies. The famed filmmaker died in January at the age of 78. 


	Standout lots in the auctioned collection included Lynch's director's chair, which sold for $70,000, a 35-millimiter print of his 1977 surrealist classic Eraserhead that went for $40,000, and a personal copy of the script to the Oscar-nominated Mulholland Drive which sold for $98,000. 


	Lynch was know to drink over 20 cups of coffee a day at one point, and his personal La Marzocco GS/3 Home Espresso Machine sold for $35,000. 


	The prize of the night, however, was a set of screenplays related to Lynch's most infamous unfinished film: Ronnie Rocket: The Absurd Mystery of the Strange Forces of Existence. The project, originally begun by Lynch in the late 1970s, is the mythical lost film of Lynch's lifetime. Described by Lynch as a movie “about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair,” the director repeatedly came back to the screenplay and script, writing and rewriting Ronnie Rocket but never finding adequate financial backing to fully develop the project. 

	











	In 2013, Lynch told writer David Breskin that Ronnie Rocket was not a dead project. “No, no, no, no, never, not in a million years,” Lynch emphasized. “I'm waiting for the next step to happen to do it, if there is a next step. I'm waiting for a time where I don't really care what happens, except that the film is finished […] It might be a picture that I would love, but I don't know if too many other people are going to dig it. It's very abstract.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Ronnie scripts have gone through all sorts of permutations over the years,” An Kroeber, the wife of Eraserhead and Elephant Man sound designer Alan Splet, said of the project. “I suspect that Ronnie Rocket is David's most thought-about story and may just never be made not because the production company didn't want to shoot it, they and several others were willing, but David wasn't.”

	The collection of manuscripts sold for a stunning $150,000. 


	“Every object in this collection served as a window into Lynch's surreal and uncompromising creative world — whether from his groundbreaking films, television work, or personal studio,” Catherine Williamson, Managing Director of Entertainment at Julien's Auctions, said in a statement. “The global response to the auction speaks not only to the cultural importance of his legacy, but to the profound admiration and reverence he inspires among fans, collaborators, and collectors alike.”

KIRO 7 Now



PUYALLUP, Wash. — Halloween may be over 100 days away, but one travelling show is proving that it's never too early to get a little spooky. 

Get ready for a killer date night: Paranormal Cirque II is creeping its way into Washington state with multiple shows in six cities.

Paranormal Cirque II is an R-rated horror circus with a haunted attraction pre-show that's included with the price of your ticket. 

“You're going to be treated to two hours of Vegas-quality, R-rated horror circus entertainment. You're going to see all kinds of amazing circus acts, acrobatics, aerial acts and comedy, all with a horror theme,” Steve Copeland, host and comedian of the cirque, explained. 

Copeland said the show is R-rated due to language and adult humor. Those ages 13-17 are welcome, but must be accompanied by an adult. 

The Cirque operates with a crew of about 50 people, including performers and behind-the-scenes folks who set up the tent and stage or work on lighting. 

From zombies to werewolves, and acrobatics to sword swallowers, there's jaw-dropping entertainment for everyone. 

“We have some brand new acts for 2025, so even if people have seen the show before, they've got to come back and see what's new. We have a brand new opening number with acrobats, diving and sliding, diving over and sliding across a table. We've got aerialists spinning on ropes, high up in the air, all kinds of craziness going on,” Copeland said. 

The Cirque kicked off in Puyallup on Friday, June 13 and ran that entire weekend.

Upcoming shows are:

Bright and breezy animation 'Elio'. Photo: Universal Studios

Eleven-year-old orphan Elio (voiced by Yonas Kibreab) is ­obsessed with outer space and the prospect of extraterrestrial life there. So much so, in fact, that he's using homemade apparatus to send a signal offering himself up for alien abduction.

When events at the nearby airforce base where aunt and guardian Olga (Zoe Saldana) works bring that dream to reality, Elio is zapped to the Communiverse, a peaceful space society of various alien races.

But he's mistaken for an official emissary from Earth rather than just a lonely boy reaching out to see who's listening. When Elio befriends the offspring of a galactic warlord, he causes a diplomatic incident.

This is all very “nice”, with the character expressions and elasticated action sequences bound to strike a chord with little people. But Pixar's name was built upon the grown-up wit it smuggled beneath the kid-acting, somewhere Elio declines to boldly go.

As for the title character and the story's child-alien bromance, co-directors Madeline Sharafian, Domee Shi and Adrian Molina seem to be banking on their target market not having seen a certain ­Spielberg sci-fi classic just yet.

DnD's new Psions can cast spells without components - but does that actually mean much for gameplay, and should the class have more to make it stand out?



                    Matt Bassil                



Published: Jun 19, 2025 

Dungeons and Dragons doesn't often come out with a brand new class, so we've been pretty excited about the Psion. This psychic character class was released in an Unearthed Arcana towards the end of May. But does it truly succeed at the fantasy of playing a psychic character?


This is playtest content rather than a finalized DnD class, still subject to changes ranging from balance tweaks to entire rewrites. We've already provided plenty of feedback for Wizards of the Coast about the Psion, writing about its unbalanced subclasses and problems with the conceptually amazing body horror Metamage. But if you thought we were done complaining, you underestimate how helpful we can be.



Personally, I think a weak point of this class is how poorly it differentiates psionic from regular spellcasting. Psions have a number of abilities that work with an Energy Dice mechanic we've seen in other DnD subclasses, but this only powers a few features. After that you get spell slots and levels like a regular caster, which makes the psychic feel a like a flavor of DnD Wizard or Sorcerer rather than its own thing.



But don't worry, psionics isn't exactly the same as regular magic. The Psion also gets a feature called Psionic Spellcasting that lets you cast spells without their material or verbal components. But this feels like such a minor change because it will almost never crop up in gameplay. It's not enough to separate the Psion from other casters and make it feel like a fundamentally different type of magic.



For starters, I'm fairly certain that virtually no parties make material components a big component (ho ho) of play anyway. It seems like most groups handwave the mechanic, and accessories like component pouches and focuses exist specifically to remove the bookkeeping.






And you still have to use somatic components (gestures) which reduces the number of situations where not having to use your voice to cast spells is helpful. I suppose it's good if someone casts Silence, you're trying to be stealthy, or your spellcasting tools are confiscated, but that's about it.



I think many players were hoping to see this class powered through something fundamentally different from spellcasting - a class that still gets to do loads of epic supernatural things but isn't tied to the same features of spell slots and lists as every other caster on the class list.



Of course, it would've been trickier for Wizards to implement this, and much harder to balance. But Psionic Spellcasting as it stands is a pretty rubbish feature, and feels mostly like a cosmetic tweak for the class' magic.

The friends of the slain Boston cop at the heart of Karen Read's murder trial slammed the justice system following her acquittal yesterday.

Read, 45, was found not guilty of the January 2022 murder of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, after jurors rejected the prosecution's argument that she hit him with her SUV when she dropped him at a house party and left him to die in the snow. 

Her defense team alleged that Read was the victim of an elaborate plot by local Boston law enforcement to frame her, claiming other police officers at the gathering killed O'Keefe.

After Read's first trial last year ended in a hung jury, the case gained national attention amid scrutiny over Read's claims that investigators planted evidence and covered up other suspects. 

After Read walked free from the murder charge, O'Keefe's loved ones, including the party's host Brian Albert, condemned the not guilty verdict as a 'miscarriage of justice.' 

'Today, our hearts are with John and the entire O'Keefe family. They have suffered through so much and deserved better from our justice system,' they said in a statement. 

'While we may have more to say in the future, today we mourn with John's family and lament the cruel reality that this prosecution was infected by lies and conspiracy theories spread by Karen Read, her defense team, and some in the media. 

'The result is a devastating miscarriage of justice.' 

The statement was penned by Jennifer McCabe, Matthew McCabe, Chris Albert, Julie Albert, Colin Albert, Nicole Albert, Brian Albert, Kerry Roberts, and Curt Roberts, some of whom were at the house party that O'Keefe was found outside of. 

Read's attorneys argued that some attendees at the party including Brian and Colin Albert and Brian Higgins could have been involved in killing O'Keefe, however none have been formally accused of any wrongdoing by authorities. 

Read's case sharply divided opinions in Boston and the true crime community, with the accused gaining an ardent following who gathered at court during her trial. 

The 'Free Karen Read' supporters were such a presence at her trial that the judge ordered they be kept 500 feet away from the courthouse and banned attendees inside the court from wearing pink, a color that they wore to show support for Read. 

Huge cheers erupted outside the trial as the not guilty verdict was read on Wednesday, with Read thanking her supporters in a speech from the courthouse steps soon after. 

'I could not be standing here without these amazing supporters,' she said. 'No one has fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than I have.' 

Read was found not guilty on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, but was convicted on Wednesday on the lesser charge of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. 

The penalty could result in over two years in state prison, but typically is limited to probation. 

The verdict brought fresh scrutiny over those who attended the house party O'Keefe was found outside. 

This included several of those who released the statement slamming the 'miscarriage of justice', including party-goer Jennifer McCabe, whose internet searches on the night of O'Keefe's death became central to the defense. 

Several hours before O'Keefe was found dead on the front lawn of Albert's home, McCabe searched how long it takes 'to die in the cold.' 

Prosecutors argued that there was no evidence that O'Keefe ever went inside the house party, however forensic investigators never took evidence from inside Albert's home, muddying theories over whether he was beaten inside. 

Read and O'Keefe had been drinking heavily on the night he died, and voice messages she left him that night where she fumed over their turbulent relationship were also played in court.

The couple had been dating for two years at the time of O'Keefe's death. He had been serving on the Boston Police Department for 16 years. 

After saying she dropped O'Keefe at Albert's home for an afterparty, Read said she woke up around 5am and panicked when he hadn't returned home, immediately driving back to the scene of the house party. 

Read then searched for O'Keefe with a friend, and prosecutors allege that during the search she told her friend: 'What if he's dead? What if a plow hit him? … I don't remember anything from last night, we drank so much I don't remember anything.'

At 6am, Read found O'Keefe laying in the snow outside Albert's home. A first responder on the scene reportedly claimed Read repeatedly cried out, 'I hit him, I hit him'. 

Investigators said they found pieces of broken taillight around O'Keefe's body, however Read's defense alleged this could have been planted after the debris was not found in an initial search and was only discovered hours later. 

 'She could have driven home, they could have talked about it the next day... (instead), she takes a 6,000-pound Lexus and she makes a decision - she steps on the gas after banging it into reverse,' prosecutors said.

O'Keefe's phone data last recorded at 12:32am that night, the same time that prosecutors argued car data from Read's SUV showed she hit the reverse pedal hard. 

The phone's temperature then steadily dropped over the next several hours, which prosecutors said was evidence that he never went inside and lay in the snow after they say he was hit.  

O'Keefe was rushed to the hospital when he was found hours later, where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy found that the cause of death was blunt impact injuries and hypothermia. 

Read's defense pointed to apparent dog bite marks on O'Keefe's body they argued were evidence that he had been attacked by Albert's dog. 

The defense alleged that the close-knit cop community of Canton, Massachusetts helped the cover-up of O'Keefe's murder inside the party, saying the lack of forensic investigating inside the home was because of the host's ties to law enforcement. 

'What if it wasn't the home of a Boston cop?' Read's attorney Alan Jackson said in his closing argument. 

'We can be certain that investigators would have torn that house apart to get answers.'  

Read, a financial analyst and college professor, also faced backlash from followers of her case for her antics, including winking at cameras, embracing her supporters and snacking and laughing in the courthouse. 

The bungled investigation ultimately led Read to walk free from the charges, Daniel Medwed, a professor of law and criminal justice at Northeastern University who closely followed the case, told the New York Times. 

'The defense did a very good job of poking holes in the prosecution's case and generating reasonable doubt about her guilt,' he said in his analysis of the verdict. 

'At bottom, trials are about putting the government's evidence to the test. Norfolk prosecutors simply failed the test.'  ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Jason Aldean sat down with Taste of Country Nights and rolled through the gamut of conspiracy theories, and you will be surprised which ones he believes in and which ones he refutes.

Taste of Country Nights host Evan Paul began tossing out the conspiracy theories to Aldean, who gave his answers:

Interesting answer to the last one about the Illuminati, due to the fact that the Aldeans are friends with President Donald Trump, and Aldean was tapped to perform at Trump's inaugural ball on Jan. 20.

Could it be possible that some of Aldean's opinions could have been swayed by the fact that he is an acquaintance of the current President of the United States?

Of course, we can't confirm that, but we do know that the ""Whiskey Drink"" singer does have President Trump's cell phone number, and the two text one another.

Granted, those texts are more along the lines of talking about golf, but it could be intimidating to answer conspiracy theories about our country and the world knowing that one wrong answer could solicit a text from the President of the United States of America.

On Wednesday, the members of the ‘True Crime Broads' podcast set up a tent surrounded by signs at Heritage Park across the street from City Hall to keep attention on the cold case.

“We want justice for Missy,” said Renae Rodden, Bever's former coworker who started the podcast. “Her killer deserves to be caught and brought to justice.”

Missy Bevers, a mother of three, was preparing to lead a morning workout at Creekside Church on April 18, 2016, when police say someone wearing tactical gear killed her.

SpaceX's Starship 36 underwent a ""catastrophic failure"" on the stand at its Texas launch site, but the latest setback is unlikely to dent the company's ambitions.

SpaceX's Starship has exploded once again — adding to a growing list of setbacks for the company's rocket.

The upper stage of the rocket, the largest ever built, was undergoing routine testing to prepare for its 10th test flight at SpaceX's South Texas Starbase site on Wednesday night (June 18) when it ""suffered a catastrophic failure and exploded,"" local authorities wrote on Facebook.

The gigantic fireball adds to a string of recent headaches for the rocket's upper stages. The ship exploded mid-flight during two previous test flights in January and March, and fell to pieces during an earlier-than-planned reentry in May.

In a post on X, SpaceX has attributed the latest explosion to ""a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" yet the exact cause of the malfunction is unclear.

""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" SpaceX added in the post. ""Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing [sic] operations continue.""

Starship is key to SpaceX majority shareholder Elon Musk's ambitions to transport spacecraft, crew members, satellites and cargo into orbit around Earth and to the moon and Mars.

Standing 403 feet (123 meters) tall and propelled by a record-breaking 16.5 million pounds (7.5 million kilograms) of thrust from its 33-engine Super Heavy booster rocket, Starship can carry 10 times the payload of SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rockets.

Designed primarily with affordable and efficient manufacturing in mind, the gargantuan rocket uses inexpensive stainless steel for its construction and methane — which SpaceX claims can be collected on Mars — to power the rocket.

These early failures are unlikely to deter SpaceX from further developing the rocket. Musk announced in March that he expects the ship to carry Tesla's Optimus humanoid robots to Mars by the end of 2026, and the rocket is also set to carry some of the Starlab private space station into orbit once the International Space Station retires after 2030.

SpaceX has also won around $4 billion in NASA contracts to develop the Human Landing System (HLS). This is a lunar lander variant of the spacecraft, and has been selected by NASA to carry American astronauts to the moon aboard the 2027 Artemis III mission — the first time humans will have walked on the moon in more than 50 years.

The impact of yesterday's explosion on SpaceX's launch date for Starship's 10th flight is unclear. Currently, the company is investigating what happened to cause Flight 9's failed reentry alongside the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.

Groundwater records from the last ice age indicate that aquifers in the U.S. Southwest are more sensitive to global warming than aquifers in the Pacific Northwest.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Aquifers in the U.S. Southwest will be more badly affected by climate change than those farther north, a new study suggests.

Climate models predict that a warmer climate will lead to less rainfall in regions like Southern California and wetter weather in the Pacific Northwest. But what could really spell trouble for the Southwest is that groundwater pools there are more sensitive to climate shifts than pools farther north, researchers said.

Modern aquifer records are poor indicators of what happens when Earth gets warmer, because humans have pumped out huge amounts of groundwater. So instead scientists looked at records from the past, with the end of the last ice age (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) revealing some of the changes that might be coming our way.

""The last ice age gives us a window to explore groundwater dynamics that might be quite relevant to future change,"" study lead author Alan Seltzer, an associate scientist specializing in marine chemistry and geochemistry at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, said in a statement.

Researchers looked at the period between 11,000 and 20,000 years ago, when ice sheets retreated from North America and storms moved northward. Before this period, what is now the U.S. Southwest received abundant rainfall, while the present-day Pacific Northwest was relatively dry. But by the start of the Holocene — the current geological epoch — the climate had shifted to resemble today's patterns, with a wet Northwest and a drier Southwest.

Related: Groundwater in the Colorado River basin won't run out — but eventually we won't be able to get at it, scientists warn

For the new study, Seltzer and his colleagues analyzed ancient groundwater from the Palouse basin aquifer, which sits beneath Washington and Idaho. Ancient groundwater holds geochemical clues, such as dissolved noble gases, that can reveal past changes in water table depth.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The researchers measured different versions, or isotopes, of the noble gases krypton and xenon from 17 wells in the aquifer, which enabled them to reconstruct water table depths over 9,000 years of global warming.

The scientists then compared these records with records from the San Diego aquifer in Southern California that Seltzer and other researchers had previously compiled in a 2019 study. The researchers revealed their findings in a new study published June 11 in the journal Science Advances.

In response to global warming and drier conditions at the end of the last ice age, water table levels in Southwestern aquifers dropped sharply. In contrast, water table levels in the Pacific Northwest stayed surprisingly stable, despite an increase in rainfall, according to the new study.

The reason for this may be that groundwater systems with a shallow water table — where water sits nearer the surface, such as the Palouse basin — are able to transfer more water to neighboring soils than systems with a deep water table, so they remain relatively stable. Surface soils are less compact, and can therefore hold more water than deeper soils.

—'Precipitation, the source of all fresh water, can no longer be relied upon': Global water cycle pushed out of balance 'for 1st time in human history'

Systems with a deep water table, such as the San Diego aquifer, are more sensitive to changes in rainfall. Without precipitation, these aquifers rapidly dry out, according to the study.

To confirm their findings, the researchers compared the ancient groundwater data from the aquifers to groundwater processes in an Earth system computer model. ""The model gave almost exactly the same answer as the isotope measurements,"" Seltzer said.

Overall, the research suggests that aquifers are more vulnerable to climate change in the Southwest, which is predicted to get drier over the coming decades, than in the Pacific Northwest. Millions of people in the Southwest depend on groundwater to live — and ""these results should help direct research and adaptation efforts"" to combat water insecurity, study co-author Kris Karnauskas, a climate scientist and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, said in the statement.

A weekly look at some small-cap stocks making news - or about to. 

Canada's S&P/TSX Small Cap Index TXTW-I is up 22 per cent over the past 52 weeks. The index hit a record 915.92 on Wednesday. The Russell 2000 in the U.S. is up about 4 per cent over the past 52 weeks. 

Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB-T shares fell this week after the company said it expects “temporary declines” in some of its international markets in the current quarter.

Aurora told investors to expect continued strong global cannabis revenue in its current fiscal 2026 first quarter, driven by improved performance in Canadian medical and consumer sales. But it cautioned that global performance would be an offsetting factor. 

“Taken together, global cannabis should be slightly lower compared to Q4 2025 and is expected to improve in later quarters due to increased distribution and further innovation,” it said in its earnings release.

In a call with analysts, CEO Miguel Martin said regulatory changes in Poland affected the ability of its patients to access prescriptions “and generally the size of the market,” adding that he expects that to be temporary. “We are excited about the long-term aspects of Poland coming back.“ 

He also said that Germany “continues to deliver at a high level, it is a growth market for us, not only growing overall, but also from a market share standpoint. And the U.K., which is the other key market of size in that part of the world is also growing.”

Before markets opened on Wednesday, the Edmonton-based cannabis producer reported revenue of $90.5-million for its 2025 fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with $67.4-million in the prior-year period. It said the increase was mainly due to 48-per-cent growth in our global medical cannabis business and 32-per-cent growth in its plant propagation business, slightly offset by lower quarterly revenue in our consumer cannabis business.

Its net loss narrowed to $17.2-million from $20.3-million in the year-ago quarter.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Bottomley, who has a “buy” and $12.50 target on the stock, said the results were generally in-line with his expectations “amid what we believe was a transformational year for the company as it continued to refocus efforts on international medical markets, which doubled [year over year] [fiscal] 2024 levels.”

Aurora also issued two releases after the earnings report, citing “misinformation” posted on the news website Investing.com related to MedLeaf Therapeutics and MediPharm. 

“Aurora has not entered into any such agreements, has had no discussions with MedLeaf Therapeutics or MediPharm GmbH with respect to any business combination transaction or strategic partnership, and has not made any statements or filed any information pertaining to any such transactions,” it stated, adding that the “erroneous articles posted on Investing.com state that they were generated ‘with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.”

Aurora said it's “launching an investigation into the genesis of these articles,” adding that it's “not in the possession of material non-public information.”

Both articles were removed from the Investing.com website by midday Thursday. 

In an e-mail statement to the Globe, an Investing.com spokesperson said the articles were published “due to a technical issue and were immediately removed upon receiving notice.” 

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $9.90 and a low of $4.95.

Other small caps making news this week:

Kraken Robotics Inc. PNG-X shares fell this week after the St. John's-based company announced a $100-million bought deal financing. 

After markets closed on Tuesday, Kraken said it has an agreement with Desjardins Capital Markets, as sole lead underwriter and bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters, to buy 37.6 million common shares for $2.66 each. 

Kraken said it expects the net proceeds will be used to support its “transition into a scalable global prime contractor,” including boosting its ability to consider larger acquisitions, particularly in the U.S. and European Union and to demonstrate a stronger balance sheet when bidding for larger governmental and commercial contracts.

Diversified Royalty Corp. DIV-T shares hit their highest level since early 2023 this week after the company announced a 10-per-cent annual dividend increase. The company also announced the addition of its ninth royalty stream, Cheba Hut, a U.S.-based cannabis-themed sandwich franchise, for US$36-million. 

After markets closed on Tuesday, Diversified said it was able to fund the transaction without raising equity. Cheba Hut has 77 sub sandwich restaurants in the U.S.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Lee increased his target to $4.75 from $4.50 after the news, and maintained his “buy” rating.

“In our view, this transaction fits well into management's strategy of buying into growing brands and elevates the company's status to the U.S. franchisor market, which will be critical for sourcing further deals,” he wrote in a June 18 note. 

CIBC analyst Ty Collin increased his target to $3.20 from $3.10 and maintained his “neutral” (hold) rating after the announcement. 

“We view positively DIV's acquisition of Cheba Hut's royalty stream, which expands DIV's portfolio in the larger U.S. market, but on familiar terrain,” he wrote in a June 18 note. “The acquisition increases distributable cash flow per share by [about] 4 per cent while keeping leverage at a manageable level and facilitating an increase to the dividend.”

He noted management has been focusing much of its active search efforts in the U.S. market, “where lower familiarity with DIV and the royalty model in general have been hurdles to getting deals done. We believe each successful deal should help DIV gain traction there.”

The company also announced an annual dividend increase to 27.5 cents from 25 cents, effective July 1. 

Mr. Lee of Canaccord said the dividend increase reflects “the firm's confidence in its ability to balance growth and shareholder capital returns.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $3.14 and a low of $2.50.

SIR Royalty Income Fund SRV-UN-T units hit a 52-week high this week after the company reported higher revenue and adjusted profit for its third quarter ended May 4.

After markets closed on Tuesday, the trust behind restaurant brands such as Jack Astor's Bar and Grill and Scaddabush Italian Kitchen & Bar, said revenue from corporate restaurant operations increased by 4.5 per cent to $64.8-million, compared to $62-million for its third quarter of 2024.

Groupe Dynamite Inc. GRDG-T shares hit their highest level since going public last fall after the Montreal-based retailer reported a 20-per-cent jump in revenue and 13-per-cent growth in same-store sales for its first quarter ended May 3 – results that beat expectations.

Before markets opened on Tuesday, the retailer behind the Dynamite and Garage women's apparel brands, reported revenue of $226.7-million compared to $188.9-million in the year-ago quarter. The expectation was for revenue of $209.4-million.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 19.8 per cent to $66.8-million.

Net earnings came in at $27.3-million or 24 cents per share compared to $23.9-million or 22 cents a year earlier. The expectation was for 22 cents.

Cannacord Genuity analyst Luke Hannan increased his target to $33 from $33 after the earnings report, and maintained his “buy” rating. 

“We believe GRGD's Q1/F25 performance should go a long way to building credibility with investors and demonstrating the business is equipped to handle a macro backdrop featuring heightened trade uncertainty,” he wrote in a June 17 note. “The company's speed to market and capabilities when it comes to managing assortment architecture should mitigate the shock of any potential future increases in tariffs; further, the average price point of its offering allows its customers to enjoy ‘affordable indulgences' even during periods of softer consumer sentiment.”

National Bank Financial analyst Vishal Shreedhar increased his target to $25 from $23 and kept his “outperform” (buy) rating.

“We now view GRGD to be a top pick in our discretionary universe along with Dollarama,” Mr. Shreedhar said in a June 17 note. “Investment in GRGD is differentiated by strong financial metrics, with an EBITDA margin and ROIC [return on invested capital] that is amongst the highest in our apparel group.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $23.36 and a low of $10.35.

High Tide Inc. HITI-X reported higher revenue but swung to a loss for its second quarter ended April 30.

After markets closed on Monday, the Calgary-based cannabis company reported revenue of $137.8-million for the quarter compared to $124.3-million for the same period last year. The result was below expectations of $138.5-million.

Adjusted EBITDA was $8.1-million, which High Tide said represented the 21st consecutive positive quarter and compared to $10-million during the previous year. 

Its net loss of $2.8-million or 4 cents per share compared to net income of $171,000 or nil per share a year ago. The expectation was for a loss of 3 cents per share in the most recent quarter.

Ventum Capital Markets analyst Andrew Semple maintained his “buy” rating and $8.50 target after the earnings report. 

High Tide remains our highest conviction idea in Canadian cannabis,"" he wrote in a June 18 note. ""It is one of the few cannabis companies in Canada to sustainably grow EBITDA, generate sustainable positive FCF [free cash flow], and maintain clear growth drivers ahead.“

Mr. Semple added there's potential for additional upside to his forecast, “as High Tide could potentially utilize its growing cash position to support accelerated growth and make acquisitions that would be accretive to its current valuation.”

In the past 52 weeks, the stock has traded between a high of $5.08 and a low of $2.30.

Aimia Inc. AIM-T announced the resolution of a tax dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and anticipates a refund of approximately $27-million. The tax dispute relates to a 2013 income tax audit of Aimia's former subsidiary, Aeroplan Inc., the company said in a release before markets opened on Monday. 

Aimia said it expects to use the proceeds from the CRA refund to support its 2025-2026 normal course issuer bid and for general working capital purposes.

Following the sale of Aeroplan Inc. to Air Canada in January, 2019, Aimia said it agreed to indemnify Air Canada for pre-closing income tax liabilities and put $100-million from the sale proceeds into an escrow account. In 2019, Aimia said it remitted $32.9-million from the escrow account to the CRA and Revenu Québec after receiving a notice of reassessment for the 2013 tax audit. In July, 2020, the balance of the escrow account, $67.1-million, was released to Aimia.

Now that the CRA dispute is resolved, Aimia said it will seek recourse from Revenu Québec for the remaining $6-million portion of the 2013 tax audit. “Aimia anticipates that a similar resolution is likely,” it stated.
