                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As a youth, the MC was tucked under the wing of Cash Money Records co-founder Bryan “Birdman” Williams, who signed Wayne at age 12. Immediately perceived as a preteen prodigy, Wayne put in work to pull stardom toward him, instead of being swallowed by the black hole-like music industry. He achieved that feat by being relentless with his output, establishing his sound, lyrical content, and delivery across his early albums (1999's Tha Block Is Hot, 2000's Lights Out, 2002's 500 Degreez), and via mixtapes series like Sqad Up, Da Drought, and Dedication, which weaved throughout Lil Wayne's official studio projects. In 2002, Wayne released “10,000 Bars,” a 35-minute song featuring his last written lyrics. “You could ask my boy,” Lil Wayne said in a July 2023 interview on The Pivot Podcast. “‘I heard that n***a JAY-Z don't write no more.' We went in the studio and we did ‘10,000 Bars' and that was the last time I rapped anything off of a paper.” In addition to being influenced by JAY's rhyming preference, Tha Carter series is also directly inspired by the Brooklyn MC's late '90s album run, Vol. With his first installment, released in 2004, Lil Wayne acknowledged the work that he put into his initial solo projects and differentiated between those efforts and the journey he was about to embark on (“This Is The Carter”). Prolific producer Mannie Fresh contributed the vast majority of the beats on Tha Carter, making way for a natural sonic cohesion. Lil Wayne's commitment to championing Southern MCs has been unwavering since he picked up a mic, but Tha Carter series is where he cemented his agenda. After the unceremonious departure of the Hot Boys, Wayne's groupmates, and in-house producer Mannie Fresh, Cash Money was in desperate need of a new era. Over production handled by an assortment of producers, including New York-based duo The Heatmakerz (“Tha Mobb”), Wayne sounded settled, reserved, and assertive. But that doesn't mean he wasn't filled with creative heat, heard most clearly on the fervent mainstream hit “Fireman.” He already established “Tha Block Is Hot” in 1999, and here, Lil Wayne felt the flames building higher around him. “Money On My Mind” is the quintessential rap song of the 2000s, oozing with confidence and solidifying Wayne's hyper-focus on stacking bread by any means necessary. In 2007 alone, he featured on close to 100 songs (that is not an exaggeration) and became not only the face of Cash Money but also the hip-hop industry at large. Because of his dominance and subsequent exposure, Tha Carter III sold more than a million copies in the first week alone, an achievement we may never see again in rap. “They can't stop me—even if they stopped me!” Wayne proclaimed on “3 Peat,” at the very top of the album, inviting listeners to bear witness to his earned greatness. Carter,” Lil Wayne's collaboration with his longtime hip-hop hero, JAY-Z: “And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or JAY-Z / Don't forget Weezy, baby,” he rapped proudly. From an aerial perspective, it's clear to see that Tha Carter III represents Wayne's transition from ambitious and hungry to self-assured and exploratory. 1 hit, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. Elsewhere, the MC equally fleshes out his horny side (“Mrs. To this day, Tha Carter III is Lil Wayne's commercial opus. While this album was the anthemic arrival of a star, from 2011's Tha Carter IV on, Wayne aspired to loosen the rigid boundaries of hip-hop even further. The delicate, inexplicit, guitar-driven “How To Love” is one of the most enduring songs of Tha Carter series; featuring tender lyrics from a thoughtful Lil Wayne, the deeply affecting and enormously successful single symbolized Lil Wayne's transition from hip-hop giant to multifaceted artist. Weezy was and still is committed to innovating outside of expectations, but on Tha Carter IV, and those that followed, his experiments far outweighed the potency of his rhymes. Even pure rap songs like “6 Foot 7 Foot” with Cory Gunz (an unabashed “A Milli” remake), and the Rick Ross collaboration “John” (cobbled together by multiple producers, despite sounding like Lex Luger's work) leave much to be desired. The treacly “Mirror” featuring Bruno Mars sees Wayne assessing himself and his path, and committing to a mirror motif that he revisited in later Carter albums. In December 2014, between Tha Carter IV and V, Lil Wayne declared, “I am a prisoner and so is my creativity,” sharing his disappointment in Birdman's handling of V, and expressing his desire to be released from Cash Money Records after contractual disputes. Originally scheduled to be released in 2014, Tha Carter V was delayed until September 2018, when it finally dropped on Wayne's Young Money Entertainment record label after his departure from Cash Money. From that moment forward, freedom was the main motivating factor for Wayne. On songs like “Dedicate,” he acknowledged and basked in his impact. “Uproar,” produced by Swizz Beatz, is an outright party starter that's still blasted at countless sporting events around the world. While Lil Wayne previously set the standard in hip-hop, upping the lyrical ante for all competitors, he slipped into unfamiliar territory on Tha Carter V. Here, he chased the vibes set by his successors—sometimes on songs with those very artists (“Don't Cry” with XXXTENTACION, “Let It Fly” with Travis Scott). On “Open Letter,” he circles back to the mirror theme set on IV, but he phones in bars like, “The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit / And sometimes, I fear who in the mirror, that n***a weird.” Wayne is still Wayne, so there are highlights peppered throughout, like the prime storytelling of “Mona Lisa” with Kendrick Lamar. Some of those identity crises carried over to 2025's Tha Carter VI, Lil Wayne's latest and most recent addition to the series. “Hip-Hop,” one of the more palatable songs on the album, completely lifts from featured artist and Dallas rapper BigXThaPlug's song formula of spitting over funk-fueled, sample-heavy production. Overall, Weezy uses VI to continue reveling in his freedom—that includes a questionable collaboration with Bono (“The Days”), and an indulgent reworking of Weezer's “Island in the Sun” (“Island Holiday”). He also raps over and interpolates some of the hardest hip-hop tracks ever. Missteps abound in other areas, including the cacophonic, head-scratching “Peanuts 2 N Elephant” produced by Lin-Manuel Miranda. With Tha Carter VI, Lil Wayne has officially entered the respected trailblazer era of his career: He's slugged it out this far, and though his songs no longer crackle with the fiery intensity of his early career, he's earned the right to be uninhibited and unrestricted. He's not as consumed with defending his claim as the Best Rapper Alive, and that has led to aimless concepts, uninspired bars, and bloated projects. Uneven as it may be, Tha Carter series is still a testament to the importance of building respect, setting boundaries (for peers, fans, labels, and family alike), and admiring one's own journey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Opinion is sharply divided as to how high the superhero pic can fly when it hits theaters, with some suggesting a much lower range of $90 million to $120 million. With three weeks left to go, James Gunn and DC Studios‘ Superman is tracking to open in the $135 million range at the domestic box office. If that forecast is right, Superman would land high up on the list of DC openings, although it would lag well behind the $166 million domestic debut of 2016's Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice, not adjusted for inflation. At the same time, it would come in safely ahead of the last solo Superman movie, Zack Snyder's 2013 film Man of Steel ($116 million). Opinion, however, is sharply divided as to just how high Superman can fly. Box Office Preview: Will 'How to Train Your Dragon' Eat '28 Years Later' and Pixar's 'Elio' for Lunch? DC Studios Horror Movie 'Clayface' to Star Tom Rhys Harries NRG always provides a range in addition to a solo number; in this case, the range for Superman's domestic opening is $125 million to $145 million. The highly anticipated summer tentpole is a seminal moment for Gunn and Peter Safran, as it's their first homegrown release since being tasked with restoring the luster to DC and making a stab at catching up with Marvel Studios. The movie, which kicks off their DC Universe, opens July 11 in North America, timed to its release around the world, meaning DC and Warners have three weeks to make their final marketing push. In this latest rendition of a story that's been told on the big screen numerous times, Superman grapples with his powers while trying to balance everyday life as journalist Clark Kent  after being sent to Earth from his home planet Krypton. The cast also includes Skyler Gisondo (Jimmy Olsen), Sara Sampaio (Eve Teschmacher), Edi Gathegi (Mister Terrific), Terence Rosemore (Otis), Anthony Carrigan (Metamorpho), Isabela Merced (Hawkgirl) and María Gabriela de Faría (The Engineer).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite its passionate fanbase, the Netflix series that also starred Jonathan Groff only ran for two seasons: "David [Fincher] has to be happy with scripts," says McCallany. “I had a meeting with David Fincher in his office a few months ago, and he said to me that there is a chance that it may come back as three two-hour movies, but I think it's just a chance,” said the Waterfront star. I was in script revisions with David for two and a half years..  but [he] was very meticulous, which is why I think he's the best director in Hollywood,” The Iron Claw star said before adding, “He gave me a little bit of hope when I had that meeting with him, but the sun, the moon and the stars would all have to align.” “It's a very expensive show, and in the eyes of Netflix, we didn't attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment” for a season three, he said in 2023. However, six years later, the fans and its passionate fanbase have continued to ask for more. Previously, in 2021, Groff also told The Hollywood Reporter he would return and gushed about his love of working with Fincher. This was the main draw for me,” Groff said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. “The Waterfront,” a new Netflix series about a family-run fishery off the North Carolina coast, officially stems from “Dawson's Creek” and “Scream” scribe Kevin Williamson, but given the first season's shallow interest in its own characters, setting, and premise — combined with its unmistakable similarities to recent TV hits — the creator credit may as well be shared with the streamer's oft-vaunted algorithm. Even if “The Waterfront” wasn't pointedly conceived to pop up after “Ozark” (and thus also prevent subscribers from a far worse fate: opening a separate streaming app to watch five seasons of “Yellowstone”), the sloppy drama would still be little more than Netflix sludge: recognizable ideas, actors, and intentions tossed together in a functional story that slowly but steadily sours into overtly redundant dreck. Related Stories ‘The Four Seasons' Breakout Marco Calvani on Going Very Gay and Very Italian for the Netflix Series ‘We Were Liars' Put Breakout Star Shubham Maheshwari Through a Four-Month Film School “Ozark” begins with an enthralling sense of urgency. Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman), a family man working a white-collar accounting job in Chicago, has been skimming money for years from his top client — a Mexican drug cartel — and now they've finally caught on. Exposed to a level of violence foreign to his cushy suburban life, Marty makes a desperate plea to save his own skin: He promises to launder hundreds of millions of dollars for the cartel by establishing an outpost in the Ozarks (and, as an after-thought, he also might win back the wife who wants to leave him and the kids who are already drifting away). “Yellowstone,” meanwhile, trades in “Ozark's” urgency for an enrapturing sense of place. Instead of being forced to flee his home and start over somewhere new, John Dutton (Kevin Costner) digs in his boot heels. He's losing his legacy: the Dutton family ranch, and writer/director Taylor Sheridan makes it easy to see what a loss that would be by framing the Yellowstone-adjacent site as America's Holy Land — rolling green pastures, gurgling blue rivers, free-roaming cattle — and Dutton as its dying steward. Despite health issues and growing financial pressure, John guards his forgotten corner of a lost way of life knowing full well it could cost him his own. “The Waterfront” features many of these facets, but it takes our investment for granted. OK, that's definitely a show born from Ted Sarandos' bored musings — it's easy enough to imagine him scribbling “Ozark” + “Yellowstone” on a cocktail napkin during the Golden Globes — but it's still a formula that's works. Harlan did it for years because his dad did it before him, which makes Cane's choice less stupidly desperate and more stupidly fated. Harlan bitches and moans about Cane's foolish endeavor, but the Buckleys take to the drug trade like ducks to water — because they are and have always been drug-trading ducks who live on the water. Each week, a few trips to the open ocean get added to their shared Google calendar, but their lives otherwise continue uninterrupted. The Buckleys, after all, don't just catch, clean, and distribute fish. They have cousins all over town, and they own their own restaurant overlooking the ocean that's run by Harlan's wife, Belle (Maria Bello). His daughter Bree (Melissa Benoist) works there, too, but after watching all eight episodes, I still can't tell you how her job differs from her mom's. Maybe the redundancy is intentional, since Bree rarely works and may have missed whatever few shifts she's assigned while in rehab. A self-described alcoholic and “pillhead,” Bree isn't clued into the family's illicit side hustle — a separation that's barely justified onscreen but could be easily explained by plot details I'm barred from discussing. Officially (and shared in terms vague enough that Brie doesn't really know what she's asking to be let in on), she has to prove she's serious about her sobriety before she can transfer from restaurant “manager” to cocaine trafficker, not that such a move would help win back her son, Diller (Brady Hepner), whose father took out a restraining order against his ex-wife when she burned down their house — with Diller inside. (Side note: No matter how propulsive or immersive, there isn't a TV drama in existence that could get me to accept the given name “Diller.” Did they name him after a billionaire? Please, prospective parents out there, let the vast disparity of potential inspirations serve as warning enough to choose a different moniker. But a humorless crime saga where a terrified mother shouts “Diller” with the same emotional intensity as Ellie crying out for Joel? Despite the Buckleys' luxurious waterfront property and small fleet of shiny shipping vessels, “The Waterfront” never bothers to emphasize what makes Havenport, North Carolina — or its esteemed fishery — so special. There's a boat here and a beach there, but the visual template evokes impersonal wealth more than any specific place. Perhaps a perpetual light breeze is indicative of coastal North Carolina (and nowhere else)? There's a tinge of disapproval in how Harlan sees his timid son, but it's nothing close to the mutual scorn that drove so many blow-ups and near-reunions between John and Jamie (Wes Bentley), let alone Logan (Brian Cox) and any of his children. The Buckleys want to get along, which would be fine — a crime drama built around nice, loving family of criminals could, theoretically, be interesting — except their fluctuating feelings make it difficult for any of their fights to leave a mark. (A spoiler-free example: Harlan doesn't even bother hiding how often he cheats on his wife, and she doesn't care, which makes some of the season's soapier twists feel that much emptier.) Early on, the family's motivation for breaking bad is written off far too quickly and never revisited: “You know what Cane's up against,” Belle says. “Overfished waters, environmental quotas, gas prices.” OK… so show us that! Get some predatory fishermen involved who are encroaching on the Buckleys' cherished waters. Make us feel how hard they're working to earn all that money the right way, rather than how easy it is to traffic cocaine. Instead, “The Waterfront” cooks up bland, predictable melodrama (like Cane's high school sweetheart moving back to town) and random, extravagant violence (like a brief but brutal torture sequence midway through the season). Alluding to its desired audience, most of the show is set to a country-rock soundtrack, including a particularly bloody scene conversely set to Rodney Atkins' wholesome anthem, “True South.” Like the rest of the show, it's all vibes and no soul. Nothing that happens has to evoke any real emotions, it just has to remind you of shows that did. Even if you haven't seen “Ozark” or “Yellowstone” — heck, even if “The Waterfront” is the first series you've ever seen — there's no mistaking a sinking ship. Let's just hope Holt — a mercurial bulldog of an actor worth building a real show around — makes his way back to solid ground. All eight episodes will be released at once.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hot on the heels of landing a role in David Fincher's The Adventures of Cliff Booth, Carla Gugino has inked a deal to star opposite Lou Taylor Pucci (You) in Winthrop, a new horror film based on the cult podcast Knifepoint Horror and the fan-favorite episode “The Lockbox” by writer, creator, and narrator Soren Narnia. Set to enter production in Vancouver this summer, the film is about a woman (Gugino) who puts her life on the line to protect her troubled, enigmatic cousin, Winthrop (Pucci), who has been targeted and hunted by a powerful supernatural force. An anthology of original stand-alone stories, Narnia's Knifepoint Horror podcast has developed a cult following in the years since its 2010 launch, reaching over 10 million downloads across all platforms. Seth Yanklewitz, CSA, and Ben Pollack handled casting. In a statement on the project, producer Peak said, “Winthrop captures the eerie dread that makes ‘Knifepoint Horror' such a success. Carla Gugino is a perfect fit for the film, bringing a rare intensity and subtlety that aligns perfectly with the silent horror of Winthrop. In the upcoming Adventures of Cliff Booth, a spin-off of Quentin Tararantino's recent Oscar winner Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, Gugino stars alongside Brad Pitt, who reprises as Cliff Booth amid the stuntman's transition to Hollywood fixer. Most recently seen in Bleecker Street's drama The Friend and Max's The Girls on the Bus, she'll next be seen in Amazon MGM's action comedy Heads of State, out July 2. She's represented by Gersh, Untitled Entertainment, and Kopeikin Law P.C. Stamm is repped by Industry Entertainment and Gersh. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Johnny Depp brought a little pirate magic — and a lot of smiles — to young patients at Niño Jesús University Children's Hospital in Madrid. The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star surprised kids on Monday, June 16, by arriving in full Captain Jack Sparrow costume during a break from filming his latest project, “Day Drinker,” in Spain. Photos from the visit captured sweet moments of Depp — completely in character — laughing with children, touching pinkies with them in their rooms, and brightening their day with a swashbuckling dose of joy. This isn't the first time Johnny Depp has donned his beloved pirate costume to bring joy to children in need. In September 2024, while attending the San Sebastian Film Festival, Depp made a special visit to Donostia University Hospital in San Sebastian. There, he visited young patients in the Pediatrics and Oncology ward — staying in full Jack Sparrow character the entire time, laughing, joking, and lifting spirits throughout the visit. Over the years, Depp has brought this same kind of magic to children's hospitals around the world — from Vancouver, Paris, and London to Brisbane, Australia, and cities across the U.S., always surprising young patients and hospital staff with his heartwarming visits. He reprised the role in four more films: Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). Following his highly publicized 2022 trial with ex-wife Amber Heard, Depp has been making a carefully orchestrated return to Hollywood, starting with his 2023 film, Jeanne du Barry. In May 2024, franchise producer Jerry Bruckheimer told Entertainment Weekly, “If it was up to me, [Johnny] would be in it.” That was not on the page, that was him doing a little Pepé Le Pew and Keith Richards. As of December 2024, Variety reported that Bruckheimer was developing two versions of a sixth Pirates movie, leaving the door open for Depp to reprise his role, possibly. Whether or not he returns to the high seas in another Pirates adventure, Johnny Depp is keeping the spirit of Captain Jack Sparrow alive — and for the young patients he visits, that magic means more than any blockbuster.</p>

Thankfully, though, his years with “Star Wars” dating back to 2016's “Rogue One” have resulted in drug dealers not being the only type of role he's offered. “Before ‘Star Wars,' the only projects I'd get offered would be drug dealers,” Luna told The Hollywood Reporter, as part of their drama actors roundtable. “And then I could be the nice drug dealer and not the vicious one but still a drug dealer. Because the system wasn't even sending messages of, like, ‘Yes, you could find a way to be yourself and still work in those projects that you're looking at and hoping to see yourself reflected in.' There's no guy with a cigar saying, ‘You! People just click now, and suddenly it's like, ‘Shit, they're watching a Mexican show.' You can be as far away as you can from the system, and the system will go and search for you if there's a need to hear your story.” Related Stories ‘The Waterfront' Review: Netflix's Sludgy Family Crime Drama Is a Shallow Reflection of Better Shows ‘We Were Liars' Put Breakout Star Shubham Maheshwari Through a Four-Month Film School But to clarify, Luna then added, “Oh, I still get a lot of drug dealers. It's just I'm not looking for what they want me to play. The actor also recalled how often he'd be told to lose his Mexican accent in order to play a wider variety of roles earlier in his career. “I remember being asked, ‘Are you going to clean up your accent?' And you go, ‘Why would I like to do that? Thankfully, the powers that be at Lucasfilm agreed. Hearing a Mexican accent from a member of the Rebel Alliance in “Rogue One” was quietly revolutionary in its own way.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bruce Springsteen confirmed the long-rumored existence of an electric, full-band version of his celebrated acoustic record Nebraska — after insisting it didn't exist during a new interview with Rolling Stone. For instance, in past interviews with RS, E Street Band keyboardist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg both separately recalled those sessions, with the latter even remarking, “It was all very hard-edged. But when asked about the full-band Nebraska during a recent chat about Tracks II: The Lost Albums — Springsteen's massive compendium of unreleased material recorded between 1983 and 2018, out June 27 — the rocker insisted, “I can tell you right now, it doesn't exist.” He added, “We tried to do a few songs with the band for a few minor electric versions of ‘Nebraska,' maybe something else, I'm not sure. There is no electric Nebraska outside of what you hear us performing on stage.” After being told about Bittan's and Weinberg's memories of those sessions, Springsteen replied, “I have no recollection of it, but I can tell you there's nothing in our vault that would amount to an electric Nebraska.” I checked our vault and there IS an electric Nebraska record, though it does not have the full album of songs.” Springsteen did not say which Nebraska songs were recorded, nor whether the collection would get a proper release at some point. There is another upcoming vault project, Tracks III, and while Springsteen said it's already finished and “ready to be released,” it may not arrive for another few years because of all the other projects he wants to release, too.

Standout lots in the auctioned collection included Lynch's director's chair, which sold for $70,000, a 35-millimiter print of his 1977 surrealist classic Eraserhead that went for $40,000, and a personal copy of the script to the Oscar-nominated Mulholland Drive which sold for $98,000. Lynch was know to drink over 20 cups of coffee a day at one point, and his personal La Marzocco GS/3 Home Espresso Machine sold for $35,000. Described by Lynch as a movie “about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair,” the director repeatedly came back to the screenplay and script, writing and rewriting Ronnie Rocket but never finding adequate financial backing to fully develop the project. In 2013, Lynch told writer David Breskin that Ronnie Rocket was not a dead project. “I suspect that Ronnie Rocket is David's most thought-about story and may just never be made not because the production company didn't want to shoot it, they and several others were willing, but David wasn't.” Sabrina Carpenter Is Under Fire for a Spicy Album Cover.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On June 17, friends, family, and fans of chef Anne Burrell were shocked at her sudden passing. The magnetic Food Network personality was beloved by many. One of the most emotional tributes was from her close friend and fellow chef, Rachael Ray. “I can't quite believe it — such a strong, vibrant, fearless woman, so full of life and love, could be gone so soon,” she wrote. Bobby Flay, friend and fellow “Worst Cooks in America” chef, has also posted his praise of the star. He also says she gave him “the greatest gift” that will last forever. On June 18th, Bobby Flay took to his Instagram stories and posted a photo of Anne Burrell sitting in a chair with the biggest smile on her face. “All of your co-hosts (me included) were just alongside for the Anne Burrell ride.” “The greatest gift I got from AB was turning me on to a world of Maine Coon Cats (including Nacho)… a gift that I'll have forever.” The photo he used was one that Burrell had posted in July 2024, before Marcia died. The last time was on May 16, when she posted an adorable Instagram video of Nancy grooming her husband, Stuart's, head. Bobby Flay's love of Maine Coons has been well-documented over the past decade. While Nacho sadly passed away in 2023, he still regularly posts photos of his current Maine Coons: Conelo and Stella. He has also never forgotten Nacho and posts about him, as well.</p>

Eight songs into her June 15 set, Lavigne brought out her ex-husband — and Sum 41 frontman — to deliver one of the most iconic anthems of the genre. “What do you say we bring one of the OG Warped Tour bands back out here tonight to join me right now?” she told the crowd. Here's How to Enter Submissions for AIM's 2025 Independent Music Awards Whibley, who had recently announced his retirement from music following Sum 41's final album Heaven :x: Hell, responded with his signature smirk: “Holy s—, goddamn. The band wrapped things up following the release of their double album Heaven :x: Hell, citing Whibley's health issues and a desire to go out on a high note. The performance also came after a turbulent year for the frontman, who filed a lawsuit against former manager Greig Nori with claims of abuse. Still, in D.C., none of that overshadowed the shared nostalgia onstage. Lavigne summed it up best: “Headlined Vans Warped Tour last night and it was everything I would have expected and more!” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I've grown up in the age of people having iPhones at shows," Carpenter explained. Carpenter's comments appeared in a recent article from Rolling Stone, who shared quotes that didn't make it into their recent cover story with the singer. Here's How to Enter Submissions for AIM's 2025 Independent Music Awards “This will honestly p–s off my fans, but absolutely,” she explained, noting she was inspired by a Las Vegas show from Silk Sonic which required her to lock her phone up.” Everyone's singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. Notably, Silk Sonic's 2022 Las Vegas residency even featured Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak crafting a song to underline the lack of devices. “I've grown up in the age of people having iPhones at shows,” Carpenter continued. I can't blame people for wanting to have memories. Do not zoom in on me when I'm 80 years old up there.” The topic of banning phones at gigs has been a contentious one over the years, with artists wishing for fans to live in the moment, and fans desiring a chance to memorialize their concert experiences. “We think you'll enjoy looking up from your gadgets for a little while and experience music and our shared love of it in person,” a note from the band read at the time. Other acts, such as Tool and A Perfect Circle have been noted for asking fans to observe such a practice, with the latter having made headlines for reportedly ejecting concert attendees who violated the request. “If you've ever been to a play or a movie, it's kind of similar: you don't take out your phone and start filming, and let the people behind you stare into your screen.” More recently, Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood put out a request to fans to put down their phones during the band's Run for Your Lives World Tour. “We really want fans to enjoy the shows first hand, rather than on their small screens,” Smallwood explained. “The amount of phone use nowadays diminishes enjoyment, particularly for the band who are on stage looking out at rows of phones, but also for other concertgoers,” he added. “We feel that the passion and involvement of our fans at shows really makes them special, but the phone obsession has now got so out of hand that it has become unnecessarily distracting especially to the band.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
