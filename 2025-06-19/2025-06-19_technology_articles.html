                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SpaceX's upper stage prototype, designated Ship 36, exploded in southeast Texas shortly before midnight local time on June 18 during routine preparations for an upcoming test flight. SpaceX is in the midst of preparing for Starship's next fully integrated test, known as Flight 10. The explosion—as shown in spectacular footage from NASASpaceFlight.com—occurred at SpaceX's Massey facility, a test site located several miles from the launch mount at Starbase, Texas. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk chimed in a few hours after the incident on X, brushing off the incident as “Just a scratch.” He elaborated further this morning, saying the early data “suggests a nitrogen COPV [composite overwrapped pressure vessel] in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,” and that if this proves to be the case, it's the “first time ever for this design.” A COPV is a lightweight tank made of composite fibers wrapped around a thin liner to store high-pressure fluids, according to NASA. No further details are known, but as SpaceNews points out, Starship was being prepared for a static fire test, and the explosion happened before the rocket had a chance to fire its Raptor engines. A June 18 advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration pointed to June 29 as a potential date for Flight 10, but that seems unlikely now. In March, Flight 8 was cut short by a hardware failure in one of the Raptor engines, while Flight 9 in May successfully reached space, but a leak led to loss of control and the vehicle broke apart during reentry. SpaceX's Starship megarocket is built to carry people and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other destinations around the solar system. It's a key part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the Moon by 2027, and is central to Elon Musk's stated goal of colonizing Mars.

The SpaceX CEO threatened to pull his Dragon spacecraft, flaunting an incredible amount of leverage. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Cybernews, the team responsible for IDing and cataloging a significant number of previous major leaks, assembled the datasets making up this most recent 16B leak. The rest are all new from all over the world, including three distinct batches that held over 1 billion credentials each. The largest batch, sourced from Portuguese-speaking populations, contains 3.5 billion credentials, with other major batches named after Russian logins, Telegram logins, and a host of largely generic names. This means that clear action items to wipe your data from these collections cannot be issued, nor can researchers tell what attacks were being considered for the data. As with all mega security breaches, the 16B mystery leak serves as a loud reminder to practice clean internet hygiene by choosing secure passwords that are changed semi-regularly. It also means that databases that serve to warn users about their compromised data have not yet been populated with the leaked accounts. Internet browsers like Firefox or Chrome that warn users of compromised credentials or third-party tools like Cybernews' data leak checker haven't yet been updated with the newly revealed stolen credentials. Large collections of stolen credentials like the ones making up this megaleak are often used in major digital offensives like phishing scams or other attacks that scale up well. So ,beyond ensuring your passwords are safe and haven't gone unchanged in 10+ years, being wary of phishing and other likely scams is also good internet safety that should always be practiced, especially in the wake of cybersecurity events like this one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an era where K-pop music groups have undeniably become a dominant force in the global music scene, Sony Pictures Animation‘s latest film, KPop Demon Hunters, does more than ride the wave of this craze. It cleverly presents the phenomenon in an action-packed animated film that serves as a gateway for parents who are curious about why their kids are so enamored with synchronized choreography. KPop Demon Hunters, co-directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, is a movie that could be summed up very easily by its title. Thankfully, the film has more to offer than what it lampshades on its proverbial tin. In concert with films of its ilk that came before it, like Turning Red and, surprisingly, Sinners, KPop Demon Hunters explores music as both a haven and a form of emotional expression through its musical elements. But unlike those films, KPop Demon Hunters leans heavily into the magical girl anime aesthetic—think Sailor Moon (or, for real ones out there, Winx Club and Totally Spies!) meets Twice—where the members aren't just deified performers; they moonlight as warriors protecting humanity from demonic threats as the latest iteration on a generations-long line of singers who protect humanity with the power of song. This golden, shimmering shield keeps demons under the command of a dark entity called Gwi-Ma (Squid Game‘s Lee Byun-hun) from opening rifts in the world forever. While all of the above is a lot to take in conceptually, KPop Demon Hunters doesn't get bogged down in a year-one-esque tale of their heroic exploits, exposing the ins and outs of their heroic mission. What's more, Huntrix kick ass while serving a live performance about how much ass they're kicking with the same kinetic energy and sonic flair as a Riot Games' K/DA—catchy, visually dazzling, and undeniably stylish—before they skydive into the stadium below to regale their adoring fans with the opener for their show. With the girls on the precipice of achieving a golden honmoon, Gwi-Ma concocts a plan to undo the girl group's meteoric rise in popularity: Saja Boys, a rival demon boy group led by Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), who plan on taking down Huntrix by hitting them where it hurts the most, by poaching their fans. The obvious bar that KPop Demon Hunters sets for itself is to deliver a film worthy of its distinction as the follow-up to Sony Pictures Animation's Spider-Verse success, where both its songs and action are exceptional. Most notably, KPop Demon Hunters' character designs are bold and expressive, filled with off-model gags and chibi-like moments that add texture to its idol protagonists, allowing them to shed their near-mythic personas and become the kind of approachable girls with gremlin-like tendencies that anyone would want to hang out with. Alongside the phenomenal voice work of its main cast, who display an uncanny sense of comedic timing that matches the film's fluid action, KPop Demon Hunters adds another layer of authenticity to its musicality. This song, along with other catchy tracks from Huntrix and Saja Boys, demonstrates that the musical efforts are not just standard fare. Rather than facing their rivals one on one, Huntrix finds itself embroiled in a deeper struggle beyond the grueling media tours. The film's emotional core, like with the group itself, centers on Rumi whose journey to superstardom takes an unexpected turn when she loses her voice. While the film does bring its conflicts and big ideas to a resolution, its ending feels overly convenient, so neatly tied up that it loses some of the depth that its setup promised. There's a twinge of missed potential here, as intriguing plot threads, particularly those tied to Rumi's journey of self-discovery and Juni's backstory, are prematurely trimmed rather than fully explored. The film cheekily has its cake and eats it too by calling attention to this with quips from Mira and Zoey. Putting aside any complaints about its somewhat rush-job wrap-up finale, KPop Demon Hunters is an animated film that boldly embraces its over-the-top premise and approaches a powerful message of acceptance. With high-energy fight sequences and moments of genuine hilarity, KPop Demon Hunters never loses sight of the magic that makes animation and idol culture so irresistibly fun. Much like Tsuburaya Productions and Industrial Light & Magic's 3D CG animated film, Ultraman Rising, which elevates a familiar premise while celebrating Asian heritage at its core, KPop Demon Hunters reinforces Sony Animation Studio's reputation for creating visually stunning, genre-blending spectacles.

Don't get too excited, though, as PatRyk on X wryly admits they have created “the world's slowest ‘iPhone'.” Booting this Nintendo ‘iPhone' currently takes 20 minutes, and all the apps they tried crash – but it's a start. We wonder how many times they waited that length of time, or even longer, for the boot process to hang or otherwise fail? Using the mobile OS also sounds like an incredible life-sapping chore, with this ‘iPhone' in its current state. PatRyk says that the system “kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash).” I've lost my mind (and 2 days of my life to install this)Behold: the world's slowest “iPhone” 🎉🎉Takes over 20 minutes to boot, kernel panics every 2nd thing you do, can't open any apps (they all time out and crash) 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/r3B3JPDUDVJune 17, 2025 At this stage, the project might sound dire, but it shows that running iOS on the original Switch is possible – it just needs optimization. But you aren't going to be ditching your real Apple iPhone for a Switch any time soon. PatRyk reveals that their Nintendo ‘iPhone' project was only possible thanks to a version of QEMU created for the Apple iPhone 11 by ChefKissInc. QEMUAppleSilicon is a version of the open-source machine emulator and virtualizer tailored for emulating Apple Silicon devices, as per its name. Over two days of mind-numbing hacking, PatRyk wrangled this GitHub code and the heavily locked-down Apple iOS. Eventually, the tinkering tour de force paid dividends, as PatRyk managed to coax iOS on Nintendo Switch to get out of bed and wash its face on a completely alien system powered by the Nvidia Tegra X1. But they say to their followers that they will be back to share further adventures in code, more frequently, so stay tuned.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Why, the indignity of it all is even worse than going deaf. Audiological testing requires significant one-on-one interaction and plenty of technology to back that up. Every audiogram I've sat for has been inside a sophisticated, soundproof chamber. Hear.com—a company that sells prescription hearing aids online and via traditional retail channels —has a workaround. I've taken Hear.com's virtual hearing test twice—this is what a tele-hearing exam looks like, should you decide to take one. If you've never had hearing aids before, this is probably a good first step; veterans will likely skip it, especially if they know what model hearing aids they want (or how much they want to spend). From there, they will suggest the best hearing aids (from their product line) to meet your needs, though you can also advocate for a specific product if you've already identified one. Open it up, and the collection of hardware and the tangle of wires connecting it all may seem daunting, but rest assured, with even a modicum of technical knowledge, it all goes together quickly, and Hear.com professionals can guide you through any confusion over the phone. On top, you'll find a Microsoft Surface tablet that has been stripped down to do just one thing: serve as the conduit for a video-based audiology session. After plugging the Surface into wall power, you'll find a USB breakout box to connect to the Surface's USB port. Assuming all the other devices are still properly plugged into that USB breakout box (which is far from assured; it's good to check everything is snug), you are effectively good to go. First is a physical exam of your ears, which is made possible thanks to the included USB-powered otoscope, which you probably know better as the lighted tool with the black, conical tip a doctor uses to look into your ear canal. There's no doctor to guide the tool by hand, so the audiologist will tell you how to position it in each ear so they can get a good look at your eardrum. Spoiler: There is more wax inside your ear canal than you think. The tests were very familiar to me, starting with tones played at varying frequencies and volume levels in each ear, during which you tap the Surface screen whenever you hear something. The test is then repeated with a bone-conduction appliance that attaches to your forehead with a Velcro band for another look at the way you process sound. Lastly, a third test measures your ability to distinguish various consonant and vowel sounds—sh vs. ch, for example—which is performed by having you repeat the words you think you hear back to the audiologist multiple times. Hear.com's audiogram was even more detailed, because it tested my hearing at nine different frequencies, one more than the in-person visit. You'll have purchased the hearing aids you're about to put on already and will find them in the box, inside a charger that notes they are fully charged and ready to use. If for some reason these aids aren't appropriate for the hearing loss measured in the testing, Hear.com will recommend an alternative at that time, but most customers should have a set in hand that will meet their needs, based on the previous intake call. The doctor will then train a hearing aid novice on how to insert, charge, and clean the aids and go over any lingering paperwork that needs to be dealt with. Hear.com sells its own hearing aids under the Horizon brand, which are private-labeled Signia hearing aids in the Signia IX series. There's not an easy way to see exactly which models Hear.com offers on its website, but they range from the Horizon 1IX ($1,975) to the Horizon 7IX ($4,950), the latter of which is what I was sent to try. Monthly payment plans are available for everything, and all of its hearing aids come with a 45-day money-back guarantee.

A lucky online shopper has taken to social media to boast how they received “a whole box of SSDs instead of one.” Redditor Ok-Middle-1360 bought one 2TB Samsung 990 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 SSD from Amazon, and was understandably surprised when a box of nine units arrived. Redditors were quick to congratulate/complain about the apparent Amazon packing error, and offer up theories as to how such obvious errors happen. It has even been suggested that Amazon randomly picks out buyers for such a ‘jackpot' as a viral marketing ploy. Laptops usually top out at two M.2 storage connectors, and desktops with four or more are quite rare. The Redditor could seek to sell-on spare drives, for a nice windfall, or perhaps buy a PCIe M.2 expansion card, or set up a NAS - if they have use for such quantities of storage/functionality. These Samsung 990 EVO Plus devices rival the best SSDs around. Perhaps wisely, though, they have decided to “ride it out” for a while, to see if Amazon reaches out regarding their obvious and expensive error. Here you will find a range of well-reasoned theories, and others perhaps less so. For example, someone who currently works at Amazon indicates that this seems to be a warehouse newbie who picked a ‘masterbox' or ‘master pack' from a pallet, rather than an individual product. Apparently, barcodes can be shared between master packs and single units. One such check, of weight, would not be far out of its expected range, where tiny PC components get packed in oversized boxes in single/multiple quantities. Redditors also offer up the hypothesis that AI-powered robotic pickers are sometimes getting things wrong. That wouldn't be such a big surprise, given the above pack nuances.

Plunging deeper into the conspiracy rabbit hole, there are several posts promoting the idea that stories like this NVMe SSD jackpot from Ok-Middle-1360 are just marketing stunts. They are “fake posts… advertisements… viral marketing,” according to some skeptics. While the best SSD deal you can find right now would ned you an MSI 2TB SSD for 5 cents per gigabyte, this colossal Amazon gaff netted this lucky user 18TB for just $0.008/GB.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As protestors faced off against ICE agents and law enforcement in Los Angeles, game developers gathered just a few miles away for Summer Game Fest. The team at Outerloop Games was no different. Outerloop, creator of Thirsty Suitors and Falcon Age, were at the event to show off their newest project, a “spicy” narrative turn-based RPG called Dosa Divas due out in early 2026. As the Trump administration carries out mass deportations, targets visas, disappears migrants into a foreign megaprison, and tweets “ASMR” videos of people being deported in chains from the official White House account, Outerloop is making games that find ways to connect people to different cultures through food. Outerloop's games have always featured food in some capacity, and Dosa Divas only ramps up its importance. Named for dosas, savory crepes popular in South India, the game stars two sisters fighting against an evil fast food empire, literally; characters in its turn-based combat have unique abilities associated with different “flavor profiles,” like sweet, spicy, or sour. Dosa Divas centers around three sisters—Samara, Amani, and fast food entrepreneur, Lina—the last of which has become estranged after their family restaurant closes down. Lina's quick cuisine has become so widespread that nobody really cooks anymore. Ekanayake says that part of the game's story is about reconciliation and reconnection, especially through food. Collecting ingredients and cooking plays an important role in the game. By sharing meals with villagers, players can help repair communities and build their own reputation. Much like Thirsty Suitors, Outerloop's previous game, Dosa Divas is set in a colorful, vibrant world that mixes fantastical elements with the everyday. In Thirsty Suitors, heroine Jala battled her exes in over-the-top fight sequences, skateboarded, and tried to make peace with her parents. Summer Game Fest had “many games set in spooky or dystopian locales that made for a weekend filled with lots of dark, shadowy worlds that felt largely devoid of color,” wrote ScreenRant. “After so much gray, to come across a bright color palette and such a visually-appealing art style in the game felt so inviting.” RPGFan said “its combat felt intuitive, its writing was witty.” Ekanayake says he's already heard from one fan with a 10-year-old son; the family had just eaten dosas the night before, and his kid was thrilled to see a little part of his life on screen. It's easily shared and introduced to people, even cultural neophytes, allowing anyone to easily experience life outside of their own. Outerloop's team includes people who come from regions like South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Palestine, so their games include a lot of what Ekanayake calls immigrant dishes. “In Seattle,” he says, “we still have an ethnic aisle in the grocery store—which is ridiculous to me because white people have ethnicity too.” Games, sometimes, can feel the same way. “You can make the best thing you can possibly make, but it still gets associated in the same way.” Even well-meaning observers fall into comments that feel othering. “A lot of white folks that come up to me like, ‘oh, what you're doing is so brave,'” he says. Ekanayake says that there's a commonality to immigrant experiences in the US, cultural aspects that Outerloop tries to get across in their games. Growing hostility towards people of color under the Trump administration is making even an annual game event a place to be on guard. “We talk about different local laws and issues depending on where folks are, and how to stay safe,” Ekanayake says. Even as a naturalized citizen, he's not entirely comfortable with leaving and re-entering the US right now, whether it's to see family or attend gaming events like Gamescom in Germany. He says it's the first time since 9/11 where he's questioned, “Am I putting my family in danger, am I putting my employees in danger?

Nvidia's recent move to partially open its NVLink interconnect through its NVLink Fusion program has triggered significant interest across the industry, as eight companies have expressed interest in developing CPUs and semi-custom silicon for Nvidia's ecosystem. However, as it turns out, Nvidia retained some of the key NVLink components closed from its partners and may even decide not to grant licenses to certain products and bar their entry into the ecosystem, reports DigiTimes. Alchip Technologies, one of a few companies permitted to engage with the program, claims that while it can develop full-stack NVLink implementation, it warns that its customers may struggle to deploy their solutions if Nvidia denies their access to certain layers of NVLink protocols. This is because the green company keeps access to protocols (beyond certain levels) gated while controlling the whole software stack. Only select companies among Nvidia's partners get access to it. However, there is a catch: only the CPU designers seem to be able to implement NVLink both on hardware and software levels. While companies like Alchip can get access to everything related to hardware, the software layer that is responsible for initiating and configuring links is still controlled by Nvidia, and therefore, Alchip clients must get a license and approval from it. In addition to limiting availability of NVLink Fusion IP to select partners (which is not bad per se, so to speak), Nvidia also require developers of actual platform to implement at least one Nvidia product (CPU, GPU, Switch) into their platform, which brings it additional revenue, but somewhat reduces flexibility of such inventions. Such a heavily controlled access to the NVLink limits practical use of third-party hardware and restricts seamless interoperability that open standards tend to provide (though NVLink does not seem to be an open standard). Analysts questioned by DigiTimes argue that Nvidia's dominance in AI hardware and its vertical control over software, pricing, and supply create little incentive for genuine openness. Therefore, the NVLink Fusion program looks more like a calculated effort to maintain goodwill among select partners, expand NVLink ecosystem in a controlled manner, enable customers looking for sovereignty to build their own CPUs or special-purpose accelerators, and reduce appeal of competing platforms with UALink, which are expected to start gaining traction in late 2026 – 2027. At the end of the day, the biggest competitive risk for Nvidia is not a single highly successful product from its rivals, but a competing ecosystem that features multiple competitive processors tailored for specific workloads. While Nvidia cannot stop such an ecosystem from emerging, it can either delay the moment it thrives, or somehow get prepared for its emergence with the help of select partners while preserving its record-high margins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nostalgia should not be enough to give any tech a passing grade. I wouldn't have dropped $65 on the revitalized GameCube controller for Switch 2 if I hadn't spent my preteen years beholden to Nintendo's boxy console. With improved buttons, the new version is better than anything from 2001. After so many years, I've come to see the gamepad as a unique device that's enhanced by its limitations. See Switch 2+ Mario Kart World Bundle at Walmart The Switch 2 GameCube controller is exclusive to Nintendo's online storefront, and its availability keeps fluctuating to the point we can't tell when or if it will be back in stock. So why would you want the official recreation? Because it works as seamlessly as a Joy-Con or Pro Controller, and compared to many third-party emulations, this is the most pitch-perfect accurate device in terms of raw feel. Sorry, you won't be emulating GameCube games with Nintendo's own tech (at least until somebody inevitably hacks it). It's an improved rendition of Nintendo's classic controller from 2001 with better buttons and wireless connectivity. I have hung onto the same original black GameCube and wireless WaveBird controller from my childhood—the joysticks so mangled with caustic adolescent fingers they were worn down to nubs. I'm comparing a brand-new device to one that's nearly as old as I am, but it appears that Nintendo replaced the squishy rubber pads of the original controller's face buttons with something that's far more snappy and clicky. That directional pad is still small, so I won't be using it for a fighting game anytime soon, but it's a better option for some retro titles. For launch, Nintendo released just three games for $50-per-year Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, including The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Soul Calibur II, and F-Zero GX. I would love to see deep cuts of the GameCube library make their return, like Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and TimeSplitters 2, or other exclusives like Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Nintendo hasn't offered an idea of what will come out next, but I wouldn't advise that you buy this controller in the mere hope we see the return of Killer 7. While Sony standardized the twin-stick layout of its DualShock, Nintendo—being Nintendo—crafted a controller that forced developers to design around its oddly shaped buttons and pressure-sensitive trigger buttons. It was a first-person shooter where that secondary nipple-like C stick went unused in favor of tank controls with a lock-on mechanic. The design lent itself to entire gaming subgenres. Super Smash Bros. Melee's controls emphasize the “A” and “B” buttons for attacks, while the C stick was geared for hitting quick directional “smash” attacks. Mario Kart World is made to be played with a single Joy-Con, which only requires one joystick, four face buttons, and triggers. Still, I found I preferred the GameCube controller's thick primary joystick and its octagonal restrictor for precision in Mario Kart. For this plasticky, ultra-purple controller, $65 was a hard pill to swallow. Its top portion, which used to sport a power connector, now has a Home button and “C” switch for GameChat. It has gyro controls that work for some Switch games, but it won't really work as a stand-in for the official Switch 2 Pro Controller or any other third-party gamepad complete with all the bumpers, triggers, and back buttons you need for modern games. There's no way you can play a first-person shooter like Cyberpunk 2077 without access to those extra buttons. The GameCube controller was full of small innovations we take for granted nowadays. Nowadays, where Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity are standardized, the wireless connectivity isn't anywhere near unique, but it's far more convenient than plugging your controller into an adapter for every play session. The addition of a Home button adds the convenience of easy access to your in-game screenshots or sleep mode. The GameCube controller wouldn't be enough if all you used it for were just three games and the hope you'll get to play more later. The significant restrictions Nintendo placed on its functionality with other devices are more than a little frustrating. It's far less versatile than most controllers, but in a way I appreciate it more because of that. If other controllers are a multi-tool, the GameCube controller is a scalpel made for specific use cases—like beating the ever-living snot out of friends in Smash.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Valve is finally working on a full in-game overlay for Steam that provides significantly more information than just frames per second (fps). The June 17th Steam Client Beta introduced an upgraded overlay that monitors hardware usage and supports DLSS/FSR frame generation monitoring. Valve's new overlay provides significantly more information than before — enough to compete with many third-party overlays. Valve's new overlay is also one of very few monitoring solutions that allows gamers to monitor both native frame rates and AI-generated frames, often referred to as 'fake frames,' simultaneously — a feature that will only become more useful as frame generation technologies become more mainstream. It isn't quite the same as 1% and 0.1% lows, but Valve believes this is the best way to display potential micro stutter to gamers. A red line will appear if major frame rate dips occur, helping gamers detect micro stutter. The fps section now supports AI-generated frame rate monitoring (as previously mentioned) when DLSS or FSR frame generation is enabled in a game. When active, the overlay will update itself automatically, displaying either "DLSS" or "FSR" in red and showcasing the number of generated frames next to the regular frame rate counter, allowing gamers to monitor both generated and native frame rates simultaneously. Microsoft introduced this method of monitoring CPU utilization in Windows 8 to provide a clearer monitoring solution on CPUs with turbo boosting technologies that constantly vary the CPU's clock speed. Unlike Microsoft's implementation, Valve's CPU monitoring system will take into account turbo boosting, and so utilization percentages will go above 100% regularly on virtually all modern CPUs.

In other words, this isn't a device to be worn during penetration, nor would the size and shape allow for such a possibility. In doing this, it not only arouses the person with the vulva, increasing natural lubrication in some cases, but also brings them closer to an orgasm—if that's their sexual goal. But while that's my personal experience, Pulse Duo is an essential sexual aid device. As someone who has many friends with vulvas who struggle to enjoy penetrative sex because of pain, the Pulse Duo offers a level of intimacy without penetration that other products don't. As much as it's not talked about or, even worse, sometimes dismissed when brought up, painful intercourse for those with vulvas isn't uncommon. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as many as 75 percent of people with vulvas will have painful intercourse at some point in their lives. For some, this may be something that pops up from time to time, while others may have medical conditions that prevent them from having pain-free intercourse. It's for these people that a device like the Pulse Duo comes into play. I should also point out that the remote control for Pulse Duo is excellent. It's not just easy to use but also extremely tactical, so even if you're not looking directly at it, your fingers can scope out what each of the four buttons is for. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The device is also waterproof, made from a mixture of silicone and ABS plastic, and can be recharged via a USB-A cable. You can buy spares from Hot Octopuss, but there's always a risk the company will stop making the cable in a few years. Speaking of charging, you'll need to do it quite often, as the battery in the Pulse Duo lasts around an hour, which is way too short. Although Hot Octopuss was kind enough to send along an explanatory video, which I watched three times, there was still a disconnect in my brain. I thought this device was to be used during penetrative sex. It wasn't until I spoke to a friend who had used another version of the Hot Octopuss Pulse that reality set in. After trying the Pulse Duo as it's meant to be used, I realized it wasn't a fit for me or my partner. Where the Pulse Duo excelled was during mutual masturbation. While he has his hands full with that, I can lie beside him while getting up close and personal with my favorite vibrator. The Hot Octopuss Pulse Duo is an extraordinary sexual device I've already recommended to a couple of friends. But its pleasantness is very much dependent upon your needs and wants. Since painful intercourse is so common among those of us with vulvas, I'm glad I have it in my drawer should that become an issue for me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like it or not, large language models have quickly become embedded into our lives. And due to their intense energy and water needs, they might also be causing us to spiral even faster into climate chaos. Some LLMs, though, might be releasing more planet-warming pollution than others, a new study finds. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, models that are more accurate tend to have the biggest energy costs. It's hard to estimate just how bad LLMs are for the environment, but some studies have suggested that training ChatGPT used up to 30 times more energy than the average American uses in a year. What isn't known is whether some models have steeper energy costs than their peers as they're answering questions. Researchers from the Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences in Germany evaluated 14 LLMs ranging from 7 to 72 billion parameters—the levers and dials that fine-tune a model's understanding and language generation—on 1,000 benchmark questions about various subjects. Some LLMs, particularly reasoning LLMs, also insert special “thinking tokens” into the input sequence to allow for additional internal computation and reasoning before generating output. Reasoning models, on average, created 543.5 thinking tokens per question, whereas concise models required just 37.7 tokens per question, the study found. In the ChatGPT world, for example, GPT-3.5 is a concise model, whereas GPT-4o is a reasoning model. This reasoning process drives up energy needs, the authors found. “The environmental impact of questioning trained LLMs is strongly determined by their reasoning approach,” study author Maximilian Dauner, a researcher at Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences, said in a statement. The reasoning model Cogito, which has 70 billion parameters, reached up to 84.9% accuracy—but it also produced three times more CO2 emissions than similarly sized models that generate more concise answers. “Currently, we see a clear accuracy-sustainability trade-off inherent in LLM technologies,” said Dauner. Questions that required detailed or complex reasoning, for example abstract algebra or philosophy, led to up to six times higher emissions than more straightforward subjects, according to the study. Emissions are very dependent on how local energy grids are structured and the models that you examine, so it's unclear how generalizable these findings are. “Users can significantly reduce emissions by prompting AI to generate concise answers or limiting the use of high-capacity models to tasks that genuinely require that power,” Dauner said in a statement.
