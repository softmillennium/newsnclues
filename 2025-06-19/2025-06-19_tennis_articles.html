                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martina Navratilova is now the most successful player in Wimbledon history. Navratilova won 18 Grand Slam singles titles in her career, with nine of them coming on the grass of Wimbledon. The Czech-born American also won 41 major titles in both women's and mixed doubles. Navratilova played Chris Evert in the 1978 Wimbledon final, the player that whom she had beaten only four times in their 25 previous meetings. When looking back on her first Grand Slam singles victory, Navratilova spoke to Amol Rajan in an interview with the BBC. While it was the biggest moment of her career at the time, Navratilova admitted that people did not care as much as she expected them to. “And afterwards…you know the hotel sent me all the newspapers, so I'm reading all the… and it was so sweet. “And I'm like, oh, the world's going to come to a stop and say, ‘Wow, Martina Navratilova won Wimbledon!' “And most of all, I couldn't even celebrate it with my family. I mean, I found out after the match that they watched it on TV, but you know, that was very bittersweet because my dad spent thousands and thousands of hours on the court with me and then travelling to little tournaments here and there. So it was bittersweet, but, you know, life didn't really change that much for me.” Her 1987 victory meant that she had equalled Helen Wills Moody with eight Wimbledon titles, needing just one more victory to stand alone in history. Navratilova was close to achieving this in 1988 and 1989, but on both occasions lost in the final to Steffi Graf. Having lost in the final in the two years prior, Navratilova did not care how she was able to get there. Navratilova did not need to scrape and scratch, beating compatriot Zina Garrison, 6-4 6-1, in the final. This was the final Grand Slam singles title that she would ever play, with Navratilova playing her last Wimbledon Centre Court match in 1994. She would win two more mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon after 1994, before Navratilova officially retired in 2006.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gauff suffered a 6-3, 6-3 upset loss in her second-round matchup with China's Xinyu Wang on Thursday. The defeat took place in Gauff's first match since winning at Roland-Garros on June 7. Wang was down 3-1 in the second set before she rallied to defeat Gauff. 49 will now advance to the quarterfinals in Berlin. Last season she upset Jessica Pegula, who at the time was ranked No. "After I won the first set, I told myself, 'Let's take a minute and enjoy this… I won the first set against the French Open champion,'" Wang said in her post-match interview, per Olympics.com's Nick McCarvel. Gauff's early exit will delay a potential rematch with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who finished as runner-up to Gauff at Roland Garros. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a stellar clay season this spring, making the finals in both Madrid and Rome before her victory over Sabalenka in Paris. Gauff has less experience on grass courts like those in Berlin. That's a smaller sample size, but a lower win percentage than Gauff's 141-61 record on hard court (70 percent win rate) and 67-22 mark on clay (75 percent win rate.) She was eliminated at that stage last year with a straight-set defeat by Emma Navarro. She will look to build on her French Open success and bounce back from Thursday's early exit when Wimbledon starts on June 30.</p>

I would love to win either here or obviously Wimbledon, but I still have a lot to learn and every grass season I think I learned a little bit more,” she said.“I would like to say just because the season is short, but also I can't blame it on that because we all have the same amount of time to get ready.”Wang advances to face eighth seed Paula Badosa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff's French Open triumph caught up with her on Thursday (19 June). It marks a career-best win for the 23-year-old Wang, and snaps the American superstar's seven-match win streak she accumulated in Paris. Wang, a qualifier in Berlin at the WTA 500 event, next faces Spain's Paula Badosa in the quarter-finals. I was putting pressure on her second serve with my return. It was a tough match, [but] I'm happy that I hung in there in the tough moments. I'm really happy to get through today." Wang was down in her very first qualifying match of the week, needing three sets to advance before scoring wins over Ons Jabeur (to make the main draw) and Daria Kasatkina (in the first round). "My team told me, 'Just fight for every point. Gauff served at just 38 percent of first serves in for the match (22 of 58) while hitting seven double faults in the one hour, 15-minute encounter. She led by a break in the first set, but relented that lead and never looked to re-settle. The opening-match loss leaves Gauff in a lurch with Wimbledon set to start on 30 June.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill has revealed how it was Novak Djokovic who helped turnaround Sinner's game in 2022 with his honest feedback. Djokovic had told Cahill that Sinner has “no variation”, “no height over the net”, “doesn't try to bring me to net” and “not attacking my serve”. Cahill decided to approach Djokovic for his views. So you know, there's no shape on his shot. He's not trying to bring me in, I know that he returns well, but he's not attacking my serve on the return of serve,” Cahill recalled the feedback on the podcast ‘Served with Andy Roddick'. And won the last three sets reasonably easily,” Cahill says about that 2022 match. “And I saw Novak, and he's always great with this, he's always been incredible when you tap him on the shoulder. And I said, ‘Hey listen, I've just started with Jannik, don't tell me anything you don't want to tell me, but can I ask what you were feeling out there?' “So he went through his whole game and broke it down. It wasn't like it was revelations to what we didn't know about Jannik and what we were trying to change in his game. “But when you take that conversation and sit down with a young man like Jannik Sinner and say,' Hey, listen, I just spoke to Novak and this is what he thinks', that leaves a big impression on a young player. Sinner's ranking at the end of that year 2022 was 15; he is now world no.1.</p>

The Czech returned to competition this year after a 15-month maternity break. The 35-year-old, who won Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014 and reached the Australian Open final in 2019, will compete at this year's Wimbledon and US Open for the last time.

Kvitova, who has won 31 titles over nearly two decades and reached a highest ranking of number two in the world, said the 2025 season would be her last.

Kvitova's career was marked by resilience, most notably her recovery from a serious injury sustained during a home robbery in 2016.

"I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me," she wrote in a statement.

"And while I am not entirely sure yet what my hardcourt swing in the US will look like, I am intending to finish my active playing career at the US Open in New York later this summer.

"I could not have asked or wished for anything more - tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love."

Since her return at the ATX Open in Austin, Kvitova has lost six of her seven matches, with her only win coming in the first round in Rome. She also competed in Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid, the French Open and the Queen's Club Championships in London.</p>

Through all these years, I am so incredibly thankful for the unwavering support of my family, my closest friends, my team, and all the incredible fans that have always supported me around the world over all these years.” With her swinging leftie serve and ability to get forward, Kvitová's game is perfect for grass. Three years later she thrashed Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 to win her second title, having only dropped one set throughout. During matches like that, Kvitová appeared unbeatable — and the expectation was that she would win many more Grand Slams. Kvitová needed an emergency four-hour operation to repair damage to tendons and nerves in her left, playing hand and there were fears that she would never play again. She confounded expectations by returning five months later at the 2017 French Open, then reaching that year's U.S. Open quarterfinals as she worked her way back to the top of the sport. In January 2019, she lost a thrilling Australian Open final to Naomi Osaka, which was the closest she ever got to lifting a third Grand Slam title. Winning that match would also have made Kvitová the world No. Kvitová reached the semifinals at the following year's French Open, before going through a quieter period in which she didn't go beyond the fourth round of a major in three years. She will be given a warm farewell at this year's Wimbledon, where she is the only multiple women's champion other than the Williams sisters since 1996.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is a stacked today of tennis action today with Carlos Alcaraz and Jacob Fearnley both in action at Queen's. Alcaraz faces an all-Spanish clash against Jaume Munar, while rising British star Fearnley is up against Corentin Moutet. Both matches will take place inside the Andy Murray Arena. Fans will also be eagerly anticipating Arthur Rinderkneck's return to action. A lucky loser, the 29-year-old Frenchman stunned world No. Whether or not Rinderkneck can pull of another surprise remains to be seen. You can follow all the day's latest tennis news LIVE, below... You can check out at any time. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. Jannik Sinner has been upset by Alexander Bublik and crashed out of the Halle Open. 1 was defending champion but went down 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 as Bublik reached the quarter-finals. Sinner had not lost to any player, aside from Carlos Alcaraz, since August before today. Jacob Fearnley has spoken out after Corentin Moutet was left furious during their clash, which saw the Frenchman label the umpire as ‘crazy' in a fit of rage. Moutet was left unhappy by how he was given a time violation and that the official had spoken throughout his match. Asked about whether he felt it was difficult to keep his cool during Moutet's outbursts, Fearnley explained: “Yeah, no, I mean, it can be tricky, but I played Corentin before, and yeah, I kind of know that's what he's going to do. And once it happened, I'd already kind of prepared for it and I could just move on from there.And also, it helps that I was kind of up in the score. Carlos Alcaraz has booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a hard-fought victory over Jaume Munar at the Andy Murray Arena. The 22-year-old was forced to dig very deep to secure the victory, but he ultimately prevailed with an impressive series of shots late on. With Carlos Alcaraz's clash with Jaume Munar taking a while now at the Andy Murray Arena, there has been a schedule change. Reilly Opelka will now face Arthur Rinderknech on Court 1, rather than after this clash of the Spaniards - which will therefore be the last match on the Andy Murray Arena today. “I always find the British heat completely different to anything else. I'm not entirely sure why that is. I was really pleased with myself today. Coco Gauff has lost her first match since winning the French Open, going out of Berlin to Wang Xinyu. 49, secured the best win of her career in a 6-3 6-3 victory. Jacob Fearnley could not hide his delight after reaching the quarter-finals at Queen's with a three-set victory over Corentin Moutet. "I'm very happy to be in my first quarter-final, it's even better to do it here in the UK," he said. It's really special to have everyone here and watch me play on this stage." Katie Boulter is into the quarter-finals at Nottingham after defeating fellow Brit Sonay Kartal. And after the match, Boulter had some very kind words to say about her opponent, insisting that Kartal has a bright future. "She is such a tough competitor, she's gunna be back here playing many more matches" \ud83c\udfa4Nice words from @katiecboulter on Sonay Kartal after an epic in Nottingham pic.twitter.com/c9JkJJ161J Jacob Fearnley is into the quarter-finals at Queen's after a 6-3 2-6 6-2 victory over Corentin Moutet. His opponent launched into a fiery outburst in the final stages of the match, calling the umpire "crazy" after being given a time violation and losing his serve. Corentin Moutet was subjected to a chorus of boos at Queen's for his reaction to being broken by Jacob Fearnley. The crowd, already on Fearnley's side, further showed their disdain towards Moutet and sent a barrage of boos in his direction. Jacob Fearnley has been taken to a third set inside the Andy Murray Arena. Aryna Sabalenka has finally won her Berlin Open match - which started yesterday. Several stars have recently opened up on abuse they receive online, including British star Katie Boulter. And now Alcaraz has revealed: “I receive them too. “I'm not going to mention exactly some of the messages I've received, but they are very heavy and some even scare you. I prefer not to think about it.” Up next in the Andy Murray Arena is Jacob Fearnley vs Corentin Moutet. Jiri Lehecka has taken the first set in his Queen's match against Gabriel Diallo. Action at Queen's is close to commencing. Carlos Alcaraz and Jacob Fearnley are due on court later today. Jannik Sinner insists he does not take any notice of the rankings despite crossing a milestone. 3 is the result of what you work on, on a yearly basis,” Sinner told the ATP Tour's media team. “You have to be very consistent, and my results have been amazing since last year until now, so we will try to push in that direction as long as we can. Of course, the result matters, but it's quite relevant for me. I do enjoy being in this position.” Carlos Alcaraz says Emma Raducanu will be his ‘boss' at the US Open. The duo are set to team up in a high-profile mixed doubles competition. "She's going be the boss," joked Alcaraz. "I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. I made that special request [but] she took a while. I have really good relationship with her. We are going to enjoy it, for sure. Murray said in a Q&A with fans in Glasgow: “We had a chat on the phone and he asked me if I would consider coaching him, which I wasn't expecting. I think it was a pretty unique opportunity. Boris Becker has not been hired by Wimbledon's broadcast rights holders despite being allowed to return to the UK. However, the corporation have decided against hiring him for this year's Wimbledon. Jack Draper overcame a series of errors to edge into the Queen's quarter-finals. Draper will face American Brandon Nakashima in the last-eight tomorrow. A man who was given a restraining order for stalking Emma Raducanu attempted to buy Wimbledon tickets, according to Sky News. His name had been black-listed and was red-flagged by the tournament's security system. Raducanu had been aware of the man's presence during previous tournaments in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha before she spotted him “fixated” in the stands during her second-round match at the Dubai Championships. A spectator at the Halle Open was taken to hospital last night. The individual was struck by a falling advertising hoarding during Alexander Zverev's match against Marcus Giron. However, the woman, said to be aged 62, did not suffer any major injuries. "There has never been anything like this in our 32-year tournament history. We deeply regret the incident," said tournament director Ralf Weber. Weber also promised the woman a free season ticket for next year's event. "We suspect that the drumming against the boards caused screws to come loose," event managers Dr Udo Kleine and Uwe Greipel-Dominik said in a joint statement. "This must not happen and we apologise. Jack Draper has responded to Emma Raducanu pairing up with Carlos Alcaraz at the US Open. Draper, who will play alongside Qinwen Zheng, said: “Yeah, I mean, a wise person once told me you should find the best partner, and that's what she did in Alcaraz. I don't blame her at all for that. “I think she will have a lot of fun playing with Carlos. Saw that with Rafa Nadal at the Olympics. She's gone about and chosen the best partner, for sure. Of playing alongside Zheng, Draper added: "I think it's a good format for the players to get prepared for the US Open, having a shot at playing with another top players. After initial speculation that it was due to a lack of light, it later transpired that officials had called time on the day's play because of a slippery surface. Sabalenka was leading Rebeka Masarova 6-2 inside the Steffi Graf Stadion. I just played two games on that side.” Hello and welcome back to Express Sport's LIVE coverage of the day's tennis news. We'll have everything from Queen's, Berlin and beyond as players ramp up their preparations for Wimbledon. Holger Rune has booked his spot in the quarter-finals with a 2-6 6-1 6-1 victory over Mackenzie McDonald. Brandon Nakashima has spoken about his upcoming clash with Jack Draper in the quarter-finals at Queens. "He's a good friend of mine so it's going to be a fun match I'm looking forward to it." Although there were initial murmurings that play had been suspended in Berlin due to a lack of natural light, it now transpires that the reason for the suspension is actually the surface. I just played two games on that side” In contrast, Rebeka Masarova agreed with the decision. Sabalenka and Masarova\u2019s match in Berlin is stopped due to the court getting slippery. Aryna wanted to continue:\u201cYou\u2019re stopping the match because she said that side is slippery? Play has been suspended at the Berlin WTA 500 during Aryna Sabalenka's clash with Rebeka Masarova due to slippery conditions. The Brit has been comfortably beaten 5-7 6-7 (4-7) by Brandon Nakashima. Despite two tight sets, the American has prevailed in style to book his spot in the quarter-finals. Dan Evans, playing the first of his two scheduled matches today, has lost the first set to Brandon Nakashima. The American needed just one break to open a lead up against his British opponent, taking it 7-5 in a cagey opener. Jack Draper insists he is still getting used to the surface, having reached the Queen's quarter-finals with a three-set win over Alexei Popyrin. When asked if he was getting comfortable on British grass, he replied: "A little bit, not exactly in the first couple of sets it wasn't pretty at all. One more under the belt and I'll be back on Friday." Jack Draper has overcome a very tough test to reach the quarter-finals of Queen's. He dropped the first set to Alexei Popyrin but held his nerve to win 3-6 6-2 7-6(5) in a thrilling decider. Up next on Andy Murray Arena is Dan Evans against Brandon Nakashima, with Holger Rune versus Mackenzie McDonald to follow. @jackdraper0 \ud83d\udde3\ufe0fFighting back to reach the quarters at @QueensTennis \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25#HSBCChampionships pic.twitter.com/OCWPjTbJbL Jack Draper leads Alexei Popyrin 5-4, with his opponent serving to stay in the match. But this has been anything but easy, and it's anyone's guess as to who will end up on top. Those on Andy Murray Arena today have certainly got value for their money, with two more matches still to come. Jack Draper is a break up in the second set and appears to have settled into this contest on the Andy Murray Arena now. He was muttering "come on" repeatedly at the change of ends in frustration, before converting his first break point. And he has taken the second set 6-2. Alexei Popyrin has gone off for a break between sets. 1 has lost the first set in his Queen's last-16 clash against Alexei Popyrin 6-3, with the second currently poised at 2-2. But he has work to do on home turf... Tobias Tappeiner, a friend of Jannik Sinner who once beat the world No. 1, has died after a tragic car crash. 3 Alexander Zverev has cruised into the last 16 at Halle with a 6-2 6-1 victory against Marcos Giron. Russia's Karen Khachanov has joined him, beating Zizou Bergs 7-5 6-3. There's another shake-up in the men's doubles at Queen's! Alex de Minaur has unfortunately dropped out of the main draw due to a hip injury, so Alexei Popyrin withdraws with him. Lucky losers Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway will replace them, facing Taylor Fritz and Jiri Lehecka on Court 1 this afternoon. There has been a change to the schedule at Queen's! Lucky losers Daniel Evans and Henry Searle are in action against second seeds Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten this afternoon. That match will take place on Court 1 after Taylor Fritz and Jiri Lehecka vs Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur. Jack Draper has been handed a huge boost ahead of the Wimbledon draw, with a top-four seeding in the men's draw now within his grasp. 5 Taylor Fritz's first-round exit at Queen's has opened the door for Draper, British No. That outcome would mean he avoids a meeting with the world's three top-ranked stars, Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev, until the Wimbledon semi-finals. There are also four matches at Halle to sink your teeth into, including a former world No. Andy Roddick has backed Novak Djokovic to challenge for a 25th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon. 1 Jannik Sinner and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz lead the odds, but Roddick believes the Serb will be closer matched to the young duo than in any other major. He was in the finals last year, let's not forget that," Roddick explained. I think it's his best Slam to potentially get in a mix. I think he's closer to Sinner and Alcaraz, best-of-five format at Wimbledon as opposed to the other places." Nick Kyrgios has added to the backlash surrounding the US Open's new mixed doubles format by joining forces with Naomi Osaka. The shake-up has faced criticism from traditional doubles players, with Ellen Perez branding it "disrespectful". Novak Djokovic has revealed that he indirectly linked up with Roger Federer as he learned how to challenge for Grand Slams. When Djokovic lifted his first major at the 2008 Australian Open, Federer already boasted double digits. "Not everyone is cut out to compete at the top, and that's normal. Federer helped me a lot in that regard, not directly but indirectly," Djokovic told the (Ne)uspjeh Prvaka podcast. "I observed how he planned his schedule.

Under normal circumstances, they are spray-painted on with chalk in perfect right angles to make the 78-foot long court we all know and love — 27 feet wide at the singles sidelines and 36 feet wide including the doubles alleys. But how about doing it with a blindfold on? That was Jakub Mensik's task in the latest Lexus ATPHead2Head challenge, when he took on host Natalie Pike in London.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legendary tennis player John McEnroe favoured Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner to come out on top in a hypothetical scenario against Rafael Nadal at the French Open. However, McEnroe's claim was bluntly rejected by Naomi Osaka's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou. The 2025 Roland-Garros final was a long battle between Alcaraz and the Italian tennis sensation. Alcaraz, on the other hand, was a long-time favourite who was looking to defend his Roland-Garros championship. While Alcaraz dropped the first two sets, he came back to beat Sinner 4-6,6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), and 7-6(2). Mouratoglou rejected McEnroe's claim and shared why Nadal, who has won 14 French Open titles, will forever be at the top.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Murray has hinted at a frosty split with Novak Djokovic as the tennis legend was asked about his brief spell coaching the 24-time Grand Slam champion. Murray, who retired after the Olympic Games in Paris last year, was a shock appointment by Djokovic in November. The 38-year-old, however, struggled for wins on the ATP tour under Murray's coaching and a split was announced in May. Murray was asked about the experience as he began a four date theatre tour, which started at the SEC Armadillo in Glasgow on Wednesday. ‘We had a chat on the phone and he asked me if I would consider coaching him, which I wasn't expecting,' Murray said, as per The Times. ‘I think it was a pretty unique opportunity. The comment may have been another wry joke from Murray, who had broken the ice with his former on-court rival when they reunited for Rafael Nadal's farewell at the French Open. Djokovic had revealed how Murray had congratulated him after winning the Geneva Open just days after their split. ‘He did congratulate me, and he said, Now that you have a proper coach, you're winning tournaments,' Djokovic said. 'I was enjoying myself very much regardless of the fact that we haven't had maybe the success we both wanted or people expected us to have.' Despite his short time in Djokovic's camp, Murray revealed earlier this month he expects to coach again in the future. 'I would do it again at some stage, I don't think that will happen immediately,' Murray told the BBC. As an individual athlete, you have a team of people around you, but you're the focal point whereas when you're coaching an individual, you're working with a physio, physical trainers, agents, and you need to know how to get your message across to the player and find out what makes them tick. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court. 'We'll see about coaching in the future but I don't think that will happen for a while.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Naomi Broady has been keen to quash one story about the Queen's Club Championships which has proved plenty of people wrong. Offering a round-up of the women's event earlier this week, the former world number 76 was delighted by their return to these grounds after nearly 40 years. It marked a landmark moment for the event, who did take a risk in expanding it out over two weeks. However, Broady has emerged to assuage those fears. She sought to dispel this rumour though, speaking on Tennis Channel, instead suggesting that the women's tournament has only added to the preceding men's event. Broady claimed: ‘It's not and actually I think a lot of people were maybe expecting the men to say that they weren't happy about it, but I can report back that they don't mind at all. ‘We heard Dan Evans say earlier this week how, yes, and he was just saying how he really preferred the atmosphere. ‘So he said for sort of the women's quarterfinals, semifinals and finals day, there was a real buzz around the centre, because so many people were here on grounds passes or with the centre court tickets to watch the women, so they pop out and watch the men warm up and get their practices in too. ‘So whilst they're not kind of down to the dirt yet, they're not muddy, that top, fresh, slippery layer has been taken off, so the men are really happy to be here, in the atmosphere the women have brought in, and last week was a really successful tournament.' Laura Robson even admitted she was surprised at how well the Queen's courts have held up. Amidst growing claims that the grass-court season should have a Masters 1000 event, Queen's is doing a phenomenal job of reinforcing that case. If people and players continue to lobby for a grass-court Masters tournament, surely this London-based one will be top of the list for a well-earned upgrade.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner's coach reveals what the moments were like after his pupil's painful defeat against Alcaraz and does not completely rule out continuing to work with the Italian. 🎾 Jannik Sinner vs Alexander Bublik Sign up with Bet365 here Make your first deposit of at least €5 Go to the “Live” section and watch every match Days go by and in the minds of many tennis fans, that historic final at Roland Garros between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner still lingers. The Spaniard saved three match points and came back from two sets down to claim his second Roland Garros title, his fifth Grand Slam, leaving behind one of the best finals in recent years. It wasn't just the world number one who suffered a hard blow but also his team, among whom was Darren Cahill, his coach alongside Simone Vagnozzi. Jannik sat for twenty minutes without saying a word, and each of us hugged him. As a coach, I couldn't ask for more. It was a brilliant and serious tennis match, with great respect between the two players. It was a true honor to be there," he stated in remarks published by Ubitennis. Cahill delved into the feeling of disappointment that his pupil was experiencing and confessed that a defeat like that takes time to heal but can also be of help: "There was nothing to say. After all he had given on the court, it was right to leave him alone with his thoughts. You carry a match like that with you throughout your entire career, but it can become a turning point," he expressed. Proud of how his player fought until the end But the defense of his player didn't end there: "Jannik has an incredible work ethic, great resilience in moments of pressure, and knows how to handle it. He's a problem solver and likes to ask many questions. He keeps his feet on the ground, knows who he is as a person, and is very humble. He doesn't get too excited after a win and accepts losses with great respect. Additionally, the Australian had no doubt that Sinner would turn the page and praised his ability to bounce back from defeats: "He has a great self-awareness. He understands the importance of a tennis match, knows that you have to face victories and defeats more or less the same way. He has an amazing work ethic, resilience, a well-defined purpose. He has a different perspective: he knows his career could last a long time and invests accordingly. And that resilience, after Paris, will be tested; it doesn't matter if he wins or loses in the upcoming tournaments: the key will be how he reacts, how he keeps pushing forward," Cahill remarked. The next day, he had already changed his attitude. There are much more important things that have happened and will happen than winning or losing a tennis match,” Cahill concluded. It is worth mentioning that, despite the great level displayed in Rome and Paris, Sinner is coming off a three-month break due to the suspension agreement for his positive test for clostebol. We thought: 'let's hope he wins at least a couple of matches'. One of the amazing things about Jannik is that he always surprises us. He also disclosed the difficulties they faced in training during the suspension, which started on February 4th and ended on May 4th. "Finding courts and training partners during the suspension was very challenging. Everything had to be approved by the ITIA. In the end, we trained on a clay court provided by a sponsor, near Monte Carlo, but at that time, tennis was nearly secondary. The Australian confirmed earlier this year that this would be his last season, but despite rumors placing Carlos Moyà in the world number one's team for the next season, the Italian persists, both publicly and privately, for his coach to continue. Cahill is leaving the door open to continue. "He has 'persisted' quite a bit, let's say, but I enjoy it too much. At the end of 2025, I may retire; we talked about it, he mentioned it by mistake in a press conference in Melbourne. If I retire, it will be for his own good. Sometimes, having a fresh voice, new energy, can be good. I think a new coach wouldn't hurt him, so the plan is still to part ways at the end of the year; we still have many months ahead, we'll see...,” Cahill concluded, who is now less certain about quitting coaching Sinner, who, along with Alcaraz, will feature in many finals like those of Roland Garros.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Jodie Burrage arrived at Wimbledon in 2022, it seems unlikely that she expected to heroically provide some medical assistance. The Brit was making her second appearance at the All England Club following her debut outing a year beforehand. Burrage entered as one of seven wildcards alongside the legendary Serena Williams, a seven-time champion at Wimbledon. A first round match against Ukrainian star Lesia Tsurenko awaited on Court 18 as the 135th edition of the tournament got underway. Tsurenko won the first set 6-2 and started strongly in the second by leading 15-0 during her opponent's serve. Burrage had the ball in hand ahead of her second serve but wasn't quick to resume the action in search of a comeback. One of the ball boys positioned behind her didn't appear to feel too well and had to sit down on a nearby chair. She then grabbed something from her bag, which later appeared to be an energy gel that's commonly used by tennis players. Soon enough, a member of the crowd also jumped to his aid with a bag of the popular Percy Pigs from Marks & Spencer. Burrage held the packet open in her hand and offered them to the poorly ball boy. Play was paused for around ten minutes as a result of the worrying scenes in SW19. However, Burrage and two officials helped him rise from his chair and slowly walk alongside the court before being taken out to recover. Burrage went on to lose 6-2 6-3 to Tsurenko but it's a match that will be remembered for her heroism. "It was quite distressing to see so we went to get some Gatorade and gel," Burrage added. "It didn't affect me too much, I actually came out and hit a great serve, probably the best serve I hit in that match after that, so if anything it helped me. I actually had a panic attack once in juniors here so I've been where he is. I kind of know how he was feeling and just tried to help as much as I could." Her friend Laura Middleton also said: "He was wilting and his glasses were off as well. Tsurenko handed over some sweets or gummies for him to eat as well. It seemed a little while before somebody came to get him. "It felt like longer because we were distressed for him, because it didn't look like he was going to get back on his feet without help." Burrage returned to Wimbledon in 2023 and beat Caty McNally to reach the second round, but didn't not feature last year. © 2025 talkSPORT Limited Registered in England No. Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, SE1 9GF talkSPORT is a registered trade mark of Wireless Group Media (GB) Limited.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A campaign group fighting plans to expand the home of Wimbledon tennis has raised £200,000 for an upcoming judicial review. Plans were approved last September for the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) - which runs the world-famous tournament - to build 39 tennis courts and an 8,000-seat stadium on protected open land on Wimbledon Park. AELTC, which owns the land, argues its development will open up a part of the park that it says was "inaccessible to the public for almost a century" however Save Wimbledon Park has concerns around the environmental impact. AELTC leased the land to a private golf club until 2018. Currently, those matches take place about three-and-a-half miles (5.6km) away at Roehampton's Community Sports Centre. That site can cater for about 2,000 spectators a day, whereas the new development could host up to 10,000 meaning the grounds as a whole could see up to 50,000 visitors per day. Plans to expand the site were first put forward in December 2018, when the AELTC – which already owned the land – paid £65m to buy out the remainder of Wimbledon Park Golf Club's lease which had been set to run until 2041. In 2021, a planning application for the scheme was sent to both Merton and Wandsworth councils. "We have massive public support, who really want us to fight this," said Christopher Coombe from Save Wimbledon Park. "The Supreme Court has now made it clear that local authorities need to look after public land like this and do the right thing, in the right way. He added: "We all love the tennis. They do a great job across the road - they don't need to be here as well. We have had 22,000 petitioners, 1,100 separate donations to our fighting fund and serious local support from all the councillors and the MPs." "When the court assesses them, they'll be able to see the due diligence we've gone through," she said. AELTC said it recently conducted a survey of about 10,000 residents in Merton and Wandsworth which found support had increased from 50% to 62% in the last six months. It said the strongest support was among residents aged under 44, with 74% in this group in favour of the plans. The strongest reasons cited for supporting the project was its "commitment to protecting and enhancing local green spaces", it added. But many are concerned the project would cause an increase in flood risk as well as the loss of wildlife, trees and open spaces. "If the plans go through, there is still the possibility this entire 73 acres would be dug up to a depth between one and nine metres, 300 trees would be felled, 500 further trees uprooted, releasing 500,000kg of carbon into the atmosphere," said Susan Cusack from Save Wimbledon Park. "Every single grass tennis court takes 105 tonnes of concrete and eight millimeters of heavily pesticised grass on top. It's about 5% organic material, so the only "green" thing about a tennis court is the colour." Simon Wright, also a member of Save Wimbledon Park, said: "We are looking at about 44,000 lorry movements over eight to 10 years. The results on air quality are going to be disastrous. "We've already done the work that shows the routes the lorries will take will be going past primary schools and nurseries at a time when we are much more aware of how air pollution affects young lungs." But Ms Jevans said that they would be "bringing a lot of the equipment necessary on site, so there is less back and forth - there are more 493 buses going up and down the road than there will be lorries." The AELTC made a covenant - a formal agreement - when they bought the land in Wimbledon Park in 1993 that they would not build on it. Ms Jevans insists that covenant should not prevent their planned development. "A covenant is fundamentally to protect the public interest and what we are now doing is very much in the public interest," said Ms Jevans. AELTC are trying to build on Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), that is the same as green belt. "If they are allowed to build, that sets a really bad precedent for the other 50 MOL sites in the London area." "AELTC are talking about creating a new park, but the majority of this land is going to be permissive access. We think it's wrong that a private members' club is allowed to have such a negative effect on so many people's lives for two weeks a year." She added: "I don't dismiss people's concerns and respect their point of view. I want to ensure the basis of their concerns is based on facts." Aside from the judicial review, a separate court case is scheduled for January which will determine whether the land is protected by a statutory trust for public recreation. The court action has been brought by AELTC which believes no such protection exists. If the court finds against them it's unlikely they could proceed with their current plans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian Open champion Jan Zielinski has hit out at the US Open's revamped mixed doubles tournament after the initial entry list was revealed this week. Women's No.1 Aryna Sabalenka has linked up with men's No.19 Grigor Dimitrov. Nick Kyrgios has also been tempted by the controversial format, signing up with two-time singles champion Naomi Osaka. Men's No.9 Holger Rune and women's No.2 Coco Gauff are the current top-10 players not to have entered so far, nor have Australian No.1s Alex de Minaur and Daria Kasatkina — the entry window closes on July 28. Polish doubles specialist Zielinski, who last year won the Australian Open and Wimbledon with Hsieh Su-wei, was left fuming after not getting an invite. “I guess winning two grand slams in mixed doubles in one year is not enough to get an invitation to US Open ‘exhibition' event,” he tweeted. The revamped format was previously criticised by Australian doubles star Ellen Perez and defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, who have entered but will need a wildcard given their singles rankings. “Tell us that you think doubles players are trash, that tradition is overrated and job opportunity is a thing of the past without actually saying it,” Perez, a players' council representative, posted on X at the time of announcement. Errani and Vavassori said the changes were a “profound injustice” that disrespects doubles players, describing the new event as a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show”. “Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,” they added. The final would be played to six games but still with no-advantage scoring and a 10-point match tiebreaker. “Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” US Tennis Association CEO Lew Sherr said. “It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”</p>

Wake Forest's Stefan Dostanic and Stanford's Valerie Glozman capped their standout NCAA tennis seasons by earning 2025 US Open wild cards Wednesday at the USTA National Campus in Orlando, Fla. By winning the American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs without dropping a set in men's and women's singles, respectively, both champions booked their Grand Slam debuts in the New York main draw. 404, capped his college career by beating Michigan State's Ozan Baris and Columbia's Michael Zheng, the reigning NCAA singles champion, in the four-player shootout. 944 Glozman, who just finished her freshman year, was seeded fourth and battled past UC Santa Barbara's Amelia Honer and Texas A&M's Mary Stoiana. Zheng and Stoiana are also headed to New York, with the finalists receiving US Open qualifying wild cards for their efforts in Lake Nona. Read more about the American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs For Dostanic, who won the NCAA team title with Wake Forest last month, the US Open wild card brings a close to what he called a "roller coaster college career" that began in 2019 at USC. "It feels surreal," the 23-year-old said, looking ahead to his US Open debut. Everyone wants to play in the US Open as an American. After a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Baris in Monday's opening round, Dostanic punched his ticket to New York with a 6-1, 6-4 win against Zheng on Wednesday. Two weeks earlier, Dostanic beat Zheng, 7-6(3), 6-4, at an USTA Pro Circuit and ATP Challenger Tour event in Tyler, Texas. "It was nerve-wracking for sure," he said. A lot of people are going to be watching, so [I'm] getting used to it a little bit. Glozman has already experienced the US Open Qualifying Tournament three times, reaching the second round each of the past three years dating back to when she was 15. I'm really grateful that the hard work paid off." "The level is super high at the US Open, so I have to put it all out there and it really pushes me to the next level," explained the 5-foot-4 product of Bellevue, Wash. "It exposes a lot of my weaknesses, so I'm able to work on them in practice, and now that I'm in college, work on them throughout the season." Glozman was an NCAA singles quarterfinalist in the fall and received ITA All-American and ACC Freshman of the Year honors for her freshman season at Stanford. Dostanic, who did not play college tennis in the fall, was named Most Outstanding Player at the 2025 NCAA team tournament after going a perfect 5-0 at No. 1 singles to help Wake Forest claim its second Division I title. The American Collegiate Player Wild Card Playoffs will conclude Thursday with the men's and women's doubles finals.</p>
