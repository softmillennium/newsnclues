                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts believe the modified stalagmites are evidence of a planned occupation of the caves by ancient societies. Located in Millares, Cova Dones may have just jumped to the forefront of prehistoric underground discussions, but answers may be hard to come by. The archaeological team identified more than 100 speleofacts coming from the fracture, displacement, or regrouping of stalagmites to form structures. Experts believe this is “convincing evidence of the planned occupation of the underground environment by prehistoric societies.” Still, some of the patterning of the recreated forms leaves questions as to their purpose, whether ritual or instead related to site planning by forming boundaries. Key animals shown in the graphics included horses, deer, aurochs, and a stag. Shortly after the rock art finding, the existence of a 1,900-year-old Roman sanctuary was revealed in a room roughly 650 feet from the entrance of the cave, with a set of inscriptions and a coin of Emperor Claudius.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Humpback whales are known for their extensive use of bubbles—from powerful, aggressive bursts that prove their prowess during courtship to the bubble-net “curtains” they produce to round up prey in a spectacle that often draws tourists from around the world. Now a new study published in Marine Mammal Science explores rare instances when humpbacks (Megaptera novaeangliae) create dramatic, doughnut-shaped vortex bubbles that look like a rolling underwater smoke ring.

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, and their colleagues at other institutions—including the SETI Institute, which is known for focusing on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) but is also interested in nonhuman intelligences on Earth—were looking for examples of whales' general bubble behavior when they uncovered a striking video taken by videographer Dan Knaub in 1988. “We were just gobsmacked—like, ‘What the hell is going on? “For a team that's interested in assisting astrobiologists parse unusual signals coming from deep space, it just fell real neatly into our paradigm.... Study co-author Jodi Frediani, a wildlife photographer who is also at U.C. With this phenomenon on her mind, she says, “I went, ‘Gee, there's a bubble ring! “It's a really fun paper,” says Syracuse University biologist Susan E. Parks, who studies bubble-net feeding in humpbacks and wasn't involved in the new study. “It reads like a detective story that's trying to piece together information about something that's not widely studied and happens rarely.” Parks hasn't observed any bubble rings herself—as far as she knows, she says, “I may have seen them before and never really thought anything of them.” Despite compiling so many examples of the rings, Sharpe still doesn't know what to think about their purpose. “My guess is that this is what it's going to feel like when we first make contact with aliens,” he says. One whale would blow a bubble ring and then swim through it or “do a spy hop right through the middle of it,” Frediani says—when performing such a spy hop, the whale would peep its head vertically above the surface, right through the bubble ring. “We need the entire human brain trust's help deciphering this. It's almost like [the whales'] blowhole is a mouth, and the symbols coming out are bubbles, as opposed to sounds.” —Fred Sharpe University of California, Davis Could the whales be trying to communicate with us? Sharpe doesn't rule this out as a possibility. “This may be a species-atypical signal that's crafted for people,” he says, “whales reaching out to humans ... using their own parlance, their own form of communication.” Parks thinks it's plausible that the animals are putting on a display for humans, but she adds that it's too soon to tell with such a small sample size. Because most of the observations were made by people, this could skew the data, she notes, although there were “two observations from planes, so we know [the whales] do produce them [bubble rings] when people aren't present, too.” Now that more researchers know to look for these bubble rings, Parks says, reported sightings may greatly increase. With more data, Sharpe and his colleagues hope to figure out what the purpose of these swirling doughnuts of air is—and whether the rings could possibly contain information. “We need the entire human brain trust's help deciphering this,” Sharpe says. Sharpe hopes footage from the study will help people feel connected with whales and make them want to protect the animals from human threats such as ship strikes, entanglement, noise and chemical pollution, habitat loss and disruption of the food web.

Systematic reviews are important because they can make sense of many academic studies such as clinical trials by combining their results. It involves searching academic databases to find potentially thousands of relevant studies, screening them to pull out the handful of most pertinent ones, assessing if they could be biased or untrustworthy, and extracting and analysing the data, often using a statistical technique called a metanalysis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team of cognitive psychologists from the Michigan State University Department of Psychology have received a $860,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research to develop assessments for identifying people who are good at performing complex procedural tasks, even under challenging conditions like sleep deprivation and frequent interruptions. This is important because Navy personnel are increasingly called upon to do lots of different tasks as military systems become more complex," said Erik Altmann, lead investigator of the study and professor in MSU's psychology department. This multiyear study will look at individual differences in placekeeping, which is the cognitive ability to remember what step you are on in a procedural sequence. The researchers will also test whether incorporating task interruptions during training can help personnel develop cognitive strategies for placekeeping during deployment, when personnel may be sleep-deprived. Procedural errors can be catastrophic, so the Navy is interested in reducing them," said Altmann. The research team, which also includes cognitive psychologists Kimberly Fenn and Zach Hambrick, has been funded since 2016 by the Office of Naval Research, with past studies looking at multitasking and the effect of sleep on cognitive performance. The results of this study could improve personnel selection and classification in the Navy and in other fields where procedural accuracy is critical; results also could suggest approaches to training that make people more resilient to effects of stressors like sleep deprivation and task interruption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. The Earth is home to incredibly remarkable and diverse biomes that host millions of species worldwide. (George Lucas managed to create an entire galaxy far, far away for Star Wars using just the natural wonders mostly found in the state of California.) Although life appears relatively well-distributed across countries and continents—barring Antarctica, of course—a new study suggests that biodiversity isn't so much an evenly distributed blanket across the planet as it is a “core-to-transition” organization. However, what they discovered is that life all around the world proliferates through a very similar process. First, there is a core area where life appears to flourish, and from there, species tend to radiate outward—hence “core-to-transition” organization. “From that core, species expand into surrounding areas, but only a subset manages to persist. It seems these cores provide optimal conditions for species survival and diversification, acting as a source from which biodiversity radiates outward.” These “core” regions are immensely important, as they only cover about 30 percent of the world's surface but contain more biodiversity than the other 70 percent. These regions likely evolved because they were originally refuges from the devistation brought on by past climatic events, such as the Last Glacial Maximum. The study also shows that overall species must be well adapted for heat and drought to colonize new areas beyond these core bioregions. “The predictability of the pattern and its association with environmental filters can help to better understand how biodiversity may respond to global change,” Joaquín Calatayud, co-author of the study from  Rey Juan Carlos University, said in a press statement. Of course, this core-to-transition organization idea isn't a new one. Biogeographers have largely illustrated this phenomenon over the centuries, but this is the first time that empirical evidence has confirmed these long-standing suspicions. Understanding the relationship between life and these bioregions can help inform conservation decisions while predicting how certain species may respond to a new type of climatic uncertainty—anthropogenic climate change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fossils are amazing; not only can they spark inspiration for iconic movie franchises (I'm looking at you, Jurassic Park), but they more importantly also provide accurate timestamps that help researchers piece together history from across millennia. Researchers from the University of Glasgow found modern society's detritus, including things like soda tabs, cemented inside a new form of rock. Researchers realized this when they were studying slag deposits—or byproducts from industrial production—at Derwent Howe in West Cumbria. Using methods including electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy (chemical analysis), the team determined the slag is made of “natural cements” like calcite, goethite, and brucite. Researchers were able to pinpoint just how rapid this new rock formation is by using the “anthropogenic material”—or, more simply put, modern junk—they found hiding inside the rock. “We found both a King George V coin from 1934 and an aluminium can tab with a design that we realised couldn't have been manufactured before 1989 embedded in the material,” John MacDonald, co-author of the study, explained in a press release. “This gives us a maximum time frame of 35 years for this rock formation, well within the course of a single human lifetime.” “This is an example in microcosm of how all the activity we're undertaking at the Earth's surface will eventually end up in the geological record as rock,” MacDonald continued, “but this process is happening with remarkable, unprecedented speed.” The study suggests that we don't have as much time to dispose of loose waste material as we previously believed—and it only gets worse after it hardens. According to experts, excess anthropoclastic rocks could affect life both above and below the water's surface, especially as coastal ecosystems change with rising sea levels. “What's remarkable here is that we've found these human-made materials being incorporated into natural systems and becoming lithified—essentially turning into rock—over the course of decades instead,” co-author Amanda Owen said in the release. “It challenges our understanding of how a rock is formed, and suggests that the waste material we've produced in creating the modern world is going to have an irreversible impact on our future.” The team explained in the release that the effects of anthropoclastic rock aren't currently included in models of erosion and land management, which are crucial parts of combating climate change.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geely, a Chinese automaker, claims that the use of AI algorithms in its hybrid system could extend their battery pack's lifespan by up to 15 percent. Somewhat unsurprisingly, Geely is pretty tight-lipped about how its Leishen AI Hybrid 2.0 system leverages AI to produce such a significant increase in efficiency. Thankfully, many other components contribute to Geely's astronomical thermal efficiency figure, including seven friction-reduction technologies, a variable displacement oil pump, and optimized intelligent thermal management. BYD, one of Geely's biggest competitors in the Chinese automotive industry, is currently only able to reach 46.06% efficiency with its DM-i system. For context, this thermal efficiency number means that BYD's system can only manage to eke out 6.4 L/100 km of  fuel consumption—just under 36.7 mpg. It's clear that Geely is on top when it comes to overall efficiency, but obviously, there are a number of other metrics we could use to compare the two automakers. BYD's Han DM plug-in hybrid starts at just above $31,400 USD, while Geely's Galaxy A7—potentially its first production car to feature the new technology—is expected to have a much more reasonable MSRP of around $14,000. Other competitors in the Chinese automotive industry include NIO, XPeng, Li Auto, and even Tesla. Geely's Galaxy M9 SUV will be another of the brand's vehicles to use their latest and greatest hybrid system. While hydrogen is much less accessible than gasoline, it could potentially boost the engine's thermal efficiency from 47.26 % to 48.15 %.

(2025)Cite this article Solution-processed metal oxide (MO) thin-film transistors present substantial promise for next-generation large-area, low-cost electronics. However, challenges like prolonged high-temperature annealing (at >400 °C) and a lack of universal, high-resolution printing technology hinder their widespread applications. Here we report a processing technology, termed ‘plasmonic printing', for fabricating high-performance, solution-processed all-MO thin-film electronics under room temperature and ambient conditions. This process leverages femtosecond-laser-excited silver nanowires to induce plasmonic local heating, facilitating rapid (<0.3 s) and localized conversion of MO precursors into high-quality MO thin films, including conductor, dielectric and semiconductor. Remarkably, these MO thin films exhibit superior electrical performance without the requirement of special gases or high-temperature treatment, thereby enhancing the fabrication efficiency. Furthermore, precise pattern control is demonstrated, enabling the fabrication of high-density, solution-processed all-MO transistor arrays (48,400 transistors per square centimetre) and integrated logic gates with uniformity and precision. This technology presents a promising pathway for the cost-effective and high-throughput printing of high-density, complex, multilayered solution-processed MO electronics, delivering performance on par with vacuum-based counterparts.

Many countries worldwide are transitioning from fossil fuel-dependent economies to carbon neutrality, driven by the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement. However, without considering the regional distribution of essential services like water and energy, this transition could inadvertently maintain or increase inequities, threatening sustainable development. Here, we argue that spatial equity of benefits should be considered in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector interdependencies and high service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan for regionally equitable climate-compatible futures. The multisector design framework combines integrated river basin-power system simulation with artificial intelligence design tools. The utility of the framework is demonstrated for Ghana by identifying the most efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios and their implied trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance. Case-study results show that an equitable low-carbon energy transition will require increased investments in renewable energy and transmission alongside more informed infrastructure system planning. With low renewable investments, equity can be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and electricity supply curtailments. Reducing socio-economic inequalities is integral to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)1,2. For instance, SDG 10 aims to reduce inequalities within and among countries1, and other goals stress equitable development globally1,2. However, more than 70% of the global population is experiencing growing socio-economic inequalities3, hindering progress towards sustainable development. Nearly 650 million people in the world still live in extreme poverty4, and around 30% of the global population is food insecure5. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, and the rising cost of living disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable people, who often have limited or no access to essential services3,4,6. Several countries are transitioning from fossil fuel-driven economies to carbon neutrality to deliver on the SDGs1 and the Paris Agreement7, intending to limit global mean temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, meeting the SDGs and mitigating climate change without considering broader socio-economic implications of interventions could exacerbate inequalities8. For instance, climate mitigation actions are expected to yield long-term benefits across multiple SDGs9,10 but might have short-term trade-offs with other goals, like poverty reduction and inequality10,11. Inadequate planning for energy transitions could increase inequalities12,13,14,15,16,17, for example in access to water and electricity. Realising the SDGs is challenged by the complexity of involving multiple disciplines, sectors, and actors in decision-making18,19. Policy decisions aimed at achieving individual SDGs could create trade-offs with other SDGs9, and thus, policymakers should aim for an energy transition that creates synergies and balances trade-offs between societal goals20,21. Increased access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is required to achieve the SDGs1,20,22. Electrification improves the quality of life and enables human development through better-equipped facilities for healthcare, education, and business17,22,23. However, over 700 million people globally do not have access to electricity, of whom more than 75% live in sub-Saharan Africa4,24. A renewables-based energy transition can help increase access to affordable and clean energy to meet the fast-growing energy demand and mitigate climate change4,24,25,26. Most countries included renewable energy targets in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)27,28,29. The renewable share of electricity generation rose by almost 8% between 2011 and 2021, and reached an installed capacity of 3146 gigawatts (GW), which accounts for 28% of the world's energy generation27. However, recent reports by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and REN21 suggest that the share of renewables in electricity generation must increase to more than 60% to achieve energy and climate goals by 203026,27. Energy transitions can produce regional disparities in renewable energy access and job creation in developed countries12,13,14,15,30. Strategic regional planning can help avoid these inequalities while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many developing countries (those eligible for Official Development Assistance under the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)31) currently have high levels of disparities in (water and electricity) service provision. Planning low-carbon energy transitions in developing countries offers an opportunity to reduce these inequalities. The aspiration to consider equity in energy transitions is reflected in the recovery packages for recent global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rising energy costs, and inflation28,32. The African Union Green Recovery Action Plan aims to build more equitable, greener, and sustainable economies33. The USA Inflation Reduction Act34 includes a US$ (US dollars) 370 billion fund for renewable energy, climate crisis, and equity, and the Build Back Better plan35,36 aims to invest US$ 2 trillion in green and inclusive growth, including US$ 400 billion for clean energy and 40% of investment benefits for communities that are marginalised and underserved by infrastructure services37. Energy systems are typically embedded within complex water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) systems, in which actions in one part of the system impact the others. Jointly managing these resources allows consideration of their cross-sectoral interdependencies, trade-offs, and synergies, and subsequently, the development of more sustainable infrastructure development pathways. So far, research has assessed distributional equity in the context of individual sectors. For instance, in the power sector, power system models have been used to assess the trade-offs between least-cost and regionally equitable allocation of solar and wind power plants in Germany15 and that of decentralised renewable energy sources in Switzerland14. Others considered electrification inequality in planning national power systems in sub-Saharan Africa16,17. A few studies evaluated inequality in access to water resources38,39,40. However, despite frequently high levels of co-dependence between resource systems, to our knowledge, equity has not been considered in designing multisector infrastructure systems to reduce regional benefit distribution inequities and carbon emissions while improving overall system performance and alleviating inter-sectoral conflicts across multiple resource systems. In this paper, we argue for considering spatial equity of water and energy services in planning low-carbon energy transitions, especially in developing countries with multisector linkages and service disparities between regions. We propose an analytical framework that can help analysts and policymakers plan national-scale equitable climate-compatible futures. The framework combines interlinked water resource and power systems simulators with artificial intelligence design tools. We demonstrate the framework using a case study of planning Ghana's future water-energy system for 2030-2040, identifying infrastructure intervention portfolios with efficient trade-offs between spatial equity in water and energy service provision, carbon emissions, food production, and river ecosystem performance. Classically, energy infrastructure planning considers goals such as minimising electricity supply curtailment, capital investment, and carbon emissions41,42. Other approaches extend the goals to include water resources and ecosystems, such as maximising hydropower generation and minimising damage to river ecosystems43,44. While such methods can design infrastructure plans that improve system performance at an aggregate level, equity in the regional distribution of water and energy services has not been considered to our knowledge. In this paper, we build on a water resource and power system simulation and design framework introduced by ref. 43 and extend it to include spatial equity of water and energy services as infrastructure planning goals. 1) has three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective planning to design equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning. The framework includes three components: (1) identifying low-carbon energy transition goals for infrastructure planning with equity and carbon emissions as key drivers, and selecting infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies; (2) integrated water-energy system simulation coupled with artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search for equitable energy transition intervention portfolios; and (3) inclusive screening and deliberation of the best set of plans assisted by machine learning. In the first component of the design framework, equity in regional benefit distribution is added as a policy objective of infrastructure planning, alongside other goals. We use the Gini index to quantify and minimise water and electricity access inequities. The Gini index is typically used to measure inequalities – ranging from zero (perfect equality) to one (total inequality). Our application of the index is designed to account for equity. For water supply, we apply the Gini index to water supplied relative to demand. For electricity supply, since some areas have lower electricity demand due to regional disparities in economic development, if the ratio of supply to demand were used, it would easily be satisfied. Instead, we apply the Gini index to electricity supplied per capita. While this does not account for inevitable variations in regional economic activities and lifestyles, it makes the most of available model outputs and allows incorporating a spatial measure of energy service equity into the framework. Intervention options that can be used to achieve the identified equity, environmental, and system performance goals are also selected in the first component of the framework. These interventions include infrastructure assets and resource allocation policies. The selected interventions are used in the second component of the framework to generate a set of efficient multisector infrastructure and operation portfolios using a simulation-based artificial intelligence search design process. In the second component of the framework, an integrated river basin-power system simulator is used to represent spatial WEFE nexus dynamics43. The river system is modelled using a water resource system model45,46. The river system model represents water resources infrastructure (e.g., dams) using a network structure driven by water supplies (hydrological inflows) and demands (e.g., municipal and irrigation water requirements and hydropower) and system operating rules. The power system is modelled using a direct current optimal power flow model47. The power system model simulates network connectivity, different power generation types including renewable energy generators, and high time resolution electricity demand profiles. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented simulation framework48. This framework integrates the simulators at the model run timestep and coordinates their inputs and outputs to form a single simulation. The integrated WEFE infrastructure system simulator simulates managed rivers (with river inflows, existing and planned water storage reservoirs, hydropower, municipal water supply abstractions, irrigation, and flood recession agriculture) and energy systems (solar power, combined solar and storage, wind power, bioenergy, thermal power generators, electricity transmission lines, and electricity demands). The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to identify efficient intervention portfolios43. In the third component of the framework, machine learning models, trained based on the search outputs (i.e., values of decision variables and objectives), are combined with the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)49 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity, environmental, and system performance indicators. The SHAP analysis of intervention options helps stakeholders explore how changing infrastructure and resource allocation policy options influences intervention portfolios. Further details on the analytical framework are given in the Methods. We use Ghana as a case study to demonstrate the importance of considering the spatial equity of water and energy services in designing equitable low-carbon futures. We use the framework above to design efficient power system intervention portfolios, including bioenergy, intermittent renewables (solar and wind), solar storage, and transmission lines, using projected electricity demands for 2030-2040. Figure 2 shows the regions of Ghana defined based on equally sized population groups. These regions are used to quantify spatial equity in water and energy access and to locate the energy infrastructure expansion options currently listed in Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. The electricity mix of Ghana comes from hydro (47%), gas (30%), and oil (23%)51. The installed capacity for existing hydropower is 1,580 megawatts (MW). The Pwalugu multi-purpose dam is under construction and will add an electricity generation capacity of 59 MW. The country's total thermal power installed capacity is 4325 MW50. Ghana had an electricity access rate of around 85% in 202124. However, some challenges still exist, including power outages52 (called Dumsor in Ghana, which means “off and on”), low electricity access rates in the Northeast and Northwest regions50, high electrical transmission losses (approximately 20%50), and a high per capita energy-related carbon emission rate compared with other sub-Saharan African countries51. The government of Ghana aims to increase renewables in the power generation mix to 1363 MW53 and achieve a 45% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to business-as-usual levels54,55. 1 shows Ghana's national power system transmission network and existing and planned water-energy infrastructure. Supplementary Table 1 provides the type and number of nodes in the Ghana multisector infrastructure system model. a–c Ghana's power system infrastructure expansion is considered in the design process. d The regions of Ghana are defined based on equally sized populations (to quantify the electricity access Gini index). The irrigation and municipal water supply Gini indices are calculated between the northern (Northeast, Northwest, and Ashanti) and southern regions (Lower Southeast, Upper Southeast, and Southwest) due to the limited spatial data of nodes of irrigation and municipal water demands. The bar and segment colours in (a) and (b) correspond to the regions with the same colours in (d). The map in (d) is based on data from Ghana Statistical Services (GSS).

The design formulation for Ghana includes minimising the electricity access Gini index, carbon emissions from generation, electricity supply curtailment, irrigation water supply Gini index, power system capital and operating costs, and maximising agriculture yields and flood recession agriculture benefits (eight objectives). The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including infrastructure expansion (solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines), operating rules for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and electricity and irrigation water allocation policies. Figure 3a shows a parallel coordinates plot of the efficient infrastructure and operation portfolios produced for Ghana using the framework. Selected portfolios are indicated as thick coloured lines. The “baseline” has high values of Gini coefficients for energy and irrigation water, carbon emissions, and load curtailment compared to the selected portfolios except for the “low energy Gini and high emissions” portfolio (magenta line). The selected portfolios (intervention bundles) show varying trade-offs between performance indicators. For instance, achieving low-carbon emissions (teal line) requires large investments in renewables and transmission lines, whereas less investment increases emissions (blue line). There is also a trade-off between power load curtailment and capital investment (teal and magenta lines). The “low energy Gini” portfolios (magenta and brown lines) improve equity by 7% compared to the “baseline” but alter emissions and curtailment depending on the level of investment. A reduction of US$ 180 million in investment compared to the “baseline” portfolio increases emissions by 7% (magenta line), whereas an increase of US$ 3,000 million results in a 5% reduction in emissions (brown line). Some Ghanaian regions have low use of electricity (e.g., Northwest and Northeast), resulting in a low electricity Gini index limit of 0.473. The “low emissions” portfolio (teal line) shows a 6% reduction in inequities in electricity access, a 25% reduction in carbon emissions, and a 1% increase in agricultural yield compared to the “baseline” while decreasing the load curtailment and irrigation water supply Gini index to zero, with an increase of US$ 7240 million investment in renewables and transmission lines. Except for a 9% increase in carbon emissions, the “low curtailment” portfolio (blue line) is comparable to the “low emissions” portfolio (teal line), with an increase of US$ 5280 million in investment compared to the “baseline”. a Parallel coordinates plot of the baseline and best-performing (Pareto-efficient) infrastructure and operation portfolios, b Aggregate portfolios of infrastructure expansion, and c, d Carbon emissions from thermal and bioenergy power plants.

Figure 3b shows the distribution of infrastructure expansion (i.e., how much new intermittent renewables and solar storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines) in the selected portfolios of Fig. 3a, c, d show carbon emissions of thermal and bioenergy power plants of the Fig. The “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios include major investments in renewables (Fig. These portfolios improve system performance and decrease operating costs (by nearly 20%) compared to the “baseline”. The “low emissions” portfolio results in a high capacity of new transmission lines, whereas transmission line expansion is lower in the “baseline” and “low energy Gini” portfolios. The renewables are lower in the “low energy Gini” portfolios. Figure 3c, d show that thermal power plants are the major contributors to carbon emissions; the power system continues to partially rely on them to meet the growing electricity demand. Results show how changes in electricity access equity are impacted by the spatial distribution of investments (i.e., prioritising underserved regions and moving resources from more developed to least developed regions to ensure equitable regional coverage of services - Fig. 4) and indicate the need for large investments in renewables to shift to a low-carbon future (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. Figure 4 presents the infrastructure expansion by region of the selected portfolios from Fig. This figure shows how more informed infrastructure planning reduces inequities in electricity access (i.e., adding new generation and transmission capacity and changing electricity allocation priorities in regions with high existing disparities - the Northeast and Northwest regions) while maintaining the same level of emissions and investment cost (e.g., the “low energy Gini and low emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios - see Figs. Results also show more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios, with higher intra-regional transmission line expansion than cross-regional transmission line expansion (Fig. Increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower reservoir re-operation, and better spatial planning could increase equity in the regional distribution of (water and energy) services and reduce carbon emissions while improving agricultural performance and meeting future energy service targets (the “low emissions” and “low curtailment” portfolios - Figs. With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments (the “low energy Gini” portfolios - Figs. The top set of figures (a–f) show the regional distribution of renewables, and the bottom set of figures (g–l) show the regional distribution of transmission line expansion of portfolios selected in the Pareto-efficient portfolios (highlighted coloured lines of Fig. Solar, wind, solar storage, and bioenergy expansion are higher and more diverse in the “low emissions”, “low energy Gini and low emissions”, and “low curtailment” portfolios, and lower in the “low energy Gini and high emissions” and “low irrigation water Gini and high yield” portfolios. The figure also shows that there is more infrastructure expansion in the Northwest and Northeast regions across the selected portfolios and that the intra-regional transmission line expansion (sum of first six coloured bars in (g–l)) is higher than cross-regional transmission line expansion (sum of last six coloured bars in (g–l)), see Supplementary Fig. 3b for the aggregated portfolios of infrastructure expansion.

The investment and resource allocation priority options show varying degrees of influence on performance indicators (Fig. Some intervention options are effective at bolstering specific performance indicators, whereas others impact multiple indicators (Fig. The most effective option for equity in electricity access and load curtailment is investing in bioenergy plants in the Northeast and Northwest regions of Ghana (Fig. In contrast, equity in irrigation water supply and agricultural yield are influenced the most by irrigation water allocation priorities (Fig. Results show the most effective choices for improving multiple performance indicators are changing the capacities of bioenergy generation plants in the Northwest and Northeast regions and investing in the Southwest's solar power and bioenergy and Southeast's wind power (Fig. a–g The five most influential intervention decisions for equity and other water-energy system performance indicators.

Considering regional benefit distribution equity in multisector infrastructure planning can help guide a country toward a more equitable transition from fossil fuels to lower-emission energy sources while reducing inter-sectoral conflicts across multi-resource systems. A more equitable energy transition will accelerate transformational SDG co-benefits20 and help reach the Paris Agreement7. This paper presents a WEFE artificial intelligence-assisted analytical framework that identifies trade-offs and synergies of multi-dimensionally efficient and more equitable low-carbon water-energy infrastructure and operation portfolios. The framework can help stakeholders identify infrastructure investments and resource allocation policies and evaluate the importance ranking and positive and negative influence of different interventions in achieving energy transition policy goals. Through iterative stakeholder deliberation processes, new or modified intervention options can be set and used to revise intervention portfolios to ensure they appropriately reflect stakeholder aspirations. Our approach aims to lower national emissions in Ghana through a balanced energy infrastructure system expansion programme (bioenergy, solar, wind, solar storage, and transmission lines), and reservoir re-operation (of Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu dams). Ghana's resulting efficient and equitable low-carbon intervention strategies show how considering equity in energy transitions allows reducing both regional service disparities and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. We show how the spatial distribution of investments drives electricity access equity and that increased investments in renewables and transmission lines, hydropower re-operation, and better spatial planning enhance equity and reduce carbon emissions while improving food production and meeting future energy service goals. With low renewable investments, equity can also be improved, but at the cost of higher emissions and load curtailments. Ghana's power system continues to partially rely on thermal power plants to meet the growing electricity demand despite the expansion of renewable technologies, resulting in relatively high thermal-based carbon emissions. However, adding bioenergy generation (and transmission lines) helps displace thermal power and decreases emissions while increasing equity in service provision in the Ghanaian case. Bioenergy, which uses agricultural crop and forestry residues and municipal waste as an input50, is recognised as Ghana's leading spatially distributed and dispatchable renewable generation technology. Crop residues alone in Ghana have an estimated bioenergy potential of 75 terajoules (TJ)50,56. Other studies have also highlighted the potential of crop residues for bioenergy in Ghana57,58,59. However, increasing bioenergy could compete with food production for land resources if only relying on energy crops for bioenergy60,61. Bioenergy production, therefore, could be regulated to prevent a negative impact on food security. The proposed WEFE infrastructure design approach help analysts and policymakers plan for equitable low-carbon futures. The proposed approach considers the spatial equity of water and energy services alongside emission reduction and other aggregated national infrastructure planning goals to identify efficient, equitable, climate-compatible intervention portfolios for multisector WEFE systems. 3 and 4 for Ghana) help identify infrastructure interventions that reduce service inequities and emissions and improve sectoral complementarities. Stakeholders can deliberate the pros and cons of a large set of efficient intervention options to help find a compromise portfolio that manages trade-offs and leverages synergies across multiple competing interests. The machine learning technique helps stakeholders understand how different interventions drive equity, emission, and other system performance targets, as shown for Ghana (Fig. This allows choosing portfolios or revising intervention choices and repeating the process if no consensus can be attained. The proposed approach could be adapted for other countries planning an equitable transition to lower-emission energy sources, especially those with service inequities and interdependent WEFE challenges. This study did not consider the potential effects of climate change and uncertainties with future projections in the equity-informed planning of WEFE systems. Climate change could impact energy generation, the demand for water and energy, and water resources management. These changes and future uncertainties could have repercussions on the equity of providing water and energy services and inter-sectoral conflicts among multiple resource systems. Addressing these limitations in future research would help identify robust infrastructure strategies for adapting to climate change. In this paper, we argue for considering equity in shaping future multisector resource systems to reduce service inequities and emissions and better balance regional sectoral benefits. The approach can support countries in phasing out fossil-fuel electricity sources and the transition to carbon neutrality fairly and transparently. As such, it is a relevant approach for developing countries seeking to transition towards lower carbon emissions while at the same time improving services. Realising an equitable low-carbon future requires considering multiple sectors, their interactions, and the equity implications of adopting different investment and policy intervention packages. Adding equity considerations alongside goals like climate mitigation could help achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris Agreement. The river system is modelled using Python Water Resources (Pywr)45. Pywr is an open-source Python repository that simulates resource system networks. It allows representing water resources infrastructure using a network structure driven by water supplies and demands and system operating rules. Pywr uses a linear programme to solve water allocations at every simulation time step (weekly in this study) by minimising allocation penalties subject to constraints imposed by operating rules. The Ghana river system model includes existing and planned infrastructure in Ghana. The power system model uses a direct current optimal power flow linear programme47 to minimise power system costs at each simulation time step (i.e., hourly) subject to equality constraints (power balance at each node) and inequality constraints (power generation and line limits). The power system model is an interconnected network of different energy sources, transmission lines, substations, distribution networks, and electricity demand locations. Energy generators can be represented as nodes in the network, each with their defined constraints, such as maximum power capacity and associated costs. The Ghana power system model simulates the existing and planned hydro, solar, combined solar and storage, wind, bioenergy, and thermal generators50. Electricity demand projections, generating resources, capital and operating costs of power plants and transmission lines, and hourly profiles of renewables were taken from Ghana's Power System Master Plan50. Hourly electricity demand profiles and transmission data were collected from the Ghanaian national grid operator, the Ghana Grid Company. The long-term annual peak load projections for 2030-2040 from the Ghana Power System Master Plan50 were used to scale the hourly load profile of 2018 to consider the projected growth in the electricity demand in the country (a twofold increase in the peak demand by 2030 compared to 2018). Capital costs consist of engineering, procurement, construction, start-up, and owner costs (for items like land, cooling infrastructure, administration and associated building, site works, project management, and licenses)50. The operating costs of variable renewables (solar and wind) and combined solar and storage are lower than the costs of hydropower, bioenergy, and thermal power plants50. The operating costs of thermal generators also differ depending on the technology and fuel types. Hourly power system simulations help capture the variability of intermittent renewables (solar and wind) and energy demand, as well as improve the use of hydropower based on the changing availability of renewables and other energy sources. The power system model dispatches the system's generators based on cost-merit prioritisation where solar, wind, combined solar and storage generators are dispatched first, then hydropower, bioenergy, and lastly, thermal generators. This balances energy production to align with variable energy demand and shares of different energy technologies. The river and power systems simulators are linked to represent multisector nexus dynamics43. The integration of the simulators uses a multi-actor object-oriented Python Network Simulation framework (Pynsim)48. The simulators run sequentially with feedback across the simulators (at hydropower generation nodes). The river system simulator runs its first simulation time step and generates the weekly average hydropower, which is then passed to the power system simulator by Pynsim as a constraint on the maximum power generation capacity for that week. The power system simulator runs for the same week at an hourly simulation time step, constrained by the information provided by the river system simulator. This process is repeated time step by time step until the simulation is completed. The integrated simulation model runs for a period of 10 years, from 2030 to 2040. The multisector simulator is connected to an artificial intelligence-assisted multi-objective search algorithm (MOEA) to search for efficient infrastructure intervention portfolios43. MOEAs seek the approximately Pareto-optimal solutions to multi-objective optimisation problems by mimicking the natural biological evolution process62,63. The MOEA generates an infrastructure intervention portfolio (i.e., a set of decision variables) and passes it to the integrated water-energy simulator. The integrated simulation model then performs a multi-year simulation to evaluate performance indicators (e.g., regarding energy transition goals) that are used as objectives to be minimised or maximised in the search process. The portfolio and values of the objectives are then stored before the next iteration, when the algorithm generates a new set of variables (a new portfolio) for the simulation model. The iteration between the search algorithm and the integrated simulation model continues until a stopping criterion is met. We allow up to 1.5 million iterations in this design process. Once the stopping criterion is met, a non-dominated sorting process is performed to find a set of best-performing (i.e., Pareto-optimal) intervention portfolios. Pareto-optimal solutions are efficient because they provide the best-achievable compromise among multiple performance objectives that coexist in multi-objective problems. These solutions are non-dominated, indicating no other solutions can outperform or equal them in all objectives at the same time. Stakeholders can consider these optimised solutions to find a compromise that efficiently balances trade-offs among multiple competing interests and leverages synergies. After the search, we used a machine learning method (details provided below) to assess the effectiveness of interventions in achieving performance objectives. Machine learning and interactive data visualisation tools help stakeholders understand, evaluate, and choose a preferred portfolio or iteratively revise the intervention options and repeat the process to obtain alternative, potentially better, intervention portfolios. We used the Borg MOEA62,63 to perform the WEFE multi-objective optimisation. Borg can tackle complex nonlinear and nonconcave optimisation problems63,64. It integrates various elements from different MOEAs and introduces several new features. It uses ϵ-dominance archives and ϵ-progress to maintain a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions and monitor convergence speed62,63. It employs randomised restarts when convergence slows to revive search through self-adaptive population sizing (of solutions) and dynamically adapts the use of different recombination operators62,63 to generate new candidate solutions. The evolution process in Borg involves evolving a population of candidate solutions over generations of iterative selection, crossover, and mutation operations. The crossover step then combines the characteristics of the selected solutions (“parents”) to produce new solutions (“children”) by imitating the natural reproduction process. Random mutations are then added to the children to improve variability and adaptability in the new population of solutions. These newly candidate individuals are then evaluated, and the process continues iteratively, as explained above and in Supplementary Fig. Each random seed uses a different starting point for the MOEA search process. 4 shows that the hypervolume stabilises before the stopping criterion of 1.5 million iterations for all four seeds, thereby indicating convergence. The design formulation for Ghana includes eight objectives: minimising the electricity access Gini index (Eq. (1)), minimising the carbon emissions from generation (Eq. (2)), minimising the power system load curtailment (Eq. (3)), minimising the irrigation water supply Gini index (Eq. (4)), maximising the agriculture yields (Eqs. (5–8)), minimising the power system capital costs (Eq. (9)), minimising the power system operating costs (Eq. (10)), and maximising the flood recession agriculture benefits (Eqs. The multi-objective search optimises 170 interventions (decisions variables), including the vector of the power system infrastructure expansion, including solar, wind, combined solar and storage, and bioenergy (biomass and biogas) generators, and transmission lines, the vector of operating rules parameters (Eq. (14)) for Akosombo, Bui, and Pwalugu reservoirs, and the vector of the electricity and irrigation water allocation priority parameters. where, Ginielectricity is the mean electricity access Gini index of a country, \({{\rm{RP}}}\) is a set of regions of equal population in a country, LS/capi is the load supply per capita of region i, LS/capj is the load supply per capita of region \(j\), \(\overline{{{\rm{LS}}}/{{\rm{cap}}}}\) is the mean load supply per capita of regions of equal population in a country, n is the number of regions of equal population in a country, t is the simulation time step, and T is the number of simulation years.

We used Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) to model reservoir operating rules. The use of RBFs in representing infrastructure operating rules, including reservoir storage and release decisions, have shown good performance71,72,73. The Gaussian RBF (\(\varphi\)) is defined by Eq. where, m is the number of input variables x (reservoir storage and time), n is the number of RBFs (four), wi is the weight of the ith RBF, and ci,j and bi,j are the m-dimensional centres and radius vectors of the ith RBF, respectively.

The time of year and storage in the reservoir are mapped to the release rule at each time step of the simulation period. This allows to dynamic adaptation of releases based on changing reservoir volumes. The multi-objective search process (MOEA) optimises the monthly storage volumes and releases (24 decision variables) for each reservoir to determine the most efficient (Pareto-optimal) operating rules. The MOEA iteratively optimises the release rules alongside infrastructure expansion, such as solar, wind, combined solar and storage, bioenergy, and transmission lines, and energy and water allocation priorities. Hydropower reservoirs can provide flexibility and stability for power grids, and their improved operations can support the transition to clean energy43,74,75,76. The MOEA explores a range of different infrastructure interventions while also adjusting reservoir release decisions to find the best-achievable compromise among equity, emissions, and other water-energy system performance objectives. This way MOEA solutions adapt to the changing shares of different energy technologies and allocate resources to improve overall system performance (see Supplementary Fig. We used the Random Forest Regression machine learning model77 from the Scikit-learn Python library78 and the SHAP49,79,80 to determine the influence of intervention decisions on equity and other water-energy system performance indicators. The MOEA typically yields a large set (up to thousands) of optimal solutions for large problems like the Ghana case study. While common patterns can potentially be identified from directly exploring Pareto-optimal solutions or via cluster analysis, the SHAP analysis of tree-based machine learning models49,79 helps explain the relationships between intervention decisions and the MOEA performance measures. It provides the importance ranking of different interventions and also the direction and magnitude of their influence in achieving performance objectives. The outcomes of the MOEA are used to train a Random Forest model for each performance objective. The features of each Random Forest model are the decision variables representing different investment and resource allocation priority options, and the target is each of the optimisation objectives. The training dataset is used to train 100 tree estimators, and the testing dataset is used to test the performance of the Random Forest models. We also test the performance of each model for different maximum tree depths ranging from 1 to 70 to select the best-fit tree depth for each model to avoid overfitting or underfitting models. 5 depicts the performance of the machine learning models for the training and testing sets with different maximum tree depths and the selected maximum tree depth for each model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have discovered a huge filament of hot gas bridging four galaxy clusters. At 10 times as massive as our galaxy, the thread could contain some of the Universe's 'missing' matter, addressing a decades-long mystery. Said models suggest that this elusive matter might exist in long strings of gas, or filaments, bridging the densest pockets of space. While we've spotted filaments before, it's tricky to make out their properties; they're typically faint, making it difficult to isolate their light from that of any galaxies, black holes, and other objects lying nearby. New research is now one ofthe first to do just this, finding and accurately characterizing a single filament of hot gas stretching between four clusters of galaxies in the nearby Universe. "For the first time, our results closely match what we see in our leading model of the cosmos - something that's not happened before," says lead researcher Konstantinos Migkas of Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. "It seems that the simulations were right all along." Suzaku mapped the filament's faint X-ray light over a wide region of space, while XMM-Newton pinpointed very precisely contaminating sources of X-rays - namely, supermassive black holes - lying within the filament. "Thanks to XMM-Newton we could identify and remove these cosmic contaminants, so we knew we were looking at the gas in the filament and nothing else," adds co-author Florian Pacaud of the University of Bonn, Germany. "Our approach was really successful, and reveals that the filament is exactly as we'd expect from our best large-scale simulations of the Universe." "This research is a great example of collaboration between telescopes, and creates a new benchmark for how to spot the light coming from the faint filaments of the cosmic web," adds Norbert Schartel, ESA XMM-Newton Project Scientist. "More fundamentally, it reinforces our standard model of the cosmos and validates decades of simulations: it seems that the 'missing' matter may truly be lurking in hard-to-see threads woven across the Universe." Launched in 2023, Euclid is exploring this web's structure and history. The mission is also digging deep into the nature of dark matter and energy - neither of which have ever been observed, despite accounting for a whopping 95% of the Universe - and working with other dark Universe detectives to solve some of the biggest and longest-standing cosmic mysteries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have created a galactic masterpiece: an ultra-detailed image that reveals previously unseen features in the Sculptor Galaxy. Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), they observed this nearby galaxy in thousands of colors simultaneously. "Galaxies are incredibly complex systems that we are still struggling to understand," says ESO researcher Enrico Congiu, who led a new Astronomy & Astrophysics study on Sculptor. Reaching hundreds of thousands of light-years across, galaxies are extremely large, but their evolution depends on what's happening at much smaller scales. "The Sculptor Galaxy is in a sweet spot," says Congiu. "It is close enough that we can resolve its internal structure and study its building blocks with incredible detail, but at the same time, big enough that we can still see it as a whole system." A galaxy's building blocks  -- stars, gas and dust  -- emit light at different colors. Therefore, the more shades of color there are in an image of a galaxy, the more we can learn about its inner workings. While conventional images contain only a handful of colors, this new Sculptor map comprises thousands. This tells astronomers everything they need to know about the stars, gas and dust within, such as their age, composition, and motion. To create this map of the Sculptor Galaxy, which is 11 million light-years away and is also known as NGC 253, the researchers observed it for over 50 hours with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on ESO's VLT. According to co-author Kathryn Kreckel from Heidelberg University, Germany, this makes the map a potent tool: "We can zoom in to study individual regions where stars form at nearly the scale of individual stars, but we can also zoom out to study the galaxy as a whole." Co-author Fabian Scheuermann, a doctoral student at Heidelberg University, puts this number into context: "Beyond our galactic neighborhood, we usually deal with fewer than 100 detections per galaxy." Future projects using the map will explore how gas flows, changes its composition, and forms stars all across this galaxy. The team is composed of E.
