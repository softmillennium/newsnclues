                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is CNBC's live blog covering European markets. European markets closed lower Thursday as investors reacted to the Bank of England's monetary policy decision and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index provisionally closed down by 0.8%, with most sectors and major bourses in negative territory. The French CAC 40 index slumped 1.3% while Germany's DAX was off by 1.1%. By sector, travel and leisure stocks were the biggest losers, declining 2.4%. CNBC's Jenni Reid reflects on this week's Paris Air Show, taking a look at the key themes and the one major player that kept a lower profile due to turmoil at its business — Boeing. Airbus racked up nearly $21 billion in orders as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation. Turkey's central bank left its key interest rate at 46% despite cooling inflation, in view of what it cited as geopolitical and trade tensions that threaten to spike prices again. "The underlying inflation trend has declined in May" and "has continued to decline in June," the bank's monetary policy committee wrote in a statement alongside its decision announcement. The committee noted that demand had slowed, and that "the potential effects of geopolitical developments and increasing protectionism in global trade on the disinflation process are being closely monitored." Inflation has been steadily declining in Turkey, and currently stands at 35.4%. The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.25% as widely expected, after inflation appeared to be stickier than previously expected. Economists have preferred to skip over a reading from April, due to a correction in the Office for National Statistics data. Norges Bank had in March suggested it was expecting to cut its key sight deposit rate in June, and followed through. The interest rate cuts were largely expected by economists. The company presented its "Future Forward" strategy on Wednesday to outline how it intends to use artificial intelligence in its business to grow revenue in the medium term. Analysts said the company's management "must be feeling deflated" over the share price reaction despite their efforts to pivot their strategy. Teleperformance's stock has been plagued by fears over how AI is expected to disrupt the company's business model. The firm provides outsourced customer care and back office services to large enterprises, which investors believe will be displaced by generative AI being deployed directly by its customers. In February 2024, the stock price declined by nearly 15% in a single day after a report from an unrelated Swedish fintech firm, Klarna, suggested it had successfully replaced customer service roles at that company with AI. "On this basis, we think TEP needs to just get its head down and quietly deliver, either in the public market domain, or behind closed doors in the private sphere," they added. "In the meantime, we continue to see the stock as a fundamentally mispriced asset, though recognise that high realized volatility poses a barrier to those with shorter investment horizons." The reduction was widely expected by markets ahead of the decision, after traders priced in an around 81% chance of a quarter-point cut and around a 19% chance of a bigger 50-basis-point cut. While other nations continue to battle inflation, Switzerland faces deflation, with consumer prices falling by an annual 0.1% in May. Low levels of inflation are not unusual for Switzerland — the country has seen several periods of deflation in the 2010s and 2020s. All major European stock markets had a negative start on Thursday, with the regional Stoxx 600 index down 0.63% as global investors monitor tensions between Israel and Iran and the potential for U.S. involvement. Most sectors are lower, though telecoms nudged slightly higher, with Vodafone up 1% after announcing Pilar López would join the company from Microsoft as its chief financial officer from October. Energy stocks are also pushing higher, with the Stoxx Oil and Gas index up 0.8%, as crude prices continue to rise on Middle East uncertainty. ICE Brent Crude futures were last up 0.83% to $77.33 a barrel. Earlier this month, Swiss authorities proposed a new requirement for UBS — Switzerland's largest systemic lender — to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital to allay possible shocks to the Swiss financial system, in the event of the bank's collapse. UBS has been fighting such measures since its government-aided takeover of stricken domestic peer Credit Suisse in 2023, citing the erosion of its competitiveness. It nevertheless noted integration costs linked to the Credit Suisse merger still weighed on the lender's profitability and that "standalone capital ratios of the parent bank overestimate its true resilience." The central bank endorsed the Swiss government's proposal for a parent bank's participation in its foreign subsidiaries to be fully deducted from its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) capital, which is typically designed to cover losses immediately as they occur. A rate hold is widely expected with figures on Wednesday confirming inflation remains well above the BOE's 2% target, coming in at 3.4% in May. The Federal Reserve also kept rates on hold at its meeting yesterday, and trimmed its projection for reductions in the coming years. ING FX Strategist Francesco Pesole, meanwhile, in a Tuesday note, pointed to signs of the euro strengthening against sterling, unless the BOE surprises with a more hawkish-than-expected message today. Higher interest rates tend to support a domestic currency. It's a big day for central bank action on Thursday, with monetary policy decisions coming from Turkey, Norway, Switzerland and Britain. The Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates, but investors will be waiting to see how policymakers voted and for any guidance on the rate cut trajectory, with most analysts expecting a cut in August. There are no other major earnings or data releases in Europe. U.S. markets are closed for the Juneteenth holiday on Thursday. Futures data from IG suggests a choppy start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open 22 points higher at 8,862, Germany's DAX down 88 points at 23,253, France's CAC 40 lower 32 points at 7,619 and Italy's FTSE MIB dropping 105 points to 39,321. Global market sentiment is becoming more skittish over the conflict between Iran and Israel and the possibility of further U.S. involvement. On Wednesday evening, U.S. President Donald Trump convened his national security advisors in the White House Situation Room for the second time in two days. Earlier, Trump said he had not yet decided whether to give the greenlight to a U.S. strike in support of Israel's ongoing bombardment of Iranian targets. Investors are also weighing the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, leaving its benchmark rate unchanged in a 4.25%-4.5% range, where it has stood since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed committee will wait to see the impact of Trump's broad-spanning tariffs on inflation before considering any adjustments to monetary policy. Still, the central bank pointed to two interest rate cuts later this year. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump ripped into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "destructive," after the central bank kept interest rates steady on Wednesday. Trump said "Too Late" Powell is costing the United States "hundreds of billions of dollars" by not cutting rates, leveling a familiar criticism against the Fed chair who has repeatedly ignored Trump's pressure campaign to cut rates. "We should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden's Short Term Debt," Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social. Trump also criticized Powell late Wednesday, calling him a "real dummy" in a near-midnight Truth Social post. Powell, whose term ends in May of 2026, said Wednesday that, "for the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies." Trump's remarks were in response to the Federal Open Market Committee keeping its borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, which is on par with where it's been since December. The criticisms were not surprising, as the president has long slammed Powell for not lowering interest rates. As recently as Wednesday morning, hours before the Fed was set to release its decision on interest rates, Trump said: "So we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won't cut today." Trump even mused about appointing himself to lead the Federal Reserve, saying, "I'd do a much better job than these people." Trump has said that he intends to announce his pick for the next chair of the Federal Reserve "very soon." We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Airbus orders and new models have taken center-stage at this year's Paris Air Show, as its U.S. rival Boeing spends yet another major industry event keeping a low profile due to turmoil at the business. Airlines and manufacturers use air shows as an opportunity to make splashy aircraft purchase announcements following months of negotiations, some of which will be wrapped up at the event. Airbus had racked up nearly $21 billion as of Thursday morning, per a Reuters calculation. That included 132 firm orders on Monday, from customers including Saudi leasing firm AviLease, Japan's ANA and Poland's LOT, versus 41 for Boeing and 15 for Brazil's Embraer, according to a tally by aviation advisory IBA. The following two days saw Boeing hold back from announcements completely, while Airbus splashed a 150-aircraft Memorandum of Understanding with VietJet Air focused on its single-aisle 100 A321neos, and orders with EgyptAir and Starlux Airlines for its wide-body A350s. Air Asia chief Tony Fernandes told CNBC on Thursday that he was in discussions at Paris about expanding the firm's existing order for the Airbus XLR — the Toulouse-based planemaker's flagship new long-range, narrowbody aircraft — and expected an announcement within the next month or so. The manufacturer sealed plenty of orders during U.S. President Donald Trump's May trip to the Middle East, including a 210-jet deal with Qatar Airways. Both Boeing and Airbus meanwhile have aircraft backlogs of more than 5,000 and 8,000 aircraft, respectively, figures that have barely budged for nearly a decade as industry supply challenges — exacerbated in the wake of the pandemic — leave airlines struggling to renew their ageing fleets. John Plueger, chief executive officer of Air Lease Corp, told CNBC earlier this week that the backlog meant it was always expected to be a subdued show in Paris compared to those past, including the post-pandemic boom year of 2023. So how many follow-on orders into the '33, '34, '35 time frame are you really going to see? But overall, the demand environment remains very robust," Plueger said. However, this does mark yet another year in which Boeing has refrained from the aircraft flypasts or major promotional activities. Starting in 2019 in the wake of the two fatal crashes of its B737-Max model, followed by the pandemic which threw the industry into turmoil, and then with fresh crises delivered via an emergency exit door blowout, allegations of widespread quality control issues, and increasingly-disgruntled customers over delivery delays — Boeing has had a host of reasons to avoid the spotlight. Just as 2025 appeared like it may represent a tentative turning point for the company, with CEO Kelly Ortberg due to attend Paris, the first-ever crash of a Boeing Dreamliner in last week's Air India disaster threw that into disarray. "Demand for new aircraft remains unprecedented, matched only by passenger demand for air travel," said Tony Payne, partner at law firm DLA Piper. He added that orders remain strong despite a "sombre and reflective environment" in the wake of the Air India crash, as stakeholders are "well aware of the impact" any relaxation of standards can have. "Orders for new aircraft and engines remains strong but alongside a sombre and reflective environment, where stakeholders are well aware of the impact of any relaxation of standards can have." "Muted" has therefore become the word of the week in terms of commercial aviation, while defense — making up nearly half of the show's content this year — takes on a bigger-than-ever role amid roiling Middle East conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and an upcoming NATO summit at which higher national security spending will be high on the agenda. Deals in this space have included Thales' contract to build 48 of its new remote-operated artillery systems for the French government. Dan Taylor, head of consulting at IBA, told CNBC that the split between Boeing and Airbus this year was "more about context than competition." "Boeing's recent orders in the Middle East, helped by U.S. diplomatic engagement, and its quiet stance post-Air India likely influenced its lower visibility at the Paris Air Show. "Airlines are likely busy reassessing fleet strategies given the latest crisis, but strong profitability, ageing fleets, easing debt levels, and continued GDP and travel demand growth across many regions all point to a sustained long-term appetite for new aircraft."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to Columbia Business School professor Michael Chad Hoeppner, the popular idea that you have 7 seconds to make a first impression may be a tad too strict. "I'm not going to give people quite that amount of scarcity, but the beginning really matters a lot," he says. During a job interview, Hoeppner says, you have approximately 90 seconds to engage your interviewer's attention — and how you speak is key. Clear communication isn't just about what you say, but how you say it, as Hoeppner attests in his latest book "Don't Say Um: How to Communicate Effectively to Live a Better Life." The way someone delivers information "has a lot to do with how we hear each other, and whose ideas we take seriously or not seriously," he says. Here are Hoeppner's tips to make the best first impression at job interviews. Hoeppner, who also coaches political candidates, compares the beginning of an interview to the start of a presidential debate. "People's attention spans are worse than they've ever been. The same goes for job interviews: "You may only get one answer at all that anyone actually pays attention to, so you have to make sure that one answer counts." Even simple, open-ended prompts like "Tell me about yourself" provide crucial opportunities to make your case as a candidate. Hoeppner recommends starting your responses with specific, vivid stories and anecdotes so that interviewers "remember what the heck you say and actually understand what you mean." During interviews, Hoeppner notes that nervous job candidates often alter their natural tone and manner of speaking in an effort to seem professional. These communication skills are crucial in all areas of work, Hoeppner says. Even brilliant employees' careers can end up stagnating because they can't communicate their ideas in a dynamic way. "What happens is then they don't get promotions to be in client-facing roles or in leadership roles," Hoeppner says. To get ready for an interview, Hoeppner recommends a method he calls "loud drafting": giving yourself an open-ended prompt and repeatedly answering it out loud. The point of this exercise is to practice answering questions in a natural way, he says. Some job candidates prepare for interviews by jotting down prepared statements, but they frequently sound stiff and unnatural when said out loud. In general, Hoeppner recommends "flexing your talking muscles" by chatting casually with people you meet and switching your phone calls to FaceTime. According to Hoeppner, in-person communication skills will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology. With almost-limitless access to information, Hoeppner asks, "what determines whose ideas get paid more attention? His answer: "Very likely how you say them."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Urgent international calls for restraint appear to be falling on deaf ears as the world braces for intensifying conflict in the Middle East. All eyes are on the White House, as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs carrying out direct military strikes on Iran. Such an act would represent a dramatic deepening of U.S. involvement in what has thus far been limited to attacks between Iran and U.S. ally Israel. The Kremlin warned Thursday that U.S. intervention in Iran would set off a "terrible spiral of escalation," while Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Reuters that the world is "millimeters" away from nuclear catastrophe. Russia is currently mired in its own war in Ukraine, which also involves a fight over a major nuclear power plant. The high-level intelligence meeting followed Starmer's presence at the G7 summit in Canada, during which he joined other leaders of the group in reiterating their "commitment to peace and stability." But chances at diplomacy are looking increasingly bleak as Iran and Israel continue to trade increasingly deadly blows and leaders of the countries involved show no sign of stepping back from the brink. Trump remained noncommittal in his comments on whether the U.S. would attack Iran. I can tell you this, that Iran's got a lot of trouble, and they want to negotiate," he told reporters on the White House lawn on Wednesday. He added that "the next week is going to be big." German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stirred some controversy, saying in an interview Tuesday that Israel was doing the "dirty work" for other countries by carrying out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The foreign ministers of Germany, France, and the U.K. are set to meet with their Iranian counterpart on Friday. Meanwhile, China's Xinhua state media service cited Chinese Premier Xi Jinping saying that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is "an urgent priority" and that the use of force is not the right way to resolve the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Xi held a phone call Thursday, during which both men strongly condemned Israel, saying the country's actions in Iran "violated the UN Charter and other norms of international law," according to a Kremlin aide. The leaders, both of whom are allies of Iran, said that military action would not resolve the issues Western and Israeli leaders have over Iran's nuclear program and that diplomacy was the only way forward. It comes after Trump posted comments on his Truth Social platform earlier this week, demanding that Iran unconditionally surrender and warning that the U.S. has the capability to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Khamenei responded by saying that any American attack on Iran would be met with "irreparable damage" and spark a wider war. Overnight, Israel and Iran traded missile barrages, with Israel striking Iran's Arak and Natanz nuclear facilities, while Iran said it hit a hospital in Israel's Negev region after aiming for a military site. At least 30 people were injured in the strike on the hospital, authorities said, with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz saying after the attack that Iran's leader "can no longer be allowed to exist."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Samsung will unveil a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone at a launch likely set to take place next month, as it battles Chinese rivals to deliver the slimmest devices to the market. But Chinese players, in particular Honor and Oppo, have since aggressively released foldables that are thinner and lighter than Samsung's offerings. "With foldables, thinness has become more critical than ever because people aren't prepared to accept the compromise for a thicker and heavier phone to get the real estate that a folding phone can deliver," Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, told CNBC on Thursday. Honor, Oppo and other Chinese players have used their slim designs to differentiate themselves from Samsung. Let's look at a comparison: Samsung's last foldable from 2024, the Galaxy Z Fold6, is 12.1 millimeter ~(0.48 inches) thick when folded and weighs 239 grams (8.43 oz). Oppo's Find N5, which was released earlier this year, is 8.93 millimeters thick when closed and weighs 229 grams. The Honor Magic V3, which was launched last year, is 9.2 millimeters when folded and weighs 226 grams. "Samsung needs to step up" in foldables, Wood said. And that's what the South Korean tech giant is planning to do at its upcoming launch, which is likely to take place next month. Honor is planning a launch on July 2 in China for its latest folding phone, the Magic V5. "The interesting thing for Samsung, if they can approach the thinness that Honor has achieved it is will be a significant step up from predecessor, it will be a tangible step up in design," Wood said. Despite these advances by way of foldables, the market for the devices has not been as exciting as many had hoped. CCS Insight said that foldables will account for just 2% of the overall smartphone market this year. "There is a chance that by delivering much thinner foldables that are more akin to the traditional monoblock phone, it will provide an opportunity to turn consumer heads and get them to revisit the idea of having a folding device," Wood said. "However, I would caution foldables do remain problematic because in many cases consumers struggle to see why they need a folding device." Although the market remains small for foldables compared to traditional smartphones, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities on Wednesday said Apple  — which has been notably absent from this product line-up — plans to make a folding iPhone starting next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Each weekday, CNBC's "Inside India" news show gives you news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse businesses, and the people behind its rise. Livestream the show on YouTube and catch highlights here. Twelve months ago, India's initial public offering market was booming, with tech startups from food and grocery delivery player Swiggy to electric two-wheeler manufacturer Ola Electric at the cusp of their debut. This year, however, there has been a pronounced change. Several companies, including education loan provider Avanse Financial Services, contract drug manufacturer Anthem Biosciences and LG Electronics' India unit, have put their listing plans on hold given weak investor sentiment and the bleak macroeconomic outlook, despite having received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The stock is down more than 3%, after opening at 328 Indian rupees ($3.79) per share — a premium of around 2% to its issue price of 321 rupees. "The IPO market was dismal, especially in the first quarter, because of a weak rupee and global volatility from the wars and constantly evolving tariff situation," Peeyush Mittal, portfolio manager at Matthews Asia, told CNBC's Inside India. A more pressing problem, however, has been the impact of slowing consumption levels on corporate earnings, Rishika Chandan, managing partner at Venturi Partners, said. Many good private equity-backed consumer brands, which would have historically posted a 35% to 40% jump in their profitability per annum, only grew 15% to 20% in FY2025 ended March, no thanks to tighter consumer purse strings, Chandan added. "That is not a great number to go to the market with," she said, adding that companies have now pushed back their listing plans, in part, to capitalize on higher sales during festive seasons later in the year. While the Reserve Bank of India's recent rate cut and the government's measures to stimulate consumption may eventually translate into higher spending, Chandan says more time will still be needed for corporates to see stronger revenue and profit numbers. "Anybody wanting to go public will likely stretch it out and wait for the valuation markup. That will also give them higher forward value, which will allow for an IPO underwriting based on the evaluation of profitability," Chandan added. For instance, $6.4 billion was raised from the Indian markets through share sales in May, making it the highest monthly total since December 2024. The sales activity shows no signs of slowing down this month, with at least 10 blocks raising $1.2 billion in just the first week, per data compiled by Bloomberg. India's "fundamentals are solid," Dhruba Jyoti Sengupta, CEO of Wrise Wealth Management Middle East, says. "With over $12 billion in SEBI-cleared IPOs and more than 130 companies in the wings, India's primary market is simply pausing before its next leap. Sengupta foresees several listings, including that of Reliance Jio, Tata Capital and LG Electronics India. The Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio is expected to go public later this year in an approximately 400 billion Indian rupee listing. The listing of the Tata Sons subsidiary, which provides a range of personal finance and corporate loans, "signifies how even conservative conglomerates now view public capital as strategic, not just financial," Sengupta noted. Elsewhere, the wealth manager considers LG Electronics India's listing a "game changer." If successful, it will indicate foreign multinationals' interest in Indian markets given its "domestic retail flows and regulatory stability," he added. Among startups, Venturi's Chandan and Nicholas Cator are keeping a close eye on the listing of Lenskart, which is backed by Softbank, KKR and Temasek. Cator, founder and managing partner at Venturi, is curious about how much it can amass on the public market. "Lenskart has done well as a company, and its numbers are good. So, its listing will be a good indicator for private investors on how to value companies, especially in pre-IPO rounds." Other listings Carter and Chandan are watching include that of cleaning and personal care services provider Urban Company, which filed its documents in April and jewelry player Bluestone, which is gunning for unicorn status ahead of its IPO. Matthews Asia's Mittal foresees some marquee IPOs in India coming in at a 25% to 30% discount to the leading player in their space, unlike last year when many IPOs were priced at a premium. "Everybody wanted to take the valuation higher, but our expectation is that valuations are already normalizing, largely because some of the IPOs in the tail end of 2024 haven't really performed well," he said, naming Swiggy and Ola Electric as such companies that are now trading below their debut price. Going forward, Mittal and WRISE's Sengupta expect India's capital markets to be buoyant with new equity issuances and a potentially stronger listing pipeline as the country grows to soon become the fourth largest in the world. Modi and Trump disagree on U.S.' role in Pakistan ceasefire. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump Tuesday, in which he "clearly conveyed" that the South Asian nation "does not and will never accept mediation" in its conflict with Pakistan, according to a statement by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. India is considering expanding its production of rare earth elements. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India's aviation safety watchdog, said Tuesday it had inspected Air India's Boeing 787 fleet and did not find any major anomalies. Indian stocks were trading flat Thursday as investors weighed the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady, amid the ongoing Israel-Iran crisis. The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield was up at 6.291%. On CNBC TV this week, Dave Ernsberger, co-president of S&P Global Commodity Insights, discussed the necessity for India to build up its energy reserves, especially in light of potential disruptions to global oil supply. However, that goal cannot be met solely by expanding oil and gas production. Meanwhile, Anand Gupta, managing director at Allianz Global Investors, said that although India's defense sector has a "longevity of growth" and will gain market share, stocks are not trading at a "reasonable price." On Monday, the Purchasing Managers Index reports, which measure activity in India's manufacturing and services sectors, will be out. Multiple mainline companies will list publicly in the coming week, including recyclables company Aten Papers and Foam, solar pump manufacturer Oswal Pumps and construction supply company Arisinfra Solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google suffered a setback Thursday after an advisor to the European Union's top court recommended it dismiss the tech giant's appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro ($4.7 billion) antitrust fine. Juliane Kokott, advocate general at the European Court of Justice, advised the court to throw out Google's appeal and confirm the fine, which was reduced in 2022 to 4.125 billion euros from 4.34 billion euros previously by the EU's General Court. "In her Opinion delivered today, Advocate General Kokott proposes that the Court of Justice dismiss Google's appeal and, therefore, uphold the judgment of the General Court," the Luxembourg-based ECJ said in a press release Thursday. The fine relates to a long-running antitrust case surrounding Google's Android operating system. In 2018, the European Commission slapped Google with the record-breaking penalty on the grounds that it abused Android's mobile dominance to give unfair advantage to its own apps via pre-installation deals with smartphone makers. Google said it was "disappointed" with the ECJ advocate general's verdict, adding it "would discourage investment in open platforms and harm Android users, partners and app developers." "Android has created more choice for everyone and supports thousands of successful businesses in Europe and around the world," a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email. Though the advocate general's proposal is non-binding, judges tend to follow four out of five such non-binding opinions. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING — Avatars generated by artificial intelligence are now able to sell more than real people can, according to a collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and a popular livestreamer. Luo Yonghao, one of China's earliest and most popular livestreamers, and his co-host Xiao Mu both used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers in real time for well over six hours on Sunday on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform "Youxuan", the Chinese tech company said. In comparison, Luo's first livestream attempt on Youxuan last month, which lasted just over four hours, saw fewer orders for consumer electronics, food and other key products, Baidu said. Luo said that it was his first time using virtual human technology to sell products through livestreaming. Luo started livestreaming in April 2020 on ByteDance's short video app Douyin, in an attempt to pay off debts racked up by his struggling smartphone company Smartisan. His "Be Friends" Douyin livestream account has nearly 24.7 million followers. Luo's and his co-host's avatars were built using Baidu's generative AI model, which learned from five years' worth of videos to mimic their jokes and style, Wu Jialu, head of research at Luo's other company, Be Friends Holding, told CNBC on Wednesday. "This is a DeepSeek moment for China's entire livestreaming and digital human industry," Wu said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. DeepSeek, China's version of OpenAI, rattled global investors in January with its claims of rivaling ChatGPT at far lower costs and using an open-source approach. AI avatars can sharply reduce costs since companies don't need to hire a large production team or a studio to livestream. The digital avatars can also stream nonstop without needing breaks. "We have always been skeptical about digital people livestreaming," Wu said, noting the company had tried out various kinds of digital humans over the years. But he said that Baidu now offers the best digital human product currently available, compared to the early days of livestreaming e-commerce five or six years ago. Livestream shopping took off in China after the pandemic forced businesses to find alternative sales channels. Livestreaming generated so many sales on Douyin last year that the app surpassed traditional e-commerce company JD.com to become China's second-largest e-commerce platform — and ate into the market share of lead player Alibaba, according to a report from Worldpanel and Bain & Company last week. Both JD.com and Alibaba's Taobao also offer livestreaming sales portals. Meanwhile, other Chinese companies, including tech giant Tencent, have developed tools to create digital people that can be used as news anchors. In late 2023, several businesses started trying out virtual human livestreamers during the Singles Day shopping holiday. But analysts have cautioned that products sold via livestreams tend to have a high return rate as they are often impulse purchases. For example, Douyin has rolled out restrictions on using the technology, especially if the virtual people do not interact with viewers. While Luo's next virtual human appearance hasn't been set yet, Wu said he expects it will be very soon. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel and Iran's escalating conflict has significantly driven up the cost of insurance for ships sailing through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. Marine insurers are now charging 0.2% of the value of a ship for journeys into the Gulf, according to data from the world's largest insurance broker Marsh McLennan, up from 0.125% prior to Israel's surprise attack on Iran last week. There has also been an uptick in war risk insurance rates for the Red Sea, Marsh said, while cover relating to ports in Israel has more than tripled to 0.7%. The length of time quotes are valid for has been cut to 24 hours from most leaders, Marsh said, down from 48 hours previously. The scramble to reassess shipping insurance costs reflects the deteriorating security environment in the Middle East, with Israel and Iran continuing to exchange fresh air attacks over recent days. "Given that the situation is currently contained within the region, risks are still being placed to enable cargo to flow through these areas," Marcus Baker, global head of marine, cargo and logistics at Marsh, told CNBC by email. Some shipowners have recently opted to steer clear of the strategically important Strait of Hormuz, reaffirming a sense of industry unease amid the conflict. Jakob Larsen, head of security at Bimco, which represents global shipowners, said earlier this week that the escalating conflict was causing concerns in the shipowner community and prompting a "modest drop" in the number of ships sailing through the area. It is recognized as one of the world's most important oil chokepoints. The inability of oil to traverse through the Strait of Hormuz, even temporarily, can ratchet up global energy prices, raise shipping costs and create significant supply delays.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US State Department said on Wednesday that it's resuming its process for approving student visas and that applicants have to make their social media accounts public for review. "Our overseas posts will resume scheduling F, M, and J nonimmigrant visa applications soon," the department wrote in a notice, asking applicants to look out for interview appointment slots. F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas are for full-time academic and vocational students, as well as those entering the US on exchange. "To facilitate this vetting, all applicants for F, M, and J nonimmigrant visas will be instructed to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to 'public,'" the government notice added. But the State Department wrote that the social media reviews would be part of "a comprehensive and thorough vetting, including online presence." "Every visa adjudication is a national security decision," the department wrote. The decision follows State Secretary Marco Rubio's initial announcement in late May that his department was pausing all student visa applications as it determined new rules for social media checks. The department's spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, said at the time that Rubio and President Donald Trump were looking to only accept visitors who "understand what the law is, that they don't have any criminal intent, that they are going to be contributors to the experience here, however short or long their status." Rubio's initial decision had also come as the Trump administration barred Harvard University from enrolling foreign students. Much of the White House's tension with Harvard and other top US universities stems from the protests and rhetoric that spread on campus as violence and tensions flared in the Middle East after October 2023.</p>
