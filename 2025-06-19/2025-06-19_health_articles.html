                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Knee braces, water therapy and exercise are the most promising non-drug therapies for treating knee osteoarthritis, according to a new meta-analysis publishing June 18, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Yuan Luo of the First People's Hospital of Neijiang, China. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common and often debilitating condition that affects millions of older adults, causing pain and stiffening of the knee joint. Treatment often includes anti-inflammatory drugs, which are linked to gastrointestinal and cardiovascular adverse events. They looked at data from 139 clinical trials involving nearly 10,000 people to compare 12 different non-drug treatments. By combining results from all these studies into a powerful network meta-analysis, the team could rank the therapies based on how well they worked. Knee braces came out on top across most categories, including reducing pain, improving function, and relieving stiffness. Hydrotherapy-exercises or treatments performed in warm water-was particularly effective at easing pain and general exercise was also consistently effective, improving both pain and physical function. High-intensity laser therapy and shock wave therapy showed some benefits, while ultrasound consistently scored the lowest in effectiveness. However, they conclude that physical therapy has promising effects on KOA, offering potential treatments without the risks of anti-inflammatory drugs. The authors add: "Knee braces, hydrotherapy, and exercise are the most effective non-drug therapies for knee osteoarthritis. They reduce pain and improve mobility without the gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks linked to common pain medications. Patients and clinicians should prioritize these evidence-based options." "Our analysis of nearly 10,000 patients reveals that simple, accessible therapies like knee bracing and water-based exercise outperform high-tech options like ultrasound. This could reshape clinical guidelines to focus on safer, lower-cost interventions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intermittent fasting diets appear to have similar benefits to traditional calorie-restricted diets for weight loss, suggests an analysis of trial evidence published by The BMJ today. Alternate day fasting also demonstrates greater benefits compared with both calorie restriction and other intermittent fasting approaches, but the researchers say longer trials are needed to substantiate these findings. According to the World Health Organization in 2022, approximately 2.5 billion adults, 43% of the global adult population, were overweight, and about 890 million (16%) lived with obesity. Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of eating and fasting on a regular schedule and is becoming a popular alternative to traditional calorie-restricted diets, which are often unsustainable in the long term. While no clear definition exists for intermittent fasting, its various methods can fall under three broad categories: time restricted eating (eg, the 16:8 diet involving a 16 hour fasting period followed by an 8 hour eating window), alternate day fasting (a 24 hour fast on alternate days), and whole day fasting (eg, a 5:2 diet involving five days of unrestricted eating and two days of fasting). But the health effects of intermittent fasting compared with continuous caloric restriction or an unrestricted (ad-libitum) diet remain unclear. To address this, researchers analysed the results of 99 randomised clinical trials involving 6,582 adults (average age 45; 66% female) to compare the effect of intermittent fasting diets with continuous energy restriction or unrestricted diets on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors. All intermittent fasting strategies and continuous energy restriction diets may lead to small reductions in body weight when compared with an unrestricted diet. Alternate day fasting was the only intermittent fasting diet strategy to show a small benefit in body weight reduction compared with continuous energy restriction (mean difference -1.29 kg). Alternate day fasting also showed a small reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg and -1.05 kg respectively). However, these differences did not reach the minimally important clinical threshold of at least 2 kg weight loss for individuals with obesity, as defined by the study authors. Alternate day fasting was also linked to lower levels of total and "bad" cholesterol compared with time restricted eating. No benefit was found for blood sugar or "good" cholesterol levels in any diet strategy comparison. Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up. The researchers point to several limitations, such as high variation (heterogeneity) among the diet strategy comparisons, small sample sizes of many included trials, and low to moderate certainty of evidence in most of the investigated outcomes. Even so, this is highlighted as one of the first systematic reviews to combine direct and indirect comparisons across all dietary strategies, allowing for more precise estimates. As such, they conclude: "The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings." They point out that any structured intervention - including continuous energy restriction - could show benefits derived not only from the dietary pattern but also from professional support, planning, and nutritional education, while diet quality during free eating days could also affect alternate day fasting outcomes. The focus should be on fostering sustainable changes over time, they say. "Intermittent fasting does not aim to replace other dietary strategies but to integrate and complement them within a comprehensive, patient centred nutritional care model."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What is the myriad of processes by which generic variations in a population affect organisms' survival and allow reproduction in an ever-changing environment? Utah State University evolutionary biologist Zachariah Gompert explores chromosomal arrangements, where large chunks of chromosomes are inverted, moved, deleted or duplicated as a possible source of large-scale macromutations. Adaptive evolution is driven by natural selection, which generates populations better adapted for survival and reproduction. A current focus of debate is whether adaptive evolution relies on many mutations with small and roughly equal effects or if it is driven by one or a few mutations that cause major changes in traits and Darwinian fitness." Gompert, who has long studied fundamental questions in evolutionary genetics, including pursuing case studies of the genetic basis of adaption in stick insects (Timematidae) and butterflies (Lycaenidae), will continue study of these organisms, along with seed beetles (Chrysomelidae). He says the NIH funding will create multiple opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students to receive thorough education in basic research experimentation while exploring genomics research, and developing skills and experience in such areas as molecular biology and whole genome sequencing. "Through this research, participants will gain skills that are transferrable across diverse scientific disciplines. This expertise has application to biomedical research on the role of genomics in health sciences, as well as application to applied research in agricultural genetics - both of which are rapidly growing fields." In addition, he says, student researchers will develop knowledge of computational data analysis, ranging from traditional computational approaches to innovative methods in machine learning. "As an affiliated faculty member in USU's new Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Center, I anticipate collaborations with scholars beyond the Department of Biology who wish to pursue varied data science projects data generated from our efforts," Gompert says. "The NIH award opens great opportunities for our research here at Utah State and for our students and community partners."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The KCNT1 gene, for example, codes for a protein that maintains normal electrical activity in the brain and helps neurons communicate. But genes don't always function perfectly. For many people, a mutation of the KCNT1 gene causes no symptoms. For others, it can lead to dysfunction of neuronal activity causing learning disabilities, difficulty communicating, and a lifetime of treatment-resistant seizures. Associate Professor Matthew Weston and his team with the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC want to bring that number to zero. With a grant from Actio Biosciences, Weston is testing whether an Actio KCNT1 inhibitor that modulates potassium levels can reduce seizures. If successful, the inhibitor could offer a treatment for an aggressive form of epilepsy that significantly reduces life expectancy. So the idea is: If you give people a blocker that will limit that potassium flow, could you improve the disease?" The research is in its early stages, but initial results indicate that the KCNT1 inhibitor reduces seizures in mice. Given favorable pre-clinical data, Weston said the best-case scenario is that "the drug enters clinical trials and works not just to stop seizures, but maybe even improve some of the other symptoms." The inhibitor is on track to enter clinical trials, which would allow patients to receive the investigational drug as early as 2026. Actio Biosciences is a San Diego-based precision medicine company focused on drug development for genetic and rare diseases.
