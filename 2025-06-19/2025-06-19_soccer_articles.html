With a few days of fun, high-level play already in the books, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is off to a fantastic start.

Group play is already in full swing as clubs battle for position to advance to the knockout rounds. That stage of the tourney begins later this month, shrinking the event's field down from 32 teams to just 16, with the winner and runner-up of each group advancing.

From there on, it's pure chaos, just like the World Cup, only this time, instead of representing each player's native country, they're representing their club, which can sometimes lead to even higher-level play as these athletes are more used to playing alongside one another.

The U.S. is hosting every game of the tournament in venues around the country, giving fans across the nation a chance to catch a game.

Here's everything to know about the bracket and schedule moving forward:

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After definitively ending its four-game losing streak with a big 5-0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the US men's national team will look to book a spot in the Gold Cup quarterfinals when it takes on the invited guest team, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia squeaked out a 1-0 win against Haiti in its first game and it is expected to be one of the better teams in the tournament. The game is at Q2 Stadium in Austin Thursday where the US is 3-0 in competitive matches all-time, all sold out. The United States plays its second group-stage game, against Saudi Arabia, at 7:15 p.m. Mountain/8:15 p.m. Central on Thursday, June 19 at Q2 Stadium in Austin. The 7:15 p.m. MT/8:15 p.m. CT match between the United States and Saudi Arabia will be televised on FS1 in English and on TUDN and Univision. America won its opener against Trinidad and Tobago 5-0 and now leads Group D. Saudi Arabia won its opener against Haiti 1-0. It writes: "Both teams will be boosted by their opening day victories, but given USA's particularly impressive performance, we believe Pochettino's side will win this one." However, on home soil, the U.S. should manage to win this match, especially considering how Saudi Arabia were challenged quite hard by Haiti in their opener. There's a chance this match ends in a draw, which both sides will benefit from, but a win is on the table for the U.S. if they play well enough to snatch it."

Porto also played out a 0-0 tie in their first game of the competition, in a far more entertaining encounter with Brazil's Palmeiras, in a match which saw young striker Samu Aghehowa impress despite not getting on the scoresheet. Despite concerns over an apparent injury in training, head coach Javier Mascherano has confirmed that Lionel Messi is fit to play for Inter Miami in today's game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>City breached rules in nine league matches last season CEO Soriano excited by global impact of Club World Cup Manchester City have been fined more than £1m by the Premier League over delayed kick-offs or restarts related to nine matches last season. A league statement said: “Rules relating to kick-offs and restarts help ensure the organisation of the competition is set at the highest possible professional standard and provides certainty to fans and participating clubs. It also ensures the broadcast of every Premier League match is kept to schedule.” City, who were fined more than £2m last summer for 22 breaches of the kick-off and restart rules, are playing at the Club World Cup and their chief executive, Ferran Soriano, has said he is excited by the way the revamped 32-team tournament is driving football's globalisation. Pep Guardiola's side beat Morocco's Wydad 2-0 on Wednesday in Philadelphia in their opening group game as they began their defence of a title claimed two years ago in the competition's last seven-club iteration. Soriano said of the new format: “We are very excited by it. It's a great initiative and we are very happy to be here. “It's very important to be here because we are a global football club. But you can be local and relevant and faithful to the history of the club and the fans that support you, but you can also be global and show what we do – which we believe is beautiful football – to the world. It's a combination that works very well and we are proud.” Goals from Phil Foden and Jérémy Doku secured the defeat of Wydad as Guardiola gave debuts to Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki, two of his eight new recruits in the past two windows. Soriano said: “I'm happy with the work that we did. Last summer we only bought one new player [Savinho, while Ilkay Gündogan returned on a free transfer] but this year between the winter and the summer it will be eight new ones. We look for stability, the fact that Pep is going to be with us for 10 years shows that we are a stable club. We've had fantastic players like Kevin De Bruyne who spent a decade with us. That's a testament to his quality but also our stability.”</p>

When the U.S. Soccer Federation turned to Mauricio Pochettino in 2025, it wasn't just hiring a tactician—it was making a statement. Fresh off stints at PSG and Chelsea, the Argentine manager arrived with pedigree, pressure and a paycheck to match. The deal marked a shift in how the soccer federation values international leadership and what it's willing to pay for it. Mauricio Pochettino inked a two‑year contract when he took charge of the U.S. Men's National Team back in September 2024, with his term running through the 2026 World Cup on home soil. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino of the United States waves to fans prior to a game against the Costa Rica at Inter&Co Stadium on January 22, 2025. The deal was carefully structured: FIFA's build‑up schedule around the World Cup gives him just enough time to implement his high‑intensity style while leaving room for renewal if he delivers on expectations. Behind the scenes, U.S. Soccer inserted a sizeable buy‑out clause to protect against poaching by a major European club, signaling their intent to keep him through the tournament cycle. Mauricio Pochettino earns a reported $6 million per year, making him the highest‑paid head coach in USMNT history—nearly triple the $2.3 million earned annually by predecessor Gregg Berhalter, according to ESPN. This hefty sum is underpinned by the Federation and donors: hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin and partner Scott Goodwin funded much of the package as part of a “philanthropic leadership gift” earmarked for elite-level coaching. The investment marks a sharp turn for U.S. Soccer, reflecting a strategic commitment to elite leadership and signaling that they're willing to pay top dollar for international pedigree.

MIAMI — Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club said Thursday.

World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever.

Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday. But his hospitalization casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States.

Madrid said Mbappe would “undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment.”

Mbappe's absence is a blow to the tournament, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino hopes will be one of the elite events in soccer and rival competitions like the Champions League and Premier League in popularity and value.

After Lionel Messi, Mbappe is arguably the biggest star in the show, with Madrid one of the favorites to lift the trophy in the inaugural edition of the tournament.

But a crowd of more than 62,000 at Hard Rock Stadium missed out on a rare chance to see him in person in the U.S. when he was unavailable for Madrid's surprise 1-1 draw by Al Hilal on Wednesday.

Gastroenteritis is also known as stomach flu and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea.

Mbappe's hospitalization comes almost exactly one year after he sustained a broken nose at the European Championship and had to wear a face mask to continue playing in the tournament.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most of the core group was absent due to injuries, Club World Cup duties, or, in Christian Pulisic's case, a hotly debated need for rest. In their place, head coach Mauricio Pochettino refreshed the roster not just to evaluate fresh faces, but to ignite more competition in his player pool. A 4-0 loss to Switzerland in the team's final Gold Cup warm-up suggested Pochettino's omissions — the “football decisions,” in his words — had backfired. But a commanding 5-0 win over Trinidad and Tobago to open the tournament paused early doubts. After March's deflating Nations League defeats to Panama and Canada, Pochettino began challenging the team's internal standards. “If you arrive to the camp and you want to spend a nice time, play golf, go for a dinner, visit my family, visit my friend — is that the culture that we want to create? Because we need to create this culture about winning.” Pochettino insisted he wasn't punishing individual players for the Nations League losses. But we have to find the right balance.” So will center back Chris Richards, who has emerged as a leader this cycle and wore the armband against Türkiye. “There's a line that we kind of need to teeter-totter,” Richards said in Nashville, a few hours from his hometown in Alabama. “Sometimes in our off time, we'd want to go hang out with family a lot more than the guys are at the camp. But again, I think if you need to make this new culture with new guys, that you have to spend time with each other outside of the pitch. … It's finding the line between friends and family, but also blending both of them, so that we have a good culture both on and off the pitch.” Walker Zimmerman, a Georgia native and Nashville SC center back, echoed that view after starting against Switzerland. “He's just stressing the point that we need to be focused each and every day, especially in training,” Zimmerman said. “But I also think this staff is really good about, ‘Hey, when you have the day off, you can have the day off.' You gotta have a work-life balance and enjoy it.” “I am the first person with my coaching staff who likes the players to be able to have free time,” he said. What I always say is when you have your work done, when your responsibilities are covered, after, yes, we can do all that we want. What we can't do is not have all those things covered and I go out for a walk. If I don't have my work done, I can't go for a walk in Nashville to see the city. The Argentine circled back to an earlier comment he had made that drew attention: his criticism of golf outings and dinner plans during camp. [I want players] on the field that may fight as if there had been death,” Pochettino explained. “He talks about balance quite a lot, and mak[ing] sure that we understand that we need to be top professionals. Zimmerman added: “It's not like we're locked down at a hotel or anything like that, but from a culture standpoint, yeah, we're focusing on the intensity in trainings, the intensity in the games and being competitive as a group.” “Everybody's been focused on maximizing rest,” center back Mark McKenzie said. And then when we get back to the hotel, kick your feet up. We got a player's lounge and what not. So guys have time to laugh and joke and be together, continue to build on what we're doing, but most important is making sure we're ready for the next match.” But there could be more players on this Gold Cup roster than expected who will crack the squad or have a substantial role, and they'll all have been part of a process Pochettino is prioritizing — calibrating a culture — that is definitely on a tight schedule. “We're all professional,” midfielder Brenden Aaronson said ahead of Thursday's group stage match against Saudi Arabia. So for us, it was like, we're gonna go out there and be really, really focused on the tournament. I think we always are, but for him to say that, and he had something to say about it, so for us it was just tunnel vision. This is Pochettino's only tournament prior to the World Cup, and if the U.S. makes a deep run next summer, the intangible progress toward a winning culture will be spun as its legacy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boca Juniors fans get ready for the Club World Cup with chants and drums on Miami beach. The videos keep rolling across your social feeds: Boca Juniors fans on the beach in Miami, while Palmeiras fans light up Times Square. You'll hear it in the stands and see it in the scenes, too: River Plate fans belting out songs in Seattle and Flamengo supporters roaring during the individual player introductions. The FIFA Club World Cup may be a global tournament, but in the United States, it feels unmistakably South American. Teams from other regions look happy to be there, intrigued by the massive prize pots and eager to find international legitimacy. But in South America, this tournament provides an opportunity to recapture some of the past glories. Palmeiras in 1951 were crowned Copa Rio champions after beating Nice, Red Star Belgrade, and Juventus. It was the first intercontinental club tournament featuring teams from Europe and South America. River Plate did the same in 1986, overcoming Romania's Steaua București. "In 1950, Brazil lost the World Cup to Uruguay, and it was a huge blow. 1951 brought that back up and was celebrated not just by Palmeiras but also supporters of other teams," said Paulo Roberto, the leader of the U.S. chapter of Palmeiras supporters' group Mancha Verde, to ESPN. Those international trophies are huge sources of pride for the teams in South America who have them. This year, Real Madrid topped Concacaf's Pachuca 3-0 in the final. "This tournament brings together the elite of global football, and it's an honor to once again see the name of River among the leading figures," River Plate Secretary Stefano Di Carlo said. The economic realities of the current ecosystem mean South American clubs often are parting ways with their talent early, transferring off top academy players to keep funding the club and watching as they go on to stardom for big European clubs. "Players who used to play in our team are now playing in Liverpool, Manchester United, etc.," said Juan Pablo Pacheco, the leader of River Plate Texas. "We see them with the bright lights of playing in Europe, but kind of forget what it's like playing in South America. We're eager to play those teams and show that we still have it, even though our best players immigrate to Europe." But the games don't always go according to script. Di María, who scored from the penalty spot, clarified after the match that his hand gesture wasn't an apology to Boca fans, but a simple greeting to his family. And family is a thread that runs through all of this, another reason the tournament matters so much to South American fans. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. It's three generations of being Flamengo," said Renato Silva, a Flamengo fan who used to live in the U.S., but once again lives in Rio de Janeiro and is traveling for the tournament. These are always part of conversations in society. I think it's much more important for us than European teams." All those factors are important, but there's something else about the Club World Cup that shouldn't be underrated by those working to understand why these six clubs seem to care so much more than some of their fellow CWC hopefuls. There are many South American fans living and working in the U.S. who still keep up with their team, perhaps track it even more closely for that feeling of home when they're far away. Having old friends come visit to go see matches in gleaming stadiums? "It means a lot for us who have been abroad for a long time," said Mariano Bossana, the president of the Boca Juniors Consulate in Washington, D.C. "It's not only a pleasure and an opportunity to see Boca Juniors playing nearby, but also a source of pride to compete with some of the most respected teams around the world. It brings Boca back to the international stage." Being on the big international stage also is a huge opportunity to put their brand in front of fans all over the world, and crucially to do so in the U.S., where nearly every team -- Asian, European, African -- has put together activities to connect with existing fans and try to win over new ones. But South American clubs have stood out in both scale and passion. Botafogo has a space near Venice Beach called Venice House, where it hosts events, and supporters can drop by to hang out and meet fellow fans. A Botafogo House em Venice Beach já é sucesso dentro e fora de campo! 🌴⚽ Em parceria com a Secretaria de Turismo do Rio de Janeiro e a TurisRio, estamos promovendo os atrativos turísticos do nosso estado em plena Copa do Mundo de Clubes da FIFA.Turismo e futebol juntos,... pic.twitter.com/DzUYiFtqHC "Botafogo House will be a special place to honor everything we've built here," CEO Thairo Arruda said in a statement. River launched their English-language social media channels under the River Plate Global umbrella just before heading to the U.S. for the tournament, which opened with a 3-1 win over Urawa Red Diamonds on Tuesday. It's a key part of that club's strategy to continue converting new fans, as the club works through many of the financial issues that clubs in South America must deal with, ones that European teams backed by billionaires or private equity may not need to be concerned about. Since 2013, the club has gone through a deep transformation. It's a motivation that will push many more South American teams forward.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are no new alerts at this time MIAMI — Real Madrid forward Kylian Mbappe has been hospitalized with an acute case of gastroenteritis, the Spanish club said Thursday. World Cup winner Mbappe missed Madrid's opening game at the Club World Cup against Saudi Arabian team Al Hilal in Miami on Wednesday because of a fever. Coach Xabi Alonso said he hoped the France international would be available for the team's next game against Pachuca on Sunday. But his hospitalization casts doubt over what part he might be able to play in the monthlong tournament in the United States. Madrid said Mbappe would "undergo a series of tests and follow the appropriate course of treatment." Mbappe's absence is a blow to the tournament, which FIFA president Gianni Infantino hopes will be one of the elite events in soccer and rival competitions like the Champions League and Premier League in popularity and value. But a crowd of more than 62,000 at Hard Rock Stadium missed out on a rare chance to see him in person in the U.S. when he was unavailable for Madrid's surprise 1-1 draw by Al Hilal on Wednesday. Gastroenteritis is also known as stomach flu and symptoms can include vomiting and diarrhea. Mbappe's hospitalization comes almost exactly one year after he sustained a broken nose at the European Championship and had to wear a face mask to continue playing in the tournament.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>See you on Sat 6/21 JERSEY CITY, N.J. (June 19, 2025) - Gotham FC forward Mak Whitham has been named to the 20-player U.S. Under-17 Women's National Team roster for two upcoming friendlies against Japan. The first match is set for Friday, June 28, at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, with kickoff scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The game will stream live on Max in English and in Spanish on Telemundo Deportes' Facebook and YouTube channels. The second meeting between the two sides will take place on Monday, July 1, in a closed-door scrimmage at the University of Kansas Health System Training Center in Riverside, Missouri — the training facility of the Kansas City Current. The two-match series serves as preparation for the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, set for this November. Whitham is one of four NWSL players named to the U.S. roster. A native of California, Whitham made her NWSL regular-season debut earlier this year, entering as a substitute in Gotham FC's season opener against Seattle Reign FC. At 14 years old, she became the youngest player to appear in an NWSL regular-season match. This season, Whitham has made five regular-season appearances for Gotham FC, totaling 58 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AC Milan know Tijjani Reijnders' quality, but now others are seeing it in a more mainstream view, due to his move. Since joining Milan, most knew that Reijnders had a bit of something special about him. This season, that feeling only increased, as he became a more complete midfielder. After all, the club have greater problems to solve. The Dutchman has spoken heavily about his belief that Pep Guardiola can further him as a player; he has a track record when it comes to midfielders. “Rayan [Cherki] has incredible skill near the penalty area, incredible vision and passing, he has many, many qualities. Today was just the first game in very difficult conditions, but I am really happy that he is here. Now Milan look up to Man City and others in the Football Eco system. Selling your best player for cheap,in order to manage accounts. Where was ManCity before OilMoney took over? How do you sell the second best striker in club history for a mere 45M and our last Ballon D'Or winner for a mere 65M? We're also not under investigation for 100+ violations of league financial rules. Kaka was sold for Europe record then do your findings in that game Cherki was a flop, and Tij show quality. and Tij not just played “very well” but he's an engine for the team like he did for us. Its like yesterday that all these same cry babies were saying oh no we sold Tonali yhis guy will never be able to replace him….. First time i saw him i knew not inly he will but will be better then Tonali. I yhink we should have asked at least 70+ for him, but oh well, Jashari can be better in long term. The same people here who keep saying that the management is mediocre for seeling Rejnders are the same people who called the management mediocre when they bought him and kept saying he was average all last season before he moved to City. At that time they were saying he was a mediocre player, and that he was nowhere close to Tonali. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

But this isn't an unprecedented move: non-member guests have long been a part of Concacaf's tournament, and Saudi Arabia is now the eighth invitee to have debuted in the event. The Concacaf Gold Cup is an international competition for national teams in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Brazil (1996 and 2003) and Colombia (2000) reached the final, but no invited team has yet won the tournament. There was a 16-year period during which the competition was exclusive to regional teams, but guests resumed participation in 2021. In 2018, Concacaf established a partnership with the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) — which Saudi Arabia is a member of — setting up “a framework to strengthen collaboration, encourage knowledge exchange and further develop football in their respective territories.” This was specifically intended to increase competitive opportunities between the confederations. Last year, Saudi Arabia received an invitation to join the biannual Gold Cup this year and also in 2027. Saudi Arabia is also a country with geopolitical pull in the world of sport, specifically soccer. It will host the men's World Cup in 2034, considered a controversial decision for various reasons. The country, through its Public Investment Fund (PIF), is also a visible sponsor of this summer's Club World Cup competition, which features Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal. Last year, Saudi's PIF also signed a multi-year deal with Concacaf. That investment followed Aramco, one of the world's largest oil companies that is majority-owned by the Saudi government, becoming Concacaf's “official energy partner” for all its teams and competitions. It has reached a joint record of six Asian Cup finals and become a regular in the men's World Cups since debuting in 1994. It is currently ranked 58th in the world by FIFA. Several Saudi players are competing for Al Hilal, most notably Salem Al Dawsari, long established as one of the stars of Saudi soccer. While the U.S. enjoyed a dominant 5-0 win against Trinidad & Tobago in its opening match of the tournament, the team was up against a poorer version of its regional rival. It means this match on Thursday could serve as more of a litmus test. All teams, minus Saudi Arabia, have qualified for this year's Gold Cup through the latest edition of the Concacaf Nations League or the 2025 Gold Cup prelims. The guest list for the Gold Cup has also featured Colombia, Peru, South Korea, Ecuador, South Africa and Qatar. These teams have regularly made deep runs in the tournament, which may have eventually led to the decision by Concacaf to make the 2007 competition exclusively a regional one to provide local teams with more opportunity to compete as the tournament expanded. That was true until 2021, when, after a 16-year hiatus, Concacaf resumed inviting guests into the competition. As successful as guests may have been in the competition, the Gold Cup still has only ever produced three champions: Mexico (nine titles), the United States (seven) and Canada (one). In the same way that this Gold Cup is serving as a crucial test for the three regional hosts the U.S., Canada and Mexico ahead of next year's men's World Cup, the competition offers Saudi Arabia a meaningful bout of international experience ahead of 2026, too. The more exposure to diversity in competition, the better, especially considering Saudi Arabia has already signed on as guests for the Gold Cup in 2027 as well. The two have a brief history, most recently playing in September 2022 in Spain as a final tuneup before the 2022 World Cup (0-0 draw).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup is off and running. The tournament got started this past weekend in the United States and continues with group stage play currently underway for all 16 teams involved. The team had a four-match losing streak and doesn't have key players in the lineup for this tournament such as Christian Pulisic, Gio Reyna, Weston McKennie, Sergiño Dest, Tim Weah, Antonee Robinson and Tim Weah. The shutout victory must be a sigh of relief for head coach Mauricio Pochettino, who's dealing with a lot of pressure of getting this team on the right track before the World Cup arrives in North America (United States, Mexico and Canada) next summer. Saudi Arabia also won its opening match of the Gold Cup, earning a 1-0 victory over Haiti. Here's everything you need to know about USMNT's group stage game against Saudi Arabia on Thursday night: Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/France), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/England), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel/Germany), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC) Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/England); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/England), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/Canada), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/Spain), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/Netherlands) Our team of savvy editors independently handpicks all recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The organizers of two major events scheduled to take place in Los Angeles next year and in 2028 would be well advised to worry about one additional factor: Donald Trump. Trump has made public statements endorsing the Olympics and identifying himself with their successful outcome. L.A. won the 2028 games in 2017, during his first term. “These are America's Olympics,” he told Casey Wasserman, the chair of the local organizing committee, during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago reported by Axios. “These are more important than ever to L.A. and I'm going to be supportive in every way possible and make them the greatest games.” Over just the last week, for example, he ordered immigration authorities to cease their raids on agricultural and hospitality sites, evidently on appeals from his own supporters who cited their need for immigrant laborers. But he reversed himself days later, ordering the raids to resume. Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner. You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. Two administration initiatives in particular could directly affect the World Cup and Olympics. Up to now, the policy has been haphazardly applied, through scattershot raids on locations such as Home Depot parking lots. It's easy to see what a Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics has to offer the International Olympic Committee. Immigration roundups across the U.S. have instilled fear in immigrant communities, prompting many to stay home from work or school. Of those countries, 25 are in Africa, but countries in Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific are also named. In 2018, when FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, was judging bids to host the 2026 World Cup, Trump assured FIFA that “all eligible athletes, officials and fans from all countries around the world would be able to enter the United States without discrimination.” But concerns remain that family members of participating athletes might face restrictions on entering the U.S. Those concerns could hardly be assuaged by a comment from Vice President JD Vance, chair of a government task force overseeing preparations for the World Cup, at a task force meeting attended by FIFA president Gianni Infantino. He was referring to Kristi Noem, secretary of Homeland Security, whose agency has been conducting the immigration raids and border detentions. Just last week, Customs and Border Protection, a subagency of Homeland Security, stated in a social media post that it would be “suited and booted, ready to provide security for the first round of games” of FIFA's Club World Cup preliminary tournament. The authority of immigration agents to provide security or conduct civil law enforcement activities is legally uncertain. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event,” a Homeland Security spokesperson told me by email. The White House didn't respond to my request for comment. There already are signs that Trump's immigration crackdown is suppressing ticket sales for international soccer games in the U.S. That appears to be the case with an opening game of Club World Cup, scheduled for Saturday between Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer club featuring Lionel Messi as player-captain, and the Egyptian team Al Ahly at Hard Rock Stadium outside Miami. Notwithstanding his statements of support for the Los Angeles Olympics, since taking office in January, Trump's feelings for L.A. have turned distinctly negative. On June 7, he called in the California National Guard and subsequently mobilized the Marines to quell street protests in downtown L.A. against immigration raids. Trump stepped up his battle with local authorities on Sunday, when he posted a statement on his Truth Social platform pledging to “expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.” We asked back in December whether the Sochi Winter Olympics, which formally begin Friday, were heading for disaster, what with terrorist threats, an uncooperative climate, cost overruns and corruption on a scale imaginable only in Russia. Los Angeles has a lot hanging on successful World Cup events and the Olympics, though it's hard to pinpoint how much, financially speaking. Projections of economic gains from major sporting events are typically optimistic, euphoric, chimerical or conjectural. The Olympic gains are even tougher to estimate. My colleagues Thuc Nhi Nguyen and Dakota Smith reported recently that local Olympics organizers have expressed confidence that they'll reach their goal of $2.5 billion in sponsorship revenue and about as much coming from ticket sales and other commercial income. As my colleague Steve Henson reported in March, Wasserman has assured the International Olympic Committee that “irrespective of politics today, America will be open and accepting to all 209 countries for the Olympics. L.A. is the most diverse city in the history of humanity and we will welcome the people from around the world and give them all a great time.” He said he had made “significant strides” in getting assurances from Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio that obtaining visas shouldn't be a problem. Promoters of major international sporting events always maintain that the games are “nonpartisan” and nonpolitical. That's true up until the point that they're not, as was demonstrated when former President Jimmy Carter ordered a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics to protest Russia's invasion of Afghanistan. Russia retaliated by boycotting the 1984 games (in Los Angeles). Will Trump's politics poison the upcoming soccer and Olympic events? It's not clear at this moment, but the organizers are undoubtedly crossing their fingers. L.A. Times Insights delivers AI-generated analysis on Voices content to offer all points of view.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Cup champion and National Women's Soccer League legend Meghan Klingenberg announced her retirement from professional soccer on Wednesday in a letter shared on social media. The post, which was a collaboration with the U.S. women's national team and U.S. Soccer, started, “This isn't a surprise. She also added a cheeky caption which read, “Now available for charity matches, Sunday brunches and pool parties… preferably all in the same day.” She played there until a 2015 trade sent her to Portland. Later in the day, Klingenberg sat down with former teammates Becky Sauerbrunn and Lindsey Horan to discuss her decision on the first episode of the new U.S. Soccer Podcast, which she will co-host alongside David Gass and Alejandro Bedoya. In addition to joining the podcast, Klingenberg is also a founding partner in lifestyle brand and media company Re-inc., alongside Tobin Heath, Christen Press and Megan Rapinoe.
