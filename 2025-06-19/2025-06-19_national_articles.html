                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some segments of the U.S. restaurant industry don't support President Donald Trump's proposal to eliminate federal taxes on tips, saying it would help too few people and obscure bigger issues in the way tipped workers are paid. Even some workers who rely on tips say they oppose making them tax-deductible. “I think there's a huge hole in this concept of ‘no tax on tips' because a lot of restaurant workers aren't receiving tips in the first place,” said Elyanna Calle, a bartender in Austin, Texas, and president of the Restaurant Workers United union. For now, making tips tax-free appears to have broad support among lawmakers. Both Trump and his Democratic rival in last year's U.S. presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris, campaigned on the concept. The House included it in a tax cuts package approved last month. The bill would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for people working in jobs that have traditionally received them as long as they make less than $160,000 in 2025. The Senate Finance Committee passed a modified version on Monday. Senators capped deductions at $25,000 and want to phase them out for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000. The Finance Committee specified that “cash tips” qualify but said the term applied to tips paid in cash, charged to credit cards or received from other employees under a tip-sharing arrangement. The National Restaurant Association, a trade organization that represents nearly 500,000 U.S. restaurants and bars, applauded the House's passage of Trump's spending bill and said it wants to see tax-free tips. But the U.S. restaurant industry has more than 12 million workers, including dishwashers and chefs, according to government data. The coalition wants Congress to eliminate taxes on service charges, which are being used to compensate employees at an increasing number of restaurants. Skandalos tried pooling servers' tips and distributing them but ran into rules preventing that. He tried raising his menu prices and explaining that a percentage of each order was going to employee compensation, but customers didn't understand and kept tipping. Skandalos now has a gratuity-free policy at his restaurant, Maialina. He charges a 20% service fee that is distributed to all employees and helps pay for benefits like paid vacation and parental leave. Skandalos said “no tax on tips” doesn't acknowledge restaurants like his that are trying to distribute pay more equally. He would like to see service charges exempted from taxes. “This bill is a very good start in terms of trying to leave more money in people's pocketbooks, but now let's finish what we started and make it a great thing for the restaurant industry overall,” he said. But Ted Pappageorge, the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, said restaurants should just pay their kitchen workers more to compensate for servers earning tips. Pappageorge wants Congress to take up a separate bill introduced by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford that would eliminate taxes on tips but also require restaurants to pay workers at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. Yolanda Garcia, a barista at Resorts World in Las Vegas and a member of the Culinary Workers Union, also supports Horsford's bill. Garcia said she makes $33,000 a year, including up to $600 per month in tips. Tips are never guaranteed, she said, but if they were tax-free, it would help make up for that uncertainty. Right now, the price of everything has gone up,” Garcia said. Calle, the Austin bartender and union leader, said she also benefits from tips, but they're inconsistent. She suspects tipping would decline if the tax-free provision passes, because customers will resent it. For Calle, the underlying problem that must be solved is low base pay. “I think that if we continue to make the shift into relying on tips for people, it gives incentives for companies to not raise wages,” she said.</p>

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a briefing as the world awaits President Donald Trump's decision on whether or not to strike Iran.

The press conference is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m.

THE US IS DEBATING USING ITS ‘BUNKER-BUSTER' BOMB ON IRAN: HOW THE WEAPON WORKS

Trump has been under heavy pressure from all sides since the beginning of the Israel-Iran war to intervene or stay out of the conflict. Israel needs the U.S.'s 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs to hit Iran's Fordow underground nuclear enrichment facility.

Reports suggest that Trump has approved the strikes, but is holding off on the final call to see if Tehran will come to the negotiating table.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Conflict rages: A new wave of Iranian missiles hit Israel today, with a major hospital in the south sustaining “extensive damage,” according to officials. Israel also attacked Iran's “inactive” Arak nuclear facility, with no major damage reported. • US weighs options: President Donald Trump has reviewed attack plans for Iran but is waiting to see whether Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a source told CNN. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will travel to Turkey this weekend, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported Thursday. Araghchi will attend a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an intergovernmental group that largely comprises Muslim-majority countries, Tasnim reported. The meeting will take place Saturday and Sunday in Istanbul, it said. A special session to address the conflict between Iran and Israel will also take place at the summit, according to Tasnim. Among Thursday's dead are multiple children, Gaza health officials said, including two who were killed after several homes in Jabalia al-Balad, in northern Gaza, came under Israeli fire. In the Al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, three children sheltering in a tent were killed by the bombardment, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Other children appeared lifeless as they were carried into the ward. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment. The United Nations repeated its warnings Thursday that famine is growing increasingly likely and that there are few areas left in the territory where Palestinians are safe from bombardment. Attacks on civilians attempting to access food supplies continue, hospitals are overstretched and 55,000 pregnant women are facing growing health risks, according to the most recent report from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. More than 55,160 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel's war with Hamas began on October 7, 2023, according to the health ministry, including more than 17,000 children. Satellite images show that Israeli strikes on Iran's Arak Nuclear Facility breached the containment dome of the “inactive” heavy water reactor's containment dome and damaged heavy water distillation towers. CNN's Jeremy Diamond gained access to a residential and commercial building destroyed by an Iranian ballistic missile in Ramat Gan, just to the east of Tel Aviv. Iran has issued a new threat to any “third party” thinking about getting involved in its conflict with Israel, threatening an “immediate” response. As the conflict between Iran and Israel stretches to a week, the council said that Iran has plans in place for various scenarios. US President Donald Trump is considering entering the conflict but has signaled he's yet to make a decision. He has reviewed attack plans but is holding off to see if Tehran steps back from its nuclear program, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. The US military has taken several steps to protect its assets and equipment in the Middle East as the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, including evacuating all non-sheltered planes from its sprawling base in Qatar and moving US Navy ships stationed in Bahrain, two defense officials told CNN. US Central Command has also pre-positioned additional supplies of blood in the region, the officials and a source familiar said, which is standard operating procedure any time there is a possibility of an attack on US forces. The non-sheltered American planes were moved out of Al Udeid airbase in Qatar earlier this week, an official confirmed after satellite imagery showed that the area had been emptied. But if he does, Tehran has threatened to retaliate directly against the US. Iran has dozens of proxy groups in the region that can launch ballistic missiles and drones at US forces and bases. In January 2024, three US service members were killed and dozens were wounded after an Iran-backed Shia militia launched a drone attack at Tower 22, a US base on the border of Syria and Iraq. Iran's foreign minister asked Israelis to avoid being near “military and intelligence sites” as his country continues to carry out strikes. Abbas Araghchi said on X that Iran's military “accurately” eliminated an Israeli command, control and intelligence headquarters, “and another vital target,” but he did not identify the location. He said the “blast wave” caused “superficial damage” to the nearby Soroka Medical Center, which he claims was treating Israeli soldiers injured in Gaza. “Hundreds of innocent Iranians have been murdered in cold blood since Israel launched its illegal war against the Iranian people last week,” Araghchi said. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to attend the meeting between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy at the White House Thursday afternoon, a source familiar told CNN. The meeting, which was originally scheduled for last week, comes amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran and as President Donald Trump mulls US military involvement. Lammy is expected to travel from the US to Geneva for a meeting Friday between the Iranian foreign minister and British, French, German and EU foreign ministers. As of Thursday morning, Witkoff was not expected to attend that meeting. Civilians can now leave protected spaces after sirens stopped sounding in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and its surroundings on Thursday. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Beer Sheva, Israel, where a hospital was struck during an Iranian attack. Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.” There have been dozens of injuries but no reported deaths from the strike. If Iran's Fordow nuclear facility were damaged or destroyed in a strike by the US, it would likely lead to a limited radiation leak in the immediate area, but it would not pose the same catastrophic consequences as bombing a nuclear reactor, experts told CNN. Kelsey Davenport, the Director for Nonproliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, said that if bombs were able to penetrate Fordow, it would likely lead to “some limited radiation from the uranium enriched and stored at the facility,” but “it's unlikely to cause significant, widespread environmental health contamination.” She explained that attacking a site where uranium hexafluoride gas — the material fed into the facility's centrifuges — is stored “is going to create chemical toxicities” and “low level alpha radiation,” which would likely be localized to the site. Davenport said that it would likely be “manageable if people are wearing the right protective equipment.” “There isn't a major radiation dispersal risk at Fordow because that enriched uranium is fresh,” explained Scott Roecker, the Vice President for Nuclear Materials Security at NTI. “It'd be localized around the site, and because it's buried underground too, I don't know you know how much of that would even be released,” he said. “You risk a reactor meltdown, widespread radiation and environmental contamination, devastating to the region,” she said. On a visit to the Soroka Medical Center in the city of Beer Sheva, which was damaged in Iranian strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the United States is “already helping a lot” in his country's conflict with Iran. “They're participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities,” Netanyahu told CNN among a group of reporters. Israel has never acknowledged its nuclear weapons program and American presidents, certainly aware of Israel's nuclear capabilities, have helped keep secret the closely held details of the program. But Israel is one of nine countries known to have nuclear weapons. Israel began exploring nuclear weapons development before its establishment in 1948, then at a secret development site in 1958, near the southern town of Dimona. In 1968, the CIA issued a report that said Israel had successfully started production of nuclear weapons. Israel is believed to have conducted a clandestine atmospheric nuclear test in 1979, which it denies. Its program has been expanding for years, experts say. It is continuing to modernize its stockpile, according to SIPRI, who said that Israel conducted a test of a missile propulsion system in 2024 that could be related to its Jericho family of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. Israel also appears to be upgrading its plutonium production reactor site at Dimona, SIPRI said. In an interview with CNN in May 2018 – shortly after Israel stole Iran's nuclear archive from Tehran – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked if he was ready to acknowledge Israel's own program. Israel has not signed the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and opposes diplomatic efforts to establish a WMD Free Zone in the Middle East. Israel has signed and ratified the 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, which obligates signatories not to explode a nuclear device in the atmosphere or oceans. Iran fired more missiles at Israel today, the Israeli military said, adding that “defensive systems are operating to intercept the threat.” Sirens sounded in the northern city of Haifa and its surroundings. It comes after Israel was hit by a new wave of Iranian missiles earlier. Israel's health ministry says at least 271 people were admitted to hospital this morning following Iranian strikes across the country. In Soroka, where a hospital was hit by an Iranian missile, 71 people were mildly injured, according to the ministry. Iran said it was targeting an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.” Since Israel started its operation “Rising Lion” on Friday, more than 2,300 people in Israel have been hospitalized but most have been discharged, the ministry says. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that “all of Israel is paying a price” amid the country's conflict with Iran, as he visited the Soroka Medical Center in the southern city of Beer Sheva that was damaged in Iranian strikes The prime minister claimed that while Israel is hitting military sites only, Iran “targets and hit a hospital.” “They hit a hospital where people can't even get up and run away,” he told reporters at the scene, adding that Iran “hit not far from here where there's a ward for children and babies.” Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that it had targeted an Israeli intelligence and command center “near a hospital.” The Israeli military confirmed that its fighter jets struck dozens of military targets in Iran overnight, including the “inactive” Arak nuclear facility. While many shops remain shut, most supermarkets and banks are still open and still frequented by the people who have remained in the city. And basic services are still very much in operation. The people who remain here are trying to go about their business. Following scenes of large lines of cars leaving Tehran — after US President Donald Trump this week warned residents of the city to evacuate — queues at gas stations have dramatically shortened, perhaps because so many people have fled. Talks between Iran, the UK, Germany, France and the European Union planned for tomorrow in Switzerland are happening in consultation with the Trump administration, a diplomat from a western European country told CNN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And you've got no idea whether he will. Donald Trump's riffing ahead of the most wrenching national security decision in either of his presidencies is nothing like the complex war-gaming and careful tilling of public opinion that most commanders in chief require before they send Americans off to fight. He wants to keep friends and foes guessing. He's shown that he believes unpredictability and volatility — factors that most presidents seek to avoid in national security crises — offer him a key advantage. His equivocating creates space for him to postpone the moment of decision and to avoid locking in definitive courses of action he can't reverse. But there's not much evidence that strategy transfers from a real estate magnate's boardroom to complex geopolitical showdowns and global peacemaking. Iran's ayatollahs, Israel, US allies, members of Congress, pundits, reporters and Americans watching at home can never be certain what Trump might do next. Trump is no JFK calmly averting nuclear war with high-pressure diplomatic chess during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Trump's critics have dreaded the moment when he'd face the kind of international crisis he largely avoided during his first term. His administration has yet to take the American people into its confidence and explain why it has suddenly changed its view that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. Now, Trump says it's weeks away from one. There's no sign the administration intends to seek authorization from Congress for a possible new act of war against Iran — as the Constitution requires. And it's refusing to say whether it's gamed out how an attack on Iran's nuclear plant at Fordow could reverberate through a treacherous region and whether it has any kind of exit strategy. But following Washington's disastrous history of plunging into quagmires caused by paltry planning for the day after shock-and-awe beginnings, it's tempting fate. And Trump's serial dishonesty and scorched-earth leadership style mean millions of Americans will need a lot more than his word to trust any decision to wage military action. He must decide whether US interests are served by joining Israel's assault on Iran to try to destroy the Islamic Republic's nuclear program with unique bunker-busting capabilities that only the United States possesses. A third US aircraft carrier group is moving toward the Middle East. A fierce war of words between Trump and Iran's clerical leaders is heating up. And the president is huddling in daily Situation Room meetings with his top national security aides. CNN reported on Wednesday that the president is preoccupied with finding a way to strike key targets of Iran's nuclear program without being dragged into a full-scale war. Sources familiar with the matter said he wants to avoid the kind of open-ended conflict like those in Iraq and Afghanistan that he's vowed to avoid and that he used as a catalyst for his rise among MAGA voters skeptical of war. These revelations might offer Americans some comfort since they suggest that the president is weighing the implications of his decisions with greater diligence than his offhand patter suggests. No one expects Trump to put US troops on the ground — they could be a sitting target in Iran or in any post-war failed state insurgency, as happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump's first-term assassination raid that killed Iranian intelligence chief Qasem Soleimani didn't unleash fury against US targets that many analysts expected. And US bases in the region are heavily defended against missile attacks. There's also some question about how much Iran's degraded military can now throw at the US and Israel. But US foreign policy of the last 25 years is haunted by false assumptions about the behavior of adversaries when they are attacked. As Trump said himself last month in Saudi Arabia, US officials were often meddling in societies they didn't understand. So, it's fair to ask whether Trump has any idea what he's getting into. A watching world is no wiser after the president's public appearances Wednesday. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,” Trump told reporters who asked him about his plans for Iran as he unveiled two massive flagpoles at the White House. Later, in the Oval Office, Trump told CNN's Kaitlan Collins that he hadn't made a final decision on what to do as he's besieged by pressure for action by Israelis and warnings from his own MAGA base to stay out of foreign wars. “I have ideas as to what to do, but I haven't made a final — I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, you know, because things change.” “It's obviously unclear where his head is at right now. I think he was pretty indecisive on the subject of Iran, which I can understand,” California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said on “The Situation Room.” But I don't think we got much guidance as to whether he is optimistic about talks with Iran leaning in towards a potential strike on Iran,” Schiff said, reacting to one of Trump's meandering press availabilities. “It was pretty nebulous, the kind of usual stream-of-consciousness.” Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is part of a group of senior lawmakers who are given access to the most sensitive classified information. We're supposed to know,” Warner told CNN's Kasie Hunt. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confronted by Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin during a hearing on Wednesday. Slotkin speaks from experience: She was a CIA officer who completed combat tours in Baghdad after the George W. Bush administration's disastrous lack of forethought for how to win peace in Iraq. “Have you commissioned any day-after planning?” Slotkin asked. “Any force protection, any use of ground troops, in Iran; any cost assessments, because I don't think we doubt what we can do as a country, and in the attack. It's the day after with Iraq and Afghanistan that so many of us have learned to be so deeply concerned about. “We have plans for everything, Senator,” he said. “I have a plan for everything, but we'll see what happens,” he told reporters on the Oval Office. The president also says he's open to diplomacy. But there's no sign of a James Baker-style peace shuttle. Far from offering his adversary a face-saving off-ramp. Trump is demanding total surrender at the outset. While this may match Israel's goals, it's a nonstarter for Iran's revolutionary corps of leaders in Tehran, who've founded their regime on more than 45 years of defying successive American presidents. Trump often seems to be operating in a parallel universe. “We are not begging for anything,” Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. His administration shows little skill in creating openings and multilayered negotiating scenarios that can loosen entrenched positions. When interlocutors demur, the process grinds to a halt. “Anything could happen,” he said, when asked if the regime in Iran could fall in a response which exemplifies his entire presidency.</p>

PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico (AP) — Powerful Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The hurricane's center was located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Punta Maldonado. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 125 mph (205 kph). It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center said. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 129 mph (210 kph). Agricultural fields blanket the low-lying coastal area between small fishing villages. Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it crashes into the coastal mountains of southern Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane center said. The storm threatened to unleash destructive winds near where the eye crashes ashore, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge, forecasters said. At first light Thursday, Acapulco awoke under ominous dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach. Still, it appeared Acapulco had dodged the worst at least in terms of Erick's strong winds. Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied. Acapulco residents had braced for Erick's arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Otis two years earlier. The city of nearly 1 million was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday. Carlos Ozuna Romero, 51, lost his restaurant at the edge of an Acapulco beach when Otis slammed the resort with devastating winds. On Wednesday, he directed workers storing tables and chairs. “Authorities' warnings fill us with fear and obviously make us remember everything we've already been through,” Ozuna Romero said in reference to Otis. Elsewhere, workers nailed sheets of plywood over shop windows and stacked sandbags outside doorways. Cars lined up to fill their tanks and shoppers made last-minute purchases before rushing home. “Now it's not going to catch us by surprise,” she said, holding out a bag of canned food as evidence. In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Forecasters expected Erick to lash Mexico's Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center's advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain. Laura Velázquez, Mexico's national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring “torrential” rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes across Guerrero. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification — when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours — which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.</p>

Vanessa Hernández, known by her stage name Nezza, sang a Spanish rendition of the United States' national anthem at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night, and she claimed the team wished she did not. Now, the singer is saying she has since received death threats for her performance. Nezza, wearing a Dominican Republic shirt while performing, posted a video on TikTok of a team employee telling her, "We are going to do the song in English today." Nezza decided to sing the Spanish version anyway, saying in a later TikTok video that it was in response to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence in Los Angeles that has led to protests and unrest in the city. Nezza said she has received death threats since her Spanish rendition of the national anthem. Anything that involves politics is going to include a death threat here and there," Nezza said to TMZ Sports. "The main thing I've seen seeing is that it's disrespectful. If both songs were made into a music video, it'd be the exact music video. I think being a proud American and still wanting better for your country can still be the same truth, and I think people are forgetting that." Nezza attends a Creator Screening in support of "IF" at The London West Hollywood at Beverly Hills on May 9, 2024 in West Hollywood, California. Nezza said she has also received support from celebrities in the Latin community, which "outweighs" the hate. "It's been really sweet to see people you idolize be on the right side of history…" she said. "I already knew in my heart what I did was right, but this just triple-confirms it." In the aforementioned TikTok, Nezza said she "just felt like I needed to" sing the Spanish version - but now she does "not feel welcome back" at Dodger Stadium. Other Los Angeles-based professional sports teams have taken a stance, including the NWSL's Angely City F.C., which gave fans "Immigrant City Football Club" T-shirts at their game on Saturday. Players were also seen warming up with the t-shirts on before their match to show support for those protesting. Fox News' Scott Thompson contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Iran remains undeterred by President Donald Trump's calls for surrender in its conflict with Israel, the president is considering using a “bunker-buster” bomb to take out a critical Iranian nuclear facility. Fordow, a key nuclear enrichment site in Iran, was found to have 60% enriched uranium last month, according to the Washington Post. Once uranium reaches 90% enrichment, it can be used to fuel a nuclear weapon. While Israel has already damaged Natanz, one of Iran's nuclear facilities, Fordow remains untouched. Left unchecked, there is concern that the Iranians could use this facility to build a nuclear weapon quickly, prompting Trump to consider hitting the facility with a “bunker-buster” bomb as a proactive measure to cripple Iran's nuclear capabilities. Here is everything you need to know about the United States's “bunker-buster” bomb. Trump approved Iran attack plans on Tuesday but still not ready to pull trigger According to Air Force Global Strike Command, their stealth and ability to carry significant weight make them the only planes capable of successfully delivering the GBU-57. Typically, each plane can carry two bombs at a time. Trump has received repeated requests from Israel to come alongside its forces to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, namely its Fordow nuclear enrichment site, Axios reported. It is unclear whether the weapon would successfully destroy Iran's key nuclear facilities. “And so, where does that lead you?” she continued. … If we leave it only partly disabled, that gives Iran every incentive to run for a bomb.” An Iranian official said Wednesday that any U.S. military intervention on behalf of Israel, including bombing Iran's Fordow nuclear facility, would risk “all-out war,” CBS News reported. An Iranian missile has already damaged the U.S. Embassy in Israel, though no military bases have been hit and no U.S. lives have been lost. Trump has reportedly approved attack plans on Iran but, as of Wednesday night, had not made a call on whether to proceed. U.S. support may be necessary to take out Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Israel's defense minister has since hinted at an intention to kill what he deemed the “modern Hitler.” “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader' is hiding,” Trump said of Khamenei in a Tuesday post on Truth Social. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers.</p>

Paul Pierce responds to LeBron James' comments pushing back on "ring culture" and disagrees, posing the question of "What do we play for? The viral confrontation between LeBron James and Stephen A. Smith seems to have everlasting effects. After a Los Angeles Lakers game against the New York Knicks back in March, the two had what Smith called an "unexpected" incident in which the NBA's all-time leading scorer voiced his concerns about Smith's remarks about his son, Bronny. Smith had been critical of the Lakers' use of Bronny and his father's apparent handling of the situation, but Smith said on Wednesday's "First Take" that there was a further reason for the courtside interaction. "I have nothing to say about that. "He hid behind his son, tried to make something out of nothing, as if I was dogging his son, which I was not. The real issue was we don't like each other. And he used that as an excuse to confront me. Smith, though, said he is keeping his personal feelings about James away from his analysis of him. "He's one of the greatest players who's ever lived. When he does great, I'm gonna applaud. When he doesn't do great, I'm not gonna applaud." At the time of the incident, Smith suggested the interaction had been between a pair of fathers, more than an exchange between a basketball player and a sports television star. Smith also said that he would be open to having further discussions with James privately, saying the Lakers star "knows how to get in contact with (him) if he wanted to." Smith added that if a one-on-one discussion had happened with James, the sports commentator would have told the four-time NBA MVP that he would "never speak negatively" about Bronny, who split time in the NBA and G-League throughout the 2024-25 season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rescue workers transport a person in a body bag after floods swept through the area in Mthatha, South Africa, Thursday, June 12, 2025. JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South Africa was under a declared state of national disaster on Thursday as the death toll from floods caused by severe rains in the Eastern Cape region rose to 92. The Eastern Cape government honoured the victims of last week's floods with a provincial Day of Mourning and a memorial service at King Sabatha Dalindyebo Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) College in Mthatha, one of the few schools whose infrastructure remained intact. “Since June 9, this province has been hit hard by unprecedented, catastrophic and unimaginable disasters, where in the whole of the province, about 92 people have perished,” said Williams. It is the first time we have experienced so many dead bodies, some of whom have not yet been found.” An extreme weather front brought heavy rain, strong winds and snow to parts of the province caused flooding in one of South Africa's poorest provinces last week, leaving dozens dead and roads, houses, schools and other infrastructure damaged. At least two school children who were washed away in a bus are among the unverified number of missing persons according to local media reports, while thousands have since been displaced. Authorities have appealed for residents to report missing people so rescuers could better understand how many people they were still looking for. Religious leaders from different Christian religions were among the hundreds of mourners who attended the memorial ceremony, lighting candles as a symbolic expression of remembering the 92 people who died in the floods. In a government notice on Wednesday, Elias Sithole, director of the National Disaster Management Centre, said severe weather had caused property damage. The declaration allows the government to release funding for relief and rehabilitation and will remain in place until it lapses or until the conditions can no longer be categorised as such and is revoked by the head of the centre. President Cyril Ramaphosa recently visited the town of Mthatha, in Eastern Cape province, where the floods hit hardest. Many of the Eastern Cape flood victims lived on floodplains close to rivers. Government officials said poor neighbourhoods with informal dwellings were most severely impacted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vox helps you cut through the noise with clear, useful journalism. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? “I should have thought of this 10 years ago,” Yoshua Bengio says. The science fiction author Isaac Asimov once came up with a set of laws that we humans should program into our robots. As you can probably guess, its core mission is to make sure AI won't harm humanity. Both because of AI's present harms (like bias against marginalized groups) and AI's future risks (like engineered bioweapons), there are very strong reasons to think that slowing down would have been a good thing. In fact, they created autonomous AIs known as AI agents, which can view your computer screen, select buttons, and perform tasks — just like you can. Whereas ChatGPT needs to be prompted by a human every step of the way, an agent can accomplish multistep goals with very minimal prompting, similar to a personal assistant. Right now, those goals are simple — create a website, say — and the agents don't work that well yet. But Bengio worries that giving AIs agency is an inherently risky move: Eventually, they could escape human control and go “rogue.” So now, Bengio is pivoting to a backup plan. If he can't get companies to stop trying to build AI that matches human smarts (artificial general intelligence, or AGI) or even surpasses human smarts (artificial superintelligence, or ASI), then he wants to build something that will block those AIs from harming humanity. Scientist AI won't be like an AI agent — it'll have no autonomy and no goals of its own. Instead, its main job will be to calculate the probability that some other AI's action would cause harm — and, if the action is too risky, block it. AI companies could overlay Scientist AI onto their models to stop them from doing something dangerous, akin to how we put guardrails along highways to stop cars from veering off course. I talked to Bengio about why he's so disturbed by today's AI systems, whether he regrets doing the research that led to their creation, and whether he thinks throwing yet more AI at the problem will be enough to solve it. A transcript of our unusually candid conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. When people express worry about AI, they often express it as a worry about artificial general intelligence or superintelligence. Do you think that's the wrong thing to be worrying about? Should we only worry about AGI or ASI insofar as it includes agency? You could have a superintelligent AI that doesn't “want” anything, and it's totally not dangerous because it doesn't have its own goals. Researchers have been warning for years about the risks of AI systems, especially systems with their own goals and general intelligence. In the last six months, we've gotten evidence of AIs that are so misaligned that they would go against our moral instructions. These are not an immediate danger because they're all controlled experiments...but we don't know how to really deal with this. And [the AIs] need good planning to strategize about things like “How am I going to convince these people to do what I want?” or “How do I escape their control?” So if we don't fix these problems quickly, we may end up with, initially, funny accidents, and later, not-funny accidents. That's motivating what we're trying to do at LawZero. In fact, it's not going to want anything. Tell me about how Scientist AI could be used as a guardrail against the bad actions of an AI agent. The only thing you need to do is make a good prediction. Does it satisfy the safety specifications that humans have provided? And if the answer is yes, with some probability that's not very small, then the guardrail says: No, this is a bad action. And the agent has to [try a different] action. So how would Scientist AI learn what to classify as a bad action? It's not for any kind of AI to decide what is right or wrong. Now, of course, there could be ambiguity in the law. Hence you can get a corporate lawyer who is able to find loopholes in the law. But there's a way around this: Scientist AI is planned so that it will see the ambiguity. It will see that there are different interpretations, say, of a particular rule. I think a problem there would be that almost any moral choice arguably has ambiguity. We've got some of the most contentious moral issues — think about gun control or abortion in the US — where, even democratically, you might get a significant proportion of the population that says they're opposed. How do you propose to deal with that? Except by having the strongest possible honesty and rationality in the answers, which, in my opinion, would already be a big gain compared to the sort of democratic discussions that are happening. One of the features of the Scientist AI, like a good human scientist, is that you can ask: Why are you saying this? So I actually think that these sorts of machines could be turned into tools to help democratic debates. And your research was very foundational in laying the groundwork for that kind of AI. On a personal level, do you feel some sense of inner conflict or regret about having done the research that laid that groundwork? I should have thought of this 10 years ago. But I think there are very strong psychological defenses that I had, and that most of the AI researchers have. You want to feel good about your work, and you want to feel like you're the good guy, not doing something that could cause in the future lots of harm and death. So we kind of look the other way. And for myself, I was thinking: This is so far into the future! So let's worry about these things when we get there. When ChatGPT came, I couldn't continue living with this internal lie, because, well, we are getting very close to human-level. The reason I ask this is because it struck me when reading your plan for Scientist AI that you say it's modeled after the platonic idea of a scientist — a selfless, ideal person who's just trying to understand the world. I thought: Are you in some way trying to build the ideal version of yourself, this “he” that you mentioned, the ideal scientist? In a way, it's an ideal that I have been looking toward for myself. Because, for the most part in science, we need to step back from our emotions so that we avoid biases and preconceived ideas and ego. For me, one of the takeaways from that moment was that we're at a point where this is not predominantly a technological problem. There's massive commercial pressure to build cutting-edge AI. How do you propose to avoid that fate? That's why we're doing this as a nonprofit. I think we could do a lot of good without having to train frontier models ourselves. If we come up with a methodology for training AI that is convincingly safer, at least on some aspects like loss of control, and we hand it over almost for free to companies that are building AI — well, no one in these companies actually wants to see a rogue AI. I know right now it doesn't look like it, but when we start seeing more evidence of the kind we've seen in the last six months, but stronger and more scary, public opinion might push sufficiently that we'll see regulation or some way to incentivize companies to behave better. It might even happen just for market reasons — like, [AI companies] could be sued. So, at some point, they might reason that they should be willing to pay some money to reduce the risks of accidents. I was happy to see that LawZero isn't only talking about reducing the risks of accidents but is also talking about “protecting human joy and endeavor.” A lot of people fear that if AI gets better than them at things, well, what is the meaning of their life? How would you advise people to think about the meaning of their human life if we enter an era where machines have both agency and extreme intelligence? But the decisions that human beings are going to make in the coming years as AI becomes more powerful — these decisions are incredibly consequential. So there's a sense in which it's hard to get more meaning than that! If you want to do something about it, be part of the thinking, be part of the democratic debate. I would advise us all to remind ourselves that we have agency. And we have an amazing task in front of us: to shape the future. Everyone wants to be a girl dad now. ﻿The tech right saw in Trump what they wanted to see, but it wasn't actually there And that's not even Apple's biggest problem right now Republicans are gutting the safety net as job-killing mass automation looms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As The Atlantic continues a major expansion of its editorial staff, today editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg is announcing the hires of Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef as staff writers. Nancy is joining from The Wall Street Journal where she was a national security correspondent; Toluse joins from The Washington Post, where he was a national political reporter and previously served as White House bureau chief; and Quinta has been a contributing writer for The Atlantic and senior editor at Lawfare. Below is the staff announcement about Nancy, Toluse, and Quinta: Dear everyone,  I'm writing to share the news that three excellent journalists are joining our team as staff writers: Quinta Jurecic, Toluse Olorunnipa, and Nancy Youssef. First, Quinta: Quinta's byline is actually a familiar one to you and to our readers; as a contributing writer here for the past several years, she's produced some of the most incisive coverage of the Trump years of anyone in journalism. Quinta was one of the people I looked to in the early days of the first Trump term to try to make sense of it all, and she delivered, time and time again. (Her Atlantic archive is a rich source of analysis and wisdom for those seeking to understand our political moment.) Quinta is sharp, quick, and extremely adept at translating difficult concepts of law and governance into illuminating stories for the general reader. She is currently a fellow at the Brookings Institution, and a senior editor at Lawfare, for which she previously served as managing editor. Next, Tolu, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter known for his thoughtfulness, brilliant writing, and years of experience covering politics at the highest level. He joins us from The Washington Post, where he has been a national political reporter and the paper's White House bureau chief. She was based in Baghdad during the Iraq War and later in Cairo, where she covered the broader Muslim world. Nancy will also be based at the Wharf. Please join me in welcoming them to The Atlantic. The Atlantic has announced a number of new hires this year, including managing editor Griff Witte; staff writers Isaac Stanley-Becker, Tyler Austin Harper, Nick Miroff, Ashley Parker, Alexandra Petri, Missy Ryan, Michael Scherer, Jamie Thompson, Josh Tyrangiel, and Caity Weaver; and senior editors Jenna Johnson and Dan Zak. Please reach out with any questions or requests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex Zverev continued his Wimbledon preparations with a dominant 6-2, 6-1 win over the US' Marcos Giron to reach the second round in Halle, despite his attention being temporarily diverted to help an injured fan in the stands. Play was halted in the first set with Zverev leading 5-2, 15-30 after a crash was heard inside the arena, with video footage showing that a piece of an advertising hoarding had fallen and struck a female spectator sitting in the tier below. Related article Emma Raducanu's accused stalker prevented from buying Wimbledon tickets 3 quickly went over and handed an ice pack to the fan, who held it against the back of her neck. “There has never been anything like this in our 32-year tournament history. We deeply regret the incident,” tournament director Ralf Weber said in a statement. Weber also offered the spectator a season ticket for next year. Event managers Dr. Udo Kleine and Uwe Greipel-Dominik said in a joint statement that they suspect “drumming against the boards caused screws to come loose.” Zverev, who is still searching for his first career grass title after defeat to Taylor Fritz in Sunday's Stuttgart Open final, will play Italy's Lorenzo Sonego in the second round. The German has twice previously reached the final in Halle, in 2016 and 2017, and is aiming for his seventh career title on home soil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israeli Defense Forces warned Iranians within the area of Iran's Arak heavy water reactor to evacuate on Wednesday. The Farsi-language warning included a red circle around the reactor that indicated it would be targeted for a military strike. The reactor is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. It noted that any presence within the area will endanger citizens' lives and that the move is a part of Israel's assault on Iran's military infrastructure. #BREAKING Israeli army issues evacuation order for Arak and Khandab. This is the area that contains Iran's heavy water reactor. Israel bombing this area would release radioactive materials causing widespread contamination and pose serious health risks ☢️ pic.twitter.com/ZbswrZqrjZ Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns. But the IAEA has said it lost “continuity of knowledge” about Iran's heavy water production due to Iranian restrictions on its inspections. Israel and Iran's recent conflict has been prompted by a lack of success in disarming Iran's nuclear program. Trump has adamantly said he doesn't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon and is reportedly considering involving the United States in the conflict to strike Iranian nuclear sites. They just can't have a nuclear weapon,” he said on Tuesday. The intelligence community has denied that Iran's nuclear program has changed since March, when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush toward building a bomb.</p>
