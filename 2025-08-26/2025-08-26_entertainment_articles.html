                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The moment has finally arrived: Kpop Demon Hunters has officially become Netflix's most popular film of all time. The animated musical produced by Sony Pictures Animation added another 25.4M views from August 18 to 24, bringing its total since its June 20 premiere to 236M views. It has now surpassed Red Notice to take the top spot on the Most Popular English Films list, as expected. Last week marked the third consecutive week that the film has exhibited nearly 0% audience decline, after two straight intervals of 26M views. 1 Box Office Win With $19M+, But Streamer Doesn't Want To Officially Report - Monday AM Update 'KPop Demon Hunters' Sing-Along Version To Debut On Netflix The singalong was also released theatrically this weekend, delivering a huge win for Netflix as the film beat out Weapons for No. KPop Demon Hunters has 24 days left in its 91-day premiere window to keep racking up views and widening the distance between it and now-No. 2 Red Notice (which had 230M views in 91 days). Season 1 also made an appearance at No. 4 with 4M views as audiences refreshed their memories and/or caught up before diving into Season 2. Wednesday is likely to stick around the charts for quite a while, as Part 2 of the second season is poised to launch on September 3. In second place was the British political thriller Hostage, which generated 10.8M views. Speaking of Mylchreest, he also had a presence on the film list with My Oxford Year‘s 5.9M views putting it at No. As always, there were also some reality titles on last week's Top 10. 3 with 8.5M views, while America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys came in ninth place with 1.9M views.

Earlier today, Taylor Swift announced on her Instagram account that she and longtime beau, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, are tying the knot. In a joint post, the two shared: “Your English teacher and gym teacher are getting married.” Now, if that isn't a real-life “Love Story,” we don't know what is. Within minutes, the slideshow racked up more than 6.3 million likes, with fans immediately zeroing in on one big question: what was Taylor wearing when Travis dropped to one knee? Our fashion editors did some digging and discovered that the mega superstar was rocking Polo Ralph Lauren's striped silk-blend dress. We tracked down a few spots where you can still snag it online. As of now, Farfetch has the dress in stock, but only in a handful of sizes. Originally retailing for just over $300, it's now going for upwards of $450, a clear sign of just how in-demand this piece has become.And if you can't score the exact “Style,” don't worry, we rounded up some great alternatives that still have plenty of availability.

Related Stories Kristen Stewart's Directorial Debut ‘The Chronology of Water' Is Getting a Theatrical Release and Big Awards Push ‘Griffin in Summer' Review: Imagine If the Delightful Nerds of ‘Theater Camp' Had to Go at It Alone Armed with a script from Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”), Roach's film opens far from those happy days, with Theo Rose (Cumberbatch) and Ivy Rose (Colman) going head to head at a couple's counseling session that is actually at its best when Ivy is calling her husband the c-word. Zipping us back in time, we soon see how this all began: with a meet-cute for the ages, but one that also hints at what might tear these two apart in the coming years. Theo is an architect bummed about the state of his work, forced to celebrate the completion of a soulless apartment building at a glitzy lunch with his coworkers. If you're willing to take the plunge on that particular (and peculiar) plot movement, you'll likely vibe with what's to come. Ten years later, Theo and Ivy's American gamble has paid way off. Happily ensconced in California's Mendocino County (the film actually shot on location in Devon in the southwest of England, so while the film's locales look absolutely stunning, they sure as hell don't look like Northern California; this is no disrespect to fertile NorCal, but that place does not have cliffs like these), Theo's career is booming, their spunky twins seem happy, and Ivy has turned her attention to cooking for fun. Theo is still holding out hope to one day build the family's dream house, Ivy's life seems mostly relegated to being a wife and mother, and it sure seems as if the couple have, well, discordant ideas about parenting. McNamara weaves these bits in well, and Cumberbatch and Colman — so naturally giddy around each other — slowly start to, if not come apart, at least poke at each other. When Theo opts to spend their house money on a seafood restaurant for Ivy, it's the first step toward their undoing. And when Theo's latest project — a massive museum dedicated to sea-faring life and shaped like a ship — literally collapses during a particularly bad storm (an event that immediately goes viral), ending his own professional dreams, it's just another nail in the coffin. While Adler's book and DeVito's movie imagined Mrs. Rose as a rising catering star, Roach's film turns her into a massive culinary brand, with Ivy's success propelling her toward the very top of the food world heap. While previous incarnations of the story provided the Roses with a pair of nearly-grown children, McNamara's script ages the kiddos down (Hattie and Roy, played by Delaney Quinn and Ollie Robinson as ten-year-olds, with Hala Finley and Wells Rappaport taking over when they turn 13), providing a new dimension to Theo and Ivy's problems. As she's off setting up new restaurants — aided by longtime employees, played by Sunita Mani and Ncuti Gatwa, none of them bothered by the fact that the chain is called “We Got Crabs” — newly-minted stay-at-home dad Theo is busy remaking the kids in his image. That means lots of physical activity, fewer sugary desserts. Such are the seemingly small disagreements that start to chip away at their marriage. And while much of this might sound deadly serious, Roach's film is frequently very funny. Moments in which the Roses are nitpicking at each other — a bit involving some ill-advised donuts is great — stand up to bigger comedic setpieces that bond them together, such as a trip to a local gun club with their loopy American pals (Andy Samberg, Kate McKinnon, Zoë Chao, and Jamie Demetriou). Oh, it's coming, but while the genuinely horrifying and also extremely funny dinner party that arguably tips everything over the edge ranks among some of the best comedic work of Roach, Cumberbatch, and Colman's careers, what follows feels at odds with everything that's happened before. That McNamara has written a truly new spin on Adler's novel is genuinely refreshing, but the lighter tone and greater reliance on actual romance between its leads makes what's to come all the harder to swallow. DeVito's film wasn't afraid to get dark, deep, and mean from the jump, but in the last act of Roach's film, the attacks that Theo and Ivy launch against each other surprise, and not always in entertaining ways. It may sound silly to wonder if this take on “The Wars of the Roses” is too cruel, but that's precisely how it feels. It's all fun and games, until someone gets hurt. Searchlight Pictures will release “The Roses” in theaters on Friday, August 29.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. This year's Cannes — specifically the Un Certain Regard sidebar — was home to directorial debuts from three major actors, including Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” and Kristen Stewart‘s “The Chronology of Water.” And though Stewart has been a Cannes mainstay for nearly a decade, the film was well-reviewed, and Stewart's star power is as strong as ever, even movies with that pedigree manage to sit on the shelf. We've asked distributors time and again to look alive. It will open limited for a qualifying run and expand in January. Related Stories ‘Griffin in Summer' Review: Imagine If the Delightful Nerds of ‘Theater Camp' Had to Go at It Alone A Little Movie by Texan Richard Linklater Could Be the French Oscar Entry “The Chronology of Water” is Stewart's adaptation of a memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch, a competitive swimmer who dealt with an abusive childhood, sexual experimentation, toxic relationships, and addiction, all before finding her voice as a creative writer. Anchored by a powerfully honest performance by Imogen Poots, the film is framed much like a visual poem, absent identifying time stamps or title cards and told in “a constellation of scattered quotes and half-invented memories,” as IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich described it out of Cannes. He praised the film and particularly Stewart's direction for being innately comfortable and gifted behind the camera, writing that “some movies are shot. “There isn't a single millisecond of this movie that doesn't bristle with the raw energy of an artist who's found the permission she needed to put her whole being into every frame, messy and shattered as that might be,” the review reads. “And it's largely for that reason why ‘The Chronology of Water' works even when it doesn't: Because, on an almost subatomic level, Stewart communes with the liquid spirit of a woman who only became whole by allowing herself to dissolve into the smallest essences of her being — over and over again until it seemed impossible she might ever regain a recognizable shape.” Stewart had been developing “The Chronology of Water” for eight years before it finally found funding from Ridley Scott's Scott Free production banner, and Stewart announced she would be directing it way back in 2022 before it finally was ready for Cannes this summer. I've earned the right to try one more time. So whatever comes out next is going to not be anything like this. Alongside Poots in the film are Jim Belushi, Thora Birch, Charlie Carrick, Susannah Flood, Kim Gordon, and Tom Sturridge. “Kristen [Stewart] hasn't just directed a film, she's carved out a world with unmistakable vision: one that pulses with pain, desire, and defiance,” said Mark Mathias Sayre, CEO of The Forge, in an official statement. “'The Chronology of Water' is unlike anything we've ever released: visceral, expansive, and anchored by a performance from Imogen Poots that wrecks and rebuilds you. “Films like ours should be birthed onto the screen and I am grateful we found a team as committed to supporting independent filmmakers as they are.” Les Films du Losange is handling international sales and French distribution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inside, they found two people dead — Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor for American Idol, and her husband, Thomas Deluca. The pair had been shot and killed several days earlier, with authorities later determining that Kaye and Deluca sustained their fatal injuries on July 10. Here's everything we know about the case so far. She joined the show in 2009 and is credited on nearly 300 episodes. After her death, a spokesperson for the show called Kaye “a cornerstone of the Idol family,” and was “truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.” The statement continued: “Robin will remain in our hearts forever as we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.” Former American Idol judge Randy Jackson called Kaye “a dear friend” and said she “consistently went the extra mile, meticulously ensuring songs were placed and cleared for the show. Along with American Idol, Kaye worked as a music supervisor on several other major shows, including Miss Universe, Lip Sync Battle, The Dance Scene, and Crashed. He co-wrote songs that were recorded by Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Jennifer Rush, Meredith Brooks, Molly Hatchett, and David Allen Coe. According to authorities, Kaye and Deluca had returned from the grocery store on July 10 when they confronted a stranger in their house. Police say the suspect, Boodarian, had entered through an unlocked door, and that the house's alarm system was off at that time; a previous LAPD statement said “there were no signs of forced entry or trouble.” During the confrontation that ensued, Boodarian allegedly shot Kaye and Deluca multiple times with a gun that belonged to the couple. ‘American Idol' Music Supervisor and Husband's Cause of Death Revealed Cardi B's Lawyer Denies Rapper Battered Security Guard as Assault Trial Begins Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie Will Return to ‘American Idol' Next Year Lil Nas X Pleads Not Guilty to Felonies After Allegedly Attacking Police Officers They attempted entry at two access points but both were locked and secured,” LAPD Communications Director Jennifer Forkish previously said (via the Los Angeles Times). It wasn't until a neighbor called the police four days later to say they hadn't seen or heard from Kaye or Deluca that police finally entered the couple's home and found them dead in separate rooms. Boodarian neither entered a plea, nor responded to questions asked by the judge. “He does have severe mental health issues,” his lawyer, Nancy Kolocotronis, said. At the end of the hearing, Judge Martin L. Herscovitz ordered Boodarian back into custody without bail and set a Sept. 3 hearing in mental health court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Gina Matthews has Dorothy in development at Prime Video, we've just learned. The series, which Matthews created and will produce under her Little Engine label, is a contemporary, music-infused YA retelling of Wizard of Oz based on L. Frank Baum's books using the Yellow Brick Road as a metaphor for the challenges and choices facing young adults today. Non-writing executive producers on the project include Gwen Stefani, Lucky Horseshoe's Blake Shelton and Lee Metzger and Little Engine's Grant Scharbo, as well as Patrick Moran. 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Actor Gavin Casalegno Reacts To Fan Hatred Of His Character: "Not Really Going So Well" “The story reminds us of the qualities we need to get through hard times, and Dorothy is a symbol of strength who shows us that with a little kindness — and a lot of grit — we can not only achieve great things but also lift up those around us. “I'm really excited to work with this creative team,” says Moran. “I'm such a fan of everyone involved and couldn't ask for a more exciting partnership as we reinvent this cherished IP.” Adds Scharbo, “We're thrilled to embark on this journey with Amazon and believe Dorothy will enchant a whole new generation of viewers.” “We're really excited about all the possibilities this show brings, and I'm so grateful that Gina shared the idea with me and Lee,” said Shelton. “I knew right away it was something Gwen would connect with. Her creativity and perspective are such a natural fit for this project.” Three-time Grammy winner and multiplatinum performing artist Stefani, who has also been a long-running coach on NBC's The Voice, is repped by WME, Blended Strategy Group and Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk, LLP. Shelton is a nine-time Grammy nominee and platinum-selling country artist who has executive produced the Hallmark holiday movie franchise Time for … to Come Home for Christmas as well as USA's Barmageddon. Matthews has produced movies like 13 Going on 30 and Isn't It Romantic, and she created the WB series The Mountain as well as Popular. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon invites you to “buy” movies digitally on its website, but what the megacorp really sells are movie licenses, which can be revoked if Amazon loses the rights to the movie. This insidious little distinction has gotten Amazon into legal trouble before, and has once again, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that a new class action lawsuit has been proposed against the company over the issue. Per the outlet, the proposed suit is bolstered by new California law that says a transaction can't be advertised as a “purchase” unless it offers unrestricted ownership of the product. That statute requires sellers to make it pretty clear to buyers that they're getting a limited license. Amazon has not yet commented on the proposed suit, which was filed in Washington federal court on Friday. However, when faced with a similar suit in 2020, the company countered that “These Terms of Use expressly state that purchasers obtain only a limited license to view video content and that purchased content may become unavailable due to provider license restriction or other reasons.” With this new Cali law in effect, we'll see if the ol' “Terms of Use” excuse flies in 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple Music is rolling out a new tool that allows you to import playlists from other streaming services. After beta-testing in Australia and New Zealand, the tool is now available in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico. The tool, announced by Apple and spotted by MacRumors, is accessed through a new menu in Music settings called Transfer Music from Other Music Services. Apple's Support page has more detailed instructions, as well as an alternative method via your web browser. Coincidentally, Apple is implementing the tool as Spotify deals with an exodus of indie-rock artists. Hotline TNT are the latest to ditch the service, noting in a statement that the company's values do not align with the band's and that “a cooler world is possible.” They follow Godspeed You! While Spotify has long generated ill will for its unusually low royalty payouts and assorted other ethical concerns, the latest wave of departures was prompted by growing awareness of CEO Daniel Ek's venture capital fund Prima Materia. That company has heavily invested in the highly contentious defense company Helsing, which specializes in artificial intelligence–driven military technologies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE BIG STORY: The Prince estate is facing yet another legal battle – only this time not from his heirs, but from a co-star in his 1984 film Purple Rain. Even after that case wrapped up, another battle erupted between allegedly “disgruntled” heirs and a pair of managers. For its part, the Prince estate said that it never meant to cause her any sorrow. In a post to social media, the estate responded that it had “never instructed her to cease using her adopted professional name” and merely wanted to “preserve Prince's assets and legacy” by cancelling Apollonia's own trademarks over a name that came from a Prince movie. DEEP DIVE: After YNW Melly's double murder trial was postponed until January 2027 – roughly eight years from when he was first arrested – I dove deep into how we got here. You're reading The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between. To get the newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday, go subscribe here. FELONY CHARGES – Lil Nas X was charged with four felonies over accusations that he attacked police officers and resisted arrest last week during a bizarre incident in which he was filmed wandering naked in Los Angeles. At an arraignment hearing, the “Old Town Road” rapper pleaded not guilty to three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting executive officer over the alleged incident – charges that could carry years in prison. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed in court docs, but Elliott's lawyer shared key details with Billboard. In a statement to Billboard, Alejandro said he “believed these songs were cleared properly by my previous label, but it seems the person who claimed the rights might not have actually controlled them.” IDOL KILLINGS – Raymond Boodarian, the man accused of killing longtime American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband last month, appeared in court for his initial hearing on murder and burglary charges. But a Los Angeles judge suspended the prosecution after the accused killer was repeatedly unresponsive in court, instead ordering a mental health review to determine whether he's competent enough to face criminal charges. DIDDY THE DIRECTOR – Elsewhere in Diddy world, federal prosecutors urged a judge to reject the rapper's bid to overturn his criminal prostitution convictions ahead of sentencing, including his argument that “freak-offs” were just “amateur pornography” protected by free speech: “The defendant was anything but a producer of adult films entitled to First Amendment protection — rather, he was a voracious consumer of commercial sex.” Lawyers for plaintiff Julia Misley, who claims Tyler “groomed” and “manipulated” her as a teenager decades ago, sought the continuance over “unavoidable delays” in preparing for trial; Tyler's lawyers objected, saying he wanted his “day in court” rather than have the case “continue to drag on.” YOUNG DOLPH ACQUITTAL – A man accused of organizing the hit that killed rapper Young Dolph in 2021 was found not guilty on first-degree murder and murder conspiracy charges over accusations that he hired two men to fatally shoot the rapper at a bakery in Memphis. One shooter was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison; the other is cooperating with prosecutors of a lenient punishment. SUPERTRAMP DECISION – A federal appeals court ruled that former Supertramp lead singer Roger Hodgson needs to share royalties from the 1970s rock band's hit catalog with his fellow band members. “Plaintiffs ask that defendants continue to ‘Give A Little Bit,' the judge wrote. “Defendants believe that ‘From Now On,' they are no longer obligated to share royalties.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Bieber is giving his thirstiest fans exactly what they want. As shared in a Monday (Aug. 25) post on Instagram, the pop star recently took a moment in the gym to snap a couple of shirtless selfies, flexing his muscles in the mirror and showing off his tattoo-covered arms and torso. Beyond a white beanie and gold chain around his neck, the only items he wears in the pictures are a pair of gym shorts and Calvin Klein boxers that show at the waistband. In his caption, Bieber wrote, “thirstrap fa u hoes.” Also on Instagram in recent days, Justin has posted praise for his wife, mogul Hailey Bieber — “Love this picture of you baby gurrllll,” he gushed on Monday (Aug. 25) of a photo from her Byrdie shoot — and shared snaps of his son, Jack Blues, who turned 1 earlier in August. (On the little boy's birthday, the Rhode founder wrote on her profile, “1 year of you my beautiful boy … you are joy personified.”) “FORGIVE MY CHICKEN LEGS,” he joked of the visual when it dropped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Chastain is better known as “the Savant” in her new Apple TV+ series, which released a trailer on Tuesday. “Snipers, bombings, ambushes… we're on the verge of serious violence,” she says when confiding to a colleague about the man she's hunting, played by Pablo Schreiber.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman gave a rare look into his family life when he celebrated his daughter Jordan Ashley Aikman's birthday. He is also a father to her younger sister, Alexa Marie Aikman. A post shared by troy (@troyaikman) On August 24, Aikman shared a beautiful photo on Instagram of himself and Jordan wearing white. He has his arm around her, and they are smiling for the camera. In the caption, he got emotional as he reflected on all the brilliant qualities his daughter has. “From the day you were born, you've embraced every challenge and adventure as an opportunity to grow. You've done it all with independence, courage, and strength. Aikman ended his message with an emotional comment on what fatherhood means to him. “Being your dad is one of life's greatest blessings. Friends and fans have reacted to the post with sweet messages. “Awww Happy Birthday @jordanaikmann You are such a light inside and out. Although Aikman does not always post on social media about his kids, he has reflected on fatherhood in an Instagram post in honor of Father's Day on June 16, 2024. They are happy photos and give a glimpse into the special bond that this former NFL star shares with his kids. “Happy Father's Day to the daddy's and their little girls (& boys),” he wrote in the caption. Fans praised Aikman in the comments and complimented him on being a great dad. One of the best to ever do it,” a comment reads. Aikman's daughters are close in age, and just four weeks earlier, on July 30, he celebrated Alexa's birthday with an Instagram post. This time, Aikman also posted a photo of himself and his beautiful daughter wearing white. They are posing in the same way, with his arm around her. In the caption, he shared his thoughts. An amazing young woman — kind, smart, funny, strong and beautiful,” he wrote. “Love being your dad and watching you chase down life with so much heart.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pierce Brosnan is showing once again that true elegance never fades. At 72, the former James Bond star turned heads at the London premiere of “The Thursday Murder Club”, looking effortlessly sophisticated with his silver hair and timeless charm. Brosnan's striking appearance once again reminded fans why he remains a Hollywood icon. London fans witnessed a rare glimpse of the Brosnan family, radiating elegance together on the red carpet (as shared by enews). Charlotte was the biological daughter of Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's first wife, whom he married in 1977. Brosnan adopted Charlotte after her biological father's death. He has five children in total, three from his first marriage and two with his wife, journalist Keely Shaye Smith, whom he wed in 2001. From the red carpet to family milestones, Brosnan continues to shine not only as an actor but as a devoted father and grandfather, proving that elegance truly runs in the family. The highly anticipated Netflix film, directed by Chris Columbus, is based on Richard Osman's best-selling book. It tells the story of four retirement home residents who solve murder cases for fun until a death hits close to home. Brosnan stars alongside an impressive cast, including Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie. Speaking at the film's New York premiere earlier this month, Brosnan praised his co-star Mirren. “I love working with Helen… She is captivating in every sense of the word, as a woman and as an actress. Having seen her work from afar for so many years, and then to be in the brilliance of her creativity as an actor is spellbinding,” he said, talking to People magazine. Other stars of the film, including Tom Ellis and Richard E. Grant, joined director Chris Columbus and author Richard Osman at the press event in Leicester Square.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto and season one star Matthew McConaughey have set a place for their latest attempt at a creative reunion: Netflix. In a new series made by Skydance Sports, Pizzolatto's words will return to McConaughey's mouth in a series known cryptically as “The Brothers Project.” That's not to be confused with McConaughey's other “Brothers Project,” which, as Hollywood Reporter notes, is an Apple TV+ comedy starring True Detective all-stars McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Instead, this “Brothers Project” refers to a presumed sports show in which McConaughey is the brother of Yellowstone star Cole Hauser. In 2020, as McConaughey's monologues were driving the Lincoln brand to new heights, he and Pizzolatto were announced as working on a show called Redeemer. Earlier this year, while taking a break from cyberbullying True Detective: Night Country, Pizzolatto and McCounaghey were announced to be working on a Mike Hammer movie, written by the former and starring the latter. It's hard to say, but “The Brothers Project” has a secret weapon that other PizzoConaughey collaborations lacked: another reunion. In the meantime, Pizzolatto's first feature, Easy's Waltz, is expected out later this fall.
