President Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday, saying he is "always" ready for a legal fight after Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook signaled she would pursue legal action over her ouster. In the wake of the unprecedented removal of a Federal Reserve governor, President Donald Trump doubled down on his decision Tuesday, saying he is "always" ready for a legal fight after the ousted governor, Lisa Cook, signaled she would pursue legal action. And especially that infraction because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages. We need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn't seem like she was," Trump said, referencing Cook's alleged misconduct in securing mortgage loans. The Federal Reserve acknowledged Cook's potential legal action and said in a statement that the U.S. central bank will "abide by any court decision." "Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System," a Federal Reserve spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital. This gives Trump another opportunity to name someone closely aligned with his financial policy to the Fed. When asked about replacing Cook on the Fed Board, Trump told reporters at the White House that he has some "very good people for that position." Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is seen swearing in Lisa D. Cook as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in May 2022. Trump accused Cook — who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors — of mortgage fraud on Monday evening. The allegations stem from Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to an agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On Aug. 15, Pulte sent the Justice Department a criminal referral regarding Cook in which he accused her of falsifying bank documents and property records. As it stands, Trump says Cook is fired, effective immediately. But Cook and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argue that he has no legal authority to remove her. Her term on the Fed Board runs until January 2038. Lisa Cook, member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve, attends a Federal Reserve Board open meeting discussing proposed revisions to the board's supplementary leverage ratio standards at the Federal Reserve Board building in Washington, D.C., on June 25, 2025. "President Trump has taken to social media to once again ‘fire by tweet' and once again his reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority," Lowell said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. "We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action," Lowell added. Fox News Digital's Rachel Wolf contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting, Tuesday, Aug. 26, 2025, at the White House in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump seemingly caught his loyal conservative base off-guard and sparked backlash by saying he would allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities. That would be a departure for the Trump administration after it added new vetting for student visas, moved to block foreign enrollment at Harvard and expanded the grounds for terminating international students' ability to study in the United States. It also marks another divide with figures in Trump's “Make America Great Again” base, who tout an “America First” agenda and had contested the U.S. inserting itself in the recent Israel-Iran war. Some of Trump's most ardent supporters — from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to former adviser Steve Bannon and far-right activist Laura Loomer — rejected the idea of welcoming more Chinese students. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Here's what to know about Trump's announcement and the reaction: During a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump was asked by reporters if he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. As you know, we are taking a lot of money in from China because of the tariffs and different things,” he said. Trump doubled down at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, sitting next to Rubio, where he said he was “honored” to have Chinese students in the U.S. and said they help colleges stay afloat. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also said that Trump told Xi in a June phone call that “the U.S. loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.” It was a shift after the State Department announced in late May that it would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections with the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.” In the past year, several U.S. universities, including the University of Michigan, have ended their joint partnerships with Chinese universities after Republicans raised concerns that U.S. dollars have contributed to China's tech advancement and military modernization. There's growing bipartisan consensus that U.S. schools should not help train Beijing's top talent in critical fields such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and aerospace technology. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was asked Monday on Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle” how such a shift would be consistent with Trump's “America First” push. Lutnick argued that Trump was taking a “rational economic view” and asserted that 15% of American universities and colleges would go out of business without those foreign students. “I just don't understand it for the life of me. Those are 600,000 spots that American kids won't get,” host Laura Ingraham said. At Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Trump said international students are helping keep some U.S. schools afloat. “And you know what would happen if they didn't (come)? It would be colleges that struggle on the bottom,” Trump said. An analysis by NAFSA, an association of international educators, found that international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 jobs during the 2023-2024 academic year. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Mao Ning, a ministry spokesperson, said Friday that students have been treated unfairly and subjected to extended interrogations. Mao said some students had their visas revoked and were banned from entering the country after they were told they “might endanger national security.” The embassy issued an advisory Monday urging Chinese students not to enter the U.S. through Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, alleging several students were harassed and interrogated by customs officials. The embassy said at least one student was detained for more than 80 hours before being sent back to China. This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the commerce secretary's last name to Lutnick, instead of Lutnik.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Fed in the crosshairs: Meanwhile, Trump said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing on Monday, was not “100% above board.” Cook has refused to resign, setting up a potential showdown. Her attorney announced he is filing a lawsuit challenging the president's action. President Donald Trump said he is considering a longer term for White House economist Stephen Miran on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors and that he soon expected to have “a majority” at the Fed. Trump earlier this month nominated Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacancy left by former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler after she resigned. Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, would finish a term slated to end January 31, 2026. “We just put a very good man in one position. We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said today during a presidential Cabinet meeting, but he did not specify what he meant by “the other.“We'll have a majority very shortly. However, Trump currently is attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whose term expires in 2038. Cook's attorney said today she plans to fight the dismissal in court. Two current governors have said they would like to cut interest rates, and Miran has signaled he also thinks rates are too high.Trump has complained for months that the Fed has kept interest rates too high President Donald Trump floated the idea today of sending Americans tariff rebate checks, an idea that his own treasury secretary has suggested the White House is unlikely to do. Some lawmakers have proposed using tariff revenue to send rebate checks of at least $600 per adult and dependent child. A family of four could end up with around $2,400 from the federal government. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has thrown cold water on the idea, including earlier this month during an interview on CNBC, saying in part that the revenue generated from new tariffs will go toward paying the national debt. “I think, at a point, we're going to be able to do it,” he said, noting how S&P Global on Monday affirmed its AA+ credit rating on the United States. “But President [Donald] Trump and I are laser-focused on paying down the debt.” President Donald Trump today said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing yesterday, was not “100% above board.” “She seems to have had an infraction, and she can't have an infraction, especially that infraction, because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting. Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud over two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence in the same year. Cook has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing. In a letter posted on social media late yesterday, Trump said he has determined there is enough cause to fire Cook, citing the mortgage fraud allegations. But the legality of Trump's attempt to remove Cook remains unsettled. President Donald Trump renewed his threat to impose heavy economic penalties on Russia if it refuses to halt its war against Ukraine — but did not set any fresh timetable for following through. “It will not be a world war but it will be an economic war,” Trump said on Tuesday of the actions that he may eventually take. But he quickly added that he didn't want to impose new sanctions or tariffs aimed at hurting the Russian economy, expressing hope that there was still a path toward brokering a deal to end the war. Trump also again suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bore some blame for the conflict, calling him “not exactly innocent either,” and brushed off Russia's recent signals that it wouldn't sign a peace deal with Zelensky. Trump has repeatedly threatened to ramp up economic pressure on Russia over the prolonged war, but has yet to take significant action, repeatedly extending his two-week deadlines for Putin. If she'd like to do that, I would do it,” he said during a White House Cabinet meeting when a reporter asked him about the prospect. But the places we're talking about happen to be virtually all Democrat-run.” President Donald Trump appeared to back off his administration's plans to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” a move that, he says, comes as US relations with China have improved. But today, the president appeared to reverse course: “We're getting along very well with China, and I'm getting along very well with President Xi. I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here.” He continued: “I like that their students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.” Trump appeared to explain that the apparent reversal was the result of improving US-China relations: “We're just getting along very well with China. President Donald Trump backed off his assertion that there would be a “conclusive” end to the war in Gaza in the next few weeks, clarifying remarks he had made just a day earlier. Yesterday, Trump said he thought that “within the next two to three weeks, you're going to have pretty good, conclusive — a conclusive ending.” Meanwhile, Hamas said it has agreed to a new Gaza ceasefire proposal as mediators push to renew talks ahead of a major Israeli assault on Gaza City. President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday upon hearing the news of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce's engagement that “I wish them a lot of luck.” The president, as recently as August 4, has criticized Swift on social media, including claiming she was “NO LONGER HOT” and was “Woke” while praising actress Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle jeans ad. Swift endorsed Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, following the only debate between Trump and Harris last year. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by JD Vance, Trump's running mate, to criticize Democrats. Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in an Instagram post Tuesday afternoon, with a caption reading, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” Indiana Republican Sen. Todd Young told reporters today that he doesn't know if President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is legal. Cook's lawyer announced today that he is filing a lawsuit to challenge her removal, and said Trump “has no authority” to fire her. Meanwhile, North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs the House Republican campaign arm, said, “I'm not a lawyer. Top Democrats have condemned Trump's attempt to fire Cook, with some saying the move is illegal. He didn't mention Lisa Cook, the Fed board member who Trump said he was dismissing yesterday evening, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. It was not immediately clear how Trump's edict would work. Unlike in other places, prosecutors — even those who handle local murder cases in DC Superior Court — work for the federally appointed US Attorney. President Donald Trump called for Harvard University to pay a sweeping $500 million settlement to restore its federal funding, saying the elite university has been “very bad.” Trump's comments come as a federal judge is expected to soon rule in the school's funding case against the Trump administration. Harvard had asked for an expedited final decision from US District Judge Allison Burroughs before September 3, which the school said was the first date it would be required to submit paperwork to close out grant funding. President Donald Trump ratcheted up his feud with Maryland Gov. In remarks last week, Moore, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, encouraged Trump to walk around Baltimore with him and see the city's efforts to curb crime, saying he would see “one of the greatest cities in the United States of America.” Trump told reporters in the Cabinet Room on Tuesday that Moore “refuses to admit his problems.” “Wes Moore was telling me he wants — ‘I want to walk with the president.' Moore has tweaked Trump on social media since initially extending the offer, saying in a post Sunday that “President Bone Spurs will do anything to get out of walking” and offering to “get you a golf cart if that makes things easier.” In turn, Trump has threatened to “rethink” federal funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge that collapsed last year. President Donald Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio during today's Cabinet meeting — but not without making a playful jab at the Florida Republican's political future. “Marco has been really, I think you're born for this job,” Trump said. “I don't think you should ever run for another office,” he added. Everybody likes him but everybody — much more importantly than like, I think you would say, is respect — they respect Marco,” the president continued. His comments come weeks after he suggested Vice President JD Vance is the “most likely” heir apparent to the Make America Great Again movement, while proposing that Vance and Rubio join for a future GOP ticket. “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” Trump said at the time, while appearing with some other members of his Cabinet. “I'm not going to use the term great, big beautiful,” Trump said. White House officials, seeking to bolster support for the law, have recently sought to emphasize the slice of tax provisions that poll the best with voters, including an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime and deeper tax cuts for some individuals. But until now, Trump had resisted shifting away from his focus on the law's size and scope, boasting about passing a multitrillion-dollar package so large that there's “something for everything” in it. President Donald Trump is currently hosting a meeting with his Cabinet. It comes after the president fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and as he has been looking to take his crackdown on crime to a national level. We'll bring you the latest updates as it happens. Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced he is filing a lawsuit to challenge President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her yesterday evening. “President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. The announcement comes hours after Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire her. In a historic move, President Trump is attempting to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook denies any wrongdoing and says she will not resign. CNN's Alayna Treene reports on Trump's latest battle with the independent Federal Reserve. Trump administration officials are planning to meet with a senior Chinese trade negotiator this week — but there's little expectation it will yield a breakthrough in ending the nations' trade standoff. The negotiator, Li Chenggang, is expected to meet with deputy-level administration officials during his visit to Washington, a US government spokesperson told CNN. But the sit-down is not a formal negotiating session, and administration officials are skeptical that it will accomplish much. Chenggang was not invited by US officials and instead sought out the meeting on his own, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump earlier this year launched a trade war against China, threatening to slap tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese imports before agreeing to hold off on most of the levies while the two sides negotiated. Still, major points of contention remain: Trump has demanded that China purchase significantly more US soybeans, and yesterday threatened to sharply escalate tariffs if the nation decides to once again curb exports of rare-earth magnets. The Department of Transportation is threatening to pull federal funding to California, New Mexico and Washington if the states don't comply with a requirement of English language proficiency of all commercial motor vehicle drivers. “This is a safety issue — making sure drivers of very heavy 80,000-pound rigs can speak the language is truly a critical safety issue,” Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news conference today. CNN has reached out to each state's respective DOT for comment. Florida incident: The DOT's double down on an order Duffy signed with the requirements in May comes after a truck driver in Florida was accused of making an illegal U-turn that killed three people. The fatal incident sparked a clash between US Department of Homeland Security and California Democratic Gov. Singh had an association with all three states that Duffy threatened. He had a CDL from Washington and California, and had been previously pulled over in New Mexico, according to the secretary. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that embattled Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook — who has vowed not to leave her post after President Donald Trump sought to fire her yesterday — doesn't deserve to be at the central bank and should just “go away.” Trump announced yesterday that he removed Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said yesterday that Trump “has no authority” to fire her and that she will not resign. A CNN review of mortgage documents shows that Cook took out mortgages for two properties, both of which were listed as her principal residence. Lutnick, during an interview on CNBC's “Squawk Box,” said that Cook should leave her role. “A governor of the Federal Reserve literally signs her name and commits mortgage fraud, and she says I'm not going anywhere,” Lutnick said, alleging fraud. “Well, the crook always says I'm not going anywhere. Lutnick said if Cook did commit mortgage fraud, she should no longer serve as a Fed governor. He added: “This woman should go away if she's committed mortgage fraud, and those signatures sure as hell look like hers.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON (AP) — JB Pritzker took a water taxi along the Chicago Riverwalk, past one of Donald Trump's famous downtown towers. After Trump's National Guard deployments to Los Angeles in June and Washington, D.C. this month, the Republican says his next targets for federal intervention may be two of the nation's most Democratic cities: Chicago and Baltimore. Trump's possible move — targeting states whose governors are among potential White House contenders in 2028 — would be another escalation of presidential power, directly challenging the rights of states and cities to govern themselves. It also would intensify a partisan scramble for voters' trust on matters of public safety. It's a way to cast Democratic leaders in affected locales as weak and ineffective, even as Trump exaggerates the violence he's ostensibly trying to stop. Democrats see a dangerous overreach by an aspiring authoritarian and have said they will challenge Trump in court if necessary. They also see in the political fight a way to persuade voters, especially moderates and independents, that Republicans bluster on crime while Democrats are better able to protect citizens and keep the peace. “This is not about fighting crime,” said Pritzker, flanked on Monday by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other leaders, adding that it's more about “an arrogant little man” trying to “intimidate his political rivals.” Though violent crime is down across the country, including Chicago, arguing over how to combat what's still happening means tussling on some of Trump's most comfortable political turf. Additionally, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to block federal money for locales where elected officials have opposed him. Pritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026, has been among Democrats ' most vocal Trump critics. Weeks into Trump's second administration, Pritzker compared it to the Nazi Third Reich. More recently, he welcomed Texas Democrats who fled the statehouse in Austin to delay Republicans' partisan redrawing of the state's congressional districts at Trump's request. In Chicago on Monday, Pritzker and Johnson emphasized that Trump's administration had not reached out about its plans, first detailed in a weekend Washington Post story. The president acknowledged he hadn't talked to Illinois or Maryland officials and at one point Monday said he might not send troops unless Pritzker asked. Pritzker's aides said his priority is to keep a federal deployment from happening. That's why Pritzker and his staff hustled to gather a cross-section of political, civic and faith leadership in a made-for-TV show of unity that Trump would surely see. “And so perhaps if somebody from Fox News or from Newsmax is here, they'll cover the fact that Chicago is in much better shape” because of what local officials are doing. In a bit of Trumpian bravado, he added, “If you hurt my people, nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.” Wes Moore, another potential Democratic contender in 2028, said Trump's characterizations of Baltimore and other cities reflect a president “living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes.” Nonetheless, voters have been siding with Republicans on the issue. A CNN/SSRS poll from May found that about four in ten Americans said the GOP's views on crime and policing aligned more with their own, compared to just three in ten who felt the same about Democrats. Trump also had an advantage on the issue over Democrat Kamala Harris in their 2024 general election matchup. Democrats acknowledged the gap this week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times the amount of money on crime-related ads than Democrats did in recent presidential election years. Pritzker aides agreed Democrats have a chance to emphasize public safety policy choices. They also highlighted the hundreds of millions of dollars in Trump administration cuts in federal support for law enforcement, housing and other programs that Johnson called “proven solutions to crime and violence reduction.” “We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence,” the mayor said. The debate also raises questions about where Trump has not called for federal intervention. Trump, as a candidate, regularly assailed U.S. cities – not just Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington. Detroit was “decimated” and “filthy.” Atlanta was a “killing field.” Pritzker noted that Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, have notably higher murder rates than Chicago. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, but one who has deviated from her colleagues like Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom by engaging more directly with Trump, including in-person visits to the White House. And even one leading Republican executive, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, added tacit support to Democrats' critiques. “Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,” he said in a statement, without mentioning Trump by name.</p>

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explains the rationale for President Donald Trump's deal with Intel and a 'very important' part of his deal with China on 'The Ingraham Angle.' President Donald Trump's plan to allow 600,000 Chinese student visas to be issued sparked backlash from the right on Monday and Tuesday. "I hear so many stories that we're not going to allow their students," Trump told reporters as trade talks with China are ongoing. But we're going to get along with China," he continued. "I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here because they'll go out and start building schools and they'll be able to survive it. But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries' students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. "I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Donald Trump says 600,000 Chinese students could be allowed into the U.S. to study at its colleges pending a potential trade agreement with China. Some immigration groups and conservative voices on social media voiced their opposition to the proposal. "We should not let in 600,000 CHINESE students to attend American colleges and universities that may be loyal to the CCP," Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., posted on X late Monday night. "If refusing to allow these Chinese students to attend our schools causes 15% of them to fail then these schools should fail anyways because they are being propped up by the CCP." "Granting 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals threatens to put foreign students ahead of U.S. graduates," Joe Chatham, director of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told Fox News Digital in a statement. Educating foreign nationals should never be put before the interests of U.S. citizens and ensuring that our nation thrives," he continued. "The president's point of view is that what would happen if you didn't have those 600K students is that you'd empty them from the top, all the students would go up to better schools, and the bottom 15% of universities and colleges would go out of business in America." "He's taking a rational economic view, which is classic Donald Trump," Lutnick added. Many suggested that the free market should come into play with these colleges that could be at a potential financial risk. WE DON'T WANT MORE CHINESE STUDENTS. We actually don't want any," conservative commentator Kira Davis wrote. "15% going under isn't a bad thing," writer Ryan Girdusky posted to X. "Trump's team is not capable of defending his Chinese student visa program," conservative lawyer Marina Medvin posted on X. "That's because they don't actually want it either. It's hard to sell something you don't like." "So this is essentially a subsidy for academia. American universities shouldn't need an influx of foreign students in order to stay afloat. If they can't survive on American enrollment, then let them go under. Plus, Chinese students steal our research and send it home," Josh Peterson, a full stack developer and investigative journalist, posted. Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler unleashed on the Trump White House, saying these Chinese students should be banned. They cozy up to our military," Wheeler posted on X. "Trump should ban all Chinese students from U.S. universities. "This is the dumbest explanation I've heard. By all means, put colleges & universities out of business!" Wheeler said in response to Lutnick's defense of Trump's policy. "Their business is indoctrinating students into hardened revolutionary Marxists. Others agreed with Lutnick's perspective on the issue, saying that it could actually help the United States bring in more talent domestically. Chinese students on U.S. visas aren't average kids. They represent the top tier of China's youth," podcast host Joshua Reid posted to X. "On the other side, we are hosting China's future leaders, scientists, and innovators. Which also means that American culture returns home with them. When you start to think about emergent tech, this is actually a great idea. Fox News Digital's Emma Bussey contributed to this report.

Pritzker delivered a fiery rebuke of President Trump's reported plan to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago The White House fired back at the barrage of criticism from Illinois Democrats over President Donald Trump's threat to send U.S. troops to Chicago. "If these Democrats spent half as much time addressing crime in their cities as they did going on cable news to complain about President Trump, their residents would be a lot safer," White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump himself confirmed that he's "willing to go to Chicago, which is in big trouble," adding that Gov. Pritzker and his fellow Illinois Democrats – Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Attorney General Kwame Raoul – railed against Trump as a "wannabe dictator" on Monday as the White House weighs deploying the U.S. National Guard to Chicago.

(Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo) "Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish its dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is – a dangerous power grab," Pritzker said. When reached for comment regarding Pritzker's criticism, the White House shared a fact sheet on Chicago crime, which includes local reporting that indicates, for the past 13 years, Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city. JB Pritzker delivers remarks in Chicago alongside Mayor Brandon Johnson and other officials as the White House floats deploying troops to the city. It also includes FOX 32's report that more illegal guns are recovered in Chicago than in Los Angeles or New York City combined. The City of Chicago is pushing back with its own fact sheet, arguing Johnson's primary focus has been "driving down violent crime in Chicago" during his first two years as mayor. "In the first six months of this year, Chicago has seen a 33% reduction in homicides and a 38% reduction in shootings," the mayor's office said, citing year-to-date crime statistics. Johnson also highlighted a "citywide homicide clearance rate of 77.4%," which his office said is "the highest in more than a decade," as the mayor emphasizes mental health and a "holistic approach to community safety." "It's very safe right now," Trump said of Washington, D.C., during his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. For nearly two weeks, Trump has carried out a crackdown on crime in Washington, mobilizing more than 2,200 National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the nation's capital. "It's going to get so good that this will be the safest capital there is. It'll be one of the safest places in our nation anywhere," Trump told his Cabinet, adding that "12 days ago, it was the most unsafe place in our nation." Trump has floated deploying troops to other U.S. cities as well, including Baltimore, Md., where he was met with criticism by another potential 2028 presidential contender, Democratic Gov.

(Oregon State Police via AP, file) BANDON, Oregon (AP) — The owner of an Oregon zoo has been indicted on more than 300 counts of animal neglect and other charges after police said they found drugs and guns at the facility. Brian Tenney, the owner of West Coast Game Park Safari in Bandon, was arraigned on Monday. Tenney's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a phone number associated with the zoo did not have voicemail set up. Tenney has not yet had the opportunity to enter a plea. Oregon State Police announced earlier this year that authorities served several search warrants at the zoo near the southern Oregon coast in May, following an investigation that included inquiries into the animals' welfare. Police said they found methamphetamine, dozens of firearms, cocaine and large amounts of cash. More than 300 animals were relocated to animal sanctuaries or rescue facilities, and a camel, chicken and kinkajou were euthanized after being evaluated by veterinarians. A grand jury indicted Tenney on 371 charges — including 327 felonies — on Aug. 19, according to state court records.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump has tossed a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against every judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland over a blanket order slowing deportations. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday dismissed a June lawsuit filed against the judges over a standing order from the judicial district's chief judge, George Russell, which automatically granted a two-day pause on deporting illegal immigrants if they file a habeas corpus petition challenging their detention. “In their wisdom, the Constitution's framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign. That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another's authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary's constitutional role,” Cullen wrote, calling the lawsuit “not ordinary.” “Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect. Cullen said in his ruling that the DOJ “must find a proper way to raise” its concerns, and suggested appealing the standing order in a habeas proceeding to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, among other options to challenge the standing order. One of the most high-profile cases the Trump administration has fought in the Maryland judicial district was filed by illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia over his deportation. The latest volley fired in that legal battle, filed Monday, challenges the Salvadoran national's deportation to Uganda via a habeas corpus petition. Because of the standing order in the judicial district, his deportation was automatically paused until at least Wednesday, but a judge indefinitely halted his deportation pending the scheduling of an evidentiary hearing in the case.</p>

Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness. These are, after all, the same GOP political appointees who said that President Donald Trump is allowed to commit crimes. Last May, however, the Court did appear to draw a line in the sand and warn Trump not to cross it. In Trump v. Wilcox, a decision that otherwise endorsed the proposition that Trump can fire leaders of independent federal agencies that are supposed to enjoy a degree of job security, the Court signaled that Trump may not fire leaders of the Federal Reserve. Admittedly, the Republican justices' explanation of why Fed leaders are protected is gibberish. One of the first major constitutional disputes in the United States involved a disagreement between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over whether Congress could charter a national bank. In any event, we're about to find out if the Republican justices were serious about this rare and arbitrary limit they placed on Trump's authority. So Trump is doing the one thing that this Court has said he may not do. This is because the Fed is supposed to make technocratic decisions about US monetary policy without being influenced by partisan politics. If Trump controlled the Fed, or if he had the power to fire its leaders, he could order it to juice the economy at a politically beneficial time for him — even though doing so would do much greater long-term harm to the US economy. The Republican justices, however, are all devotees of a legal theory known as the “unitary executive,” which claims that it is unconstitutional to give any federal agency leader protection from being fired by the president. In Wilcox, for example, the Court's Republicans permitted Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, two other agencies whose leaders are supposed to be protected from political firings. He alleges that she committed mortgage fraud by describing two separate properties as her primary residence, but this is an obvious pretext. Trump has raised similar allegations against several of his political enemies, including New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). It is now all but inevitable that Cook v. Trump will reach the Supreme Court after Cook sues to retain her job. And thus any federal official who wields power that is “executive” in nature must be fully accountable to the president and must serve at the president's pleasure. Even if you accept this basic principle, the Republican justices have often applied the unitary executive theory in haphazard and ahistorical ways. In their benighted Trump immunity opinion, for example, the Republican justices claimed that “investigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive function” — and thus the president must have full control over all federal prosecutors. But the United States didn't centralize federal prosecutions in the executive branch until fairly late in its history. As law professor Jed Shugerman explained in a 2019 essay, prosecutions initiated by private attorneys were the norm “through the mid-nineteenth century” — although the Fifth Amendment still required these private lawyers to obtain an indictment from a grand jury before a federal prosecution could proceed. Additionally, “federal judges themselves led what appeared to be prosecutions during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.” Vestiges of this old system still remain. Current law, for example, gives federal district judges the power to appoint US attorneys under some circumstances. All of which underscores a recurring theme from these justices: The current Court's unitary executive decisions do not appear to be a good-faith effort to interpret the Constitution; rather, it appears that they're just about power. While lawyers can only palm their faces in despair at this Court's unitary executive cases, economists and investors will watch the Cook case with great interest, because the consequences of a decision permitting Trump to fire Fed leaders would be quite dire. The Federal Reserve is supposed to maintain a very delicate balance when it raises or lowers interest rates. High interest rates strangle economic growth and depress employment, but they also reduce inflation. So, if the Fed sets those rates in the wrong place, it risks either mass unemployment or runaway inflation. In 1971, President Richard Nixon pushed Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates in advance of Nixon's reelection race — the idea was to inject cocaine into the economy at the moment when voters were weighing Nixon's economic record, and to let the pain come later. And Nixon won reelection in an historic landslide. Burns's action is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s. It's not hard to imagine how presidents could abuse this power if the Supreme Court gives them control over the Fed. So it's not hard to see why even this Supreme Court is cautious about giving Trump the power to fire Federal Reserve leaders. Still, these same justices have shown all the backbone of a jellyfish when they are asked to impose literally any limit whatsoever on Donald Trump. So it remains to be seen whether they will hold to the completely arbitrary line they drew in Wilcox. The court finally lifted a two-year ban on drag performances. Don't expect the courts to keep ICE under control. The Court has a special set of rules for Trump. A new poll shows public support for the Supreme Court at its lowest point ever.</p>

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a Pennsylvania requirement for mail-in ballots with missing or incorrect dates to be tossed out is unconstitutional, upholding a lower district court ruling.

A panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld a March ruling from a federal district court in Pennsylvania that found the requirement did “not pass constitutional muster” in a lawsuit filed around the 2022 election. The Republican National Committee had appealed the lower court ruling, but a panel of three judges appointed by former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush rejected the appeal.

“We must determine if the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's requirement that mail-in ballots that arrive in undated or misdated return envelopes be discarded complies with our Constitution,” the opinion written by Judge D. Brooks Smith said. 

“Weighing the burden that practice imposes on Pennsylvanians' constitutional right to vote against the State's interest in the practice, the balance of the scales leads us to hold that it does not comply with our Constitution,” added the opinion by the Bush-appointed judge.

The lawsuit, which was brought in Nov. 2022 by a group of Pennsylvania voters, now-Sen. John Fetterman's (D-PA) campaign, along with the Democratic Party's House and Senate campaign wings, argued the state's date requirement for mail-in ballots violated the Civil Rights Act along with the First and 14th Amendments.

“The date on a mail ballot envelope thus has no bearing on a voter's qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote,” the Democrat-led lawsuit alleged.

The RNC could appeal the panel's decision to the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit or appeal to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is slated to hear a trio of cases that could have significant implications for the 2026 elections, including one regarding Louisiana's congressional map and one that could open the door to challenging late-arriving mail-in ballots.

If the decision allowing undated ballots to be counted remains in place for the 2026 elections, it could have an impact on various key races in the Keystone State, including for the governor and in battleground House races.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why it matters that the University of Chicago is pausing admissions to doctoral programs in literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages I was getting ready to Zoom interview for a tenure-track job near Boston that I almost certainly wouldn't get (and didn't). Sardined with me in a Greenwich Village coffee shop in December 2019, one of my faculty mentors talked me through, for the thousandth time, the questions I should expect the hiring committee to ask me and dispensed advice about how I should answer them. Then we walked back to his office, lined in handsome foreign-language editions of various novels and works of philosophy, where I would sit for the interview. There, he offered a final piece of wisdom: “Don't be nervous. Some other elite schools might have the coveted Ivy League branding, or a few more famous faculty members, or a couple more dollars to tack onto the salaries of its professors and graduate students. “Chicago!” as one stunned academic friend put it in a text to me. In an August 12 email to faculty, Deborah Nelson, Chicago's arts and humanities dean, said that the changes were necessitated by “this moment of uncertainty” and “evolving fiscal realities.” These bits of bureaucratese appear to be allusions to both the Trump administration's war on higher education and Chicago's homegrown financial troubles, which include an eye-popping $6.3 billion in debt and a bad bet on crypto. Chicago's social-sciences division has also announced doctoral-admissions pauses, primarily in humanistic-leaning programs such as anthropology and social thought, where towering figures including the philosopher Hannah Arendt once taught. What's happening at Chicago is a particular gut-punch to the humanities, not just at the university itself, but nationally and even globally. Chicago has long helped to keep alive tiny fields and esoteric areas of humanistic study, particularly in the languages. Of course, some might view these comments as self-serving complaints. But the primary fears of the people I spoke with were not about their own careers or futures, but instead about their fields—about knowledge that, once lost, cannot be easily regained. “There's also a real practical risk that a field simply cannot be re-created just because you have books.” I heard this sentiment echoed over and over. “If we stop producing people who are trained or educated to help undergraduates understand the most important things thought or written or painted in human history,” the renowned philosopher Robert Pippin said, “we might not be able to recover that.” Elaine Hadley, an emerita professor of English, told me, “Part of what we do is we're conservators, keeping a body of knowledge going. No one I spoke to was insensitive to the pressures their grad students face when confronting the vanishing opportunities for tenure-track employment. But the professors also seemed reluctant to define the success of a program by how many professors it creates—after all, most humanities PhD students at Chicago do not pay tuition and receive stipends to cover their living costs, and getting paid to learn and read is not the worst fate. These faculty perspectives also stood in stark contrast with the reigning image of elite higher educators in right-wing media outlets: that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Depending on whom I asked, the move to scale back humanities doctoral programs is either a prudent acknowledgment of the cratered job market for tenure-track professorships and a wise attempt to protect the university's humanities division from looming financial and political risks, or it is a cynical effort, under cover of the Trump administration's assaults, to transfer resources away from “impractical,” unprofitable, and largely jobless fields (such as, say, comparative literature) and toward areas that the university's senior leadership seems to care about (such as, say, STEM and “innovation”). Many professors worried that the move to impose uneven changes—reducing admissions in some while halting them in others—may be an attempt to create circumstances that will ultimately make it easier to dissolve the paused programs. “Let no good crisis go unleveraged,” Holly Shissler, an associate professor in the Middle Eastern Studies department, said with a dark laugh. When I emailed Nelson and asked whether the changes were part of a plan to kill off the paused departments, she said, “A one-year pause is exactly that—a discrete decision that applies merely to a single admissions cycle.” She seemed to acknowledge, however, that a divisional reorganization could happen. “My goal is to sustain the full scope of our faculty's research and teaching,” she said. “To do so, we must be open to new ideas and structures.” She added, “There's no magic number of departments in the arts and humanities.” In the meantime, Chicago's humanities professors appear largely determined to resist being evaluated in terms of expediency. In a meeting with Nelson a few days after the announcement, 14 out of 15 chairs in the humanities division told the dean that she should pause enrollment in all of their departments or none of them. Targeting some and not others was unacceptable, they argued, because it sent the message that some fields matter and others do not. As anyone who has served on a faculty anywhere can tell you, this degree of cross-department solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for less-favored colleagues is remarkable, and even moving. And it does not settle the most pressing question raised by all this turmoil. One Chicago administrator, in an attempt to defend the university's admissions pauses, pointed out that other prestigious peer institutions were expected to make similar announcements about their Ph.D. admissions in the coming weeks, and noted that Harvard is cutting nearly $2 million from its own humanities division. But the evidence doesn't give me much hope.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? We all have a limited reserve of attention, and modern life is excellent at depleting it. In the past, humans did a fair amount of strategizing and planning to survive, but now, we're bombarded with emails and messages all day, we juggle calendars, attempt to multitask, and pull out our phones when we can't think of anything better to do. Into the breach has stepped an enormous number of productivity hacks, as well as influencers and productivity evangelists peddling easy-fix solutions. A to-do list no longer suffices when you can intricately track habits, time, goals, and progress. We also live in an era of ubiquitous short-form videos and AI overviews, bite-sized bits of information that are supposed to save us time, but in fact may just be fueling the desire to devour more content as quickly as possible. It isn't that we're undisciplined or have undiagnosed ADHD (although that certainly may be the case for some) — we're simply pushing our minds beyond the brink of what they can reasonably do, Stajkovic says. “You could see how it would be easy for people to say we have attention problems when really the problem is the environment and how much we're trying to fit in,” Stajkovic says. It just wasn't made to tow a boat.” This constant barrage of information we're subjected to in modern life, most of which is delivered via a screen, leads to information and cognitive overload — a mental maxing out of attention and productivity. Because the hunter-gatherer brain has a limit on attentional capacity, modern demands chip away at those resources, Stajkovic explains. Simple, routine tasks — brushing your teeth, feeding yourself — are less mentally taxing, while blocks of meetings, hours of work without a break, and perpetual scrolling are depleting. In this exhausted state, it's difficult to put forth your best effort. In one study, German workers who used text-based digital tools like Slack, Trello, and email during the pandemic had higher rates of perceived cognitive overload. Video tools, on the other hand, didn't contribute to cognitive overload. Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank. The consequences of cognitive overload are far-reaching, if not entirely surprising: Psychological distress, lower job productivity and satisfaction, depressive symptoms. “It impairs our working memory, it impairs our ability to make decisions and the quality of decisions we make,” says Miriam Arnold, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “It can also have behavioral outcomes, so we might try to avoid the information, for example, ignoring emails or procrastinating, which makes it worse in the long term.” Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank. The pace of work in our hyper-connected digital workplace isn't helping matters much either. Employees are not only responsible for the central elements of their job; they're also expected to be constantly reachable and responsive. The modern workday can feel like it's filled more with communicating about work — answering emails and attending meetings — than actually doing the work. Even with more busywork and tighter timelines to contend with, we're still driven to be high-performers because of the fundamental human need to display competence, says Klotz, also the author of Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less. Although sending another email or checking off a to-do list item gives the illusion of accomplishment, it's only a proxy for actual productivity. “One of the reasons that it doesn't feel good to be going as hard as we can and not actually accomplish anything,” Klotz says, “is because we realize that we're not meeting that need for competence.” In order to get more done, some may turn to productivity tools and systems — project managing software, strategies meant for people with diagnosed attention disorders, breaking down assignments into smaller tasks. “Say you have three things to do, and a strategy is breaking it into micro-tasks,” Stajkovic says. The best way to get more done when you've hit your cognitive max is the most straightforward: Take a break and rejuvenate, experts say. In which case, try to take at least a 15-minute pause during the workday and don't skip your lunch break. Some jobs don't offer the flexibility to pause outside of designated break times, so Stajkovic suggests switching to a less taxing assignment if you can, something you can do almost automatically without much thinking. Outside of work, it's important not to sabotage leisure time. Why are you responding to emails at 10 pm or opening TikTok as soon as you have a moment of downtime? And instead of adding more to your plate in the form of elaborate productivity hacks, try eliminating what doesn't serve you. While everyone's scenario will look different, Klotz suggests clarifying your goal in work or life and skipping meetings or tasks that don't serve that goal if you have the flexibility. If your main purpose at work is to teach students, maybe there are a few nonessential department meetings you could opt out of to make more time for additional instruction. Perhaps the most impactful antidote to our fast-paced, production-obsessed culture is recognizing you probably did enough today — and nothing short of a brain upgrade can change that. “Instead of thinking about ‘What more could I do? '” Stajkovic says, “focus on what I did get done and being content with that.” But do you really want to run your household like a small business? Why it feels like people are more impolite than ever.﻿ A summer program running on magic, swords, and financial precarity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses. The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers. Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don't match what states confirmed. In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. The money in question wasn't spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. “It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16. Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn't sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained. In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs. We don't have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said. At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She'd been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn't read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out. We'd get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad. Trump administration pulls back billions in Covid-era funding for state, local health departments States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF. The Trump administration's nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News' analysis. The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said. She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients' hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice. “We've never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts. Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump's first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended. “I don't understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.” CDC facing major funding cuts, with direct impact on state and local health departments Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing. The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles. KFF Health News' analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations. Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 to one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage on National Institutes of Health grant terminations. “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods. This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients' location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration's order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Today, after years of escalating attacks, that consensus has irrevocably shattered. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, saying on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country's leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of the evidence that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children. Kennedy, in response, ominously warned the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don't follow the government's vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy's scrutiny. And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is meeting this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of Trump's “Operation Warp Speed” during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed. As a result of all this, more people could get sick. Drug manufacturers may produce fewer doses of their existing vaccines. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can't find one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won't be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won't cover it anymore. That will leave them to decide between taking the risk to go see their loved one, who could get seriously ill, or not seeing them at all. We are running headlong into a forced experiment, in which the federal government actively obstructs the usage of vaccines and the development of new ones, and a growing share of the public has lost their faith in one of modern medicine's greatest tools. That the federal government and professional medical societies would be openly at war over vaccine guidance in this way really was once unimaginable. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully eradicated measles as of 2000. But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still believe that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw its worst measles outbreak since the early 1990s, and Kennedy's health department was, based on reporting by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements waffling on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy's presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found an uneasy home within the Trump administration. After Trump's election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government's support for vaccines. In the first few months on the job, he put a vaccine skeptic in charge of searching for a link between vaccines and autism. He unilaterally rolled back those COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant people. He replaced the federal government's expert vaccine panel with his own handpicked members. He has ordered a review of the childhood immunization schedule, as well as the safety of Covid shots. But now the medical community is punching back. Americans, meanwhile, are stuck in the middle, just as we head into another cold-and-flu season. ﻿And why fitness culture is a quintessentially American invention.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, that's one way to silence a heckler. Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani hit a home run in the top of the ninth to cap off Sunday's 8-2 win against the San Diego Padres, but it wasn't the home run off Yuki Matsui that had everyone talking; it's what Ohtani did after rounding the bases. Ohtani was sitting at 0-10 – unusual for him – before the homer. So, after hitting his 45th home run of the season, Ohtani, with a huge smile on his face, ran up to the fan and gave him a high five and a pat on the back. He was then seen laughing while talking to those around him. “Very annoying, as he's in my right ear the entire game. But it was very out of character for Shohei and he was wearing him out the whole game,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. “It was good to see Shohei, you know, initiate a high five from him.” The skipper added with a smile, “That was great. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.” Ohtani certainly wasn't the only Dodgers player struggling earlier in the series as their offense only scraped together two runs total in the opening two games – both LA losses – before exploding on Sunday. His projected 409-foot home run to right-center came with Los Angeles already up by five in the ninth. It was the cherry on top of a dominant outing for the defending World Series champions.</p>

Hurwitz grew up in a “culturally Jewish” home in Massachusetts, but her parents weren't religious, even if they sent Sarah to Hebrew school. Hurwitz maintained this loose relationship with her faith until, at 36 and the height of her career, she attended an Introduction to Judaism class. Hurwitz's first book, Here All Along: Finding Meaning, Spirituality, and a Deeper Connection to Life – in Judaism (After Finally Choosing to Look There), about her rediscovery of Judaism, was published in 2013. It is a much more intense book than its predecessor. Hurwitz is angry about the antisemitism that has risen in recent years. In 2021, during “yet another iteration of the Israel–Gaza conflict” and with “Hamas launching rockets at Israel and Israel responding with air strikes,” Hurwitz was appalled by what she read online: “As I scrolled through social media posts declaring that Israelis are Nazis and ‘Zionism = Racism,' I was struck by how many of these posts were coming from progressive voices, people I thought of as being on my ‘side.' It had been bubbling beneath the surface for years.” Here she is describing how modern liberalism can't compare to religious tradition: “Severed from my roots, the closest I came to meaning and spirituality was a collection of social justice slogans and self-help clichés, a convenient mash-up of Democratic politics and ‘being a good person' filtered through the ‘you do you' creed of modern life. Knowing much about how to be accomplished, but little about how to be good, I skimmed the surface of my life while building my résumé.” Communists didn't like the fact that Jews had a tradition going back thousands of years, a threat to communism's “Year Zero” plans to start history anew. Hurwitz quotes historian Izabella Tabarovsky, who observed that Soviet propaganda denouncing “Zionism” reached people across the Muslim world and in Africa. For a Democrat such as Hurwitz, seeing students at America's elite institutions rage against Jewish people is heartbreaking. “I now understood how the story of Zionism has been stolen and rewritten by others such that it is no longer about a people who rejected their role as history's scapegoats and rose up to claim safety, autonomy, and power in a state of their own,” she writes. If I have any criticism of As a Jew, it's that Hurwitz doesn't address the ways that Jews in America have profoundly enriched our culture. In the end, Hurwitz laments that many Jewish people let others write their history.</p>
