                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Daniil Medvedev is unlikely to look back fondly on the 2025 Grand Slam season. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has ended his year at the majors with just one match win after he fell to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat against Benjamin Bonzi on Sunday night at the US Open. After stealing the third set amid chaotic scenes, Medvedev twice surrendered a break in the fifth set. After shaking hands with Bonzi, he tossed six racquets from his bag to fans in the stands. Despite a courageous comeback and some excellent shotmaking, Medvedev produced an error-strewn performance on Louis Armstrong Stadium, offering up 64 unforced errors overall. For Bonzi, it was a second consecutive Grand Slam victory against Medvedev following his four-set triumph in the pair's clash at Wimbledon in late June. The 20-time tour-level champion Medvedev began his Grand Slam year by rallying from two-sets-to-one down to defeat then-World No. “I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” Medvedev said of his 2025 Grand Slam season. Benjamin Bonzi defeats Daniil Medvedev on Sunday at the US Open. Sunday night's encounter between Medvedev and Bonzi in New York did not lack drama. Bonzi appeared set to wrap a comfortable upset when he stepped up to serve on match point at 5-4, 40/30 in the third set, but an unexpected interruption acted as a catalyst for wild scenes on Louis Armstrong Stadium. Medvedev ran towards the umpire's chair to remonstrate and soon after encouraged the crowd to raise as much noise as they could muster. Sustained crowd noise delayed play for about five minutes. As Bonzi paced near the back of the court, even Medvedev was concerned things had spiralled out of control and he signalled for an end to the chaos. Upon resumption, a Bonzi fault drew an enormous roar from fans. Massive roars rang out when Medvedev then earned – and converted – a break point to level at 5-5. The former US Open champion, who once fancied himself a villain to the New York crowd – made a heart symbol with his hands to thank them for their support. Despite serving below full strength due to a leg injury, Bonzi fought off five break points to hold for 4-3 and soon after broke Medvedev in the final game of the match to secure a dramatic win for new coach Nicolas Mahut. “It's a very important win, it's my first Grand Slam with Nico, our first week together,” Bonzi said on court after the victory. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. For me it's like my best victory ever. But the 29-year-old's horror show at the Slams represents a dramatic dropoff for a player who has been of the most consistent performers at that level in recent years: Medvedev reached at least one Grand Slam final per year from 2021 to 2024.

Ultimately, Muchova, last year's semifinalist, proved too strong on this occasion for the seven-time Grand Slam winner, closing out a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory in exactly two hours. The result marked Williams' fourth consecutive first-round exit in New York. This was Williams' 25th US Open appearance, coming just a month after she returned to competition with a surprise win over then-World No. Her return to the Big Apple didn't start as smoothly. She was broken in the opening game and quickly fell behind 0-2, facing three break points in her second service game at risk of going down a double break early. But she saved all three and rallied to win three straight games, taking a 3-2 lead before dropping the next four to concede the first set. Williams committed seven double faults in the opener. She broke Muchova in the opening game and never looked back, hitting 10 winners to just five unforced errors, and limiting herself to one double fault.

Specifically, the barrier that Althea Gibson broke 75 years ago when she became the first African-American to play the U.S. Nationals at Forest Hills.So it made sense that fans had a chance to see one of the inheritors of Gibson's legacy, and a trailblazer of equal importance, Venus Williams, play in person on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. So it made sense that fans had a chance to see one of the inheritors of Gibson's legacy, and a trailblazer of equal importance, Venus Williams, play in person on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. 👉 Watch on the Tennis Channel app: TenniStory, Althea Gibson Williams' presence would have been enough, no matter how her first-round match with Karolina Muchova went. And for the first three games, it looked like we might not get much more than that from Venus. She started the way you would expect a 45-year-old who hasn't played a Grand Slam match in two years, and who has played very few matches anywhere since 2021, to start: slowly. She was down 0-2 before most fans had entered the building. Many of them may have wondered: Was she going to get a game?Venus put those fears to rest by saving three break points and holding for 2-1. From there, she began to get comfortable in the rallies. Her service toss gets away from her—she committed 10 double faults in this match. But for all of that, she can still put a flat wallop on the ball. When she does, even a highly-ranked 20-something pro like Muchova isn't going to catch up with it.

When she does, even a highly-ranked 20-something pro like Muchova isn't going to catch up with it. For the next set and a half, Williams played Muchova evenly. She drilled winning returns off her second serves. She found the corners with her ground strokes. She even jumped up to knock off a smash. “You guys had me stressed.”Even then, the fans stayed silent. “I was stressed,” Muchova told the crowd later. “You guys had me stressed.”Even then, the fans stayed silent. But Muchova overcame it when she needed to. After losing the second set, she walked off court, “collected myself,” and came back out and played much cleaner tennis. Just as in the first set, she started with an early break, and quickly led 3-0. Still, even in the third set, there was a vintage Venus moment. The cameras caught Venus' scream as she swung.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys had the first-round jitters in her surprising loss to Renata Zarazua, a 3 hour and 10 minute marathon in which she committed 89 unforced errors. NEW YORK -- Even in a breakthrough season capped by her first Grand Slam title, Madison Keys faltered on Monday, falling to unseeded Renata Zarazua in the first round on Arthur Ashe Stadium. The sixth-seeded American, who won her first Grand Slam title earlier this year in Melbourne, fought off the Mexican World No. 82 for three painstaking sets before finally succumbing, 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5, in a 3-hour and 10-minute marathon. Speaking to reporters after the match, Keys, 30, said she felt fine in warm-ups, but it was evident early in the first set that she wasn't at her strongest. "And it kind of became a little bit paralyzing. The sloppiness was evident, as Keys made 89 unforced errors against 46 winners. "I think it was probably building a little bit," Keys said when asked about the pressure of playing her first US Open as a major champion. "The reality is it usually builds a little bit. You always kind of feel first-round jitters, and as the day is getting closer, you feel a little bit more and more nervous. Then once you start playing badly, it just kind of all snowballs." It was a particularly stunning upset, and not just because of Zarazua's far lower ranking. It was also only her ninth appearance in the main draw of a Slam, and she's never advanced past the second round. It's equally surprising because of Keys' success in tight matches this year. She currently leads the Hologic WTA Tour with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins. -- but her recent experience at majors has helped her feel like she belongs, and made the moment feel more manageable. "I was really nervous coming in," Zarazua told reporters. Next up for the feisty 5-foot-3 player is Diane Parry, who dropped just one game in a dominant effort over now-retired Petra Kvitova.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It would be hard for Marin Cilic's past at the US Open not to somehow inform his latest campaign at the hard-court major. The 2014 titlist is back to compete in New York for the first time in three years and walking around the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center has perhaps inevitably brought back memories of his past successes there. Cilic's intention is to put them to good use as he prepares for his 15th main-draw appearance at Flushing Meadows. Obviously, I am not thinking only about my victory here, more into details,” Cilic, who takes on 23rd seed Alexander Bublik in the first round, told ATPTour.com. What helped me to just find my inner peace and compete at that level? “I'm just trying to pick a couple of things and if I can incorporate those into my game, great. The feeling that you know you played well here is maybe an extra boost to lift your game.” The US Open naturally stands out as a special tournament for Cilic, but not just for his 2014 title run in which he dropped just three sets and included a straight-sets victory against Roger Federer in the semi-finals. “It means an achievement of a lifetime [to me], absolutely,” said the 36-year-old Croatian. “Here, all my dreams came true, so coming here again always brings the goosebumps and always brings a little bit of a sensation of, ‘Can I do it again?' Marin Cilic defeated Kei Nishikori to triumph at the 2014 US Open. There were no guarantees that Cilic was going to get the chance to compete again at an event where he holds a 41-13 record. He missed almost all of the 2023 season and half of 2024 due to a right knee injury, a tough absence for any player to bounce back from in their mid-30s. “It was a huge struggle to come back,” reflected Cilic. “It's an extremely difficult position, unknown territory, when you need to do a surgery. I was so diligent and professional for so many years, and I want to come back to give myself another chance. That's you on the photo, I can't believe it!' When Cilic steps on court to face Bublik on Tuesday afternoon in New York, it will be the 36-year-old's first US Open outing since 2022, when he reached the fourth round. A 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz ended Cilic's run in a five-set thriller before going on to lift his maiden major title and simultaneously become the youngest No. “I played him that year also in Miami, where he won his first Masters 1000 and I was like, ‘This guys is unbelievable',” recalls Cilic of the 2022 incarnation of Alcaraz. “Not many guys just blew me off the court like that. To even have that kind of a run in 2022 when he was 19, with so many tough matches and five setters, it was just incredible.” 1-chasing Alcaraz: Sinner's ‘back is a big target' at the US Open! With Cilic having played most of his career in the ‘Big Four' era, the way Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have dominated the majors across 2024 and 2025 could give Cilic a sense of déjà vu. “Carlos and Jannik deserve [their success],” said Cilic. They worked on their game and have incredible ability. For me, it is also great to be a part of this generation as well.” As a player who notched plenty of successes in the Big Four era, does Cilic have any advice for other top ATP Tour stars currently trying to reel in the red-hot Alcaraz and Sinner? “Everybody has different goals, but if you want to be better than those guys, you have to be prepared to work better than them and be smart with training, smart with decisions. Many things, because these guys are just on a run for the past couple of years and are not meaning to stop.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
