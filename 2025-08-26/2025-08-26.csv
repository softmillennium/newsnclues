            A federal judge on Tuesday threw out an aggressive, unusual lawsuit the Trump administration brought earlier this year against all 15 federal judges in Maryland, rejecting a bid by the Justice Department to limit court power in fast-moving immigration cases.
    


            The opinion on Tuesday framed the lawsuit as a major constitutional standoff, with Judge Thomas Cullen writing the Justice Department couldn't pursue a “constitutional free-for-all.”
    


            Cullen, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, also wrote a scathing rebuke of the Trump administration, saying it is intentionally trying to smear the justice system.
    


            “Over the past several months, principal officers of the Executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,' ‘liberal,' ‘activists,' ‘radical,' ‘politically minded,' ‘rogue,' ‘unhinged,' ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,' ‘[c]rooked,' and worse,” Cullen wrote.
    


            “Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate,” he added.
    


            The ruling from Cullen, who was brought in from another district to handle the case in Maryland, said the government lacked the legal right — known as standing — to bring the challenge and that the judges are immune from such suits brought by the executive branch.
    


            “Any fair reading of the legal authorities cited by Defendants leads to the ineluctable conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss. To hold otherwise would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law,” Cullen wrote in the 39-page decision.
    


Judge to require that Kilmar Abrego Garcia remain in the US while he challenges deportation to Uganda



            The Justice Department sued all federal judges on the lower-level District Court of Maryland in late June, after the court's chief judge put in place a rule that would automatically and temporarily block the Trump administration from removing an immigration detainee from the US if the detainee had gone to court to challenge their removal.
    


            That rule was on full display Monday in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to El Salvador in mid-March and eventually returned to the US. The Trump administration has indicated it was to deport him immediately, but Abrego Garcia filed a new case in Maryland that triggered the protection from the court against immediate deportation.
    


            Tuesday, Cullen found he wouldn't have the authority the Trump administration wanted from him to immediately block the Maryland judges it sued, and that the executive branch doesn't have a reason within the law where it can sue the judges as it did.
    


            “Dismissal of the Executive's suit is appropriate because it has not pointed to a cause of action that permits this court to entertain a lawsuit between two coordinate branches of government, and this court will not be the first to create one,” he wrote.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.
    


            The Justice Department had argued that the automatic orders from the Maryland court in certain immigration cases were unlawful because they didn't involve the usual analysis by a judge to determine whether such a temporary block against a removal was warranted.
    


            In finishing his opinion, Cullen underscored the unusual nature of the lawsuit, which came as the Trump administration faced a slew of immigration-related cases amid its effort to deport an unprecedented number of undocumented immigrants from Maryland and elsewhere.
    


            “Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,” he wrote. “Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.”

            United States Special Envoy Tom Barrack sparked outrage after telling Lebanese journalists to act “civilized,” not “animalistic,” during a news conference in the Lebanese capital Beirut on Tuesday.
    


            Barrack, joined by deputy envoy Morgan Ortagus, was in the Lebanese capital as part of US efforts to disarm the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. During the briefing, he scolded the journalists for calling out questions simultaneously – a common practice in news conferences – linking their behavior to what he described as a broader “problem” in the Middle East.
    


            “Please, be quiet for a moment. And I wanna tell you something. The moment this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we're gone. So, you want to know what's happening? Act civilized, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what's happening in the region,” he told the reporters.
    


            Lebanon faces a delicate dilemma. It relies on crucial US support while accommodating Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the country, even as it comes under frequent Israeli military attacks.
    


            “Do you think this is fun for us? Do you think this is economically beneficial for Morgan (Ortagus) and I to be here putting up with this insanity?” he told the journalists.
    


            Barrack, who is of Lebanese descent, is the special envoy to Syria and also serves as the US Ambassador to Turkey.
    


            The envoy's comments angered Lebanese journalists on social media, who described the statements as “racist.”
    


            “Tom Barrack struts into Beirut like a 19th-century colonial commissioner, calls Lebanese journalists ‘animalistic,' lectures us on ‘civilization,' & blames it all on our ‘region.' That's not just arrogance, it's racism. You don't run this country, & you don't get to insult its people,” Lebanese-British journalist Hala Jaber said on X.
    


            Another journalist, Ali Hashem, called the comments “humiliating.”
    


            “The level of arrogance US officials demonstrate in Lebanon is humiliating for the country.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the US State Department and Barrack's team for comment.
    


            Without naming Barrack, the Lebanese presidency said it “regrets the statements made from its platform” by “one of its guests today.”
    


            Barrack is leading a US delegation to Lebanon, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Congressman Joe Wilson, and Ortagus.
    


            The US has offered Lebanon support if its government disarms Hezbollah. The militant group was weakened significantly after months of an Israeli campaign that was launched after Hezbollah attacked Israeli-held territory in support of Hamas in October 2023.

            Calling Turkish coffee “just a drink” undersells it. It's a ritual, a conversation and, as arguably the ancestor of all modern coffees, it's a nearly 500-year-old piece of history, inscribed by UNESCO on its intangible cultural heritage of humanity list.
    


            Coffee's roots go back even further. Lani Kingston, adjunct professor at Portland State University, says a single coffee bean dating from the 12th century has been found at an archaeological site in the United Arab Emirates. By 1350, coffee-serving paraphernalia appeared in Turkey, Egypt and Persia.
    


            The story of Turkish coffee begins not in Turkey, but in Yemen. In the 15th century, Sufi mystics are said to have consumed it to stay awake during long nights of prayer and devotions. When Sultan Süleyman, known in Europe as Süleyman the Magnificent, seized Yemen in 1538, coffee made its way into the Ottoman Empire. Within a year, the beans had reached Constantinople — the ancient city that is now Istanbul.
    


            In 1539, the Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa registered a property that included a “kahve odası,” or coffee room, according to Cemal Kafadar, Harvard professor and author of an academic paper about coffee: “How Dark is the History of the Night, How Black the Story of Coffee, How Bitter the Tale of Love: The Changing Measure of Leisure and Pleasure in Early Modern Istanbul.”
    


            By the 1550s, the first “kahvehanes,” or coffeehouses were appearing in İstanbul, chronicled by historian İbrahim Peçevi in his book, “History of Peçevi.” The beverage's new popularity quickly reshaped cultural life. The Ottoman cezve-ibrik method of preparing coffee — shared with Greece and rooted in Ethiopia — became the hallmark of traditional Turkish coffee. As gastronomy researcher Merin Sever explains, the fundamental difference between Turkish and other coffees is that cezve-ibrik is essentially cooking; it's not brewed, but “cooked” in water like a soup, producing an unfiltered drink.
    


            Coffeehouses stirred controversy. Religious scholars and political leaders across Asia and Europe viewed them as places for subversive activities and idle chatter. Mecca's governor, Hayır Bey, banned coffee in the city in 1511, an edict that would last 13 years, due to concern it would lead to radical ideas. Ottoman sultans repeatedly shut down cafes over similar fears. They never completely vanished though. Even in 17th-century England, Charles II tried to shut them, suspecting “anti-royalist sedition and treasonous conversation is happening in those coffee shops,” says London tour guide Chris MacNeil.
    


            Turkish coffee is “more than a beverage,” says Seden Doğan, assistant professor of instruction at the University of South Florida and a native of Safranbolu, in northern Turkey. Doğan calls it a “bridge” that facilitates sharing — both in sorrow or joy.
    


            Today, coffee is the unofficial catch-up drink in Turkey. As in many countries, when two friends who have been apart for a while want to have a chat, they say, “Let's have coffee.” In Turkey, that means something more specific: “Come over and I'll make you a cup of Turkish coffee.”
    


            The preparation ritual is precise and meticulous, involving a small, long-handled pot called a cezve placed over heat, preferably hot coals or sand. The finest coffee grounds are cooked slowly to release a rich flavor and create a beautiful top layer of foam, considered a mark of quality.
    


The underwater city where black roses bloom



            A proper Turkish coffee must be served hot and with foam intact, alongside a glass of water and a piece of lokum, or Turkish delight. The water cleanses the palate, while the lokum balances the drink's bitterness.
    


            Coffee etiquette is equally important. Although served in small cups, it's to be drunk calmly and slowly, not rushed like an espresso. This gives the grounds time to settle and keeps them at the bottom of the cup.
    


            When the cup is empty, it's time for the ritual of tasseography, or coffee-cup reading. The cup is inverted onto its saucer, left to cool and then shapes and symbols perceived in the leftover grounds are “read” for meaning. These are mostly made up on the fly, but a fish typically means luck; a bird indicates a journey.
    


            While fortune-telling is generally discouraged in Islamic culture, coffee-cup reading is viewed as a “playful, symbolic interpretation” and a “communal ritual,” says Kylie Holmes, author of “The Ancient Art of Tasseography.”
    


            Doğan agrees: “We do it for fun.” Tasseography is an act of storytelling, Doğan says she often spends an hour on a reading, weaving narratives and focusing on positive outcomes because people “enjoy hearing good things about themselves.”
    


            Turkey's coffee rituals also find their way into other national traditions. During courtship, a prospective bride prepares and serves Turkish coffee to the groom and his family. As a test of his character, she adds a generous amount of salt to the groom's coffee. If he drinks without complaint, he proves his patience, maturity — and worthiness.
    


            Coffee quickly moved westward. Venetians likely encountered it first through trading connections. But there's a clearer link between Turkey and London's original coffee scene: Daniel Edwards, a Levant Company merchant who lived in Smyrna, modern-day İzmir, brought his servant Pasqua Rosée to London. In 1652, Rosée opened what is believed to be the city's first coffeehouse in St. Michael's Alley.
    


            For a penny, customers could drink as much as they like while joining the lively conversation. Much like Turkey's “kahvehanes,” these “penny universities” were hubs of news, politics and, at times, dissent. Specifically, they were places of male dissent. Women weren't allowed to drink coffee in either culture, but in London women could at least work in a coffeehouse.
    


            Despite its rich history and cultural significance, Turkish coffee never had the global brand recognition of espresso. Sever blames a generational gap. “We've confined Turkish coffee to a ritual, and for young people, it's now seen as something you only drink with your parents,” she says.
    


            She says innovation is necessary for global appeal. Doğan disagrees, insisting on traditions must be protected.
    


Hagia Sophia: Secrets of the 1,600-year-old megastructure that has survived the collapse of empires



            Others are working hard to introduce Turkish coffee to the world. Ayşe Kapusuz organizes Turkish coffee workshops in London while in New York, Uluç Ülgen — Dr. Honeybrew — runs the Turkish Coffee Room, offering theatrical sessions of coffee drinking and fortune-telling.
    


            “Despite Turkish coffee's bitter taste, Americans drink it to the last drop for the cup-reading performance,” he says.
    


            To find a genuine coffee experience in Turkey, Kapusuz advises finding a venue where it's prepared slowly in a cezve, preferably over hot sand and served hot with thick foam, plus lokum and water.
    


            In Istanbul, Kapusuz recommends Hafız Mustafa. Sever suggest Mandabatmaz on İstiklal Street and Nuri Toplar in the city's Egyptian Bazaar. For a modern twist, she suggests Hacı Bekir in Kadıköy.
    


            Coffee-cup readings can be found in Istanbul's Sultanahmet district or near Tünel in Beyoğlu, but Doğan suggests a more personal approach, as the experience is more about storytelling and human connection than divination. That might simply mean asking a coffee-drinking local for help to find the fascinating story waiting at the bottom of a cup.

Russian media organizations are expanding their reach internationally as Western networks scale back operations due to financial constraints, the BBC reported Monday.

RT and Sputnik, which remain banned across much of the West following accusations that they had spread “misinformation” – have been growing their presence in other regions. RT launched a Serbian-language service in late 2024, while Sputnik Africa has recently launched radio broadcasting in Ethiopia.

The UK broadcaster said this “coincides with an apparent weakening from the Western media” driven by budget cuts and shifting foreign policy priorities. In Lebanon, it lamented, Sputnik has moved into airwaves previously occupied by BBC Arabic.

The report also pointed to staff reductions at US-funded Voice of America under President Donald Trump, part of a broader push to curb what his administration sees as inefficient government spending. 

The policy shift had global repercussions. In Ukraine, as many as 90% of media outlets have faced financial strain since foreign grant money became scarce.

Media experts interviewed by the BBC argued that Russian outlets have capitalized on the West's retreat. “Russia is like water: where there are cracks in the cement, it trickles in,” said Kathryn Stoner, a Stanford University political scientist.

Stoner and other scholars published a book last year titled ‘Russia, Disinformation, and the Liberal Order,' which characterized RT as a “threat to democracy.”

Founded in 2005, RT was designed to project Russian perspectives to international audiences. Part of its strategy has been to challenge entrenched Western narratives and present viewpoints excluded from other global broadcasters.

The Moldovan government has alienated voters by misrepresenting its crackdown on democratic institutions as necessary to further integration with the EU and offering a false choice between “democracy” and “authoritarianism,” according to American analyst Darren Spinck.

People in the fractured EU candidate state will take to the polls for parliamentary elections next month, and will be faced with a choice between unwavering loyalty to technocrats in Brussels or a more pluralistic political system supporting national sovereignty of the kind promoted by US President Donald Trump, Spinck suggested in an article in the National Interest magazine on Monday.

Moldovan President Maia Sandu claims that the country's path to the EU depends on her staying in power, and has labeled opposition figures as “pro-Russian” to justify erosion of democratic institutions during her tenure. Moscow has accused her of betraying Moldova's national interests for the sake of alignment with Brussels' policies.

Chisinau's record of barring opposition candidates from the ballot box and silencing media outlets associated with political figures have contributed to the nation's downward slide on the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual Democracy Index, noted Spinck, who is an associate fellow at the Henry Jackson Society think tank.

“Moldova is emerging as a frontline state between two competing twenty-first-century visions of democracy: one rooted in sovereignty, tradition, and pragmatic governance, as envisioned by the Trump administration, and the other grounded in technocratic liberalism, embraced by Brussels,” he wrote.

The article cited recent opinion polls that indicate Moldovan voters are predominantly concerned with domestic issues such as corruption and inflation, and are increasingly disillusioned with the current government. The bloc of parties opposing the ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) could deny Sandu an outright majority at the parliamentary elections in September, he pointed out.

Spinck argued that the Trump administration is also facing a choice on whether to “stick with Washington's old playbook” and back Sandu the way President Joe Biden's administration did, or to “engage constructively with whichever parties succeed in forming Moldova's next government.”

The US has the power to “apply a new litmus test” for Moldova's “civilizational alignments,” the analyst argued. If it is “not based on blind ideological loyalty to Brussels” but instead “prioritizes pluralism, tradition, and civil liberties,” the new approach would further American interests. Choosing otherwise would be “prioritizing the EU's technocratic stability over genuine democratic diversity,” Spinck warned.

Vladimir Zelensky's “open threats” will not go unnoticed, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said, adding that Ukraine cannot force its way into the European Union through extortion, bombings and intimidations.

Ukrainian strikes on the Druzhba (“Friendship”) oil pipeline this month have repeatedly disrupted flows to Hungary and Slovakia, prompting anger in both EU countries. At a press conference in Kiev on Sunday, Zelensky, when asked about Hungary's opposition to Ukraine's EU and NATO bids, quipped that “friendship” with Budapest now depends on its stance – a pointed play on the pipeline's name.

Orban described Zelensky's comments as a “public threat” and a confession that Kiev had intentionally jeopardized his country's energy security “because we don't support their EU membership,” news outlet Magyar Nemzet reported on Monday.

“This shows that the Hungarians made the right choice,” Orban added. Earlier this year, Hungary blocked EU accession talks with Ukraine, following an unofficial national referendum in which more than 2 million Hungarians – around 95% of voters – rejected Kiev's bid.

The prime minister stressed that Ukraine cannot join the EU through blackmail, bombings or threats, adding that “Zelensky's statements will cast a long shadow.”

Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, called Ukraine's actions “unacceptable,” insisting that even as an EU member, Kiev would have no right to dictate Hungary's energy purchases.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto also rebuked Zelensky's “intimidation” in a post on X, urging him to stop threatening his country and end attacks on its energy security.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga shot back that Szijjarto could not tell Zelensky “what to do or say,” urging Budapest to follow in the footsteps of other countries and diversify away from Russian energy. Gulyas pointed out that Europe still lacks price-competitive alternatives to Russian supplies.

Unlike many EU countries, Hungary has refused to send weapons to Kiev and maintains that Ukraine's NATO membership could trigger an all-out conflict with Russia.

The Druzhba dispute has deepened already fraught ties over EU sanctions against Moscow and disputes over the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine.

MOSCOW, August 26. /TASS/. First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Denis Manturov did not rule out the resumption of aviation cooperation between Russia and the United States, but he stressed that it is too early to discuss the possible format of such collaboration, he said in an interview with TASS CEO Andrey Kondrashov ahead of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).

""Perhaps the resumption of aviation cooperation cannot be ruled out. But in which areas and in what formats - this is too early to discuss for now,"" he said.

Earlier, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and special presidential representative for investment and economic cooperation, stated that direct air service between Russia and the United States could resume by the end of 2025.

BERLIN, August 26. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has made four attempts to speak with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the phone in the past weeks but the latter did not take the calls, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported, citing sources.

The paper points out that earlier, Trump shocked India by imposing the country with 25% tariffs and calling it a ""dead economy."" ""There are signs indicating that Modi felt insulted,"" Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes, adding that Modi's unwillingness to hold a phone conversation with Trump demonstrates the extent to which the Indian premier was irritated by what the US president had done.

The newspaper also notes that the way Trump is perceived in India has considerably changed, particularly due to his statements about plans to boost relations with Pakistan.

India and the United States launched talks on a large-scale trade agreement in February, following Modi's visit to Washington. The two countries seek to increase annual trade to $500 billion by 2030. The document was expected to be signed in the fall. India's delegation made several trips to Washington to hold talks on the document; a US delegation's visit to India for the sixth round of talks, set for August 25, was canceled.

On August 6, the US raised tariffs on Indian goods by 25% to 50%, citing New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil and petroleum products. Trump criticized the South Asian nation for having always purchased the bulk of defense equipment from Russia and being the largest buyer of Russian energy, alongside China. The Indian Foreign Ministry condemned criticism from the US and the EU over Russian oil imports as unjustified. The increased tariffs are set to take effect on August 27.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Haboob swept through capital, rattling homes, terrifying drivers and leaving tens of thousands without power

A powerful storm kicked up a towering wall of dust that rolled through the city of Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday, darkening the sky, blinding drivers, knocking out power and damaging one of the nation's busiest airports.

The dust storm, known as a haboob, is pushed by the wind and produced by a weather front or thunderstorm. It typically occurs in flat, arid areas. The storm came from the south-east, and was followed by heavy rain, wind and lightning.

Bernae Boykin Hitesman was driving her son and daughter, ages nine and 11, home from school when the storm arrived late in the afternoon in Arizona City, about 60 miles (95km) south-east of Phoenix.

She had to quickly pull over as the storm engulfed her car. “I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,” she said.

Boykin Hitesman said she could taste the dust and feel the strong wind rattling her car until it finally passed about 15 minutes later.

“I was nervous,” she said. “My kids were really, really scared, so I was trying to be brave for them.”

Richard Filley, a retired university professor who lives in Gilbert, said the dust storm caused the trees to sway and knocked bird feeders to the ground. Fine dust found its way through “every little crack and space” into his house, he said.

“The windstorm part of it, I'm glad it's gone,” he said. “You look at the photos of haboobs and they are a spectacular natural phenomenon. They are kind of beautiful in their own way.”

Heavy rain and wind followed Monday's haboob, delaying flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor international airport and causing some damage to the airport.

“Crews have been identifying leaks and attempting to clean up water where it has collected in passenger areas,” Heather Shelbrack, the airport's deputy aviation director for public relations, said in an email.

Tens of thousands of customers in Maricopa county lost power.

Phoenix has been drier than usual during the monsoon season, while parts of south-east and north-central Arizona have had a fair amount of rain, said Mark O'Malley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.

“But that's typical for a monsoon, very hit and miss,” he said.

The forecast for metro Phoenix calls for a 40% chance of rain on Tuesday before drying out, O'Malley said.

The storm comes just days after the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert was hit by dust storms and high winds.

The annual gathering in the Black Rock desert officially started on Sunday, but attenders who had already set up camp on Saturday were confronted with a powerful dust storm that sent tents flying and plunged visibility to near zero.

Footage shared on social media by attenders showed intense winds, dust storms and collapsed tents.

The National Weather Service Reno warned on Tuesday that more storms could hit the region, and could persist late into the evening.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Unexploded devices delivered by Russian bombardments litter the landscape, killing hundreds of people and forcing residents to avoid roads, parks and forests

In north-east Ukraine, less than 50km from the Russian border, lies the city of Shostka. In the first months of the full-scale invasion it was blockaded, and ever since has faced constant shelling and drone strikes from the Russian army.

But if and when the attacks stop, there will be an invisible danger that will linger for much longer: unexploded devices. Ukraine is now one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, with about a quarter of its territory – an area larger than England – contaminated with explosives.

Even before Russia began increasing the scale of its bombardments this summer, Shostka and the wider Sumy region had been accumulating large numbers of unexploded mines and other ordnance. In Sumy that means roads villagers once trusted can no longer be used, parks and forests have become fraught with danger, and fields that once fed communities must be abandoned.

“A few days ago, there were 40 Shahed drones over us. They can drop mines now, so even if nothing explodes right away, there's always a chance something will go off later,” says Shostka resident and explosives specialist Yelyzaveta Kyseliova, 21.

Which countries have the most landmines?

Russia Has the world's largest stockpile of landmines (26.5m) and has used them extensively in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, including dropping them from drones.



Ukraine The  most mine-contaminated country in the world, according to the UN, with about 23% of its territory requiring survey for explosive hazards.



Myanmar The country had the world's largest documented number of casualties from landmines (1,003)  in 2023.



Syria Hundreds of civilians have been killed by landmines as they returned home after the fall of the Assad regime last year.



Iraq Large tracts of land were contaminated by mines during the 1980–88 Iran war, the 1991 Gulf war and the 2003 invasion by the US-led coalition.Egypt The country is still heavily contaminated by landmines from the second world war and the wars with Israel in 1956, 1967 and 1973.



Laos More than 270m cluster bombs were dropped on Laos during the Vietnam war, with about 80m still unexploded, contaminating 30% of Laos. About 20,000 people – 40% of them children – have been killed or injured by cluster bombs .



Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Vietnam,  Columbia, Lebanon and Libya Large areas of these countries remain heavily contaminated with landmines and explosive munitions.

“People usually call the Ukrainian military when they see something suspicious, but mines are everywhere now, dropped from drones, scattered by rockets. Two weeks ago, a family was killed on a road they'd driven for years. It wasn't a hidden track. That mine was put there recently, probably by a drone,” she says.

Local activists say incidents involving mines happen so frequently that some residents don't even bother reporting them.

In the south of Ukraine, in another heavily bombed frontline city, Kherson, Liudmyla Kryvorotko lives with the loss of two of her children to unexploded ordnance.

In the winter of 2022, Kryvorotko and her four children left their town, recently liberated but still under Russian fire, to seek refuge with relatives. What they didn't know was that on their way out, the retreating Russian army had used mines and explosives to turn the civilian roads into death traps. Kryvorotko's car detonated one such landmine.

“Two of my children – my 19-year-old son and my 22-year-old daughter – died on the spot. I lost consciousness and my youngest daughter was severely injured. My 14-year-old son, Mykhailo, sustained a concussion, but he dragged us out of the vehicle,” she says. They managed to walk to the nearest village before being rescued by Ukrainian soldiers.

Kryvorotko had a punctured lung and broken ribs, and her youngest daughter was lucky to survive, with injuries to her face and chest. Two years on, she says, their bodies are still covered in scars. “We have nowhere to go that is safe, every place has been infected with the war.”

Traditionally, mines consist of an explosive charge that is triggered by the victim; they are rigged to detonate when they are stepped on or when a trip wire is pulled, or even just when they are touched or moved. They come in all shapes and sizes depending on what they intend to target. Soviet forces used small butterfly-shaped explosives in Afghanistan that continue to maim children who pick them out of curiosity. These have also been found in Ukraine in previously occupied territories.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion, just under 1,000 people have been injured and 359 killed by mines and explosive remnants of war, including at least 18 children, according to data shared by the state emergency service of Ukraine.

UN mining expert Paul Heslop says there are already more than 1m mines scattered across Ukraine, and that Russian forces “widely booby trapped” parts of the country as they retreated. This includes bigger pressure-plate landmines (often called anti-tank or anti-vehicle mines) that contain a lot more explosive (5-10kg) and are triggered by heavier vehicles such as cars, tanks or military trucks.

“There is also an awful lot of unexploded shells, rockets, grenades, mortars from the fighting, particularly in the buffer zone where artillery's got roughly a 20-mile range,” says Heslop. “While clearing the areas, we are looking at a level of complexity, of scale, that we just haven't seen before.”

Ukraine has joined Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in recently announcing its withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which regulates and restricts the use of most types of landmines. They cite threats from Russia, which they share a border with, as a reason for their decision.

In the case of Ukraine, however, the concerns are manifold, since the government's demining operations continue even as it considers using mines to deter Russian advances.

“In the context of an asymmetric threat, Ukraine is forced to ensure an adequate level of defence capability,” says Andrii Danyk, who is in charge of Ukraine's demining efforts. Nonetheless, he says, “humanitarian demining remains one of the priorities of state policy”.

Back in Sumy, Kyseliova is working with the Ukrainian Red Cross to allay the fears of local residents in and around Shostka trying to rebuild their lives. “We do a lot of educational activities. We tell people what to do and what not to do if they come across mines. We try to show how to be safer.”

But even in places where information sessions are run, changing behaviour is difficult, says Kyseliova. “People get used to the war. As long as they don't get killed, they think it's fine.” Children and teenagers are particularly at risk. “Kids just grab things. And teens, they want to try risky stuff.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Open letter has been signed by 209 former EU ambassadors, senior diplomatic staff and ambassadors from EU nation states

A public letter signed by 209 former EU ambassadors, senior diplomatic staff and ambassadors from EU nation states has been published today, calling for urgent action over Israel's war in Gaza and unlawful actions in the West Bank.

If the EU will not act collectively, member states must take steps individually or in smaller groups to support human rights and uphold international law, the letter says, laying out nine possible approaches.

They include suspending arms export licenses, barring trade in goods and services with illegal settlements and barring European datacentres from receiving, storing or processing data from Israeli government or commercial sources if it relates to Israel's “presence and activities in Gaza and elsewhere in the occupied territories”.

Signatories include 110 former ambassadors, 25 former director general and two of the most senior diplomats in the EU – Alain Le Roy, former secretary general of the European External Affairs service and Carlo Trojan, former secretary general of the European Commission.

“This struck a chord,” said Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, former EU representative to the Palestinian territory and part of a steering group of 6 former diplomats coordinating the initiative which began in mid-July.

This letter was the third public call for action, and the first calling for nations to act individually if the EU does not take collective action. A proposal to partly suspend Israel from the Horizon research fund over Gaza failed in late July.

“There is such dismay now within the institutions, people are saying enough is enough,” Kühn von Burgsdorff said.

“We can't stay paralysed if the 27 (member states) can't take action, that betrays our values. So we have proposed nine actions that can be taken at the state level or by groups of states.”

“European governments are losing credibility not just in the global south but with our own citizens, in every member state.” He cited polling from his native Germany, traditionally a staunch supporter of Israel, that showed 80 percent of the population disagree with Israel's actions in Gaza and two-thirds want the government to take action.

The Israeli military said on Tuesday an initial inquiry into its strike on a Gaza hospital that killed five journalists determined that troops had identified a camera “positioned by Hamas” in the area to observe its forces. Israeli forces struck Nasser hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people including journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others outlets.

The UN has demanded that Israel's investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20 people, among them five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability. “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN's human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.

Mariam Abu Dagga, one of the Gaza-based journalists killed in the Israeli airstrike on Nasser hospital, has been described as “deeply passionate” by her peers. The 33-year-old photojournalist was killed when Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday (25 August) and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded.

The Israeli security cabinet has begun its meeting, a spokesperson told The Times of Israel. The meeting has started at prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. It was moved up to 4pm and is expected to finish by 7pm.

The death toll in Gaza has risen, with least 75 Palestinians, including 17 aid seekers, being killed in the last 24 hours according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. It said that the total death toll since 7 October 2023 has now risen to 62,819, with 158,629 people wounded.

Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar has accused “left-wing” governments of trying to “force” Palestinian state on to Israel. During his first official visit to the US since taking office last year, he said at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations in New York that the move would amount to “suicide”.

A human rights group says US military personnel could face legal liability for assisting Israeli forces who commit war crimes in Gaza. According to Human Rights Watch, direct participation by US forces since October 2023, including providing intelligence and involvement in coordination and planning makes the United States party to the conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups.

Protesters in Israel on Tuesday torched tyres, blocked highways and clamoured for a ceasefire that would free hostages still in Gaza, even as Israeli leaders moved forward with plans for an offensive which they argue is needed to defeat Hamas. The disruption came as Palestinians in Gaza braced for the expanded offensive against a backdrop of displacement, destruction and parts of the territory plunging into famine, AP reported.

Dutch airline KLM will resume flight services to and from Israel on 28 September, after suspending flights in June over security concerns. It will bring back the Tel Aviv to Amsterdam route once daily with a Boeing 737-900, which seats 188 passengers. The carrier took a one-year absence from flying to Israel, and only just reopened the route before shutting it down again on 13 June due to the closure of Israel's airspace following Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear and military infrastructure.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar are prepared to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon, near the Israeli border, in hopes that it would create opportunities and jobs for members of the militant Hezbollah group and its supporters once they surrender – Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Tom Barrack, said. As reported by The Independent, Barrack took trips to Israel and Syria to discuss the situation in Lebanon after the Lebanese government said it would disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah rejected this plan.

Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that the country would not be joining other western nations in recognising Palestinian statehood at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. Reuters reports that he was speaking at a joint news conference with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who said last month that Canada planned to recognise the state of Palestine at the General Assembly, after similar announcements by France and Britain.

Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students to leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month, but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel's approval. It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK's leading universities.

Israel-based group Physicians for Human Rights has written to Israel's government warning that orders to evacuate hospitals in Gaza City ahead of a planned Israeli offensive will be a “death sentence” for many patients. “The analysis shows that southern Gaza cannot accommodate additional patients,” PHR said in a letter sent on Monday to COGAT, the Israeli authority responsible for civilian affairs in Gaza.

Iran has vowed to take “reciprocal action” after Australia expelled its ambassador over accusations that Tehran was behind antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.

Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday that the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) had “credible intelligence” to believe that the Iranian government was behind the attacks against the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne and Lewis's Continental Kitchen in Bondi in Sydney last year.

He also announced that Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps would now be listed as a terrorist group.

But Iran hit back on Tuesday and pledged to take “reciprocal action”. It also said that Albanese was weak and was only taking the action to compensate for a tougher recent line on Israel.

Israel hit Gaza's Nasser hospital twice, killing at least 20 people including five journalists, health officials said.

The first strike hit the top floor of a building at the Nasser hospital, killing the Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri and others.

Iran's involvement in clandestine violence and espionage overseas takes many forms, but all have a single aim – to win advantage for Tehran by striking unexpectedly at the “soft underbelly” of enemies.

It's a strategy that dates back to the 1979 revolution, and is rooted in a pragmatic if regretful assessment of Iran's continuing weakness on the conventional battlefield.

Australian authorities have not revealed exactly what convinced them that Iran was behind a series of antisemitic attacks in the country in recent months, but the charge is plausible, experts say.

“We don't know the full details, but the Australians wouldn't [publicly blame Iran] unless they were pretty confident,” said Matthew Redhead, an expert in state threats and intelligence at London's Royal United Services Institute.

“Iran sees this as a cheap way of fighting an undeclared war against its opponents and of rallying audiences its wants to impress in the Middle East … They don't have the resources to fight any other way. There is a long history here.”

The Israeli military said on Tuesday an initial inquiry into its strike on a Gaza hospital that killed five journalists determined that troops had identified a camera “positioned by Hamas” in the area to observe its forces.

Israeli forces struck Nasser hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people including journalists who worked for Reuters, the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others outlets.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said later on Monday that Israel deeply regretted what he called a “tragic mishap”.

Protesters in Israel on Tuesday torched tyres, blocked highways and clamoured for a ceasefire that would free hostages still in Gaza, even as Israeli leaders moved forward with plans for an offensive which they argue is needed to defeat Hamas.

The disruption came as Palestinians in Gaza braced for the expanded offensive against a backdrop of displacement, destruction and parts of the territory plunging into famine, AP reported.

It also followed deadly strikes a day earlier on Gaza's main hospital which killed 20 people including medics and journalists. Among them was Mariam Dagga, a journalist who worked for the Associated Press.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to convene a security cabinet meeting later Tuesday. However, the government said the meeting will not include discussion of ceasefire talks, according to an official with knowledge of the situation.

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter, said there was a delegation from Egypt in Israel on Monday and they discussed the negotiations.

Ministers have approved plans to help a further 30 students to leave Gaza to take up places at UK universities next month, but their evacuation remains uncertain and dependent on Israel's approval.

It takes the total to 39, after a government commitment last week to work to secure the evacuation from Gaza of nine Chevening scholars with places at some of the UK's leading universities.

Chevening scholarships are largely government funded and are offered to “exceptional individuals” to study for a one-year master's degree at a UK university. All 40 students identified by the government have fully funded scholarships.

A Home Office source said it was “a complex and challenging task”. Names would have to be submitted to the Israeli authorities for approval, after which the students would travel to a third country, likely to be Jordan, for visa biometric checks, which are not currently available in Gaza.

Campaigners for the students welcomed the news, but expressed concern that the latest group had received no direct contact from the government or been given details of what might happen next, while others with full funding appeared not to have been included.

The Israeli army has raided the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, triggering clashes with Palestinian youths.

Wafa, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency, reported that the army detained at least three people after raiding a currency exchange shop.

Israel-based group Physicians for Human Rights has written to Israel's government warning that orders to evacuate hospitals in Gaza City ahead of a planned Israeli offensive will be a “death sentence” for many patients.

“The analysis shows that southern Gaza cannot accommodate additional patients,” PHR said in a letter sent on Monday to COGAT, the Israeli authority responsible for civilian affairs in Gaza.

“Hospital capacity across the Gaza Strip is already at maximum. This makes the safe transfer of patients from Gaza City hospitals to southern medical centers impossible.”

There are no permanent hospitals in Rafah, just a field hospital. Al Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis -- which was attacked yesterday -- is already operating at 180 percent capacity and faces ongoing shortages, the letter said.

Field hospitals run by international organisations in Deir al-Balah, Khan Yunis and Al-Mawasi have limited equipment and face risks of closure.

The letter called for an immediate halt to evacuations, and for the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical equipment.

Physicians for Human Rights last month said Israel was committing genocide in Gaza, citing the “deliberate, cumulative, and ongoing dismantling of Gaza's healthcare system”.

The UN has demanded that Israel's investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20 people, among them five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability.

“There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN's human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.

On Monday, Israel struck Nasser hospital, the last functioning public hospital in southern Gaza, twice. Witnesses said the second strike came just as rescue crews and journalists arrived to evacuate the wounded 15 minutes after the first bombing, killing first responders and media workers.

The “double tap” strike killed journalists working for Reuters, Associated Press and Al Jazeera, as well as independent journalists. It drew global condemnation. All three publications issued statements mourning the journalists, and urged Israel to look into the killings.

The office of the Israeli prime minister said it “deeply regrets the tragic mishap” that happened at the hospital and that the Israeli military was conducting an investigation.

The UN spokesperson urged Israel to ensure its investigation led to results, referring to recent Israeli military investigations that were closed without resolution.

The Israeli security cabinet has begun its meeting, a spokesperson told The Times of Israel.

The meeting has started at prime minster Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem. It was moved up to 4pm and is expected to finish by 7pm.

The security cabinet will discuss the next phases of the IDF's operation in Gaza City, and the forum is expected to approve of plans.

According to local sources, the cabinet will not discuss the hostage release and ceasefire plan that Hamas accepted last week.

Hamas said in a statement on Sunday that Israel's plans to take over Gaza City showed it wasn't serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire would be the “only way” hostages would be released.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar are prepared to invest in an economic zone in south Lebanon, near the Israeli border, in hopes that it would create opportunities and jobs for members of the militant Hezbollah group and its supporters once they surrender – Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, Tom Barrack, said.

As reported by The Independent, Barrack took trips to Israel and Syria to discuss the situation in Lebanon after the Lebanese government said it would disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah rejected this plan.

Now, Barrack said something needs to replace conflict in the area, according to The National. 

“We have to have a substitute for what happened, because there is another outside party,” he said, referring to Iran.

“Iran has been the financier of the growth of Hezbollah, both its municipality and its militia. So how do we substitute that?” he asked.

“We bring in the Gulf countries simultaneously and a new economic zone, which will have some depth to it in the next few weeks.”

Germany's chancellor Friedrich Merz has said that the country would not be joining other western nations in recognising Palestinian statehood at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.

Reuters reports that he was speaking at a joint news conference with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, who said last month that Canada planned to recognise the state of Palestine at the General Assembly, after similar announcements by France and Britain.

However, Merz said that Germany would not be following. “The position of the federal government is clear, as far as the possible recognition of the state of Palestine is concerned,” Merz said.

“Canada knows this. We will not join this initiative. We don't see the requirements met.”

More than 140 nations have joined the call for international recognition of a Palestinian state, which is around three-quarters of all United Nations members.

Mariam Abu Dagga, one of the Gaza-based journalists killed in the Israeli airstrike on Nasser hospital, has been described as “deeply passionate” by her peers.

The 33-year-old photojournalist was killed when Israel bombed the main hospital in southern Gaza on Monday (25 August) and then struck the same spot again as rescuers and journalists rushed to help the wounded.

Reuters journalist Hussam al-Masri; the Al Jazeera journalist Mohammed Salam; the photojournalist Moaz Abu Taha, and Ahmad Abu Aziz from Quds Feed were also killed.

“Mariam had left us instructions not to cry for her when we bid her farewell. She wanted us to spend time with her body, speak to her and take our fill of her before she left,” said Samaheer Farhan, a 21-year-old freelance journalist and close friend of Dagga.

To her colleagues, she was known also for her kindness and dedication.

“Mariam was kind, gentle and deeply passionate about her work. She had lost her mother and her closest colleague, Abu Anas, yet she never stopped covering the war for even a single day,” Farhan said.

Independent Arabia said that she was the “example of dedication and professional commitment”, and praised her for carrying “her camera into the heart of the field, conveying the suffering of civilians and the voices of victims with rare honesty and courage”.

This comes as The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned Israel's “broadcasted killing of journalists in Gaza”.

A Norwegian wealth fund has sold Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, over Israel's use of its bulldozers to destroy Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank.

The fund said it excluded Caterpillar and five Israeli banking groups on ethics grounds. “There is no doubt that Caterpillar's products are being used to commit extensive and systemic violations of international humanitarian law,” said the fund's independent council on ethics.

It also said the machinery was “being used by Israeli authorities in the widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property”.

“As deliveries of the relevant machinery to Israel are now set to resume, the council considers there to be an unacceptable risk that Caterpillar is con­tributing to serious violations of individuals' rights in war or conflict situations,” it said.

The wealth fund has now removed more than 20 Israeli companies this year, but Caterpillar is the first big US company to be removed through the wealth fund's ongoing review to ensure its investments do not contribute to violations of international law.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

U.S. President Donald Trump discussed nuclear disarmament with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during talks in Alaska, Trump told reporters in the White House on Aug. 25.

""I think the denuclearization is a very, it's a big game,"" Trump said.

""But Russia is willing to do it, and I think China is going to be willing to do it. We can't let nuclear weapons proliferate. We have to stop nuclear weapons,"" he added, without revealing details of the discussion.

The Kremlin has not commented on Trump's statement.

According to a report from the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), Russia has a total inventory of 5,580 nuclear warheads as of March 2024, including around 1,200 awaiting dismantlement, the most of any country in the world.

Russia's nuclear arsenal includes tactical weapons for battlefield use and strategic weapons capable of reaching the U.S. 

 

Moscow has repeatedly issued nuclear threats against Ukraine and the West since launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. While those threats have not materialized, concerns persist over Russia's military ambitions beyond Ukraine.

To date, nuclear arms control negotiations between Moscow and Washington have made no progress.

Weeks before the Trump-Putin Alaska meeting on Aug. 15, the U.S. president ordered two U.S. nuclear-powered submarines to be repositioned to ""appropriate regions"" in response to inflammatory language from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. 

Medvedev said increased involvement from Washington to end Russia's war against Ukraine could bring the U.S. and Moscow closer to direct conflict. He has repeatedly threatened nuclear escalation and spread Kremlin propaganda portraying Russia as the victim of Western aggression.

Trump accused Medvedev of ""entering very dangerous territory,"" calling him a ""failed former president"" and warning him to ""watch his words.""

Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.

LATEST: Polish president's veto won't threaten Ukraine's Starlink access, Nawrocki's office claims.

Editor's note: This story was updated to include another law signed by President Karol Nawrocki the same day and a comment from a diplomatic source.Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Aug. 25 vetoed a bill that would have extended financial support for Ukrainians fleeing the war, a decision that officials warn will also cut funding for Ukraine's Starlink internet service starting Oct. 1.

Poland has been supporting Ukraine's internet connection since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion by financing Starlink systems, which are a lifeline for soldiers fighting on the front line.

""Presidential vetoes are cutting blindly! Karol Nawrocki turns off the Internet in Ukraine with his decision, because de facto it means his decision on the law on assistance to Ukrainian citizens,"" Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski wrote on X. ""This is the end of the Starlink Internet, which Poland provides to Ukraine, which is waging war. This is also the end of support for storing Ukrainian administration data in a safe place.""

""I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet,"" he added, accusing Nawrocki of ""helping Russia"" by blocking support for Kyiv's communications infrastructure.

The Polish president's decision to veto the bill ""means that as of Oct. 1, Warsaw will not be able to continue paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription,"" a spokesperson for Poland's Digital Affairs Ministry told TVP public television on Aug. 25.

""The bill, which President Nawrocki vetoed, extended the period of assistance, meaning this funding from the Ukraine Aid Fund, until the end of March next year,"" ministry spokesperson Marek Gieorgica said. ""Therefore, there is currently no legal basis for funding this from Oct. 1.""

According to Polish outlet Onet, Nawrocki said on Aug. 25 that Poland's strategic interests have not changed, and Russia remains ""the greatest threat to security."" 

""However, after 3.5 years, the situation in terms of financials and social and political emotions has fundamentally changed. The law that was proposed should be corrected today,"" Nawrocki added during a briefing at the Presidential Palace.

Ukraine relies heavily on Starlink, the satellite internet system developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, to maintain connectivity in front-line areas and support government communications. 

Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on April 3 that Poland had supplied 5,000 additional Starlink terminals for critical infrastructure.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has received over 50,000 Starlink terminals, with Poland providing nearly 30,000 — the largest contribution by any single country, according to Fedorov.

Among other measures, Nawrocki announced the submission of his own bill that, among other measures, would extend the period required to obtain Polish citizenship from three to 10 years and introduce harsher penalties for illegal border crossing. 

Nawrocki also proposed equating the ""Bandera symbol"" with Nazi and Communist symbols in Poland's criminal code and revising the law on the Institute of National Remembrance to reflect ""crimes committed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.""

The controversy over historical symbols has long complicated Polish-Ukrainian relations. While many in Poland associate Stepan Bandera's legacy with wartime atrocities, in Ukraine, the figure has come to symbolize resistance and national identity, especially in the fight against Russia's ongoing invasion.

""In order to eliminate Russian propaganda and set relations with Ukraine on a mutual respect, I believe we should also include in this bill an unambiguous slogan 'stop Banderism,'"" the Polish president declared.

A Ukrainian diplomatic source told the Kyiv Independent that while Ukraine appreciates Poland's past support, equating Ukrainian symbols with Nazi and Communist ones risks fueling negative sentiment in Ukrainian society.

""Any politicized decisions on allegedly equating Ukrainian symbols with Nazi and Communist ones may provoke stronger negative sentiment in Ukrainian society and will require a response from the Ukrainian side,"" the source said.

Nawrocki, a right-wing nationalist backed by the opposition Law and Justice party, narrowly won Poland's presidential election on June 1 with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal rival Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski.

While Poland has a parliamentary system in which the president's authority is largely ceremonial, the Polish president is still able to veto legislation proposed by the parliament.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin on Aug. 25 signed a resolution calling for Moscow to withdraw from the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture.

Despite Russia remaining a signatory to the convention, Russian war crimes and the torture of Ukrainian civilians and troops have been repeatedly documented.

The resolution calls for Russian President Vladimir Putin to withdraw Russia from the decades-old agreement.

""On the submission to the President of the Russian Federation... a proposal on the denunciation by the Russian Federation of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,"" the resolution read.

Russia's actions in occupied Ukrainian territories further underscore its disregard for international protections. 

Former Kherson Mayor Volodymyr Mykolaienko was detained by Russian forces on April 18, 2022. Russian troops were unsuccessful in pressuring Mykolaienko to cooperate with occupation authorities, and he was targeted for his pro-Ukrainian views, his niece Hanna Korshun-Samchuk told the Kyiv Independent.

Ukrainian Journalist Viktoriia Roshchyna disappeared in August 2023 and died in the fall of 2024 after being tortured in Russian captivity. Roschyna's body was returned to Ukraine in February with missing organs.

U.S. funding was an attempt to provide alternatives to extremism, largely devoted to supporting better local governance and training leaders

Asmadee Bueheng knows T-shirts. It had always been a hobby, finding items emblazoned with music bands or other designs that make them rare.

In deep southern Thailand, on the border with Malaysia, he would sift through bulk shipments of used clothes – sold by weight in bundles of up to 100 kilograms − and pick out shirts he knew had value. Then he would sell them, sometimes for hundreds of dollars, to customers as far away as Japan.

It made for a fun gig, a modestly profitable side venture to his main work as a journalist at BenarNews, writing on intensely local and sometimes deeply sensitive subjects.

Then, Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a new administration that cut deeply into U.S. spending overseas, including the funds that supported BenarNews, a media outlet operating in Islamic regions of southeast Asia that published stories about Muslim society in Thailand. It was funded by the U.S. Agency for Global Media.

In Thailand, “no other news agency reported peoples' stories in the deep south,” Mr. Bueheng says. “It was the essential platform for local stories like this to be told.”

The cuts shut down Benar in April and left Mr. Bueheng unemployed.

Trump administration ends some USAID contracts providing life-saving aid, officials say

Selling T-shirts is now his main work, searching through bags brought in from Pakistan and Malaysia and posting good finds for sale on Facebook Marketplace, rather than reporting on issues like a project to develop local hydro dams. That project has come at a cost to the environment and local residents that, he says, demands scrutiny.

“I want to write about this,” he says. “But nobody wants to run the story.”

The Malay Muslims of southern Thailand occupy a region that has been wracked by violence and political instability, home to a separatist movement that has attacked civilians and institutions of the central government. The conflict has killed more than 7,000 people in the past two decades. 

Today, military checkpoints with armoured vehicles and defensive installations are installed across roads through the area. Soldiers with assault rifles are visible walking through local forests on patrol.

Few foreign tourists travel here, and the Thai government has been suspicious of Western influence in the region, in particular human-rights advocacy.

“Many international organizations could not do anything here,” said Yasmin Sattar, a political scientist at Prince of Songkla University who has conducted an assessment of United States Agency for International Development spending in the Thai south over the past decades.

But the U.S., through its funding of BenarNews and money that came from USAID, found ways to deliver funds that supported local organizations and government administrators.

Among Western donors, “we could say that USAID is the biggest,” she said.

Around the world, cuts to U.S. foreign funding have been rapid and severe, with the shuttering of USAID cutting off money for critical medical supplies and life-saving food. 

Mr. Trump has accused the agency of misspending billions of dollars. The cuts could result in 14 million additional deaths over the next half-decade, according to a study published last month in The Lancet. 

What has happened in southern Thailand, a region little-known outside the country, underscores the immense reach of the funding changes. It also points to the ways Mr. Trump's foreign policies risk longer-term damage to his own country, undoing years of effort to bolster the U.S. position in the Muslim world.

“It's just a pity,” said Prof. Sattar.

In recent years, U.S. funding in the area was largely devoted to supporting better local governance, training leaders and young people. It was an attempt to provide alternatives to extremism. 

“When young people get the sense that they can engage with their own local government, at the end of the day they may not feel like they want to engage with violence,” said Prof. Sattar.

A decade ago, in the long aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the U.S. image was so poor in southern Thailand − as in other Muslim areas around the world − that local organizations “couldn't even tell the community that they got funds from the U.S.,” Prof. Sattar said. But years of investment began to bring change in perceptions. 

“Foreign aid can be a soft power,” she said. “But when Donald Trump returned, everything just turned back.”

Across southern Thailand, roughly 15 small organizations have had to shutter projects because of the cuts, said Soraya Jamjuree, co-ordinator of the Network of Civic Women for Peace. Months later, “there is still no replacement for the USAID funding,” she said. 

Her organization, which published a guide for women's participation in public life, was in the past visited by the U.S. ambassador to Thailand. The front cover of the guide features the USAID logo and slogan: “From the American people.”

“A lot of religious leaders in the deep south hold very conservative ideas on women: Women should stay at home. They should not have a role in society. With this project, we are trying to conduct a dialogue with local religious leaders,” Ms. Jamjuree said. “It is not against Islamic law for women to have a greater role in society.”

Opinion: Scrapping USAID doesn't just hurt the world's poor – it harms the West

Her organization receives funds from Canada, too, as well as a raft of other international sources. But the U.S. was important because of the size of its support. Foreign cash is particularly key in an area riven by sectarian strife, she said. Community groups that receive government funding can be seen as allies with a government that some here perceive as oppressive.

The disappearance of U.S. funding has also come at a sensitive time in southern Thailand, where a long-standing peace process has been suspended since late last year. Incidents of violence rose 30 per cent last year, and are up again this year. The number of casualties was up by two-thirds.

Civil-society groups, including those that have been funded by USAID, have played a role as independent monitors of what is taking place in the Thai south, where martial law has “allowed government security forces to do whatever they want − enforcement of the law without any discretion,” said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, which monitors conflict in the region.

“The issue is impunity, because government officials claim they have impunity when they violate international laws.”

For that reason, the central government has long chafed at foreign support for local organizations in the Thai south. In the wake of U.S. funding cuts, “it has seemed to me the government is a little bit more relaxed. They know that USAID has stopped giving money to the local civil society,” Mr. Jitpiromsri said.

The U.S. had always been careful not to fund projects overtly critical of the Thai military, in order to avoid pushing the country closer toward China. Nonetheless, Mr. Jitpiromsri said, “Trump's new policy has effects on the human-rights movement.”

Among those who feel newly vulnerable is Mr. Bueheng, the journalist. He has faced criminal charges, accused of obstructing justice, underscoring the risk of his work.

“When I worked at BenarNews, at least I had some organization to support me. But after its closure, I am back to being freelance − and vulnerable to oppression by authorities.”

Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney loves to reach for hockey metaphors. He doesn't always catch the right one. 

Explaining why he was ditching most of the retaliatory tariffs against the United States, the PM said on Friday that “there is a time in the game when you drop the gloves,” to “send a message,” and a time when you “want to put the puck in the net.” 

It's a nice image, but it doesn't capture what's going on. Nor does it explain why Ottawa was left with no choice but to take a step back.

Canada's best strategy in the first period, when U.S. President Donald Trump dropped the tariff gloves, was to respond in kind. The Carney government met tariffs with levies of our own. Depending on how the Americans responded, that could have remained the game plan for the second period, the third period and overtime. 

But Canada can't fight the U.S. by itself. We need everyone else to also go over the boards. Otherwise, it's Lady Byng versus Ogie Ogilthorpe.

LeBlanc to meet with Lutnick in Washington as Canada eyes sectoral tariff relief

And with the exception of China, other trading partners declined to dance with the U.S. They've already left the ice and hit the showers. The Europeans aren't dropping the gloves. Nor are the British, the Japanese or the South Koreans. All reached trade deals with the Trump administration – one-sided deals where, in return for being hit with sweeping American tariffs, they promised to not retaliate, and to invest more in the U.S. 

They agreed to allow Washington to punch them, and to not punch back. Instead, they took the blows, said thank you and quietly picked up their teeth.

Canada can stay out on the ice if we want. But at this point, it's just us and Ogie Trumpilthorpe.

It's also important to remember that countertariffs were never designed to be permanent. Their aim was always deterrence: to shock the Americans into retreating and returning to the status quo ante of low tariffs and free trade. If other countries had joined Canada, maybe better results would have been possible. But they didn't.

The best economic models, such as those from the Bank of Canada and the Peterson Institute for International Economics, show that while U.S. tariffs will hurt our economy, Canadian retaliation will have an even bigger impact – on us. The price is worth paying if it pushes the Americans to change course. But the Trump administration hasn't changed course, and the rest of the world, at least for the moment, has given up trying to force the matter.

So here we are.

Canada needs new playbook for relations with China amid Trump chaos: report

Mr. Carney keeps saying that the average tariff on Canada is “the best deal of anyone in the world right now.” It would be more accurate to call it the least-bad deal. U.S. tariffs on Canada are not as high as what other countries are facing – but they're higher than they've been in generations. 

The Trump administration is, for now, honouring the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Or rather, partly honouring it. The U.S. President imposed a general 35-per-cent tariff, but USMCA-compliant goods are exempt and that covers nearly all Canadian exports. 

This arrangement is unique. However, Washington continues to impose sectoral tariffs on some of Canada's most important exports to the U.S.: automobiles, steel, aluminum, copper and lumber. These tariffs violate the spirit and the letter of the USMCA. As such, the Carney government is dropping the general retaliatory tariff while maintaining countertariffs in the affected sectors. It's not an unreasonable position.

However, what Canada has mostly been doing is making concessions to the Trump administration – more spending on the border, more spending on defence, goodbye digital services tax – in return for nothing. But the rest of the world has made even bigger concessions, in return for nothing. 

Canada's partial reprieve from (some) U.S. tariffs is a less-bad deal than the rest of the world got, but the arrangement may be about to get worse. The blows to the Canadian economy have been softened by the USMCA, and Washington's decision to partially respect it, but that's not necessarily a permanent state of affairs. 

Opinion: Carney's reciprocal tariff retreat might seem like a betrayal, but it makes sense

The Trump administration is clearly determined to make tariffs a large and lasting part of the American policy tool box, and to use them to force companies to shift manufacturing to the U.S. This is a threat to Canada, given that our manufacturing industries – led by automobiles – are integrated into American supply chains. 

To the extent that Washington is willing to preserve and honour the USMCA – which would mean Canadian autos, steel, aluminum and other exports to the U.S. benefitting from lower trade barriers than competitors from the rest of the world – that close and integrated trading relationship could be mostly maintained.

However, if the Trump administration's goal is boosting U.S. manufacturing by reversing continental integration, sidelining the USMCA, and hitting Canada with the same tariffs as the rest of the world, then the damage to our economy will be far greater. And the need to transform our economy and our trading relationships will be all the more urgent. 

For now, Canada's best bet is to rag the puck. Play for time. Hang on to the USMCA – and prepare for the possibility of its demise.

India's Supreme Court has ordered an investigation of Anant Ambani, the son of the country's richest man, over illegal animal imports and financial misconduct.

India's Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered an investigation into Anant Ambani's business dealings related to his massive private zoo. Anant is the son of India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.

The zoo, known as Vantara and run by the elder Ambani's philanthropic Reliance Foundation, presents itself as ""the world's biggest wild animal rescue center.""

However, critics say it is anything but, claiming that Ambani is holding illegally acquired endangered species in unsafe conditions in the western state of Gujarat and has no intention of ever returning them to the wild.

Officials from India's Central Zoo Authority estimate that roughly 200 elephants, 50 bears, 160 tigers, 200 lions, 250 leopards and 900 crocodiles populate the private facility.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday said that ex-judges had been empaneled to look into accusations that Ambani had illegally acquired animals and has been involved in money laundering.

In a statement, the court said, ""We consider it appropriate to call for an independent, factual appraisal"" of the situation. The court added that the judges would also consider ""complaints regarding the creation of a vanity or private collection"" in Gujarat and whether the region's harsh climate is suitable for such creatures.

The statement said that complaints had been lodged by non-profit and wildlife groups. Not only do these allege wrongdoing by Ambani, they further claim that the Central Zoo Authorities failed to adequately exercise its oversight duties.

Vantara, which denies any impropriety, has said it will fully comply with government investigators, adding that its ""mission and focus continues to be the rescue, rehabilitation and care of animals.""

The investigative panel is scheduled to deliver a report on the veracity of accusations of illegal animal acquisition and compliance with India's Wildlife Protection Act by September 12.

Vantara claims to be home to more than 150,000 animals from over 2,000 species. It also boasts what it says is the world's largest elephant care facility.

Ambani made global headlines in 2024 by hosting the world's most expensive and lavish wedding with days of celebrations accentuated with private performances by international pop stars such as Katy Perry and Justin Bieber.

Vantara was one of several venues visited by guests during the festivities.

In March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi toured the zoo, saying it ""provides a safe haven for animals while promoting ecological sustainability and wildlife welfare.""

A US citizen was stabbed when he tried to stop two men from harassing female passengers on a tram, according to the police, who are now searching for any clues.

Police in the eastern German city of Dresden have appealed for witnesses to come forward after a stabbing incident that took place on a tram in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Police said that an altercation took place involving three people on the Gorbitz-bound tram at the the Neustädter Markt stop early Sunday at 00:25 local time (2225 UTC/GMT late Saturday). 

According to the police, two men from a group were harassing female passengers. 

A 21-year-old US citizen attempted to intervene but was stabbed by one of two men involved in the altercation.

The police apprehended a 21-year-old Syrian national but have yet to capture an unidentified man wanted for grievous bodily harm, among other things.

US daily tabloid The New York Post published pictures appearing to show the interior of the blood-spattered tram.

Police confirmed that the man who had been detained had since been released as the search for the other suspect continued.

Protesters blocked major roads, calling for an end to the Gaza war and the release of hostages. Some families of those still held hostage accuse Netanyahu's government of prolonging the war. Follow DW for the latest.

Below is the latest news from Israel, Gaza and the wider Middle East region on Tuesday, August 26:



The Israeli army said its initial inquiry into the strike at the Nasser Hospital in the Gaza Strip suggests soldiers had identified a camera which, according to the army, was positioned at the hospital by Hamas to observe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) activities. 

According to an IDF statement, the soldiers decided to act against the camera, adding that while six of those killed were ""terrorists,"" the military ""regrets"" any harm caused to civilians. Israel's claims cannot be independently verified, and the targeting of hospitals is a crime under international law.

The 'double-tap' strikes — in which journalists and aid workers were killed in a second blast after responding to the first — was condemned internationally, including by some of Israel's closest allies.

Human rights groups have accused Israel of spreading disinformation to justify the killings of civilians, journalists and aid workers in Gaza. A report by the monitoring group Action on Armed Violence, published this month, found that Israel closes down or leaves unresolved 88% of cases of alleged war crimes.

An open letter signed by 209 former EU and member state ambassadors and staff has called for the immediate implementation of EU measures against Israel over what they said were its ""unlawful actions in Gaza and the West Bank.""

The letter called for the implementation of nine proposed EU actions against the Israeli government.

Among these proposals are the unilateral suspension or revocation of arms export licenses to Israel and the halting of funding of national co-financed projects involving Israeli entities.

The letter called for the enforcement of sanctions on human rights grounds and counter-terrorism laws which would include visa bans and asset freezes.

The letter, addressed to leaders of the 27 EU member states and leadership structures of the European Commission, among others, followed another open letter sent late in July.

""We note with dismay that, in the ensuing four weeks since our letter, no ceasefire has been agreed in Gaza, no Israeli hostages have been released, and, alarmingly, the Israeli government has begun implementing plans to empty Gaza City and its environs,"" the joint letter said.

The former diplomats noted that since the previous open communication, more than 2,600 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza, many of them women and children.

""Compounding the totally inadequate humanitarian access to Gaza, the Israeli government has continued to prevent UNRWA and 100 international NGOs from delivering any aid since 2 March,"" the letter stated.

""We express our profound disappointment that, in response to the deteriorating situation in Gaza, no substantive measures have been taken by the EU to pressure Israel to end its brutal war,"" the letter said.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that he doesn't think journalists were intentionally targeted when Israel struck a hospital in Gaza on Monday, that left at least 20 people dead, including medics and journalists.

""Right now I do not believe that this was a targeted attack on journalists,"" Merz told DW's chief political editor Michaela Kuefner in Berlin.

""But this is, of course, a result of what the Israeli army started a few days ago and of what the Israeli government decided to do,"" Merz said. 

The German leader said that his decision to suspend the license of new arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza, was the right one.

""I feel that my decision that under these conditions, Israel should not receive weapons that will be used in the Gaza Strip has now been more than proved to be the right one,"" Merz pointed out.

The German went on to say that the current actions of Israel in Gaza were ""unacceptable.""

""What the Israeli government is doing there and what the Israeli army is doing in carrying out the Israeli government's wishes is unacceptable, and yesterday's events cast a dark shadow over what is otherwise, in every sense, a justified course of action against Hamas,"" Merz said.

The spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Majed al-Ansari, said that mediators are awaiting Israel's response to a ceasefire proposal, agreed to by the Hamas militant group last week.

""What matters is not the venue, but that an agreement is reached now. There is already an offer on the table Israel must respond,"" al-Ansari told a media briefing.

""Attempts to stall by shifting locations or other tactics are clear to the international community, and it is time for Israel to give a serious answer to what it has already agreed to in the past,"" al-Ansari said.    

The latest proposal put forward by mediators involves an initial 60-day truce and staggered exchanges of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.

As mediators awaited Israel's response to the new proposal last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had given instructions for new negotiations seeking ""the release of all our hostages and the end of the war under conditions acceptable to Israel.""

In Tel Aviv, protests are again erupting against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Demonstrators accuse him of rejecting peace deals to serve his own political ends, while Gaza mourns the 20 dead killed in airstrikes on a hospital in Khan Younis.

Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that his government had expelled Iranian Ambassador to Australia Ahmad Sadeghi and three other embassy employees for their involvement in antisemitic crimes.

Albanese said not all antisemitic crimes in the country could be tied back to Iran, but noted that Australia's Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) had found that Iran had coordinated attacks.

Albanese also announced that, in response to the hostile behavior, Australia would close its embassy in Tehran.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany will not be among Western allies recognizing a Palestinian state, at least for now.

“We will not be joining this initiative,” Merz said in a joint press conference with Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney.

""We do not consider the conditions for state recognition to be fulfilled in any way at present,"" Merz said.

Carney announced in July that his country would recognize Palestinian statehood at the UN General Assembly in September. French President Emmanuel Macron has said his country plans to do the same.

Germany supports a two-state solution and sees recognizing a Palestinian state as a final step toward peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians.

The Committee to Protect Journalists chief executive Jodie Ginsberg tells DW that Israel is trying to control the narrative in Gaza, after journalists were killed in a strike on Nasser Hospital on Monday.

Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said that 20 people were killed in the strikes, which have been widely condemned.

Christian leaders in Jerusalem have expressed serious concern over the Israeli government's planned takeover of Gaza City.

The Greek Orthodox Church of St Porphyrius and the Catholic Church of the Holy Family — both located in Gaza City — issued a joint message on Tuesday.

""Many of those who have sought refuge within the walls of the compounds are weakened and malnourished by the hardships of recent months,"" the statement from the church leaders said. ""Leaving the city of Gaza and trying to flee to the south would be nothing less than a death sentence.""

Both the Greek Orthodox and Latin Patriarchates in Jerusalem have been places of refuge for civilians, including children, the elderly and people with disabilities.

The religious leaders said it was ""time to end this spiral of violence, put an end to the war and prioritize the common good of the people.""

""It is with great urgency that we appeal to the international community to work towards an end to this senseless and destructive war and the return of the missing and the Israeli hostages,"" the statement added. 

Tuesday morning saw protesters and activists take to the streets in parts of Israel with calls for the immediate release of remaining hostages and end the fighting in Gaza.

A main highway near Tel Aviv was blocked and protesters set fire to tyres on a route north of the city according to news agencies.

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has called for a day of action under the slogan ""Israel stands together.""

Israeli media also reported rallies near a US embassy branch in the city, as well as outside the houses of various ministers across the country.

""There is an offer on the table. We demand that our leaders sit at the negotiation table and not get up until there is an agreement,"" said Hagit Chen, whose son was abducted by militants in October 2023, according to a statement released by a forum representing the families of hostages. 

Activists have also called for the Israeli government to reverse its decision to take over Gaza City.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week ordered immediate talks aimed at securing the release of all remaining captives in Gaza, while also doubling down on the plans for a new offensive to seize Gaza's largest city.

A total of 50 hostages are still being held in the Gaza Strip, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.

Tuesday has so far seen protests in parts of Israel with demands for the remaining hostages in Gaza and for an end to the war.

A total of 50 hostages are still being held in the Gaza Strip, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.

This comes amid continued condemnation of Israel's airstrikes on Nasser Hospital on Monday, which killed at least 20 people, including five journalists.

A dramatic dust storm has blanketed Arizona, grounding flights and blinding drivers.

Towering clouds of dust rolled through cities in the south west such as Phoenix, knocking out power and darkening the sky.

Extraordinary footage showed the storm obscuring skyscrapers as it moved across the ground at 45mph.

Two million people across Arizona were put on a dust storm watch with the National Weather Service warning of low visibility and strong winds.

The storm was so powerful that temperatures in Phoenix dropped from 100F (38C) to 75F (24C) as it passed, according to ABC News.

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at the city's Sky Harbour Airport for an hour on Monday night.

Three hundred flights were delayed when the airport reopened.

More than 15,000 people in Arizona lost power, mostly in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, according to PowerOutage.us.

Videos taken in Tempe showed the Mountain America Stadium being swallowed up by a cloud of dust.

Among those caught in the storm was Bernae Boykin Hitesman who was driving her son, nine, and daughter, 11, home from school in Arizona City when the storm arrived.

She was forced to pull over as the dust storm, also known as a haboob, engulfed her car.

A haboob is a towering wall of dust carried forward by wind from inclement weather or a thunderstorm. It typically occurs in flat, arid areas.

“I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,” Ms Hitesman said.

She said her children were “really scared” as they cowered inside their vehicle for 15 minutes until the storm passed.

In the Nevada desert, Burning Man got off to a rough start owing to 80mph gusts which the National Weather Service said created a “wall of blowing dust”.

Festival goers posted videos on social media of campsites covered in dust, while those trying to get onto the site had to wait eight hours in their cars.

In one clip posted on X, a group of men wearing face and eye masks desperately tried to secure their tent, which was flapping wildly in the wind.

Donald Trump is considering a United States travel ban for European Union officials responsible for the bloc's Digital Services Act and additional tariffs on countries with similar laws, which he claims discriminate against Americans.

The State Department is considering placing sanctions which may come in the form of visa restrictions on those behind the legislation as the US government continues to fight against what it sees as an attempt to silence conservative voices.US officials held a meeting on the issue last week and are yet to make a decision on whether to press ahead with the sanctions, sources told Reuters.

Such a move would be an unprecedented attempt to punish countries for domestic policies the Trump administration does not agree with.

Mr Trump also threatened to impose “substantial additional tariffs” on the UK and other countries that have digital taxes unless they scrap the legislation.

The US president characterised the laws as a discriminatory “attack” on American tech companies, and warned he would impose export restrictions on critical American-made chips and other protected technology.

It comes after a fact-finding delegation of US congressmen visited Westminster to air their concerns and vowed to brief Mr Trump on what they saw as an attack on American businesses.

In a post on Truth Social, Mr Trump said: “As the President of the United States, I will stand up to Countries that attack our incredible American Tech Companies. Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology.

“This must end, and end NOW! With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips.”

Mr Trump's latest salvo is part of a broader push by his government to reshape the global online space, and prevent what he sees as the silencing of conservative voices and decline of free speech.

The EU legislation is meant to battle online harms by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

But Washington has said the EU is pursuing “undue” restrictions on freedom of expression in its efforts to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation.

Relations between the Trump administration and the EU are already strained amid tariff threats.

Reports from earlier this month claimed the US government had instructed European diplomats to launch a lobbying campaign to oppose the Digital Services Act.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio previously threatened visa bans for people who “censor” speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.

JD Vance, the US vice-president, is among the US leaders to have repeatedly lashed out at European officials and regulations, accusing them of “censoring” Americans.

The Republican used his speech at the Munich Security Conference in February to accuse EU leaders of suppressing the speech of groups such as Germany's Right-wing AfD party.

The UK Government has also come under fire for its Online Safety Act, which the Trump administration views as “Orwellian”.

During Mr Trump's visit to Scotland last month Sir Keir Starmer defended the bill and insisted the UK would protect free speech.

It comes as Nigel Farage prepares to tell Lucy Connolly's story when he testifies to members of Congress in September about threats to freedom of expression in Britain.

He is set to bring up the case of Mrs Connolly, who was released from prison earlier this month after being jailed for 31 months over a social media post in the aftermath of the Southport attacks.

A State Department spokesman said: “We are monitoring increasing censorship in Europe with great concern but have no further information to provide at this time.”

An EU Commission spokesman declined to comment on the potential for sanctions, but had previously called censorship claims by the US “completely unfounded”.

“Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in the EU. It lies at the heart of the DSA,” the spokesman said. “It sets out rules for online intermediaries to tackle illegal content, while safeguarding freedom of expression and information online.”

Israel said it would respond to the deal last week, but has yet to contact mediators, days past its own deadline.

Israel missed its own deadline to respond to a temporary ceasefire and captive release deal that Hamas accepted over a week ago, with Israeli authorities appearing “unwilling” to accept the framework despite Hamas saying that the agreement contains significant concessions in Israel's favor.

Qatari officials said on Tuesday that they have not heard from Israel about the framework, presented by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, even though Israel said that it was going to respond by Friday, August 22. 

Israel appears “unwilling to reach an agreement,” said Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari, per Al Jazeera.

“We are in contact with all parties in pursuit of a ceasefire agreement, but there is no official Israeli response — neither acceptance, rejection, nor the presentation of an alternative proposal,” al-Ansari said. “We do not take seriously the media statements in Israel and are awaiting an official response to the proposal.”

Hamas announced over a week ago that it has agreed to the latest proposal. The details of the framework haven't been released to the public, but reports have said that it involves a 60-day pause in attacks and an increase in humanitarian aid. Hamas would release roughly half of the remaining 50 Israeli captives in this time, while Israel would release some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners it's holding in captivity.

Qatari officials say the proposal is “almost identical” to one put forth by U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, in June. That proposal, in fact, reportedly involved the release of fewer Israeli captives than the current deal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, however, imposed a new condition on the framework last week, insisting that it involve the release of all Israeli captives — likely a nonstarter without a plan for a permanent ceasefire agreement, especially as Israel escalates its campaign to raze Gaza City and annex the Strip.

The introduction of a last-minute demand echoes a tactic taken by Israel numerous times amid the genocide, of insisting on a condition that Israeli officials know will be rejected out of hand right as negotiations are nearing completion. Former U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently effectively admitted that this is a known tactic of Netanyahu's to allow Israel to continue its genocide.

Israel's refusal to accept the agreement comes even though Hamas agreed to significant concessions in the latest proposal. 

Drop Site reported last week that Hamas agreed to provisions like allowing Israel to continue its occupation of Gaza's border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, which was previously a red line for Hamas. Another significant concession reportedly involved the removal of Hamas's demand that the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme be removed from the Strip amid the ceasefire.

The top negotiator for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed resistance group in Gaza that has participated in ceasefire negotiations, said that Palestinian negotiators are effectively daring Israel to finally accept a ceasefire deal.

“If the Israeli government now refuses to accept the mediators' proposal — which is fundamentally their own — it exposes the true nature of the Israeli position, shielded by the United States, regarding the entirety of the negotiation process: using it for stalling and gaining time to commit further crimes. There is no longer any room for concessions or futile negotiations,” the official, Mohammed Al-Hindi, told Drop Site.

Israelis have launched protests against Netanyahu's refusal to secure the release of the captives. By demanding that all of the captives be released and delaying an agreement, after all, he is ensuring that numerous Israelis remain in captivity in Gaza indefinitely — potentially facing injury, famine, or death at the hands of Israeli forces.

But the findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

This story was originally published by The New Lede.

Air pollution from oil and gas activities is responsible for an estimated 91,000 deaths and over 10,000 preterm births in the US each year, according to a new study that examined the impacts of the industry through its lifecycle from extraction to refining to burning fuel in power plants.

The study, published August 22 in the journal Science Advances, also attributes an estimated 216,000 annual incidences of US childhood asthma to air pollutants from fossil fuels, as well as over 1,600 lifetime cancers.

California, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have the highest total health burden from all stages of oil and gas production and use, according to the study, with racial minorities facing disproportionate exposure to harmful air pollutants that include fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

The findings, based on data from 2017, likely underestimate the health toll of the US oil and gas lifecycle, the authors said, given annual production increased by 40% from 2017 to 2023 and consumption increased by about 8%.

“Every day, new peer-reviewed evidence emerges demonstrating the level of harm the petrochemical industry causes,” Heather McTeer Toney, executive director of the nonprofit Beyond Petrochemicals, said in a statement. “Faced with this data, I can't imagine how a government official at any level could support building more petrochemical plants.”

Previous studies have focused on air pollution from a single stage of the oil and gas lifecycle, a single air pollutant, or a specific region, according to the study authors.

To measure the industry's national health impact, the researchers combined data from several sources, from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s National Emission Inventory. The new study is “a solid leap forward” in its effort to determine the industry's broader health impacts, said Johnathan Buonocore, an air pollution researcher at Boston University. “This paper shows there's impacts across that whole supply chain that we all should be paying attention to,” he said.

The findings come after the Trump administration launched what the US EPA in March called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history,” with a particular focus on easing regulations “throttling the oil and gas industry.”

Last month, the administration announced plans to rescind the government's “endangerment finding,” which forms the basis for enforcing limits on greenhouse gas emissions. The administration  issued a rule that extends by 18 months deadlines for fossil fuel operations to reduce their emissions of methane and volatile organic compounds.

The Environmental Defense Fund, the Center for Biological Diversity and other nonprofits this week filed a motion asking a federal court to stop the move to delay these limits on pollution from oil and gas operations.

“Rather than hold Big Oil accountable for its pollution, the Trump administration is forcing people to breathe dangerous chemicals and suffer the harms of an overheating climate,” Maggie Coulter, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute, said in a statement.

Even as the federal government moves to roll back and delay air pollution protections, states still have the option to implement their own stricter regulations, including more stringent permitting requirements and pollution control rules, said Buonocore.

“Power plants, any of those kinds of things, these are things that the state has some say over ….,” he said. “States have the ability to set their own regulations that go above and beyond the federal floor.”

Buonocore and colleagues concluded in a 2023 study that oil and gas production is responsible for $77 billion in annual health costs – about three times the cost of climate impacts from the industry's methane emissions. The industry impacted health in cities with little or no oil and gas activity, including Washington, DC, New York City and Chicago, according to the study.

Over half of US counties lack a single federally-monitored air quality station, with more than 50 million Americans living in “air quality monitoring deserts,” according to a study published in April.

“We don't just charge people criminally and then say, ‘Oops, my bad,'” US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said.

US President Donald Trump has attempted to portray his deployment of National Guard troops and other federal agents in Washington, DC as a boon for public safety.

Inside DC courtrooms, however, judges and defense attorneys have expressed alarm at the tactics being used by law enforcement officers to unfairly charge local residents with serious crimes that carry lengthy prison sentences.

NPR reports that US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui expressed incredulity on Monday while dismissing weapons charges against a Maryland resident named Torez Riley, who was subjected to what the judge described as “without a doubt the most illegal search I've ever seen in my life.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

While reviewing the case, the judge said that law enforcement officials seem to have targeted Riley for a search simply because he was a Black man carrying what appeared to be a heavy backpack.

“I'm absolutely flabbergasted at what has happened,” Faruqui said. “A high school student would know this was an illegal search.”

The Department of Justice had agreed to drop the charges after body camera footage of Riley's arrest showed officers searching him without probable cause, but Faruqui said that was cold comfort for a defendant who had already spent the last week behind bars.

“We don't just charge people criminally and then say, ‘Oops, my bad,'” the judge said. “I'm at a loss how the US Attorney's office thought this was an appropriate charge in any court, let alone the federal court.”

Faruqui also noted that judges in his court “on multiple occasions” in recent weeks had taken the highly unusual step of moving to suppress search warrants used against suspects, which makes them inadmissible to use in court.

NPR's report echoes an article in The New York Times earlier this week that detailed some of the difficulties the government is having in making some of its charges stick in the wake of Trump's DC crackdown.

In its report, the Times focused the arrest of 28-year-old Amazon delivery driver named Mark Bigelow, who was hit with federal felony charges for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officials who were attempting to detain him over a misdemeanor offense of possessing an open container of alcohol.

“As he was placed in a vehicle, the handcuffed Mr. Bigelow became belligerent, twisting his body and yelling, ‘Get off me! Y'all too little, bro!' at an ICE agent, according to a court filing, which described how Mr. Bigelow made ‘physical contact' by kicking an agent in the hand and another in the leg,” reported the Times. “As a result, Mr. Bigelow was charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding a federal officer, an offense that carries a maximum sentence of eight years in prison.”

Federal public defender Elizabeth Mullin said in court last week that Bigelow would never have been charged with a federal felony were it not for the president's decision to send federal agents swarming the streets of the nation's capital.

“He was caught up in this federal occupation of DC,” she said. “This was a case created by federal law enforcement.”

The Times also reported on Monday that federal prosecutors had reduced charges against a woman named Sidney Lori Reid, who was accused of assaulting an FBI agent during a protest against Trump's immigration policies last month. The decision to refile Reid's case as a misdemeanor came after prosecutors failed on three separate occasions to convince a grand jury to charge her with felony offenses.

Attorneys Tezira Abe and Eugene Ohm, who have been representing Reid, said that the grand juries' refusal to indict their client on three separate occasions indicated fatal weaknesses in the government's case.

“The US attorney can try to concoct crimes to quiet the people, but in our criminal justice system, the citizens have the last word,” they said. “We are anxious to present the misdemeanor case to a jury and to quickly clear Ms. Reid's name.”

In the lead-up to the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this month, things did not look good for Ukraine. Characterizations of the summit oscillated between a “new Yalta,” in which the U.S. president might agree to the Kremlin's demands for a Russian sphere of influence over Ukraine, and a “new Munich,” in which Trump would throw Ukraine under the bus and withdraw U.S. support for the country's defense. In other words, expectations in Ukraine and among Kyiv's allies were low.

Yet the summit didn't end in a major disaster for Ukraine. Trump didn't negotiate with Putin on Kyiv's behalf; he didn't agree to start normalizing relations with Russia before the war in Ukraine was resolved; and on August 18, he received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a phalanx of European leaders at the White House, where they collectively managed to throw the diplomatic ball back into Putin's court. “This was very much a day of team Europe and team U.S. together supporting Ukraine,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said afterward.

But although Putin now knows that his aspirational Plan A, in which Trump would simply impose a deal on Kyiv written in Moscow, is unlikely to materialize, he has shifted to his more workable Plan B, in which Trump will lose patience and significantly reduce U.S. assistance to Ukraine. In the Kremlin's calculus, this still counts as winning, and Putin's diplomatic strategy is still following the three-pronged approach that my co-authors and I outlined in Foreign Affairs a few months ago. Moscow is holding the U.S. president's attention, forestalling a new round of painful U.S. sanctions, and keeping the fighting going.

This is because, in the Kremlin's assessment, time is on Russia's side. Moscow has the upper hand on the battlefield: it has maintained a significant numerical advantage in personnel and equipment, and despite mounting casualties, it has continued to gradually gnaw through the fortified lines in the Donbas. Moreover, Russia is catching up in drone warfare, denying Ukraine its competitive edge. Moscow doesn't want a cease-fire to stop the war right now—unless, of course, all of its political demands are simply met.

Russia is playing Trump for time. But despite the country's confidence, it's not clear that Putin has a realistic contingency plan should Kyiv prove able to hold on, as it has for the past three years. If, for example, the EU speeds up delivery of ammunition and drones from existing stock and extends a financial lifeline to Kyiv by confiscating the $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets sitting in its banks, the Kremlin may not achieve its strategic goal of Ukraine's subjugation. Despite putting Russia's economy and society on a war footing, Putin may need more than just time to win.

Early engagements with the second Trump administration seemed encouraging for Moscow's Plan A. Trump appointed his friend Steve Witkoff as a special envoy for negotiations with Russia, and Witkoff visited Moscow several times and spent hours talking to Putin. Between Trump's inauguration in January and the summer, the U.S. and Russian presidents had three lengthy phone calls, and Putin's talking points clearly made an impact on his U.S. counterpart, as painfully evidenced in Trump's dressing down of Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28.

Moreover, Moscow has been trying to compartmentalize the relationship with the United States, as was clear during the first high-level meeting between the Russians and Trump's national security team on February 18. The Kremlin suggested seeking peace in Ukraine in tandem with a broader normalization of U.S.-Russian ties, which would include reopening the consulates in both countries (which have been closed since 2017), restarting arms control talks, and boosting mutual trade and investment.

By summer, however, it had become apparent that the Kremlin's charm offensive was faltering. Zelensky, with a lot of counseling from European leaders, had managed to patch up the relationship with Trump by signing a mineral deal that provided the United States with preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources, particularly rare-earth minerals. In return, the White House has continued Kyiv's access to U.S. military assistance, including American intelligence and the ability to purchase U.S. weapons with European money. And on July 14, speaking alongside Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO, Trump threatened “very severe tariffs” if Russia didn't agree to an unconditional cease-fire.



The threat of further economic coercion had teeth. In 2024, Russia exported a meager $3 billion in goods to the United States, so even triple-digit tariffs would not seriously affect the Kremlin's budget. But Trump has imposed a 25 percent punitive tariff on Indian goods for purchasing Russian oil—a tariff that will likely further increase the discounts that Russian oil sellers need to provide to Indian buyers, reducing the profitability of the oil trade for the Kremlin.

The decrease in oil and gas revenues is already affecting the war economy: some of the Russian regions that previously offered lavish payouts for military recruits are reducing sign-up bonuses because funds are drying up. The most visible sign of this is the country's ballooning budget deficit. At the beginning of this year, the Kremlin's plan was to have a budget deficit of just 0.5 percent of the country's GDP. Yet in June, the Kremlin had to increase that to 1.8 percent of GDP. It will overshoot even this target; in the first seven months of this year, the budget deficit already amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP.

More U.S. sanctions could also prove damaging. The United States, for instance, has not yet blacklisted Russian energy giants, such as Rosneft and Lukoil, but such a move would put significant pressure on the Kremlin's cash flow. As Alexandra Prokopenko wrote in Foreign Affairs in January, the Russian economy has enough steam to support Putin's war machine for another 18 to 24 months, but the situation is worsening.

This reality presented the Kremlin with a dilemma of whether to continue the hard-nosed course, ignoring Trump's threats—or try to assuage him. In the end, the Kremlin decided it was better to initiate a meeting between the presidents and get Trump and Putin's personal relationship back on track. The Kremlin invited Witkoff to come to Moscow, where he was presented with a semblance of an acceptable deal on August 7. The Russians also suggested a meeting with Trump, which was hastily organized in Alaska. The usual Russian mantra that leaders' summits must be carefully prepared—a justification that the Kremlin uses to explain Putin's reluctance to meet with Zelensky—was tellingly abandoned.

After a three-hour conversation between Putin and Trump, the Alaskan summit's scheduled working lunch was canceled and the press conference downgraded to official remarks by each president. This was a clear signal that Russia's attempts to compartmentalize the Ukrainian war and to normalize ties in other areas had failed. But that was the only notable underperformance by Putin's team.

On the core issue, Putin achieved his key goal for the meeting: he convinced Trump that the White House's peacemaking efforts should be focused on reaching a comprehensive resolution to end the war, not an unconditional cease-fire, and that the fighting could continue in the meantime. Despite Trump's previous claims, as well as urging by European leaders and Zelensky before the summit, the White House has imposed no punitive measures on Russia over the Kremlin's refusal to agree to a cease-fire.

How did Putin succeed? He matched Trump's performative diplomacy with performative negotiations, essentially tricking the Trump administration into believing that he was making serious concessions. According to Trump and various U.S. officials, such as Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Vice President JD Vance, Putin signaled in Alaska that he was ready to climb down from some of his maximalist demands—demands that were absurd to begin with.



Instead of demanding the full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the four regions to which Moscow lays claim, the Kremlin is now asking Kyiv to surrender only the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, while in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Moscow will accept the current line of contact. Putin apparently suggested that he is also willing to trade other parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies, including pockets of the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions.

These land swaps would see Kyiv surrender a land mass nearly ten times as large as what Russia is prepared to give back. Moreover, the quarter of the Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls, including the strategic cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk, is the most fortified part of the country and has been turned into a massive network of defense installations since its recapture in 2014 from Russian-backed separatists. For Zelensky, surrendering this territory is all but impossible for both political and military reasons. All available polling shows that Ukrainian society will not accept the country's territory's being traded; and from the military perspective, surrendering western Donbas would amount to giving the invader the key to all of northern and central Ukraine. (There are no major fortification lines beyond the “fortress belt” that Putin wants Kyiv to abandon.)

Nevertheless, after the summit, Trump accepted the logic of “land swaps” offered by Putin, although he said that the decision would be Zelensky's to make.

Another key issue discussed in Alaska was postwar security guarantees for Ukraine. Witkoff told Fox News that “epic progress” had been made during the summit. According to him, Putin agreed for the first time to the concept of security guarantees for Ukraine, and the result could be even stronger than NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause—without actual NATO membership for Kyiv.

Moreover, according to Witkoff, Russia agreed to enact a law that it would not take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal or “go after any other European countries.” These promises were greeted as “groundbreaking” by Trump's team, and the U.S. president presented them as a major achievement during his August 18 meeting at the White House with Zelensky and a group of European leaders.

For a moment, there was optimism that a security guarantee could be hammered out. Capitalizing on the vague language of the Russian proposal, Europeans jumped on the opportunity to present a plan of their own: the deployment of a European “reassurance force” in Ukraine after the war, to which ten EU countries would potentially contribute troops, while Trump promised vague “air support” from the United States without elaborating on what that could mean in practice.



But on August 20, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov poured cold water on the plan. According to him, Moscow's idea for a security guarantee is not a set of bilateral commitments between Ukraine and the U.S. and European governments with formulations similar to Article 5, but rather a consensus-based agreement guaranteed by the UN Security Council's five permanent members—with the Kremlin holding veto power. Essentially, he wants the fox to help guard the henhouse. Moreover, Moscow insists on seriously limiting the Ukrainian armed forces—both in numbers and equipment—as well as their ability to cooperate with foreign partners in arms procurement, intelligence sharing, weapons design, and training.

The “epic progress” turned out to be strikingly similar to the positions Russia held in the talks that took place in Istanbul in the first two months after Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and ultimately collapsed. As first described in Foreign Affairs by Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko, those negotiations ended with no agreement in part because of Moscow's and Kyiv's inability to bridge the very same gap over security guarantees. For Putin, ending Ukraine's security partnership with the West remains a core goal. But from Kyiv's vantage point, the size of its army and ability to maintain ties to NATO's militaries are a prerequisite for retaining sovereignty and thus nonnegotiable.

Moreover, Ukraine has reasons to believe that its negotiating position is stronger than it was in 2022. Unlike three years ago, European countries are finally ready to provide the security guarantees Kyiv seeks—or at least they now say so. Even more important, the depth of cooperation between Ukraine and NATO now far outstrips the level Putin worried about before the war, precisely because of Russia's invasion. The alliance is intimately involved in building and testing weapons with Ukraine, training its army, and supplying it with intelligence and arms, including ones that can strike deep inside Russian territory. It is unimaginable that Kyiv would abandon this partnership voluntarily. Despite Trump's wish to organize a meeting between Putin and Zelensky as well as a trilateral summit to seal the deal, a genuine peace agreement remains as elusive as ever.

It's impossible to predict how Trump will deal with the chasm between Russia's positions and what is acceptable to Ukraine. But while Putin stalls, it is clear that Europe is busy developing plans of its own. Europe's Plan A consists of carefully pushing Trump to accept the fact that it's the Kremlin that is obstructing his peace efforts and that only pressure can incentivize Putin to engage in compromise. If this plan succeeds, Putin's procrastinating could backfire, with Trump at last hitting Russia with more sanctions. The Europeans are also planning to continue to pay for American weapons for Ukraine. In the week after the Alaskan summit, the Pentagon approved the sale to Ukraine of $850 million worth of equipment, including 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles with a range of 150 to 280 miles.

But if the Europeans' Plan A fails—if Trump doesn't blame Putin, or if he merely loses interest—they are developing their own Plan B. At the very least, they plan to maintain current levels of military support to Ukraine and increase the sanctions pressure on Russia (although the EU's sanctions toolkit is far less powerful than Washington's). If key European countries agree to step up the pressure, they could also share more of their existing military equipment stock with Ukraine, temporarily reducing the combat readiness of their own forces but keeping Ukraine in the fight at this crucial juncture. They could also provide a long-term financial lifeline to Kyiv by seizing the nearly $250 billion in state Russian assets frozen in the EU, allowing the purchase of U.S. weapons without reaching deeper into European taxpayers' pockets. In theory, if the United States keeps providing intelligence, doesn't drop the sanctions, and allows the EU to buy weapons for Ukraine, Europeans can self-organize and play a critical role in sustaining Ukraine's defense effort to the very moment when Putin's war machine may run out of offensive steam some 18 to 24 months down the road.

Europe's Plan B probably will not deter the Kremlin: given Putin's demonstrated ability to stomach pain and keep plugging away at an elusive victory, the Russian leader may instruct his generals and economic team to simply carry on. His government can navigate the deterioration in public finances by cutting expenditures on education, health care, and infrastructure, as it has throughout the war. Putin is also prepared to tap into the deep well of Russian manpower by force if the financial incentives dry up further. In July, the Kremlin launched digital draft notices to push more Russian men into the army; the moment a future recruit receives an electronic notification that he has been called up, Russia's borders are closed to him and there are various penalties for not serving. The Kremlin is obviously preparing money and troops for a protracted war in which its only strategy is to outlast Ukraine militarily and economically.

Yet the eventuality for which the Kremlin does not appear to have a plan is that Russia will be unable to translate its massive advantage in manpower and materiel into a decisive breakthrough—as has been the case since the war began. A plan, in other words, for the possibility that Ukraine's defense lines don't crumble after all.

            Well, that's one way to silence a heckler.
    


Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani hit a home run in the top of the ninth to cap off Sunday's 8-2 win against the San Diego Padres, but it wasn't the home run off Yuki Matsui that had everyone talking; it's what Ohtani did after rounding the bases.
    


            Before joining his teammates in celebration, the 31-year-old took a detour to the Padres fan sitting directly next to the visitor dugout.
    


            The fan's voice could be heard on field mics throughout the broadcast reminding the three-time MVP of his struggles in the batter's box throughout the series. Ohtani was sitting at 0-10 – unusual for him – before the homer.
    


            So, after hitting his 45th home run of the season, Ohtani, with a huge smile on his face, ran up to the fan and gave him a high five and a pat on the back.
    


            The camera cut to the fan who appeared to shake his head while smiling after the interaction. He was then seen laughing while talking to those around him. All in good fun, it seems.
    


            “Very annoying, as he's in my right ear the entire game. But it was very out of character for Shohei and he was wearing him out the whole game,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said after the game. “It was good to see Shohei, you know, initiate a high five from him.”
    


            The skipper added with a smile, “That was great. That was fun. It was good to see Shohei show his personality.”
    


            Ohtani certainly wasn't the only Dodgers player struggling earlier in the series as their offense only scraped together two runs total in the opening two games – both LA losses – before exploding on Sunday.
    


            His projected 409-foot home run to right-center came with Los Angeles already up by five in the ninth. It was the cherry on top of a dominant outing for the defending World Series champions.
    


            The win moved the Dodgers level with their division rivals in the NL West, but with San Diego losing 6-9 to the Seattle Mariners and the Dodgers blowing out the Cincinnati Reds 7-0 on Monday, LA now has a game lead in the back-and-forth division race.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump is crowing about his tariffs reducing the debt by $4 trillion. But there are some caveats","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/politics/us-national-debt-trump-tariffs","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            President Donald Trump is making sure to share – repeatedly – a recent government analysis that shows his sweeping array of tariffs is expected to reduce the federal debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, more than forecast only a few months ago.
    


            The president has referenced the Congressional Budget Office report in multiple remarks and on Truth Social since it was released on Friday, saying it shows the success of one of his key, but controversial, policy platforms.
    


            “The tariffs came in at $4 trillion,” Trump said at an Oval Office event on Monday afternoon, the second time he mentioned the report that day. “The CBO, they just announced it. I told them that was going to happen, but they refused to give us credit for it. Now they're giving us credit because the money is flowing in.”
    


            However, how much revenue the US actually realizes depends on several important factors, including whether the current levies remain in place into 2035 and how the nation reacts to the higher tariffs. The tariffs are expected to increase inflation and potentially weaken the economy, which could in turn reduce federal revenue. (The CBO's analysis did not take the economic impact into account.)
    


            Already, the president has announced some recent changes not incorporated into the analysis, including the coming suspension of tariff-free entry for products under $800. On the flip side, a federal appeals court is considering whether Trump overstepped his legal authority to impose many of the tariffs, which may lead to at least some of them being undone.
    


            Also, the president hasn't mentioned that the One Big Beautiful Bill, his domestic policy agenda that he signed into law last month, is expected to increase the federal debt by an estimated $4.1 trillion or so between 2025 and 2034, more than his tariffs are forecast to bring in.
    


            Since taking office in January, Trump has slapped tariffs on a wide range of goods and countries, including increasing tariffs on most Chinese goods by 30%, on automobiles and car parts by up to 25%, and on most imports of steel and aluminum by 50%, among other examples. The levies are expected to increase the price consumers pay for computers and other electronics, clothing, toys, furniture and more, even as the president insists that foreign governments will pick up the tab.
    


            The beefed-up tariffs are projected to lower the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over the 2025 to 2035 period, plus reduce interest costs by an additional roughly $700 billion, for a total impact of $4 trillion, according to the CBO's latest estimate. It looked at tariffs imposed as of August 19.
    


            The CBO had estimated in early June that the tariffs implemented through May 13 would reduce the federal debt by a total of roughly $3 trillion.
    


            However, Trump has also modified the rates on countries and sectors numerous times.
    


            For instance, Trump slapped a minimum 20% tariff on most Chinese goods in April. But within days, he increased rates to 145% in response to China imposing higher tariffs on American goods. In May, following bilateral trade negotiations, both countries agreed to lower rates on one another's goods, with the US charging a minimum of 30%. Rates are set to stay at the previously agreed upon levels through November. However, Trump said Monday that he's prepared to hike tariffs on Chinese goods as high as 200% if it doesn't ship more rare-earth minerals to the US.
    


            The president also recently said he would consider distributing at least some of the tariff revenue to Americans in the form of rebate checks, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC last week that the money would go to paying down the national debt.
    


            Tariffs and other customs duties have generated nearly $156 billion in revenue so far this year, through August 22, according to Treasury Department data.
    


            The revenue is more than most people expected, said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a watchdog group. And it could be difficult to pull back, though it would depend on the economic consequences.
    


            “If we see a significant increase in inflation and a recession or something, it's more likely that these get reversed, either wholesale or piece-wise through trade deals,” he said, noting that a prior CBO estimate that took economic impact into account showed tariffs would likely decrease revenue somewhat. “Whereas, if you just see a one-time, small price shift and some mild economic weakness, we may learn to live with these.”

California, Washington and New Mexico could lose millions of dollars of federal funding if they continue failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.

An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way all three states are enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump's executive orders. He said the department was also already reviewing how states were enforcing the rules before the crash.

Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can't demonstrate English proficiency and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash that killed three should not have ever been given a commercial driver's license because of his immigration status. But the crash has become increasingly political with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the Trump administration's immigration concerns in interviews.

But Duffy said Tuesday that it is a safety issue — not a political one — because truckers need to understand road signs and be able to communicate with law enforcement about what they are hauling if they are pulled over or what happened if there is an accident.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports the Trump Administration threatens funding for some states over enforcing English rules for truckers.

“This is about keeping people safe on the road. Your families, your kids, your spouses, your loved ones, your friends. We all use the roadway, and we need to make sure that those who are driving big rigs — semis — can understand the road signs, that they've been well trained,” Duffy said.

The Transportation Department said California has conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect requiring truck drivers be able to recognize and read road signs and communicate with authorities in English. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.

He cited similar statistics for the other states with Washington finding more than 6,000 violations of safety rules during inspections, but only pulling four drivers out of service for English language violations. New Mexico has not placed any drivers out of service since the rules took effect.

Duffy said the states will lose money from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program if they don't comply with the rules within 30 days. Duffy said California could lose $33 million, Washington could lose $10.5 million and New Mexico could lose $7 million.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office said on the X platform that the Trump administration is just trying to deflect responsibility for the crash. The other two states did not immediately respond Tuesday.

“This is rich. The Trump Administration approved the federal work permit for the man who killed 3 people — and now they're scrambling to shift blame after getting caught. Sean's nonsense announcement is as big a joke as the Trump Administration itself,” Newsom's office said.

Three people were killed when truck driver Harjinder Singh made an illegal U-turn on a highway, according to Florida's Highway Patrol. He is being held without bond after being charged with three state counts of vehicular homicide and immigration violations.

A nearby minivan slammed into Singh's trailer as he made the turn on a highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach. Singh and his passenger were not injured.

Diamond R. Litty, the elected public defender in St. Lucie County, said her office was provisionally assigned to Singh's case during his initial appearance Saturday morning. A review of his finances will determine whether Litty's office remains on the case.

Litty said her office will focus on the criminal charges against Singh, who is presumed innocent, but they will also work with an immigration attorney to determine how Singh's status affects the case. After more than three decades at her position, Litty said she can't recall a case that garnered more attention than this one.

“Unfortunately, Mr. Singh has been caught in the crosshairs of politics,” Litty said.

But the head of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association trade group that represents small-business truck drivers praised Duffy's announcement.

“Basic English skills are critical for safely operating a commercial motor vehicle — reading road signs, following emergency instructions, and communicating with law enforcement are not optional. The fatal crash in Florida this month tragically illustrates what's at stake,” the group's president, Todd Spencer, said.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Singh, a native of India, was in the country illegally. So Duffy said he should not have been granted a commercial driver's licenses by Washington and California. He said New Mexico should have pulled Singh off the road for not speaking English after he was pulled over in July because he later failed a test given by DOT investigators after the Florida crash.

California is one of 19 states, in addition to the District of Columbia, that issues licenses regardless of immigration status. Supporters say that lets people work, visit doctors and travel safely.

But in addition, Newsom's press office has said Singh obtained a work permit during Trump's first term, which Homeland Security officials disputed. Newsom also said the permit was renewed in April and federal officials have not addressed that.

Florida authorities have said Singh entered the U.S. illegally from Mexico in 2018. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that Singh should have never received a commercial driver's license.

“You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not in this country legally. You're not allowed to issue a CDL to somebody who is not capable of understanding traffic signs,” DeSantis said, calling the crash an “avoidable tragedy.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Devon Walker is leaving “Saturday Night Live,” in the first of what could be several cast departures as the storied program prepares for its 51st season.

“Me and the show did three years together, and sometimes it was really cool,” Walker wrote Monday on Instagram. “Sometimes it was toxic as hell. But we did what we made the most of what it was, even amidst all of the dysfunction.”

The note in his post was titled: “wait ... did he quit or did he get fired?”

Walker's announcement comes as “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels is saying that he anticipates changes following the show's historic 50th season. No cast members had announced their departure following the season's conclusion. In an interview with Puck that ran last week, Michaels answered “yes” when asked if he expected to “shake things up.”

“It'll be announced in a week or so,” he said then.

Representative for “Saturday Night Live” did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

Meanwhile, “SNL” writer Celeste Yim announced they were leaving after five seasons. Yim, the show's first openly nonbinary writer, posted last weekend on Instagram that the job was a dream come true “BUT was also grueling and I slept in my office every week BUT my friends helped me with everything BUT I got yelled at by random famous men BUT some famous girls too BUT I loved it and I laughed every day and it's where I grew up.”

Michaels told Puck at least one cast member was certain to be back: James Austin Johnson, who plays President Donald Trump.

Since its debut in 1975, the NBC program has reinvented itself often, with performers over the past 50 years ranging from John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd to Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson. The 51st season will premiere Oct. 4.

Ugandans on Tuesday questioned an agreement with the United States to receive deported migrants, highlighting the lack of parliamentary approval and that the deal eases political pressure on the country's authoritarian president.

KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The highest-profile detainee that the United States seeks to deport, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, appears to be headed to Uganda, where critics claim that a deal with the Trump administration eases political pressure on a president who's ruled for nearly four decades.

Ugandan officials have released few details about the agreement but have said they prefer to receive deportees of African origin — and don't want people with criminal records. Abrego Garcia is an El Salvador native who has been charged with human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty.

Abrego Garcia, the subject of a protracted immigration saga, was detained again Monday by immigration officials in the U.S., and the Department of Homeland Security said he “is being processed for removal to Uganda.”

Other African nations already have accepted deportees. In July, the U.S. deported five men with criminal backgrounds to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini and sent eight others to South Sudan, where civil war threatens to erupt again. Rwanda has said it will receive up to 250 migrants deported from the U.S.

Opposition figures and others in Uganda on Tuesday questioned the lack of parliamentary approval for the agreement.

Without such oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda's national assembly.

He said the agreement left him “a little perplexed” because Uganda already struggles to look after refugees fleeing violence in neighboring countries like Congo and South Sudan. He suggested the agreement makes sense only as a matter of “economic expediency” for Uganda's government.




It is unclear what Uganda's government is receiving for accepting deportees, how many it might take or what its plans for Abrego Garcia might be. The country's attorney-general, as well as government ministers in charge of refugees and internal affairs, were not immediately available for comment.

The day before Uganda confirmed the deal, the deputy minister in charge of international relations, Okello Oryem, asserted to The Associated Press that such an agreement was “complete rubbish.”

Some Ugandans on Tuesday were busy speculating what benefit longtime President Yoweri Museveni might receive. The authoritarian leader has been in power since 1986.

For Museveni, the deal is desirable “for political and perhaps economic reasons” and might come with trade opportunities, said Marlon Agaba, the head of a leading anti-corruption group in Uganda.

“The Trump administration is about deals, about deal-making, and any strongman would welcome that,” he said.

After U.S. sanctions targeted many government officials over human rights and other issues, “Museveni will be happy” to transact with Washington over deportees, said Ibrahim Ssemujju, a lawmaker and prominent opposition figure. “He will be asking, ‘When are you bringing them?'”

Ssemujju asserted that the agreement is flawed without parliamentary authorization.

Negotiators for the Ugandan side in the deal with the Trump administration are believed to have been reporting directly to Museveni.

For much of his time in power, Museveni was seen as a strong U.S. ally, especially for his support of counter-terrorism operations in Somalia, where he deployed troops to fight the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab.

But his cachet in Washington has declined. The Biden administration piled pressure over corruption, LGBTQ+ rights concerns and alleged rights abuses.

Ugandan officials sanctioned by the U.S. include the parliament speaker, the prisons chief, a former police chief, a former deputy army commander and some former government ministers.

In 2023, reacting to U.S. sanctions imposed against Ugandan officials following the enactment of a law against homosexuality, Museveni told a gathering of government officials that he had no wish to visit the U.S.

PHOENIX (AP) — A powerful storm kicked up a towering wall of dust that rolled through metro Phoenix on Monday, darkening the sky, blinding drivers, knocking out power and grounding flights at one of the nation's busiest airports. 

Bernae Boykin Hitesman was driving her son and daughter, ages 9 and 11, home from school when the storm, known as a haboob, arrived late in the afternoon in Arizona City, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southeast of Phoenix.

She had to quickly pull over as the storm engulfed her car. “I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,” she said.

Boykin Hitesman said she could taste the dust and feel the strong wind rattling her car until it finally passed about 15 minutes later.

“I was nervous,” she said. “My kids were really, really scared, so I was trying to be brave for them.”

A haboob is a dust storm pushed by the wind produced by a weather front or thunderstorm and typically occurs in flat, arid areas. Heavy rain and wind followed Monday's haboob, delaying flights at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and causing some damage to a terminal roof. 

“Crews have been identifying leaks and attempting to clean up water where it has collected in passenger areas,” Heather Shelbrack, the airport's deputy aviation director for public relations, said in an email. 




More than 15,000 people lost power, most in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, according to PowerOutage.us.

Richard Filley, a retired university professor who lives in Gilbert, said the dust storm caused the trees to sway and knocked bird feeders to the ground. Fine dust found its way through “every little crack and space” into his house, he said.

“The windstorm part of it, I'm glad it's gone,” he said. “You look at the photos of haboobs and they are a spectacular natural phenomenon. They are kind of beautiful in their own way.”

Phoenix has been drier than usual during the monsoon season, while parts of southeast and north-central Arizona have had a fair amount of rain, said Mark O'Malley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix.

“But that's typical for a monsoon, very hit and miss,” he said.

The forecast for metro Phoenix calls for a 40% chance of rain Tuesday before drying out, O'Malley said.

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump says he's firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, amid mortgage fraud allegations, opening a new front in the fight over America's central bank.

The president's announcement came Monday night, days after Cook said she wouldn't leave her post despite Trump calling for her to resign over an accusation from one his officials that she committed mortgage fraud.

Trump appointee Bill Pulte, the head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged on social media last week that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.

Trump said in announcing the move that he had the constitutional authority to remove Cook, but doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity, as Trump would likely appoint a loyalist to the Fed's governing board with Cook gone.

Trump's plan to fire Cook threatens the Fed's venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here's why the central bank's independence matters:

The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy, which strengthens or weakens based on cuts or increases to the short-term interest rate the central bank controls.

Cutting the rate — which typically happens when the economy falters — can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. Raising the rate — which the Fed does to cool the economy and combat inflation — can weaken the economy and cause job losses.

Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliances more expensive.

Most investors also prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said the peninsula has grown more unstable in the past few years as Pyongyang continues to develop its nuclear programs and is “at the final stage of developing” intercontinental ballistic missiles. 

“The hard facts are that the number of nuclear weapons that North Korea possesses has increased 2.5 times during the past three to four years,” Lee said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies after meeting with Trump in the White House. “And their ability to produce fissile material has increased tremendously.” 

Lee said Seoul has increased its defense capabilities but is at a disadvantage without nuclear capability. He called for efforts to stop the situation from getting worse.

The recently defunded nonprofit that distributed federal money to public media stations across the U.S. is warning of another casualty when it shuts down next month: the resilience of the nation's emergency alert systems.

In 2022, Congress authorized $136 million for the Next Generation Warning System grant program, meant to help stations in rural, tribal and otherwise underserved communities repair and improve the warning systems that tell people about evacuation orders, Amber Alerts, tornado warnings, and more.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which manages the grant money, is shutting down Sept. 30 after Congress and Trump defunded it in July.

That could leave unspent millions in grant dollars that were awarded but not yet paid to stations, imperiling dozens of projects meant to save lives in emergencies. 

The need for robust and redundant warning systems was made tragically clear in July when Texas floods killed at least 136 people, many in areas with spotty cellphone reception and no siren systems.

Adm. Daryl Caudle took over as chief of naval operations, the Navy's highest-ranking officer, on Monday, ending a six-month vacancy created by the Trump administration's firing of his predecessor.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ousted a growing list of top military leaders with little or no explanation. Hegseth fired Caudle's predecessor, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, without explanation in February.

Neither Caudle nor Navy Secretary John Phelan addressed the ouster at a swearing-in ceremony Monday, though Franchetti was among several former chiefs of naval operations in attendance.

Caudle showed his agreement with an often-repeated Trump administration phrase, saying, “Peace through strength works.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Monday with counterparts from eight seven NATO allies, Ukraine and the European Union about the Trump administration's efforts to forge a Ukrainian-Russian peace agreement.

In a brief statement that did not divulge any details of the conversation, the State Department said Rubio had spoken with the foreign ministers of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Ukraine and the top diplomat for the EU.

Rubio and the others “agreed to continue cooperation in diplomatic efforts to bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end through a lasting negotiated settlement,” the State Department said.

Earlier Monday, Trump suggested multiple times that he might dispatch the National Guard to Chicago regardless of Gov. JB Pritzker's opinion, calling the city a “killing field,” an apparent reference to the Cambodian genocide.

Pritzker and other Illinois officials said the Trump administration has not reached out to Chicago leaders about any federal initiative to deploy military personnel to the city to combat crime the way the president has in the nation's capital. They cited statistics showing drops in violent crime in Chicago and cast Trump's move as performative, partisan and racist.

“Mr. President, do not come to Chicago,” Pritzker said, standing in a park about a mile from the Chicago skyscraper that features Trump's name in large lettering.

The governor said he would fight the “petty whims of an arrogant little man” who “wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish his dissidents and score political points.”

Trump signed an executive order on Monday threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding to local and state governments that offer cashless bail, arguing that it is a threat to public safety.

Cashless bail refers to policies that allow people to be released from jail without paying any money while they await trial. It is an alternative to the traditional cash bail system in which which people pay money to be released and get their money back if they return to court when they are supposed to.

Studies have shown mixed results regarding the impact of cashless bail on crime. Many focus on the recidivism of individual defendants rather than overall crime rates.

Loyola University of Chicago's Center for Criminal Justice published a 2024 report on Illinois' new cashless bail policy, one year after it went into effect. It acknowledges that there is not yet enough data to know what impact the law has had on crime, but that crime in Illinois did not increase after its implementation. Violent and property crime declined in some counties.

The president has signed a proclamation honoring 13 American servicemembers killed in a suicide bombing during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal of forces at the end of the Afghanistan war in 2021.

Surrounded by family members of those killed in the attack, Trump called the attack “the worst day, and in many ways the most embarrassing day in the history of our country.”

In May, Trump directed the Defense Department to conduct a review of what occurred during the U.S. withdrawal, and Trump said during the event that he expected that to be complete by the middle of next year.

Tuesday marks the fourth anniversary of the suicide bombing.

A bipartisan pair of congressional lawmakers are pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria after they were heartened by a visit with the country's new interim leader.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Republican Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, told reporters on a call that they had talked with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa about permanently lifting sanctions and would make a push to have Congress do that in the coming months. 

President Donald Trump issued an executive order lifting the sanctions on the country in June, but Congress would need to act to make that move permanent.

Shaheen said the sanctions “are preventing investment in the country and the prosperity and opportunity that people want to see in the future.”

The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee says that Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza needs to end after an airstrike on a hospital killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press.

“I personally am appalled by the bombing in Gaza and by the killing of journalists. And I think it needs to end now,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told reporters on a call from Beirut.

Shaheen was traveling in the Middle East as part of a U.S. delegation to meet with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Congressional Democrats, who once were stalwart supporters of Israel, have recently become more outspoken critics of how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has conducted the war on Hamas.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis noted that the government is temporarily prohibited from deporting Abrego Garcia under overlapping court orders currently in effect. 

She asked Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign if the government knows it is “absolutely forbidden at this juncture” to remove him from the U.S. under the current legal landscape. 

“Your honor, yes, we certainly understand that,” Ensign said.

Abrego Garcia was taken to a Virginia detention center after he surrendered on Monday, said the plaintiff's attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, adding that they are concerned he would be moved to another facility later. 

Xinis said she will order that Abrego Garcia is not moved from the Virginia facility for now. She said she believed she must extend a temporary restraining order barring Abrego Garcia's removal from the U.S.

U.S. Ambassador to France Charles Kushner did not respond to a summons to the French foreign ministry to answer complaints about an open letter he sent accusing French authorities of not doing enough to combat antisemitism, a French diplomatic official said.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with the ministry's practice, said Kushner, the father of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, did not appear for the meeting and was represented instead by his number two.

The official said the U.S. diplomat was told that Kushner's open letter to French President Emmanuel Macron “was unacceptable in both form and substance,” constituted interference in France's internal affairs and ignored the French government's efforts and policies on combating antisemitism.

Neither the embassy nor the State Department had any immediate response to the French official's description of the meeting. The State Department had said on Sunday that it stood by Kushner's criticisms and that the ambassador “is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.”

A network of clinics in Maine will not resume getting Medicaid funds to treat thousands of low-income patients during its lawsuit over Trump administration cuts to abortion providers, a judge ruled Monday.

President Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the “big beautiful bill,” blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. The parameters in the bill also stopped funding from reaching Maine Family Planning, a much smaller provider that offers health care services in one of the poorest and most rural states in the Northeast.

Maine Family Planning says Medicaid dollars are not used for its abortion services, which are a relatively small percentage of the overall services provided. It's unfair to cut off funding for the clinics “solely because Congress wanted to defund Planned Parenthood,” an attorney for Maine Family Planning told the judge earlier this month. But in his ruling Monday, Judge Lance Walker said the payments will not resume during the ongoing lawsuit by the provider seeking to restore the funds.

One of the duties for National Guard members in Washington will be cleaning up trash around the city, the military task force overseeing all the troops deployed to D.C. said Monday.

The D.C. National Guard posted a video on social media Saturday that showed troops cleaning up an area around a trail. They were shown hauling several garbage bags and cleaning up large amounts of rubber gloves from a park bench.

Officials said the effort is part of a broader “beautification” operation aimed at community restoration and improvement.

Task force officials wouldn't offer details about how often troops have been asked to clean up areas in Washington.

Those rules, broadly, say that while troops can use force, they should do so only “in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm” and “only as a last resort,” the military task force overseeing all the troops deployed to D.C. said Monday.

Troops first began patrolling the streets of D.C. with guns on Sunday -- just days after Defense Secretary Hegseth authorized the move.

The task force has directed questions on why the change was necessary to Hegseth's office. Those officials have declined to answer those questions.

Speaking in the Oval Office Monday, Hegseth said that it was common sense to arm them because it meant they were “capable of defending themselves and others.”

Trump made it a recurring theme on the campaign trail in both 2016 and 2024. 

He has drawn controversial comparisons between the city and war zones like Afghanistan, and in 2017, vowed to “send in the feds” in response to gun violence — a move that came even as the city was experiencing a broader trend of declining violent crime.

Violent crime in Chicago dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. Shootings are down 37%, and homicides have dropped by 32%, while total violence crime dropped by over 22%.

Crime in Chicago also represents persistent, localized challenges, said Kimberley Smith, director of national programs for the University of Chicago Crime Lab. The neighborhoods with the highest homicide rates experience approximately 68 times more homicides than those with the lowest rates.

Smith attributes much of the drops in violent crime to a focus in Chicago on the systemic drivers of violence, rather than the militaristic approach Trump has touted in Washington, D.C. She encouraged more federal investment in researching these types of violence prevention strategies.

“Kind of out of necessity Chicago has become a hub for innovation in gun violence prevention,” she said.

When asked whether he'd be open to sending National Guard troops into Republican-led states and cities with high levels of crime in addition to as Democratic-led states, the president said, “Sure, but there aren't that many of them.”

On the first day of school in Washington D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she sympathized with the dilemma of immigrant parents who may be keeping their children home for fear of being detained or arrested by ICE agents.

“Parents are anxious. We've heard from a lot of them,” Bowser said, following a ribbon cutting ceremony for a newly renovated bilingual middle school. “Parents who need to make adjustments are going to be making adjustments, and that's a sad thing to say. Schools should be safe places.”

As schools opened across the capital city, parental social media groups and listservs were buzzing with reports and rumors of checkpoints and arrests from the hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel who have flooded the city.

Bowser didn't mention Trump by name, but harshly criticized any immigration crackdown that targets school children.

“Any attempt to target children is heartless, is mean, is uncalled for and it only hurts us,” she said. “I would just call for everybody to leave our kids alone.”

As South Korea's president described a prosecutor appointed by his country's National Assembly, Trump interjected, “Is his name Deranged Jack Smith, by any chance?”

Trump called Smith, who led two criminal cases against Trump before he took office for his second term, “a deranged, sick individual.”

“I'm only kidding. Maybe I'm not,” Trump added.

Trump suggested before his meeting with Lee began that a “Purge or Revolution” was taking place in South Korea.

By way of explanation, Lee talked about investigating what he called “turmoil” after former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly imposed martial law and was ousted from office.

A sizeable bruise on Trump's right hand was exposed during his meeting with the South Korean President Lee.

Last Friday, the president's hand was covered with a noticeable splotch of makeup that did not match his skin tone.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Trump's hand bruising is “consistent” with irritation from his “frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.”

Asked about famine in Gaza, Trump talked about Hamas' attack on Israel in October 2023 and about the people still being held hostage by the militant group.

He said the U.S. is spending a lot of money to help feed the hungry in Gaza and that, “I think within the next two to three weeks you're going to have a pretty good conclusive ending.”

President Trump said he would be traveling to China “at some point probably this year” after he said Chinese President Xi Jinping would like him to go to China. 

Trump called the bilateral ties “a very important relationship.” 

“We're going to get along with China,” he said. The two countries are seeking to strike a trade deal, after both sides called a truce in escalating tariffs and export restrictions.

Trump said he's resetting the economic relations with China, referring to his levying tariffs on Chinese goods. 

Since he took office, Trump has levied 54% tariffs across the board on Chinese goods, though his administration has paused 24%, pending final negotiations

In both of his appearances in the Oval Office Monday, Trump has mused about renaming the Department of Defense to its original name, the Department of War. 

The name was changed in 1949.

Trump said the previous name “had a stronger sound” and there might be an update on the potential name change “over the next couple weeks.”

The U.S. president responded to a question about whether he would return to the Demilitarized Zone that separates the Koreas by fondly recalling the last time he did so in 2019.

“Remember when I walked across the line and everyone went crazy?” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon.

He recalled that everyone went crazy, “especially Secret Service.”

But “I loved it,” Trump said. He added that he felt safe because he had a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator.

Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot on North Korean soil in June 2019 during an unannounced trip to the DMZ.

The president suggested that the U.S. should do away with a lease covering a large joint American-South Korean military base.

“I would like to see if we could get rid of the lease, and get ownership of the land where we have a massive military base,” Trump said.

Osan Air Base is a joint U.S. Air Force and South Korean base on South Korea's west coast.

“I don't know that they'll meet, Trump said. “Maybe they will. Maybe they won't.”

Trump last week following his hosting of European leaders and Zelenskyy for talks, as well as speaking by phone with Putin, said that he was arranging direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy that might be followed by three-way talks in which he'd take part.

But Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, made it clear Friday that Putin won't meet with Zelenskyy until the Ukrainians agree to some of Moscow's longstanding demands to end the conflict.

“It takes two to tango. I always say,” Trump said. “And they, should meet, I think, before I have a meeting and probably close the deal.”

While answering a question about the conflict, Trump said “this is a whole new form of war.”

He highlighted to use of flying drones, which have been widely deployed for reconnaissance and weaponry.

“A drone war never existed before,” he said. “We're actually studying it.”

“I would like to ask for your role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula,” President Lee told Trump. He even added that he'd like to see “construction of a Trump tower in North Korea and playing golf.”

Kim added of a possible upcoming meeting between Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, “I believe that he will be waiting for you.”

Trump said he had a very good relationship in his first term with Kim though he also called him “Little Rocket Man.” 

Trump repeated his suggestions that he could soon meet with Kim and suggested he could help work toward peace.

Lee Jae Myung complimented Trump's decorative touches in the Oval Office, to which Trump has added numerous gold accents around the room.

He told Trump the office “looks very bright and beautiful” and has “the dignity of America.”

He also said, “I think America is becoming great again.”

House Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer wrote that the Republican-led committee will probe “disturbing allegations that DC crime data is inaccurate and intentionally manipulated” in a letter to Metropolitan Police Chief Pam Smith.

Comer cited local reports that a police commander for Washington's Metropolitan Police Department was put on administrative leave after allegedly altering some crime statistics. Mayor Muriel Bowser has confirmed there is an ongoing investigation into the incident.

“In light of these reports and a related whistleblower disclosure made to the committee, the committee requests documents and information, as well as transcribed interviews with the district commanders of each of the seven patrol districts,” Comer wrote.

The move comes two weeks after President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency over crime in the nation's capital. More than 2300 National Guard troops have been deployed to the city along with a surge in federal law enforcement agents from the FBI, ICE, DEA and other agencies.

The Justice Department launched its own investigation into DC's crime statistics. Trump and Republicans have cast doubt on those statistics and scrutinized some local policing policies they allege reduced the reports of criminal acts.

The endowment is “updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the Administration Consequently, we are cancelling existing funding opportunities that fall outside these new priorities,” reads an email sent to novelist Marie Myung-Ok Lee, echoing language received by numerous authors who posted emails from the federal agency.

The fellowships were established in 2001 and have been awarded to hundreds of authors, including such prize winners as Jhumpa Lahiri, Andrew Sean Greer and Terrance Hayes. They offer up to $50,000 to fiction and nonfiction writers.

The NEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Like other federal cultural organizations, the NEA has faced cuts in funding and pressure from the Trump administration to emphasize more patriotic themes.

Lee Jae Myung, the new president of South Korea, has arrived at the White House for his meeting with Trump.

He waved to the gathered press as Trump welcomed him on the West Wing driveway.

They are now headed for their meeting at the Oval Office.

Perhaps, the most significant announcement from last week's White House gathering with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leader was Trump affirming that the U.S. would support Europe's security guarantees for Kyiv once the Russian invasion ends.

But Trump said on Monday, “we haven't even discussed the specifics” of just how the U.S. would be involved in assisting a European-led effort. “But we'll be involved, and from the standpoint of backup, we're going to help them.”

Just before wrapping up his comments in the Oval Office, Trump said the administration would soon be reducing drug prices anywhere from 1,000% to 1,500%. He noted that many other countries pay far less for prescription drugs than people do in the U.S. Trump made a similar promise earlier in August.

Drug prices obviously cannot be reduced more than 100%, but experts have told the Associated Press that while the Trump administration has taken steps to lower prescription drug prices, there's no indication costs have dropped such a massive drop.

“I find it really difficult to translate those numbers into some actual estimates that patients would see at the pharmacy counter,” said Mariana Socal, an associate professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University who studies the U.S. pharmaceutical market. She added that Trump's math is “really hard to follow.”

“I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un and North Korea,” Trump told reporters. He even suggested that he had a better relationship with Kim than almost anyone but Kim's powerful sister, Kim Yo Jong.

“A lot of people would say, ‘That's terrible.' No it's good,” Trump added, recalling meeting with North Korea's leader during his first term.

“In fact, some day, I'll see him,” Trump said of a possible second-term meeting with Kim. “I look forward to seeing him.”

Israeli officials say of the 50 hostages still held by Hamas, only about 20 remain alive. The rest were either killed during the October 2023 attack or while in captivity, according to Israeli officials.

But Trump on Monday told reporters that are “probably a little bit less than 20 because I think one or two are gone.”

Trump did not elaborate on what his estimate is based on.

In long comments to reporters, Trump mixed up the name of Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.

“I did a favor for Christie, uh, for Christe Whitman. Uh, Whitmer,” Trump said of the Democratic leader of Michigan.

He was trying to describe an April meeting where Whitmer and the president discussed sparing an Air Force Base in Michigan from being closed.

But the president appeared to be mixing up Whitmer's name with that of Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey.

It was the kind of verbal gaffe Trump routinely says his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, might have made — claiming it was evidence Biden was mentally diminished.

In other comments Monday, Trump suggested Biden “didn't know he was alive” and “didn't know what he was doing.”

In a Truth Social post Monday, the U.S. president blasted critics of the government's new 10% stake in the chipmaker as “stupid,” adding he would make similar deals “all day long.”

Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett signaled the same Monday, telling CNBC that Friday's deal that some conservatives have labeled “socialism” was part of broader strategy of setting up a sovereign wealth fund that would invest in an array of companies.

“I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries,” the National Economic Council director said.

Asked about an overnight Israeli strikes on a hospital in southern Gaza that killed five journalists, including a freelancer who worked for The Associated Press, Trump said initially he wasn't aware the incident before offering: “I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it.”

“And I think he's very bad for votes,” Trump said. He also criticized “liberal courts” for protecting Abrego Garcia, but added, “We have that under control.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi, speaking in the Oval Office at Trump's side, said of Abrego Garcia, “He will no longer terrorize our country.”

“The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be,” Bondi said.

The comments followed Abrego Garcia being detained by immigration authorities to face renewed efforts to deport him.

Trump and members of his administration have made unsubstantiated exaggerations in order to justify bringing the military into Democratic run cities such as Washington and Los Angeles. Here are just a couple examples from today:

Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff on Washington: “You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed or mugged, or wearing their watches again. They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again.”

The administration offered no proof to support these statements.

More than 180 current and former employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency published a letter Monday warning that debilitating cuts to the agency charged with handling federal disaster response risks a catastrophe like the one seen after Hurricane Katrina.

Addressed to the FEMA Review Council and Congress, the letter contains six “statements of opposition” to current policies at FEMA, including a burdensome expenditure approval policy implemented by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem which the signatories say reduces FEMA's ability to perform its missions.

It also critiques a DHS decision to reassign some FEMA employees to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA workforce.

About 140 staff members at the Environmental Protection Agency were placed on administrative leave last month for signing a similar statement.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is applauding the decision to arm National Guard troops deployed to fight crime in Washington.

“It's just common sense to make sure they're armed,” Hegseth said. He added that troops are therefore, “Capable of defending themselves and others.”

Some National Guard units patrolling the nation's capital have started carrying firearms at Trump's direction — a major escalation of his military deployment that makes good on a directive issued late last week by Hegseth.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin is calling on his party to “fight like hell” as he welcomes Democrats from across the nation to the DNC's summer meeting in Minneapolis.

In his welcome address Monday morning, Martin charged that President Trump is dismantling democracy and peoples' lives.

“This is not politics as usual. This is authoritarianism. It's fascism dressed in a red tie,” Martin said. “And all the Democrats throughout this country, we are the only thing standing in his way.”

Martin is focusing his ire on the Republican president, but he's also confronting internal divisions in the DNC's first meeting since he became party chair. His critics believe the party isn't doing enough to push back against Trump.

“I get it. People are pissed off. I'm pissed off,” Martin said Monday morning. “We are still unified despite our differences.”

Vance slammed Democratic governors who've criticized the Trump administration for using National Guard troops to fight crime in big cities, saying “we want people to welcome us, to ask us” for sending in the military.

“They're angrier about the fact the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades,” Vance said of top Democrats.

He said Trump's Washington crackdown meant people who would have been killed are now “living, breathing” and going on with their lives in the nation's capital.

Trump signed the order that charges the Department of Justice with investigating instances of flag burning. Trump said those who burn the United States flag would be charged with inciting a riot and receive one year in jail with no opportunity for early release.

Trump said burning an American flag “incites riots at levels we've never seen before.”

Trump's advisers said the executive order “wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment,” which protects the freedom of speech, but did not expand on what that meant.

The 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson ruled flag burning constitutes “symbolic speech” that's protected by the First Amendment.

Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy breaks down President Donald Trump's latest executive orders and his crackdown on crime as he eyes additional cities on 'Special Report.'

After yet another bloody weekend, some Chicago residents said they would welcome reinforcements if President Donald Trump decides to federalize the police force in Chicago.

Trump first floated the idea on Friday during a press conference in the Oval Office after seeing success with the same effort in Washington, D.C., which went 12 days without a homicide. 

""Chicago's a mess,"" Trump said on Friday, adding that it would ""be our next one after this,"" following the federal intervention in Washington, D.C.

""Chicago's a killing field right now, and they don't acknowledge it,"" he said on Monday. ""And they say, we don't need him.""

LIZ PEEK: TRUMP PRANKS DEMOCRATS INTO OPPOSING SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS CLAIMED TO SUPPORT

Danielle Carter-Walters, a Black woman, is a personal trainer in the city. She is also the co-founder of Chicago Flips Red, a group of Windy City Trump supporters.

""Our communities are out of control. The destruction. The devastation of what's happening. We are being displaced out of our homes by illegal aliens,"" she told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""There's a lot of us, thousands, silently supporting us. People think that Black women can't be MAGA. People are starting to see there's a lot of us.""

Carter-Walters is a resident of the city's Marquette Park neighborhood.

""I stay on the South Side of Chicago,"" she said. ""I'm living the experience. You can't sit in your car without worrying about being robbed, mugged, shot, carjacked. We definitely need something to be done.""

CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PLAN 'MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION'

She's not the only person in favor of federal intervention.

""This is a unique generational opportunity for Illinois and for the city of Chicago, and I think that the politics are getting in the way,"" Aaron Del Mar, the Cook County Republican Party chairman, told NBC Chicago. ""[Chicago Mayor] Brandon Johnson and [Illinois Gov.] J.B. Pritzker should be saying one thing, and that's ‘thank you.'""

Former First Assistant State's Attorney of Cook County Robert Milan is counted among those who support Trump's plan. He recalled efforts under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel to flood high-crime areas with more police and the National Guard. That plan, according to NBC Chicago, worked to reduce shootings in the short term, but federal funding to continue was never granted.

""You would see that in those areas there would be no shootings at all,"" he told the outlet. ""In really, really dangerous areas, right? And we would listen to the gangbangers on wiretaps, and they were saying, ‘We gotta get out of here, police are everywhere, we can't do anything.'""

Meanwhile, Chicago marked another weekend of bloodshed.

Six people were killed, including a 5-year-old boy, and 27 were injured in shootings across the city, according to CBS News.

On Friday night, two men were standing outside when a person approached them on foot, pulled a gun, and shot and killed them, the outlet reported.

On Saturday afternoon, a boy in an apartment was shot in the head, according to CBS. He died shortly thereafter at Comer Children's Hospital.

Former deputy assistant attorney general Tom Dupree discusses the FBI raid on John Bolton's home and reaction to it on 'America Reports.'

The FBI's raid on John Bolton's home and office is tied to an investigation that reaches beyond his controversial book, a source told Fox News Digital, fueling speculation that the former Trump adviser could face criminal charges.

The scope of any potential charges against Bolton, who served under President Donald Trump before falling out of favor with him in 2019, is uncertain, but experts tend to agree that Bolton has some legal exposure.

Prominent D.C.-based attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in national security, said that while there are many unknowns about the Department of Justice's investigation into Bolton, his memoir, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" could be an area of vulnerability for him.

""With respect to Bolton's book, he is potentially vulnerable if he maintains any copies of early drafts which were determined to contain ‘voluminous' amounts of classified information when it was first submitted to the White House for review,"" Zaid told Fox New Digital. ""Those drafts were likely disseminated, per normal course of business, to his literary agent, publisher and lawyer.""

Zaid added that those transmissions could be unlawful under the Espionage Act, a serious set of charges used throughout history to punish spies and leakers of government secrets.

During the first Trump administration, Attorney General Bill Barr opened an investigation into Bolton and brought a civil lawsuit against him over the book days before it was set for release.

The DOJ alleged in the lawsuit that Bolton skipped over normal prepublication review processes and allowed his publisher to move forward with printing a book that contained several passages of classified national security information.

In court papers, Bolton said he did not initially believe his memoir contained classified information, but then he edited some information out of the book after consulting with the National Security Council. Bolton never received a final signoff from the National Security Council before moving forward with publishing. He argued in court papers that the Trump administration's refusal to approve the memoir's contents violated his First Amendment rights and that the National Security Council's review process ""had been abused in an effort to suppress"" the book, which contained harsh criticisms of Trump.

DEMOCRATS OPPOSED JOHN BOLTON FOR YEARS — UNTIL THEY SOUGHT HIM AS AN ALLY AGAINST TRUMP

Judge Royce Lamberth, a D.C.-based Regan appointee, denied the Trump DOJ's request to block publication of Bolton's book because, among several reasons, it had already been exposed to publishers. Still, Lamberth faulted Bolton.

""Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,"" Lamberth wrote in an order at the time. ""He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.""

Lamberth found it was likely Bolton ""jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information"" in violation of various nondisclosure agreements he signed as part of his national security role.

The DOJ never brought charges against Bolton, and the investigation was closed under the Biden administration. The Biden DOJ dismissed the civil lawsuit against Bolton over his book in June 2021.

While Bolton's book controversy has been at the forefront since the raids at his home and office, one well-placed source familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital on Monday the investigation is far more expansive than the book. 

The search warrants, which were authorized by a judge, were based on evidence collected overseas by the CIA, the New York Times reported.

Critics note Bolton is the latest target of the Trump DOJ, which despite pledging to end ""weaponization"" has pursued several of the president's political rivals. The department has launched grand jury probes into New York Attorney General Letitia James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and is examining Obama-era national security officials who Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard says tried to undermine Trump's 2016 victory. Trump has also urged an investigation of former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, citing ""criminal acts"" tied to the George Washington Bridge lane-closure scandal.

Former U.S. Attorney John Fishwick of Virginia suggested the line between honest scrutiny of potential wrongdoing and political revenge has become blurred.

""Trump DOJ targeting enemies of Trump — Letitia James, Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor [Lisa] Cook and now John Bolton. Trump appears to want them harmed for personal/political reasons but if they broke the law are the investigations justified?"" Fishwick told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""That question is putting an incredible stress test on our legal system.""

Zaid noted that Bolton could bring claims of a selective or vindictive prosecution if he were indicted but that those are difficult to prove.

Attorney Jason Kander, an Army veteran and former secretary of state of Missouri, said on the podcast ""Talking Feds"" that even if the DOJ does not secure a conviction against Bolton, the legal process itself is punishment.

""It's not just harassment. It's potential financial ruin,"" Kander said. ""When they come after you like this it doesn't matter if there isn't a scintilla of evidence. It's a minimum half a million bucks in legal fees in a situation like this.""

A major dust storm that rolled over Phoenix, Arizona, on Monday, August 25, impacted visibility and travel conditions. This timelapse was captured by @arizonachef and shows the cloud of dust moving over homes.

A massive dust storm, known as a haboob, overtook the Phoenix metropolitan area on Monday, leaving many without power, grounding flights and blinding drivers.

While dust storms are common in Arizona during the monsoon season, they can strike at a moment's notice. Monday's wall of dust preceded rain in the late afternoon and early evening hours.

A National Weather Service dust storm warning was in effect for the Valley until 5:45 p.m. local time. 

""Be ready for a sudden drop to zero visibility,"" the alert, shared by FOX 10 Phoenix's Nicole Krasean on X said. ""Pull aside, stay alive!""

Anyone driving during dust storms is urged by authorities to pull far off the road, put their vehicle in park, turn off their lights and keep their foot off the brakes so that other drivers will not follow them. 

""I couldn't see my hand in front of my face if I put my hand outside,"" Bernae Boykin Hitesman told the Associated Press. She was driving her children home from school in Arizona City, which is about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix, when it hit.

""I was nervous,"" she said. ""My kids were really, really scared, so I was trying to be brave for them.""

Flights were temporarily grounded at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport as the storm rolled through, and some damage was caused to a terminal roof.

""Crews have been identifying leaks and attempting to clean up water where it has collected in passenger areas,"" Heather Shelbrack, the airport's deputy aviation director for public relations, told the AP.

Phoenix has been drier than usual during the monsoon season, while parts of southeast and north-central Arizona have had a fair amount of rain, Mark O'Malley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix, told the AP.

""But that's typical for a monsoon, very hit and miss,"" he said.

The forecast for metro Phoenix calls for a 40% chance of rain on Tuesday before drying out, O'Malley said.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered a fiery rebuke of President Trump's reported plan to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump as a ""wannabe dictator"" Monday, accusing him of trying to ""occupy"" Chicago with National Guard troops after reports the White House is preparing a possible deployment as soon as September.

The Democrat railed against a Washington Post report detailing the potential move, warning that Trump was escalating rhetoric against Chicago and its leaders over crime. 

""This is exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against,"" Pritzker said at a press conference in front of Trump Tower in downtown Chicago.

‘SLAP IN THE FACE': MAJOR BLUE STATE GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL OPENING FINANCIAL AID TO ILLEGALS

""What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American.""

Pritzker vowed to fight the move in court, accusing Trump of trying to occupy a U.S. city for political gain.

""Go talk to the people of Chicago who are enjoying a gorgeous afternoon in this city… ask if they want their neighborhoods turned into a war zone by a wannabe dictator,"" Pritzker said, flanked by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other local officials. 

""Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish his dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is – a dangerous power grab.""

The Democrat said Trump was trying to militarize a blue state while simultaneously slashing $800 million in federal crime prevention grants. Most of the grants were headed to nonprofits and local community groups, not to police departments or federal law enforcement. 

Pritzker said that crime rates are down in Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, and that Trump's narrative of the city being engulfed in crime is manufactured. 

For instance, he said that murders are down 32% compared to last year and nearly cut in half since 2021.

""You are neither wanted here nor needed here,"" Pritzker added. ""We will see the Trump administration in court. We will use every lever at our disposal to protect the people of Illinois and their rights.""

Hours earlier Trump suggested he would prefer to be ""asked"" before sending troops. He has been floating the idea of deploying the National Guard in Chicago, replicating operations in Washington, D.C., which has also seen the federal government take control of the local police. More than 1,000 arrests have been made and the capital has gone 11 days straight without a homicide, according to the latest figures.

ILLINOIS GOV CALLS FOR MASS PROTESTS AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN: GOP 'CANNOT KNOW A MOMENT OF PEACE'

National Guard units sent without state approval are generally restricted to defending federal property and personnel. When Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles in June over anti-ICE protests, they were confined to federal buildings and escort duties for immigration agents. In Washington, D.C., which is under federal jurisdiction, Guard units have conducted armed patrols alongside local police.

""In a certain way, you really want to be asked to go,"" Trump told reporters, before taking a jab at Pritzker: ""He has to spend more time in the gym.""

Trump continued his attacks on Pritzker and ripped the Windy City's crime record.

""I'm thinking about you know, when I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there. I made the statement that next year be Chicago because, as you all know, Chicago's a killing field right now and they don't acknowledge it. And they say, we don't need him.""

Chicago recorded 573 homicides in 2024, marking the 13th straight year Chicago has led the nation in total murders, according to Chicago Police Department data compiled by Wirepoints.

According to the Council on Criminal Justice's year-end 2024 update, aggravated assaults declined by 4% compared to 2023 but remained 4% higher than in 2019, gun assaults fell 15% though they were still 5% above 2019 levels, and carjackings dropped 32% year-over-year yet were 25% higher than in 2019.

Meanwhile, Johnson echoed Pritzker's defiance, insisting Chicagoans don't want a ""military occupation."" 

""We believe that you don't solve crime by sending in the military,"" Johnson said. ""The last thing that Chicagoans want is someone from the outside of our city who doesn't know our city, trying to dictate and tell us what our city needs.""

Johnson called the plan ""a stunt,"" saying Trump's targeting of Chicago is rooted in racism.

""We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence. We've already tried that, and we've ended up with the largest prison population in the world without solving the problems of crime and violence,"" Johnson said.

""The addiction on jails and incarceration in this country. We have moved past that. It is racist. It is immoral. It is unholy. And it is not the way to drive violence down.""

Fox News' Dana Perino joins 'Fox News Saturday Night' to dish on her new book 'I Wish Someone Had Told Me...' and share what led her to her time as press secretary and later news career.

A couple of weeks ago, I had a creeping worry that I couldn't quite place. I don't typically have anxiety, but something was really bothering me.

I tried to pinpoint it. I ruled out anything to do with health, family, or work. I wasn't under a pressing work deadline, and my to-do list was manageable (shout-out to Kate DePetro for the assistance!).

I wondered if it was just that seasonal back-to-school feeling — what I'd wear on the first day, if I could open my locker without embarrassing myself, and if Tracy and I would be in chemistry class together. But it wasn't that either.

WOMAN FEARED DOGS, THEN BEGAN TREKKING ALL OVER THE WORLD WITH NEWLY ADOPTED PUP

Perhaps it was that some of the leaves on the trees in Central Park were already turning yellow, giving up after a hot summer? Nope — I'm ready for less humidity, cooler temperatures, and football (ha ha, not really).

Finally, I realized what I was concerned about — Percy. Oh, he's fine. He's ""fit as a butcher's dog,"" as my husband Peter says.

Dana Perino and Percy. (Dana Perino)

But it's just that … I'd recently noticed some white hairs on Percy's chin, and I was starting to panic that he was going to be five years old. And, as all dog owners tend to do, I started counting the years. 

Peter and I talk about Percy all the time. He brings us closer together, keeps the mood lighter at home, and makes us live more in the present.

""If he's 5, then we only have, at most, nine more years, and by then I'll be (not saying), and I don't get to see him enough during the week and I'm missing his life,"" and on and on.

""Peter, did you see these white hairs under his chin?"" I asked.

""Yes, but remember, Vizslas go gray early. He's only going to be 4 next month.""

""Wait. He's only going to be 4? Are you sure?""

Peter did some quick math. ""Yes, he was born in 2021. We picked him up that November.""

Relief flooded over me. I felt like I'd won a year's worth of time with him. ""Thank God,"" I said.

And Peter didn't think I was crazy (about that). 

Four years ago, Jasper — ""America's Dog"" — passed away after a quick battle with cancer. It was tragic, and I think about him, and our previous Vizsla, Henry, every single day.

The heartache eases, but I can still immediately be brought to tears when I think of them.

Percy is a worthy successor. He's different from them. He is faster, goofier, and, dare I say, even prettier.

He loves to chase balls and has taught himself to put three to four in his mouth at once.

He takes a stuffed bear to bed every night — the one Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich gave him when he joined our family.

He loves the beach but only to run on it — he won't swim like the ones before him. He hates to be out of his depth. 

Dana Perino's dog Percy frolics in the ocean. (Dana Perino)

It used to bother me, but then I decided it's safer if he stays on shore. In my sight. I can't stop looking at him.

Like the 68 million households in America with dogs, I delight in having a dog in my home. 

Peter and I talk about Percy all the time. He brings us closer together, keeps the mood lighter at home, and makes us live more in the present.

Which is one of the best things about National Dog Day — a reminder of how special these pets are to us and how we must live in the present with them. They're not worried about tomorrow. Or about a few gray hairs. They're fully in the moment — where we should be.

President Donald Trump speaks from the Oval Office, touting his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown and naming Chicago as the next city he plans to clean up.

President Donald Trump wants to drive down crime in some of our most dangerous cities. Democrats are furious, coming down hard — once again — on the wrong side of an issue that affects millions of Americans.

Why would the leaders of high-crime cities like Washington and Chicago object to the president helping to make their streets safer? They are panicked that Trump will succeed, exposing them as the inept, corrupt leaders they truly are.

For decades, Democrats have struggled to overcome GOP accusations that they were ""soft on crime."" In 1994, trying to combat that charge, President Bill Clinton signed into law the most sweeping anti-crime bill in history. It funded the hiring of 100,000 new police officers, authorized the construction of new prisons and introduced a ""three-strikes"" law mandating lengthy jail terms for repeat offenders.

TRUMP'S WEEK SHAPED BY CRIME AGENDA, POTENTIAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO CHICAGO

That was Democrats' high-water mark for cracking down on crime. In recent years, party leaders, including former President Joe Biden, have apologized for the 1994 crime bill, now considered by the left to be racist and overly harsh. Especially in the post-George Floyd era, Democrats have adopted policies such as defunding the police and no-bail reform, which have made our cities more dangerous and favor criminals over citizens.

President Trump is trying to reverse course. He is threatening to send troops to violence-prone cities and has just signed an executive order to eliminate cashless bail, a policy that sends criminals back onto the streets, often to offend again.

Just as they did decades ago, Democrats are walking into a trap, resisting what most citizens applaud. In recent months, they have championed criminals in the country illegally, protested President Trump's deportation policies and now they are opposing safe streets.

It doesn't get dumber than that.

CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD PLAN 'MOST FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION'

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson greeted speculation that President Trump may soon send National Guard troops to the Windy City with an X post calling the move ""the most flagrant violation of our Constitution in the 21st Century."" He further boasted: ""The City of Chicago does not need a military occupation.""

Actually, it does. One headline from this summer says it all: ""At least 55 people shot, 8 fatally, in 4th of July weekend.""

Chicago, once a prosperous and orderly city, has descended into lawlessness, with a murder rate that keeps people sheltering in their homes at night. Though the number of killings has declined this year, Chicago still ranks among the most murder-prone cities in the U.S. By mid-August, Chicago had suffered 254 homicides. In New York City, with a population nearly three times larger, there were only 201 murders in the same timeframe.

During the last mayoral race in 2023, a poll showed that two-thirds of the city's residents didn't feel safe from crime. Asked to rank which issues were most important in choosing the next mayor, 44% said crime and public safety — by far the top issue. The economy and jobs came in at just 12%.

CHICAGO'S CRIME CRISIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE — TRUMP MUST STEP IN NOW

Continuing high crime is one reason polls show Johnson has the lowest approval rating of any mayor in the United States, at 26%. Johnson, two years into the job, is underwater with every racial and income group. Despite making a big show of welcoming illegal immigrants and defying President Trump's ban on sanctuary cities, Johnson is unpopular with Hispanics, earning only 26% approval from that group.

Though he has prioritized programs catering to minority residents, Johnson, who is Black, also falls short with African Americans, of whom only 38% approve of the job he's doing.

Black voters may dislike Johnson because the crime targeted by President Trump occurs mainly in their neighborhoods. The Chicago Crime Lab reports that ""Black residents [are]…22 times more likely to be killed compared to white residents."" They also note, ""neighborhoods with the highest homicide rates experience approximately 68 times more homicides than those with the lowest rates.""

Johnson dismisses concerns about crime and said in an interview with NPR that President Trump sending in the National Guard would be ""not Democratic, illegal, and costly."" He also argued it would not bring Chicago's crime down and touted recent declines in violent offenses in the Windy City.

But across the U.S., crime has dropped from post-pandemic levels; Chicago's gains are not unique. And cities like Washington, Chicago and Baltimore — another possible target mentioned by Trump — are not safe.

Sending in federal troops makes them safer, and it isn't only President Trump who has shown that to be true. In March 2024, New York Governor Kathy Hochul deployed 750 National Guardsmen into New York City's subways to stem a deadly wave of people being pushed in front of trains and other offenses.

Subway crime dropped, and Hochul appears to have no plans to remove the soldiers still patrolling the stations and trains. She explained, ""I think people will tell you … they feel much safer."" No kidding.

That hasn't kept her from criticizing the president, calling his initial deployment of 800 troops into D.C. a show of ""abusive power."" She maintains that her situation was different because she had the cooperation of local officials.

It is true that Washington's Mayor Muriel Bowser has not supported Trump's efforts to bring down crime in the District. In its earliest days, she sounded positive about the beefed-up law enforcement presence, saying, ""What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the federal officers that we have.""

Pushed by political allies to follow the anti-Trump playbook, her optimism evaporated as she urged residents to ""make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push."" An authoritarian push that has seen crime in Washington plummet.

President Trump is betting that the residents of cities plagued by violence and theft will welcome his assault on crime. He's probably right. Democrats should wise up.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Trump fights fire with fire with a burst of DOJ investigations against political foes","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3781939/trump-fights-fire-with-fire-doj-investigations-political-foes/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The Department of Justice is homing in on critics of President Donald Trump and Democratic officials who once made him the subject of their own investigations.

The latest targets include John Bolton, his first-term national security adviser whose house was recently raided, and Chris Christie, the former friend-turned-foe whom the president suggested should be reinvestigated for actions taken when he was New Jersey governor.

The unofficial retribution list for whom Trump's DOJ has placed in its crosshairs extends well beyond the pair, including those like Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), New York Attorney General Letitia James, former President Barack Obama, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump and those supporting him say the actions are warranted to retaliate against the onslaught of “lawfare” he faced during the 2024 campaign. Indeed, the president is making good on a campaign pledge to seek revenge against political enemies that could eventually result in legal punishments.

“Revenge does take time, I will say that,” Trump said during a 2024 campaign interview with Phil McGraw, better known on TV as “Dr. Phil.”

But Trump is also testing whether embracing what critics have assailed as “politically motivated” investigations will quell what his supporters see as unfair political prosecutions in the future, or if it will further erode public confidence in the justice system.

“Joe Biden weaponized his administration to target political opponents — most famously, President Trump,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. “And if that wasn't bad enough, Biden — or whoever was really calling the shots — also used his administration to target everyday Americans who dared express political opinions he disagreed with.”

Jackson, referencing allegations that former President Joe Biden's mental acuity deteriorated as commander in chief to the point he could no longer run the country, cited as evidence Biden DOJ investigations into parents who criticized local school boards and anti-abortion activists jailed for protests at abortion clinics.

“The American people are lucky Biden's shameful chapter of history is closed,” Jackson continued. “President Trump is restoring law and order.”

Trump declined to say on Monday whether more raids of vocal critics like Bolton could be expected and said that the responsibility falls to Attorney General Pam Bondi. Agents last week searched Bolton's Washington, D.C.-area home and office related to classified documents, but it was unclear if the ongoing inquiry into his tell-all book from his time in Trump's first term was connected.

“It already has the absolute aura of being politically motivated,” former DOJ national security prosecutor Joseph Moreno said in an appearance on NBC News. “I hope that's not the case.”

Instead, Trump blamed Democrats for having first weaponized the justice process, in part by raiding his south Florida Mar-a-Lago estate under Biden, which later led to criminal charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents.

“They raided Mar-a-Lago. They started that,” Trump said. “These were bad people that we had in our government.”

Like Bolton, Christie, one of Trump's fiercest opponents, also found himself in the president's crosshairs. On Monday, Trump floated reopening the so-called 2013 “Bridgegate” investigation from Christie's time as governor. The investigation led to the conviction of two Christie allies related to lane closures on the George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey to Manhattan as part of a retaliation scheme against a Democratic mayor. The convictions were overturned in 2020 by the Supreme Court.

“He blamed other people, but he knew all about it. I don't know if they want to look at him; it's not for me. If they want to look at it, they can,” Trump told reporters of the DOJ investigating Christie. “I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.”

Trump cited the lane closures affecting ambulances that were delayed due to traffic.

Other subjects of DOJ investigations include James, the Democratic New York attorney general who's targeted Trump's company; Schiff, a former impeachment manager, for mortgage fraud allegations; and Obama, Brennan, and Comey for the 2016 Russian election interference investigation.

In similar attempts to flex his executive authority, Trump has moved to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations as he criticizes the board for not lowering interest rates. He's also revoked the security clearances for dozens of current and former high-level government officials, including Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.

On Monday, Trump suggested he may extend his power by making Chicago the next city to which he deploys National Guard troops to combat crime, as he did in the nation's capital.

TRUMP SAYS HE KNOWS ‘NOTHING' ABOUT FBI RAID ON JOHN BOLTON'S HOME

Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL), a possible 2028 presidential contender who's increasingly clashed with Trump, said he was “ringing an alarm” about the president's “manufactured” crisis. He condemned the notion of sending military troops into Chicago as an attempt to “intimidate his political rivals.”

“This is exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against, and it's the reason that they established a federal system with a separation of powers built on checks and balances,” Pritzker said. “What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Before he reclaimed the White House, President Donald Trump seemingly spent as much time in courtrooms as he did on the campaign trail as prosecutors and Democrat-aligned attorneys raced to get their cases against him over the finish line before the election. Now, several of those cases remain in legal limbo months into his presidency.

Trump declared a “total victory” last week after an appeals court tossed out a roughly half-billion-dollar fine he faced in his New York civil fraud trial. And the sweeping set of criminal charges and civil judgments that once threatened his fortune and freedom are crumbling in appellate courts — a trajectory some experts say could lead to total exoneration.

“This was a Case of Election Interference,” Trump wrote on Truth Social when a New York appellate court wiped out more than half a billion dollars in penalties tied to Attorney General Letitia James's civil fraud lawsuit. “Every single Dollar was thrown out, even the penalties imposed on us by the Corrupt Judge.” 

While the court did not dismiss every sanction against him, Trump used the ruling to argue that every case brought against him is destined for collapse once higher courts weigh in. Attorneys working on his behalf echoed the same theme. 

“What they've been put through by Letitia James and her office is really, really unfortunate,” Jesus Suarez, a partner at Continental PLLC representing Trump, told the Washington Examiner. “At the end of the day, the President's been vindicated … and the rule of law in this country is stronger because of him and the strength of the entire Trump Organization.”

Trump's latest win does not conclude his legal battles from the 2024 campaign era, but it does mark a turning point. Nearly every case that once threatened his presidency is now tied up in appellate courts or, in the case of federal prosecutions, has been abandoned altogether.

In a long post celebrating the decision, Trump signaled a desire to see additional reversals of negative court rulings he endured before winning the presidency, including a criminal case that resulted in a jury finding him guilty of 34 felony counts and a defamation case from writer E. Jean Carroll that resulted in  millions of dollars in fines after a separate jury found him liable for sexually abusing her in the 1990s.

Here is where Trump's legal cases stand.

Technically, Trump remains a criminal defendant in the racketeering and 2020 election conspiracy case that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, an elected Democrat, brought against him and 18 allies in 2023. The early days of the case produced the president's now-iconic mug shot on Aug. 24, 2023 and touched off the lawfare campaign against the eventual winner of the 2024 election.

The indictment centered around a call Trump placed to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) following his 2020 election defeat to then-candidate Joe Biden, which Willis used as a springboard to claim Trump sought to subvert the election in the state.

But it is extremely unlikely that Trump will ever face a trial while in office. For the remainder of his term, he is protected by the presidency, and afterward he could invoke broad immunity from prosecution under the Supreme Court's 2024 ruling on presidential powers and immunity from prosecution over actions taken while in office.

While Trump is shielded by the presidency, his allies are not. Dozens of Republicans who served as alternate electors, along with senior figures such as former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, and attorney John Eastman, remain under indictment in Georgia and in other state-level cases tied to the 2020 election. Those prosecutions have dragged on slowly, but they remain active — and Trump has no power to pardon or shield his allies in state court.

The prosecution has become one of the most dysfunctional of any against Trump. Willis was disqualified in December 2024 after a state appeals court found she had a conflict of interest due to her romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she appointed. She has appealed that ruling to the Georgia Supreme Court, where the matter has been pending for seven months.

If the high court upholds her removal, the case would be transferred to another district attorney, who could either drop it or revisit Willis's charges. Even if Willis were reinstated, the trial judge would first have to sift through a backlog of motions from more than a dozen defendants trying to dismiss or narrow the charges.

In theory, prosecutors could keep the charges against Trump on hold with the aim of reviving them after he leaves office in 2029. But by then, the evidence would be close to a decade old, and Trump would likely claim immunity under the same Supreme Court precedent that already forced the dismissal of federal charges tied to his 2020 election challenges.

Trump technically became a convicted felon in May 2024 when a Manhattan jury found him guilty on 34 counts of falsifying records connected to a hush money payment. Although Judge Juan Merchan imposed no punishment, the conviction left Trump with a criminal record, which Democrats have touted extensively, as he returned to the White House.

Trump is still trying to erase that outcome. This summer, his lawyers urged a federal appeals panel to transfer the case from state to federal court, citing the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity, which came down after his trial.

Trump's attorney Jeff Wall argued the decision entitled Trump to a federal forum and that some evidence presented at trial should have been excluded under the new immunity standard.

The panel, consisting of two Obama appointees and a Biden appointee, has not yet ruled. If Trump succeeds, the case could eventually land before the Supreme Court, giving him another chance to wipe away his conviction.

A five-judge panel on New York's Appellate Division ruled Thursday that Judge Arthur Engoron imposed excessive fines by ordering Trump to pay a $355 million penalty, which ballooned to almost $500 billion after interest.

The divided panel struck down the financial penalty but upheld Engoron's finding that Trump misrepresented his wealth to banks and insurers, even though there were no corporations or entities involved with Trump's business that were harmed by his business practices.

The appeals court left in place temporary bans preventing Trump and his sons from holding executive roles in their company, though those sanctions can be paused while further appeals play out. James has already appealed to New York's highest court, while Trump's team is expected to ask that court to throw out the entire judgment, including the fraud findings.

Legal experts say the ruling carries significance beyond the financial relief for Trump. Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told the Washington Examiner that Engoron's reputation has taken a blow.

“It's not often where you have a judge in a civil or criminal case who's making these types of determinations — these are jury questions,” Rahmani said. “The fact that he was basically the judge, jury and executioner … and he was overturned on appeal, that does affect his reputation. And [he is] likely going to be overturned again.”

Rahmani also pointed to James's political exposure. “Not only was she unable to get the ball across the finish line here, at least temporarily pending the further appeal, she's facing her own mortgage fraud investigation. So now, instead of being on the offense, she's on the defense,” he said.

Andy McCarthy, National Review columnist and former prosecutor, said the ruling highlights how judicial overreach helped Trump politically.

“[James] lost, but I think Trump is president because of lawfare, and I think this was just one part of an overarching campaign in which Trump actually won sympathy from even people who weren't particularly sympathetic to him,” McCarthy said on Fox News.

McCarthy added that the size of the fines James secured from Trump in relation to what she accused him of doing was glaring, saying, “There was such a ridiculous mismatch between what the penalty was — more than half a billion dollars — and whatever wrong was actually established in the trial, that it had to go.”

He noted that Trump could still prevail further at the New York Court of Appeals, which may examine whether James overstepped by using a consumer-protection statute in an unprecedented way to target sophisticated financial actors engaged in private business.

For now, Trump has been spared from the most punishing financial hit of his career, even as the case remains a live fight on appeal.

In 2019, writer E. Jean Carroll alleged in her memoir that Trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. Trump denied the allegation and publicly attacked Carroll, leading to two separate lawsuits.

In May 2023, a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation, ordering him to pay $5 million. In January 2024, another jury directed Trump to pay Carroll $83.3 million for separate defamatory comments. Trump appealed both cases.

A three-judge panel upheld the $5 million verdict last December, and the full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reconsider the case in June. He can still try to get the Supreme Court to hear his appeal.

Trump's appeal of the larger $83.3 million judgment is still pending. 

Former special counsel Jack Smith brought two criminal cases against Trump: one in Washington, D.C., for his alleged role in trying to overturn the 2020 election, and another in Florida for allegedly retaining classified documents. Both cases were dropped after Trump's reelection in line with Justice Department policy barring criminal prosecutions of sitting presidents. 

Those dismissals make it unlikely either case will return before Trump leaves office, if ever.

The appellate courts now hold the future of Trump's legal battles in their hands. His victory in the civil fraud case showed that sanctions imposed in trial courts can be pared back or eliminated altogether, giving him fresh momentum as he seeks to undo the remaining judgments.

Rahmani said Trump's record so far reflects a mix of aggressive strategy and favorable timing. “Trump's lawyers masterfully used procedure in D.C. to get stays, to get delays … to run out the clock in that case until he was reelected,” he said, pointing to the dismissal of Smith's federal cases.

NEW YORK APPEALS COURT TOSSES LETITIA JAMES'S $515 MILLION TRUMP FRAUD PENALTY

“In Fulton County in Georgia, they went on the offense. They put DA Fani Willis on the run,” he said. “Really the only loss for Trump per se was Alvin Bragg in New York, but even then, even though he got those 34 felony counts, there was no sentencing, Trump was discharged. That record has allowed Trump to cast his courtroom fights as part of a broader comeback story, one that he aims to make a clean sweep so long as an appeal remains at his disposal.”

“So it really seems like a clean sweep, aside from being a convicted felon for the current president,” Rahmani added.

Gov. JB Pritzker (D-IL) warned President Donald Trump against sending the National Guard to Chicago.

Speaking to reporters in Chicago on Monday, Pritzker railed against Trump's proposal to use the National Guard the same way he'd used it in Washington, D.C., arguing that such a deployment wasn't needed.

“We have crime like other cities do, but let's be clear, we are actually in better shape than the 30 biggest cities across the United States,” he argued. “It's important to understand that the president of the United States is doing this for theatrics.”

“Calling the military into a U.S. city to invade our streets and neighborhoods and disrupt the lives of everyday people is an extraordinary action, and it should require extraordinary justification,” Pritzker continued.

He then gestured to his immediate surroundings, implying that the peaceful atmosphere of Chicago's riverwalk was unanimous throughout the city.

“Does this look like an emergency?” Pritzker said.

He said Trump hadn't reached out to coordinate any such deployment.

“No one from the White House or the executive branch has reached out to me or to the mayor,” Pritzker said. “No one has reached out to our staffs. No effort has been made to coordinate or to ask for our assistance in identifying any actions that might be helpful to us.”

The Illinois governor also dabbled in popular Democratic speculation that Trump's mental faculties were slipping, replicating Republican attacks against former President Joe Biden's cognitive state. Pritzker had used the same attack angle during the 2024 campaign, often countering Trump's criticism of Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris's mental state by claiming he was projecting.

PRITZKER SAYS TRUMP ‘NOT IN GOOD SHAPE' AFTER NATIONAL GUARD THREATS: ‘TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE'

Trump has long derided the state of Chicago, complaining of its Democratic administration and crime. He took his criticisms one step further on Friday, saying the city was “a mess” and might require the use of active-duty troops.

“We'll straighten that one out,” Trump said, adding that after Washington, D.C., “I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Antisemitism has become a raging problem in the West. You can see it online, where there is an abundance of conspiracy theories about Jewish people. It's at protest rallies and in our elite institutions.

In July, Claire Shipman, Columbia University's acting president, announced that the university would take steps to combat antisemitism on campus. In a message to the community, Shipman promised that Columbia would make reforms.

“In a recent discussion, a faculty member and I agreed that anti-Semitism at this institution has existed, perhaps less overtly, for a long while, and the work of dismantling it, especially through education and understanding, will take time,” she wrote.

One book that Shipman can put on the syllabus is Sarah Hurwitz's new release, As a Jew: Reclaiming Our Story from Those Who Blame, Shame, and Try to Erase Us, a timely and important book.

Hurwitz is known publicly as a speechwriter for both of the Obamas. Hurwitz grew up in a “culturally Jewish” home in Massachusetts, but her parents weren't religious, even if they sent Sarah to Hebrew school. Hurwitz maintained this loose relationship with her faith until, at 36 and the height of her career, she attended an Introduction to Judaism class. That course changed her life. She found in Judaism a wisdom and a tradition that she had never appreciated. Hurwitz's first book, Here All Along: Finding Meaning, Spirituality, and a Deeper Connection to Life – in Judaism (After Finally Choosing to Look There), about her rediscovery of Judaism, was published in 2013.

As a Jew is the follow-up. It is a much more intense book than its predecessor. Hurwitz is angry about the antisemitism that has risen in recent years. In 2021, during “yet another iteration of the Israel–Gaza conflict” and with “Hamas launching rockets at Israel and Israel responding with air strikes,” Hurwitz was appalled by what she read online: “As I scrolled through social media posts declaring that Israelis are Nazis and ‘Zionism = Racism,' I was struck by how many of these posts were coming from progressive voices, people I thought of as being on my ‘side.' None of this was new. It had been bubbling beneath the surface for years.”

As one would expect from a book written by a speechwriter, Hurwitz has a way with words. Here she is describing how modern liberalism can't compare to religious tradition: “Severed from my roots, the closest I came to meaning and spirituality was a collection of social justice slogans and self-help clichés, a convenient mash-up of Democratic politics and ‘being a good person' filtered through the ‘you do you' creed of modern life. Knowing much about how to be accomplished, but little about how to be good, I skimmed the surface of my life while building my résumé.”

Hurwitz traces modern antisemitism back not only to Adolf Hitler but to the Soviet Union. Communists didn't like the fact that Jews had a tradition going back thousands of years, a threat to communism's “Year Zero” plans to start history anew. Hurwitz quotes historian Izabella Tabarovsky, who observed that Soviet propaganda denouncing “Zionism” reached people across the Muslim world and in Africa. The result, Tabarovsky concludes, was a rebrand of Zionism from a movement for national self-determination to “a racist, fascist, Nazi-like, genocidal, imperialist, colonialist, militarist and apartheid-promoting conspiratorial ideology.”

Today, antisemitism can be found on the Right and the Left, and particularly on college campuses. For a Democrat such as Hurwitz, seeing students at America's elite institutions rage against Jewish people is heartbreaking. “I now understood how the story of Zionism has been stolen and rewritten by others such that it is no longer about a people who rejected their role as history's scapegoats and rose up to claim safety, autonomy, and power in a state of their own,” she writes. “Instead, it has been turned into a story about a people who epitomize the worst evils of humankind, all of which are embodied in their state, the very founding of which was a sin.”

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAKES HEADWAY IN CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM LEGAL FIGHTS

If I have any criticism of As a Jew, it's that Hurwitz doesn't address the ways that Jews in America have profoundly enriched our culture. From Bob Dylan to Superman, Annie Leibovitz to Mel Brooks, Mad magazine to Philip Glass, Jews have helped create modern America.

In the end, Hurwitz laments that many Jewish people let others write their history. Hurwitz now reflects that her early detachment from her faith “was the product of two thousand years of antisemitism and two hundred years of efforts by Jews to erase parts of ourselves and our tradition in the hope of being accepted and safe. My Jewish identity back then was not empowering. It was humiliating. As I came to understand the various forces that had turned me against my own tradition, I came to see the ways in which I have been complicit in this process. And in addition to grief, shame, and anger, I feel something else: compassion. Compassion for my ancestors.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Flush with cash and soaring with hubris, Trump appointees are supersizing ICE.

In a video produced by the Department of Homeland Security this month, two tricked-out ICE vehicles roll around on the National Mall to “Toes” by rapper DaBaby: “My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (uh, brr) / Said if I leave her, she gon' die / Well … you done with life.”

The vehicles feature a new ICE logo and DEFEND THE HOMELAND in block letters, painted in a color scheme similar to the president's private plane. The Lincoln Memorial zips by and DaBaby continues: “Better not pull up with no knife / 'Cause I bring guns to fights.” There's the White House, the Washington Monument, the U.S. Capitol. On the tinted glass of the pickup, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP is stenciled in all caps, like a production credit.

“What I look like with all this money?” DaBaby asks, more of a taunt than a question.

The 29-second spot—shared on social media earlier this month with the caption “Iced Out” and a freezing-face emoji—treats ICE's new taxpayer-funded fleet like flashy bling, but it's a proclamation that the president's mass-deportation campaign is entering a swaggering new phase. For many longtime Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and agency veterans, the video epitomizes the transformation of ICE from an agency focused on legalistic immigration procedures into a political instrument and propaganda tool.

Most ICE officers and agents prefer to work in plain clothes, focus on finding immigrants who are known criminals, and keep a low profile, especially in major U.S. cities where they are loathed by many, and where some activists use crowdsourcing apps to report their whereabouts in real time. Driving around in “wrapped” vehicles not only blows their cover; it potentially makes them a target for protesters, vandals, and attackers, agency veterans told me.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her small cadre of loyal aides have been pushing the agency to do more showy operations in Democratic-run cities that can advance the president's agenda—and supply clips for social media and the MAGA faithful. “They love this cowboy shit,” one frustrated ICE official told me.

Rather than pursue time-consuming hunts for “the worst of the worst,” officers are conducting roundups and setting up checkpoints to grab people from their vehicles. Trump officials now want everyone to know ICE is here. The publicity campaign, including the new vehicle design and social-media videos, has been pushed by DHS political appointees in their 20s who have been given positions of power at ICE, according to three agency officials I spoke with who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an email that ICE “finally has the money to grow its workforce to support ICE's mission” as a result of the “Big Beautiful Bill” Trump signed last month. The bill flooded ICE with $75 billion in new funding to spend over the next few years. The agency has an annual budget of about $8 billion. With the money comes a sense of urgency that pervades ICE headquarters, and officials are scrambling to spend quickly, expand aggressively, and take an even more confrontational approach with critics and opponents. Pressure from the White House—including daily conference calls with Stephen Miller—remains constant.

Trump loves ICE. Its workforce has never been so miserable. 

ICE aims to more than double the number of deportation officers on U.S. streets by the end of 2025. The slick cars and the bouncy rap tracks are recruitment tools, they say, along with a “Join ICE” website and an ad blitz using 1940s-style Army posters, many with Uncle Sam, to depict Trump's deportation campaign as a patriotic war effort, akin to fighting the Nazis. Many of the new hires will enter ICE with different motivations than the generations before them, seeing the position not as a federal-law-enforcement career but as a chance to serve as a foot soldier in Trump's mission to bring sweeping social and demographic change.

New deportation officers at ICE used to receive about five months of federal-law-enforcement training. Administration officials have cut that time roughly in half, partly by eliminating Spanish-language courses. Academy training was shortened to 47 days, three officials told me, the number picked because Trump is the 47th president. DHS officials said the training will run six days a week for eight weeks.

Trump took office promising millions of deportations a year, a goal so unrealistic that it has doomed career officials at ICE to a perpetual state of missing expectations and constant worry about getting fired. Miller, who specializes in making federal policy out of Trump hyperbole, has tried setting quotas, telling ICE to make 3,000 immigration arrests a day. The agency continues to come up short. Noem has reshuffled ICE's top leaders and forced out others, criticizing them for not delivering what the president wants.

It's not for lack of effort. ICE arrests in U.S. cities and communities have jumped fourfold under Trump, the latest government data show. More than 59,000 detainees are in custody across the country and facing deportation, a record, and Trump's funding bill has given ICE $45 billion to expand detention capacity to more than 100,000 beds. The agency is on track for about 300,000 deportations during the 2025 fiscal year, which ends next month. That would be the highest level in at least a decade.

The new hiring push is preparing ICE for the next phase of Trump's deportations, targeting major U.S. cities that have “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation between police and federal immigration authorities. Trump officials have targeted some of those cities—especially Los Angeles, and now Washington, D.C.—but ICE still doesn't have the staffing to carry out the kind of roundups Miller has been pushing for.

Stephen Miller triggers Los Angeles

Noem and Corey Lewandowski, the Trump-world fixture who is Noem's confidant and unofficial chief of staff, have spent the past few months tightening control over ICE through their top appointee, Madison Sheahan, the agency's deputy director. Sheahan worked as an aide to Noem in South Dakota, and she was running the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries when Noem installed her at ICE in March, initially trying to make her the agency's top official. Other administration officials objected, and Todd Lyons, a veteran ICE official, has remained in the acting-director role.

Sheahan, whose job consists of running ICE's “day-to-day operations,” according to her official bio, has alienated many career officials who dislike being bossed around by a 28-year-old who has never worked in immigration enforcement. Eight current and former officials told me that Sheahan affects a brusque, bruising personal manner that they believe she deploys to compensate for her lack of law-enforcement credentials.

“They put her in there because she has a very, very close connection to the secretary, to be her eyes and ears and keep watch on what's going on,” one official told me. “She's been demanding a gun and a badge constantly, even though she's never gone through any training or done anything to earn those things.”

Sheahan has been thrust into a role she's not ready for, one official said. “When you start from a position of weakness, you have to do things outside of the comfort zone to make it seem like you have authority,” the official told me. There are new framed photos of Sheahan participating in ICE raids hanging outside the executive suites on the 11th floor of the agency's headquarters, along with photos of Noem, but few of ICE acting director Todd Lyons, two officials told me.

In recent weeks ICE officials have been working out an arrangement that would grant Sheahan limited customs-inspection authority to give her a firearm she could carry inside federal buildings, three officials told me.

McLaughlin said Sheahan does not have a service weapon, and has not sought one. “These attacks on Madison Sheahan's leadership style have no basis in reality and are rooted in sexism,” McLaughlin wrote. “Madison Sheahan is a work horse, strong executor, and accountable leader.”

Sheahan and Lewandowski accompany Noem when she travels, including during trips to South America. Allegations of an extramarital affair have dogged Lewandowski and Noem for years, and their purported romance is treated at ICE and DHS as an open secret, according to nine current and former officials I spoke with. Lewandowski and Noem have denied the rumors. In April, The Daily Mail published photos of Lewandowski leaving Noem's condo building with a duffel bag over his shoulder, and The Washington Post reported this month that Noem has been living rent-free for the past several months in a waterfront residence typically occupied by the top Coast Guard commander. DHS said Noem moved there after the Daily Mail article compromised her safety.  “This Department doesn't waste time with salacious, baseless gossip,” McLaughlin said of the alleged affair.

Some White House officials have grown tired of Lewandowski's presence at DHS, where he is a “special government employee” without a formal job. The frustration has been compounded by a new DHS directive requiring Noem to personally sign off on all DHS contracts over $100,000. Four people told me that the requirement has led to a backlog of delays and missed payments to longtime vendors, and Lewandowski, whose temporary job does not require him to file public financial disclosures, has been acting as a gatekeeper. McLaughlin defended the practice and claimed that the extra oversight has saved billions of dollars.

Corey Lewandowski is too controversial—even for Trump

Several of the current and former officials I spoke with are conservative lifelong cops who believe deeply in immigration enforcement and the role of ICE. They told me they worry that a historic chance to reform the agency will be squandered by incompetence and shady deals with well-connected contractors.

The money provided by Congress “is meant to make up for decades of underfunding,” one career ICE official told me, “and now it will be blown on ridiculousness rather than real improvements that could truly change the way immigration enforcement is conducted.”

California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Noem on Thursday asking for a full accounting of Lewandowski's tenure at DHS and his role in decision making and contacting deals, as well as his communications with lobbying firms and outside consultants.

“It is deeply concerning that DHS may be allowing a temporary appointee to function as a senior executive without proper appointment, ethics restrictions, transparency or oversight,” Garcia wrote. Several officials have described Lewandowski's influence over personnel and funding decisions as “far-reaching and unchecked,” he added.

One recent ICE appointee is Chad Kubis, a 26-year-old graphic designer and Liberty University graduate who made promotional videos and ran social-media accounts for Noem when she was the governor of South Dakota. Kubis, who is close to Sheahan, is working on designs to paint the new ICE vehicles. The vehicles and wrappings cost about $100,000 each, contracting records show. ICE plans to wrap at least 2,000 more vehicles, officials told me.

Two officials I spoke with said the marked vehicles can be useful in some circumstances. If a vehicle with the ICE logo shows up and prompts someone to run away, it would give officers the “reasonable suspicion” requirement needed to justify chasing them down, detaining them, and checking their immigration status. McLaughlin said the marked ICE vehicles are “no different from police vehicles,” and won't jeopardize the ICE workforce.

In addition to the sleek new fleet, Trump officials are reaching back in history to find imagery that they hope will attract a new generation of ICE officers. Trump officials have repurposed U.S. propaganda posters from the 1930s and '40s that Franklin D. Roosevelt created to fight fascism. AMERICA NEEDS YOU, reads one poster that originally showed Uncle Sam trading his top hat for a factory-worker cap but now features him in an ICE hat. Another image shows him with rolled sleeves and an eagle on his shoulder, marching toward a signing bonus. DEFEND YOUR COUNTRY, it says.

The hype man of Trump's mass deportations 

Some posters, though, go considerably further. On one, taken from an image promoting Roosevelt's New Deal that shows Uncle Sam standing at a crossroads, DHS's social-media account added the caption “Which way, American man?” It's a reference to the title of a canonical text for neo-Nazis and white nationalists, the 1978 book by William Gayley Simpson, Which Way Western Man?, which depicts Jews, Black people, and nonwhite immigrants as an existential threat to the United States. As Uncle Sam scratches his head in the new ICE-recruitment poster, signs in one direction point to HOMELAND, SERVICE, and OPPORTUNITY. In the other direction, INVASION and CULTURAL DECLINE.

Trump officials have insisted for months that the goal of their immigration-enforcement campaign is to protect Americans from criminals and gang members, not to change American culture. But the posters suggest otherwise. “A U.S. government agency should not resort to using such language and imagery for any purpose, let alone recruiting people to serve,” the Anti-Defamation League said in a statement.

The post has gathered nearly 6 million views on the Department of Homeland Security's X account. Asked about white nationalist messaging, McLaughlin said such concerns were “tiresome.”

“Under the Biden administration, America experienced radical social and cultural decline,” she said. “Our border was flung wide open to a horde of foreign invaders and the rule of law became nonexistent.”

Rapid growth is not the only purpose of the ICE-recruitment effort. Trump officials want to change the agency's character by flooding it with new hires who are inspired by MAGA ideology rather than by the typical perks of a federal badge. DHS says its recruitment drive has already generated more than 115,000 applications for about 11,000 positions. ICE is preparing to spend $40 million over the next several months to draw even more applicants.

ICE currently has about 5,700 deportation officers, and the administration wants to add 8,000 more by the end of the year through its shortened training courses and by offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 and eliminating long-standing requirements, including getting rid of age limits and lowering the minimum age for applicants to 18. “We're taking father/son bonding to a whole new level,” DHS declared on X with a poster showing two generations of men in military tactical gear.

The terrible optics of ICE enforcement are fueling a backlash

One ICE official briefed on the hiring plan said that the agency had already sent out about 300 offer letters to recent retirees, who would be able to continue to collect their retirement benefits while drawing a salary. ICE wants to solicit as many retirees as possible, because they can be quickly recertified with online courses and don't need additional training.

ICE officials told me that they're also targeting law-enforcement officers already employed by federal, state, and local governments. These recruits can be trained mostly through online courses, and won't need the firearms and tactical courses normally required of new hires.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said “no subject matter has been cut,” and ICE trainees will “still learn the same elements and meet the same high standards ICE has always required.”

The last group—applicants with no police experience—could include candidates as young as 18. Lyons, the acting ICE director, traveled to Georgia last week to swear in the 59-year-old Lois & Clark actor Dean Cain, and the agency is preparing to make commemorative Superman coins with his likeness, one official told me.

Current and former ICE officials I've known for years told me they have little confidence that the hiring surge will be carried out responsibly and raise the professionalism of the agency workforce. “They're opening it up to everyone who wants to get a badge and a gun,” one veteran official told me.

“We have had enough problems trying to clean up the workforce to make us a really viable law-enforcement organization and get a smarter, stronger, more mature workforce that isn't gonna make mistakes on the street,” the official said. “And now? You're gonna get a lot of people who are just power hungry and want authority.”

The spaces were once furnished by scrappy kids. Then the adults entered the room.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

My first college dorm, which I moved into in August 1995, was a cobbled-together mess. I had a tiny budget, and my parents' contributions were limited to some paper goods and the ubiquitous bed-in-a-bag. So my roommate and I had to get scrappy. We filled the room with odds and ends we had made and scavenged from home: denim and preppy-plaid blankets, a batik wall hanging, tie-dyed curtains, and—the space's focal point—a faded brown-and-gold love seat from my roommate's basement, where it had been the site of family movie nights and dog naps since the '70s.

As I've dropped my own kids off at college over the past several years, I've encountered a strikingly different scene. My fourth son Owen's freshman move-in day last year was a tightly engineered process in which parents dutifully schlepped a carload's worth of expensive-looking loot into dorms. Walking down the hall, I saw well-curated rooms coming together with lots of parental assistance. Online, Facebook groups such as “Dorm Room Mamas” and “Dorms on a Dime,” which collectively have hundreds of thousands of followers, are filled with photos featuring coordinated bedding, matching desks and bedside tables, tasteful rugs, and neon name signs—most no doubt paid for by parents. I'd read about the trend of parents hiring interior decorators to create high-end dorms but had assumed that practice existed only for the one percent.

Although the rooms I saw on Facebook may have been extreme, elaborate dorms do seem to be growing more common. This year, the National Retail Federation projects that American families will spend $12.8 billion on college-residence furnishings, up from a projected $6.7 billion in 2019. The jump isn't just due to individuals spending more, an NRF spokesperson told me; a greater number of people are also choosing to buy dorm decor in the first place. Gone are the days when most students pieced together secondhand finds from the side of the road and parents' basements, or lived in more spartan spaces. The era of peak dorm decor is here.

In part, this shift can be chalked up to the visual- and envy-driven world that social media has ushered in. Even if my roommate and I had felt moved to snap a photo of our dorm, whom would we have shared it with? Smart marketing from the companies selling dorm supplies most likely plays a role too. Stores such as Target and Walmart, which didn't have a dorm category at all when I was growing up, now have whole displays devoted to the gear. It also probably helps that, for many parents, the project is an easy sell. Small-space decorating involves much of the fun and excitement of a renovation with little of the hard, tedious work, Gretchen Rubin, who has written about life after kids leave home, told me. Compare this with an at-home endeavor, where parents may be thinking, Okay, I gotta clear out 30 years of clutter before I can use this room, Rubin said, and the appeal is obvious.

And then, of course, there's the influence of intensive-parenting culture, which typically demands that parents spend more on and do more for their kids. “We raise the bar, raise the bar, raise the bar for parents,” Asha Dornfest, the author of the Substack newsletter Parent of Adults, told me. Expectations “ratchet up in high school,” when many parents help with the college process, she said. A growing number of parents are entwined in their adult children's life as well. Seen in this light, it's perhaps obvious why many take an active role in college move-in.

On the surface, it may seem harmless for parents to help out. The adults get to enjoy furnishing the space, and kids most likely appreciate the hand. “ Who doesn't want free, nice stuff?” Ken Ginsburg, a pediatrician and the author of Lighthouse Parenting: Raising Your Child With Loving Guidance for a Lifelong Bond, told me. But too much interference comes with definite downsides. For one, if parents are making the design decisions, young adults can miss out on the opportunity to express themselves, by themselves. Jessica Lahey, the author of The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed, explained to me that “when parents impose their tastes and their wishes” on a room, it can dampen “kids' yearning to start living their own life.”

Parents getting overly involved can also rob emerging adults of an opportunity to develop autonomy. “College is not just about academics or the vocational side of things. It's about becoming a psychologically independent person,” Laurence Steinberg, the author of You and Your Adult Child: How to Grow Together in Challenging Times, told me. Parents can stymie that growth. “The more things you do for your child,” Steinberg said, “the fewer things he can do for himself.” Robbed of this agency, even in small ways, kids can start to lose confidence. Ginsburg said that although an adult child will probably appreciate a dorm decked out on Mom and Dad's dime, they still might internalize the message I don't think you could have done this on your own.

Most kids could set up a room without their parents. A Pinterest-ready aesthetic isn't a prerequisite for academic or social success. And students tend to live in the room for less than a year. Come summer, every mini-fridge hauled up the stairs and every hook adhered to the wall must come back down and out the door again—until students return the following year and get to try something new. The dorm room, in this way, is the ultimate blank canvas on which a young adult can paint themselves a new identity, and the perfect place for parents to practice letting go.

Plus, students may learn something from decorating on their own. Sourcing secondhand furnishings requires ingenuity that may serve them well in other arenas. Negotiating with a roommate about which posters to hang can help them work on compromise. That process tends to be easier when students arrive at move-in on similar footing. It gets a lot more complicated when “one student has a professional decorator,” Rebekah Peeples, an associate dean at Princeton University, told me, “and their roommate is a low-income student who only has the essentials.”

Granted, most parents aren't hiring professional designers; they're just trying to prepare their kids as best as they can while facing down what, for many, will be their longest stretch of life apart from their child. Fixing up dorms may be one way some of them are tempering the anxieties that naturally come along with this transition. In the “Dorm Room Mamas” Facebook group, sandwiched among the photo ops, plenty of parents shared deeper concerns. One member sought suggestions for a small, inconspicuous safe for stashing prescription medications; another asked if her daughter's sudden anger and attitude before move-in was normal. Their devotion to interior design might have surpassed mine, but their care for their kids was relatable.

Luckily I haven't yet had to fully face the monster of modern dorm decor. When my adult sons headed off to school, they weren't too worried about what their space would look like. Their dad and I sprang for basic bedding, towels, a shower caddy, and a starter supply of toiletries but left decor choices mainly up to them. If and when my 16-year-old daughter heads off to college in a couple of years, I expect I may be under a little more pressure. But in that scenario, I'm planning to do us both a favor: I'll mostly opt out.

The state is ever more insistent on a reality at odds with people's experience. That's not a good sign for progress.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Labubu appears to be yet another sign of China's global success. Figurines of the grinning, pointy-eared elf, marketed by a Chinese company called Pop Mart, are so wildly popular that fans around the world go to great lengths to get their hands on them. Many of them come in “blind boxes,” meaning that the consumer gets to see the contents only after purchase. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua boasted in mid-June that the Labubu craze “signals a broader shift in China's role on the global stage”: The country is becoming a cultural center.

At home, however, the Chinese Communist Party is working to dampen the enthusiasm. A June article in its main newspaper, the People's Daily, criticized the “out of control spending” on blind boxes and similar products among minors who are “irrational” in their decisions and called for tighter regulation to prevent such objects from becoming “tools to exploit children's wallets.”

Blind boxes are but one cultural trend to incur the party's ire. In recent years, Chinese authorities have gone after video games and K-pop, comedy clubs and Halloween parties, gay and lesbian activists and women's-rights advocates, tech entrepreneurs and financial advisers. The incessant crackdowns, and the campaigns of censorship or censoriousness, suggest that the Chinese regime is intent on not just eliminating opposition, but also micromanaging its people's lifestyles, consumption, and beliefs.

From the June 2024 issue: The new propaganda war

That China under Communist rule is not an open society is hardly a surprise. But before Xi Jinping became the country's leader, the ruling establishment operated with some constraints. Now David Shambaugh, the director of the China-policy program at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs, describes China's political environment as “neo-totalitarian,” meaning that the state has taken a heavy hand “across the board and in all aspects of the lives of the nation.”

The turn comes at a moment when many outside the country perceive it to be on a trajectory of ascent toward possible global dominance. A recent op-ed in The New York Times declared that the long-anticipated “Chinese century,” when the center of global power switches from Washington to Beijing, “may already have dawned.” Inside China, however, the country often seems to be not taking over the world so much as sinking into an autocratic abyss. Maybe these trends can coexist, and China can continue rising globally while deepening its domestic repression. But another trajectory seems just as likely—that an oppressive state will curtail China's vitality and place a hard limit on its global rise.

This past November, in the town of Zhuhai, in southern China, a man named Fan Weiqiu got into his car and plowed into a crowd at a sports center, killing 35 people and injuring 43. Apparently distraught over a divorce settlement, the 62-year-old Fan was found inside the car with severe self-inflicted knife wounds to his neck.

The incident immediately became a political problem. Such a tragedy should never have happened in the happy, harmonious society that Xi claims to have created, free of the violence and divisions that plague other, inferior countries. China's vast security state quickly got to work making sure it hadn't: Censors scrubbed videos, articles, and comments about the incident from social-media platforms. Workers at the sports center cleared away the bouquets of flowers that mourning residents had laid there. Police chased off curious visitors. Fan was executed two months later.

Disappearing inconvenient truths has always been a feature of Communist rule in China. In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer and the family visit Beijing, and as they pass through Tiananmen Square, they find a plaque that reads On this site, in 1989, nothing happened. But Xi has lately taken his efforts to convince people that they live in a socialist utopia to a new extreme.

The Chinese people are content, the state's propaganda organs insist, as they feed the public good news and suppress discussion of the country's many economic and social problems. The result is a surreal environment, where public discourse is ever more detached from everyday life, and the government is ever less responsive to the concerns and difficulties of its people.

At the same time, the state intrudes more and more into daily life. My wife and I have experienced this directly. Over the past year, teams of police have made regular visits to our Beijing apartment—four of them just this month. Officers check our passports and visas while recording the interaction with small video cameras. We have already provided this information to the police, as required by local regulations; these repetitive visits are likely meant simply to intimidate.

The resulting atmosphere is a throwback to an earlier era of Chinese Communist rule, before the economic-modernization program of Deng Xiaoping. In 1978, as party leader, Deng inaugurated liberalizing reforms with a speech calling upon his fellow cadres to “emancipate our minds.” Deng did not intend China to become a free society. He made that clear with the Tiananmen massacre. But his approach did open safe spaces for debate and personal expression, especially in areas perceived as more pragmatic than political, such as the economy. This relative relaxation was crucial to China's rise, as it helped the country's leaders formulate policy and stoke entrepreneurship.

Today's Chinese leadership seems intent on winding these developments backwards. In a speech published earlier this year, Xi said he aimed to “ensure that the entire population is grounded in a shared ideological basis for unity.” Minxin Pei, an expert on Chinese politics at Claremont McKenna College, put a finer point on the Chinese leader's motivations, suggesting to me that for Xi, “the loss of control over ideology, the loss of control over society” present “the primary threats to the Chinese Communist Party's hold on power.”

Xi has been reasserting that control by steadily eliminating safe spaces for expression. He has enforced the study of his own philosophical ideas, known as Xi Jinping Thought, and constrained public debate on national issues. What was politically tolerated just a few years ago no longer is. The artist Gao Zhen, famous for his depictions of Mao Zedong, the Communist regime's founder, was detained last year, and the authorities confiscated several of his works that had been created more than a decade earlier. Censors remove from social media not only criticism and politically sensitive material, but even accounts and posts deemed too pessimistic.

One reason for the suppression may be that China has a good deal of bad news to disappear. Xi's predecessors could tout the country's rapid economic progress, but this ready source of political legitimacy has been evaporating, as growth has slowed and jobs are harder to find. Improving China's economic outlook would likely require more liberalizing reforms. Xi has resisted them, probably because they would weaken his grip on society by expanding the power of a wealthy middle class. China's leaders “may be fearful of creating a monster they cannot control,” the Yale University economist Stephen Roach told me.

Instead, Chinese propaganda asserts that the economy is fine. Unflattering data and reports by prominent economists vanish from the internet. State media avoid reporting on the cost to Chinese factories of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and when they do acknowledge it, they tend to add a positive spin. Indeed, Cai Qi, a member of the party's powerful Politburo, has urged officials to “sing loudly” about China's bright economic prospects.

A chasm has opened, as a result, between the experiences of Chinese citizens and the government's response. Chinese college graduates struggle to find jobs; the government, rather than reaching for policies to address their predicament, first suspended the release of unemployment statistics for the nation's young workers in 2023, then rejiggered the method of calculating them to produce a lower figure.

But the Chinese public isn't so easily fooled. In recent weeks, social-media users expressed nostalgia for the boom times by posting photos and videos of celebrities from the 2000s and commenting on both their fashion and the better opportunities available back then. These posts implicitly criticize the government by puncturing its narrative of economic progress. A recent paper by the scholars Michael Alisky, Martin King Whyte, and Scott Rozelle cited surveys conducted in China in which only 28 percent of respondents said in 2023 that they believed that hard work is always rewarded, compared with an average of 62 percent in polls conducted between 2004 and 2014.

Timothy McLaughlin: Why Beijing wants Jimmy Lai locked up

“I really wonder how a state that insists on a narrative that ‘everything is getting better' and doesn't want to hear dissenting voices is going to be able to recognize and respond to those types of voices that are going to emerge in Chinese society,” Carl Minzner, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told me.

In October, residents of Shanghai who ventured out in Halloween costumes got a rude surprise: Police hauled them off the streets. Unsanctioned Halloween celebrations were apparently now off-limits. The authorities didn't offer an explanation. Were they afraid that a reveler would criticize the regime with a satirical disguise, or dress up in a manner offensive to socialist morality? That a Halloween party might morph into a protest? In a politically charged society, nearly anything could appear to be a threat.

Students in the central city of Zhengzhou began taking nighttime bike rides to nearby Kaifeng. Late last year, the outings became a phenomenon as more and more riders joined them; sometimes the cyclists sang the country's national anthem as they peddled. At first, officials encouraged these jaunts. But then the crowds swelled to the tens of thousands, and the security state got jittery. In mid-November, police shut the bikers down.

If such arbitrary, paranoid behavior sounds familiar, it should, as it's common in authoritarian states and can contribute to their decline. China has already been through this. During the initial three decades of Communist rule under Mao, China plunged into violence, political paralysis, economic chaos, and a famine that killed tens of millions. Those who challenged Mao or tried to repair the damage were purged.

The Communist Party was able to save itself only after Mao's death, by opening China to the world in the 1980s and introducing the reforms that sparked its rapid economic growth. Ever since, China has appeared to be a “different” kind of authoritarian regime, one that merged political control with economic vibrancy. The “China model” supposedly furnished an alternative to the West's democratic capitalism as a pathway to national success.

Dan Wang: A nation of lawyers confronts China's engineering state

Now China appears to be going back to the future. The four decades of reform were “an aberration,” Wang Feng, a sociologist at UC Irvine and the author of China's Age of Abundance, told me. The Xi era is “a reset,” Wang said, returning China to a system in which the only source of power is political—the Communist Party, which is “exercising control over all sectors and suffocating society.”

Can China continue to ascend economically under these conditions? Some of its new industries, such as electric vehicles and AI, seem to be continuing to thrive. But in other respects, China is following a pattern familiar from the failed autocracies of the past. Shambaugh told me he was reminded of the late Soviet period, noting “the systemic sclerosis inherent in one-man dictatorship, especially the sycophancy and the need to carry out the leader's directives no matter what they are.” Shambaugh wrote in a 2024 paper that as the Soviet regime felt itself losing control, its raison d'être seemed to become simply staying in power—“rule becomes rule for rule's sake.” Xi's “evident insecurities and obsession with maintaining total control,” Shambaugh wrote, are “clear evidence” that the same is happening in China.

That's not to say that China's system is on the verge of collapse. Beijing “has an economy and international linkages to fall back on that the Soviet Union never did,” Shambaugh told me. Chinese Communism could simply “atrophy” in place, he said, citing as examples of this trajectory North Korea, Venezuela, and Cuba.

Could China really become like North Korea or the Soviet Union? Neither outcome is easy to imagine. But neither is the continued progress of a country that can't allow its citizens to grieve or celebrate.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Ivy League's problems are southern schools' opportunity. 

Jewish college students are going south.

Even before the Ivy League upheavals of the past two years, Jewish students had been slowly drifting away from the elite campuses of the Northeast. Now, as some seek respite from the protest movement that erupted after the Israeli response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas invasion of southern Israel, the drift has become more like—sorry—an exodus. And selective colleges outside the Northeast, sensing an intensifying disdain for Ivy League schools among Jewish teens and their parents, are tripping over one another to recruit these students.

The recent wave of anti-Israel campus activism, and accompanying incidents of anti-Semitism, have mostly taken place at a small number of hyper-selective schools. And high-school seniors have noticed. The population of Jewish undergraduates at Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania shrank by 3 to 5 percent from 2023 to 2025, according to data gathered by Hillel, the national Jewish student organization. (Only Hillel tracks these numbers, because colleges generally don't monitor religious affiliation.)

Of course, many Jewish students still apply and get admitted to the Ivies, and anyone who gets into these top colleges is still very likely to attend. But anecdotal reports suggest that a significant number of high-achieving Jewish teenagers are deciding not to apply to them at all. In Hillel's 2024 survey of 427 Jewish parents, nearly two-thirds said that they had eliminated a college from their child's application list because of concerns about anti-Semitism. And nearly every rabbi and professor I spoke with for this article knew students who, once admitted to an elite northeastern college, opted to go somewhere they perceived as more welcoming. Ramaz, a Modern Orthodox school in New York, usually sends more than a dozen graduates to Columbia each year. Last year, it sent zero.

To selective colleges elsewhere in the country, the situation presents an opportunity to poach talented Jewish students who might previously have gone to an Ivy League (or so-called Ivy Plus) school. These schools have cracked down on protests and taken pains to differentiate themselves from their northeastern peers. “We absolutely are hearing from our administration partners at strong schools in the South and Southwest that they want to take advantage of this moment to recruit top Jewish students,” Adam Lehman, the CEO of Hillel International, told me. “And, by the way, they're succeeding.” Vanderbilt Chancellor Daniel Diermeier told me, “We want to create a place where there's thriving Jewish life, just like we do for all the other students. But again, it's particularly salient right now because of the contrast with other universities.”

Rose Horowitch: The elite-university presidents who despise one another

Historically, one or two Ramaz graduates in a given year would apply early-decision to Emory University, the head of Emory's Chabad chapter told me. Last year, 12 did. (Chabad is a Hasidic group that focuses on outreach to nonobservant Jews.) Jewish-student interest in Emory, as well as in Vanderbilt, has more than doubled since October 7, 2023, rabbis at the universities told me. Vanderbilt's Hillel had to hire new staff to host all the prospective students who wanted tours; the university's undergraduate Jewish population has grown by 20 percent in the past two years. The University of Florida's Hillel chapter experienced a 50 percent increase in student participation from 2021 to 2025. Clemson University—a South Carolina school not often associated with vibrant Jewish student life—saw its Hillel grow fourfold over the same period. Southern Methodist University, near Dallas, now appears to have more Jewish students than Harvard, Hillel data show.

These colleges are recruiting Jewish students not out of pure munificence or southern hospitality, but because it can be very good for their bottom line. “Jewish families are historically philanthropic and give back, Jewish students are more likely to pay full tuition, and having a substantial percentage of Jewish students helps create a more successful university environment,” Mike Uram, a Jewish nonprofit leader and the former head of the University of Pennsylvania Hillel, told me. This strategy was once used by Ivy League colleges to rise in the rankings. Now southern schools are running the same playbook.

The history of Jews in the Ivy League is long and tumultuous. The universities capped the number of Jewish students they admitted from the 1920s to the '60s. According to former Harvard President A. Lawrence Lowell, this was for Jews' own good: “The anti-Semitic feeling among the students is increasing, and it grows in proportion to the increase in the number of Jews,” he wrote in 1922, by way of justifying discrimination. To keep that number under control, admissions offices emphasized “character,” a code word for WASPiness. But in the following decades, Jews—who make up only about 2 percent of the U.S. population—reached a representation of 20 times that on some Ivy campuses. The achievements of Jewish academics, and donations from Jewish alumni, helped place America's top universities among the best in the world. By the turn of the century, according to Hillel, UPenn was one-third Jewish.

That didn't last. In 2010, the University of Pennsylvania was about 20 percent Jewish, and six years later, 13 percent. Hillel data suggest that Yale, Harvard, and Columbia also all saw significant declines in their Jewish population from 2015 to 2023. Dartmouth and Princeton, which enrolled fewer Jews to begin with, saw their shares drop a few percentage points too. (The dynamic wasn't universal; at Brown and Cornell, the Jewish population grew over the same period.) Leonard Saxe, a social-policy professor at Brandeis University, attributes much of the change to universities shifting their admissions objectives to focus on recruiting first-generation, international, and racial-minority students.

At the same time, southern colleges began courting Jewish students in an effort to raise their academic standing. Schools such as Duke, in North Carolina, and Vanderbilt, in Nashville, built out their Kosher dining halls and Jewish-studies programs. “Yes, we're targeting Jewish students,” then–Vanderbilt Chancellor Gordon Gee said in 2002. “That's not affirmative action. That's smart thinking.” Tulane, in New Orleans, pioneered this tactic; its undergraduate population is now 40 percent Jewish, according to Hillel. (“We're not trying to recruit Jewish students per se,” Tulane President Michael Fitts says, “but we're trying to create a supportive community, and we will act affirmatively against anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination.”)

Franklin Foer: The golden age of American Jews is ending

The chaos on left-leaning campuses during the 2023–24 academic year gave southern universities the recruitment opening they had been waiting for. At Harvard, protesters accosted an Israeli American student who later sued the university for allegedly not disciplining his attackers. At Columbia, 13 Jewish students told the student newspaper that they'd faced attacks or harassment in the days after October 7. The percentage of Ivy League Jewish students who reported censoring their opinions multiple times a week rocketed from 13 percent in 2023 to 35 percent the next year, according to a survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE).

Some Jewish students began looking for a way out. In October 2023, Lauren Eckstein was attending Pomona College, in California, one of the few elite liberal-arts colleges on the West Coast. The day after the Hamas attack, pro-Palestinian student groups released a post justifying the violence. A few weeks later, several of Eckstein's professors, including much of the history department, signed on to an anti-Israel letter arguing that “the ongoing violence and terror inflicted by the Israeli state must be understood in the context of this settler-colonialism and Israel's apartheid regime,” and that “condemnations only of specific acts of violence perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups can serve to disavow the roots of violence.” Her grandparents had recently made a $1.2 million donation to Pomona, but she nevertheless decided to look into finishing her degree elsewhere.

Around the same time, Washington University in St. Louis opened a midyear transfer program. Andrew Martin, the university's chancellor, released a statement touting his campus's tough response to protests that violated university policy. When protesters set up an encampment, for example, WashU swept it within hours. “We had no tolerance,” Martin told me. Daniel Diermeier, the Vanderbilt chancellor, issued a similar statement. The University of Florida, meanwhile, started a program on Jewish classical education. Clemson University launched a partnership with Israeli universities.

“Jewish students add value to a campus community in terms of their academic work, in terms of their overall commitment to elevating campus life through community service and partnerships, and through the way they stay connected to their alma maters—including as donors,” Lehman, the Hillel CEO, told me. Publicly, the leaders of these southern universities say that these choices are simply the right thing to do. But talk to administrators in private, and it becomes clear that they see in the struggles of elite northern universities a chance to steal away students who can help make their campuses more competitive.

It might be working. “From what I hear, the overall consensus is that the top schools for Jewish students to go to now are WashU, Emory, Vanderbilt, Tulane,” Eckstein told me. “It's very different than when I was younger and so many Jewish students wanted to go to the Ivy League.” She said that she'd transferred to WashU so that she could fully focus on her studies and extracurriculars. I heard this sentiment over and over from Jewish leaders at southern schools; they told me that students chose their university because it gave them the opportunity to be apolitical. “It's not so much that they want to go to a school that's pro-Israel,” Zalman Lipskier, the head of Chabad at Emory, told me. “They just want to be left alone and be able to pursue their education, and pursue their goals and dreams without having to worry about if they're going to get sucker-punched or harassed on their way to class.”

Whether such worries are wholly realistic is up for debate. The line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism is nearly always contested; the anti-Israel protest movement on some campuses counts many Jewish students among its ranks. Meanwhile, southern colleges are becoming more popular with northeastern students of all backgrounds. No doubt some Jewish students have opted out of the Ivy League simply because they think the South is the place to be.

Even so, an atmosphere of fear has clearly taken hold among many Jewish families. Jewish leaders at Columbia, Harvard, and Yale told me that just about every parent of a prospective student asks if their child will be safe on campus. (Here I will resist the temptation to make any quips about Jewish moms.) Of course, the parents who reach out to campus rabbis in the first place are a nonrepresentative subset of Jewish families. Anxiety around anti-Semitism is concentrated among students who are religiously observant and more likely to participate in Jewish organizations, several of the rabbis told me.

Meir Posner, the head of Chabad at Yale, told me that he doesn't think Jewish students' physical safety is at risk on campus. But anti-Semitism shows up in subtler ways. “There is a perception that engaging or aligning oneself with any particular Jewish organization on campus is somehow an implicit political alignment,” he said. Posner and other Ivy League Jewish leaders stressed that there are still thriving Jewish communities on their campuses. But they fear that if the decline continues, it will lead to a kind of doom loop.

That point is, by all accounts, still a long way off. So many Jews apply to Harvard that it could probably fill its entire freshman class with Jewish students if it wanted to. Michael Courtney, the director of college counseling at the Modern Orthodox school Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy, in New York, said that even though more kids are looking at southern schools, the best students still tend to end up in the Ivy League. Columbia and Harvard are highly regarded among graduate schools and employers; his students don't want to cut themselves off from those opportunities. And many Ivy League campuses have taken steps to address anti-Semitism. Harvard, for example, recently promised to cover the cost of security for its Hillel chapter. In the most recent FIRE survey, 19 percent of Jewish students said that they often self-censor—closer to the 13 percent prior to October 7, 2023, than the 35 percent the year after.

Franklin Foer: Can this man save Harvard?

But holding back the competition will be difficult. The upstarts are sending recruiters to Jewish day schools in the Northeast, flaunting the strength of their Jewish communities in interviews and public statements, and portraying themselves as the antidote to Ivy League illiberalism.

Several close observers I spoke with believe that a durable realignment is under way. Jewish students being welcomed across the country is in many ways a good thing, of course. But the partnership between Jews and the Ivy League, which has been fruitful for both, might be coming to an end. “There is something very poignant, and maybe even sad, about seeing a community that was excluded for so long from fair participation in elite university life, and then overcame those barriers and flourished so much on those campuses—then seeing their numbers decline so precipitously afterwards,” Mark Oppenheimer, a professor of religion and journalism, told me. “It was a great triumph of American opportunity that Jews sparked the explicit design of restrictionist, anti-Semitic admissions policies in the years after World War I, and then overcame them and really took to higher ed like no minority group ever had before.” Oppenheimer taught for years at Yale. Now he's at WashU.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If Alina Habba's appointment is illegal, so is much more of Trump's DOJ takeover.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A line in the musical Hamilton claims, “Everything is legal in New Jersey.” This is not precisely true. At the moment, however, nobody seems to know who in the state is in charge of enforcing federal law.

Last Thursday, a judge ruled that Alina Habba, Donald Trump's pick to head the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey, has been illegally leading the office since July 1. That doesn't just cause problems for Habba going forward: If Habba was not legitimately in office, the prosecutions that took place under her are all now in question. The administration has appealed the ruling. “I am the pick of the president,” Habba insisted on Fox News. “I will serve this country.”

The chaos around Habba is a glimpse into the dubious methods by which Trump has bent the rules to stock his government with loyalists. Now those maneuvers have upended prosecutors' work in New Jersey—and potentially around the country.

Typically, the president nominates U.S. attorneys for confirmation by the Senate, which gives the president's choice a thumbs-up or -down. The statutes that allow temporary appointments are structured that way for a reason. As with all Senate-confirmed positions, the Senate's constitutional power to advise and consent on U.S.-attorney nominations is meant as a check against the president selecting candidates whose only merit, as described in The Federalist Papers, is “of being in some way or other personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious instruments of his pleasure.”

But this is exactly what Trump finds appealing about appointees like Habba, one of his closer advisers. Trump originally selected Habba in late March under a statute that allows the president to select an interim U.S. attorney when the chief prosecutor's office is vacant. Interim appointments expire after 120 days; from that point on, judges in the district may make their own selection. In June, the president officially nominated Habba to fill the position via the normal process. The Senate did nothing to move on Habba's nomination, and on July 22—120 days since Trump announced that he had appointed Habba “effective immediately”—New Jersey judges selected a career prosecutor in the office, Desiree Grace, for the role instead.

Judges' authority to make such picks had been previously uncontroversial, but the Trump administration exploded with rage. “When judges act like activists, they undermine confidence in our justice system,” scolded Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on X. The Justice Department devised a “solution” to slide Habba back into the job—a Rube Goldberg series of maneuvers, taking advantage of the tangle of authorities that governs temporary appointments. Grace, a registered Republican who previously had earned accolades for her aggressive prosecution of violent crime, was fired. Habba dropped her bid for the permanent role and was reappointed, not as interim U.S. attorney, but as a “special attorney” and the “first assistant” to the U.S. attorney, who did not exist—allowing Habba to step into that role under a different law, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. Essentially, Habba became her own chief aide.

In his ruling last week, Judge Matthew Brann said that this scheme violated the Vacancies Reform Act. Among other problems with the reappointment, the judge held that the statute forbids slotting a first assistant into the top job if the assistant was appointed after the vacancy in question arose—which, in Habba's case, is exactly what the Justice Department did.

Habba was in fact the second temporary U.S. attorney to be slotted back into the job in this manner. In the Northern District of New York, the district's judges declined to appoint John Sarcone as the U.S. attorney after his interim appointment expired on July 15, following a rocky 120 days during which the Albany Times Union reported that the residence Sarcone had listed in the city appeared to be an abandoned building. (U.S. attorneys are required to live in the district they oversee.) Sarcone, too, was transformed into an acting U.S. attorney by becoming his own first assistant. Although details are hard to come by, the Trump administration seems to have used a similar sleight of hand in extending the terms of temporary U.S. attorneys in New Mexico, Nevada, and the Central District of California.

These temporary leaders have struggled to gain the respect of their offices. In California, Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli has pursued exorbitant criminal charges against anti-ICE protesters, reportedly notching an embarrassing string of defeats in front of grand juries that refused to charge. In New Mexico, Acting U.S. Attorney Ryan Ellison's office faced repeated admonition from judges over his insistence on prosecuting migrants for trespassing in a freshly created military zone along the United States–Mexico border. In Nevada, Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah has a history of racist remarks against Black officials, once commenting that the state's attorney general, Aaron Ford, who is Black, should be “hanging from a fucking crane.”

Read: Trump's revenge campaign has a weakness

Habba, too, had a rocky tenure as chief prosecutor. During her first months at the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, she promised on a podcast to “turn New Jersey red,” oversaw the filing of criminal charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Democratic Representative LaMonica McIver after the two clashed with ICE agents at an immigration-detention facility, and decorated a conference room with pictures of herself. (The office dropped the charges against Baraka, but only once a magistrate judge excoriated prosecutors for bringing what appeared to be a politically motivated case.)

Democratic senators in these states have voiced concerns over these appointees, and could block any formal nomination for so long as Republicans respect existing Senate norms. Trump regularly rages against these constraints. But the scheme around acting appointments has meant that—for some period, at least—these officials haven't had to worry about securing confirmation. Instead, they can focus on pleasing the president.

Habba is the only prosecutor of this group whose appointment has been challenged in court. A handful of defendants in criminal cases argued that the charges against them should be thrown out because Habba's appointment was invalid. This is how the case ended up before Judge Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who joked during a hearing that he had been assigned to oversee the knotty litigation “for my sins”—all of the district judges in New Jersey having been barred from the case because of their role in appointing Habba's short-lived successor.

Although Judge Brann declined to dismiss the prosecutions outright, that was the only win for the Justice Department. In finding the government's shell game around Habba's appointment illegal, he left little wiggle room for Habba to remain in the role. The judge did pause his ruling to give the government time to appeal. However, the litigation has already cast doubt over the normal process of law enforcement in the state, as prosecutors scramble to shore up their cases against challenges to Habba's illegitimate involvement. During a hearing held by Judge Brann, New Jersey Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Coyne explained that some New Jersey judges had paused work on criminal cases while they waited for confusion over Habba's role to be resolved. Shortly after Judge Brann ruled, another federal judge indefinitely delayed a sentencing in a New Jersey fraud case over concerns as to whether Habba had any authority to supervise the prosecution. Other defendants may soon raise their own challenges, both in New Jersey and the Northern District of New York—as well as in the other districts with temporary appointees. Because Brann's ruling is on hold, it's not clear what authority Habba might be able to exercise going forward without potentially upending months of prosecutors' work down the road should higher courts find that she really is not in her role legally.

David A. Graham: Trump's newest crackdown on dissent

The Trump administration chose to risk this chaos. Senate confirmations often move slowly, which can lead to delays in confirming U.S. attorneys. But past administrations have dealt with this problem by allowing longtime career officials to run prosecutors' offices while nominations are pending—an approach explicitly allowed by the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. There's no shortage of qualified professionals, like the fired Desiree Grace, available to take on such temporary roles. Trump, though, has decided that it's more important to him to install loyalists whom he can trust to harass his enemies and go easy on his friends. Whether that upends the actual work of law enforcement is apparently beside the point.

The effects of this choice may ripple beyond the Justice Department. Judge Brann's ruling would sharply constrain the president's choice of acting officials in Senate-confirmed offices, requiring many of the Trump-selected temporary leaders currently running various agencies to be replaced with career government employees. It would also prevent the administration from filling vacant offices by delegating power to temporary officials like David Richardson, who is currently running FEMA under the ungainly title of “Senior Official Performing the Duties of FEMA Administrator.” Information on what authority any given official is acting under can be difficult to come by, but such placeholders may currently make up a non-negligible chunk of administration officials. According to data compiled by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service, Trump has yet to nominate anyone to almost 300 out of 800 tracked Senate-confirmed positions, and only 126 nominees have been confirmed by the Senate.

Attorney General Pam Bondi seems committed to fighting for Habba—in part as a way of continuing the administration's efforts to delegitimize the courts by decrying “activist judges.” (Judge Brann, it is worth noting, is no one's definition of a liberal: He was once active in the Pennsylvania Republican Party and is a member of the Federalist Society and the National Rifle Association.) Even setting aside the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, the sheer scope of temporary officials affected by Brann's ruling practically required the administration to appeal. “A government operating by handshake and mutual understanding may go along swimmingly,” Judge Brann wrote, “but only for so long as everyone is willing to play by the rules.” Other presidents have taken advantage of this approach to gain some flexibility in the face of Senate delays. Trump, though, has stretched things to the breaking point. Now they may finally have snapped.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Why it matters that the University of Chicago is pausing admissions to doctoral programs in literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages

The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was lit, COVID-19 was still a mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan, and I was a Ph.D. candidate in a dying field: comparative literature. I was getting ready to Zoom interview for a tenure-track job near Boston that I almost certainly wouldn't get (and didn't). Sardined with me in a Greenwich Village coffee shop in December 2019, one of my faculty mentors talked me through, for the thousandth time, the questions I should expect the hiring committee to ask me and dispensed advice about how I should answer them. Then we walked back to his office, lined in handsome foreign-language editions of various novels and works of philosophy, where I would sit for the interview. There, he offered a final piece of wisdom: “Don't be nervous. It's just Harvard,” he said, grinning. “It's not like it's Chicago.”

A joke, but not entirely. For as long as I can remember, and certainly much longer than that, the University of Chicago has been widely viewed as the destination for humanities students and scholars. Some other elite schools might have the coveted Ivy League branding, or a few more famous faculty members, or a couple more dollars to tack onto the salaries of its professors and graduate students. But perhaps nowhere is the study of literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages more valued, their spirit more authentically preserved, their frontiers more doggedly pursued, than at Chicago. The university has had several household names on its humanities faculty, including the firebrand critic Allan Bloom, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the ethicist Martha Nussbaum, as well as scholars who may be less well known to the general public but whose work has been deeply influential in their fields, including the brilliant literary critic Sianne Ngai and Fred Donner, the pathbreaking and Guggenheim-winning historian of early Islam. In short, Chicago is a place for scholars' scholars. At least, that's the reputation. And Chicago's reputation is no doubt why, when the university announced recently that it was reducing Ph.D. admissions for seven departments—among them art history and English language and literature—and outright freezing admissions to others, including classics, the decision was met, in some quarters, with fury and disbelief. “Chicago!” as one stunned academic friend put it in a text to me.

In an August 12 email to faculty, Deborah Nelson, Chicago's arts and humanities dean, said that the changes were necessitated by “this moment of uncertainty” and “evolving fiscal realities.” These bits of bureaucratese appear to be allusions to both the Trump administration's war on higher education and Chicago's homegrown financial troubles, which include an eye-popping $6.3 billion in debt and a bad bet on crypto. “To be anything but cautious at this moment,” the dean's email continued, “would be irresponsible.”

Read: Grad school is in trouble

Chicago's social-sciences division has also announced doctoral-admissions pauses, primarily in humanistic-leaning programs such as anthropology and social thought, where towering figures including the philosopher Hannah Arendt once taught. What's happening at Chicago is a particular gut-punch to the humanities, not just at the university itself, but nationally and even globally. The school is, as the classics professor Catherine Kearns put it in a message to me, “a singular center for the pursuit of humanistic knowledge and intellectual growth.” Of the nearly 30 Chicago humanities professors I spoke with for this article, many emphasized that the stakes are much higher than the fate of prospective graduate students or the professors who might teach them. Chicago has long helped to keep alive tiny fields and esoteric areas of humanistic study, particularly in the languages. Without the university's support, and the continued training of graduate students who can keep these bodies of knowledge going, entire spheres of human learning might eventually blink out.

Of course, some might view these comments as self-serving complaints. But the primary fears of the people I spoke with were not about their own careers or futures, but instead about their fields—about knowledge that, once lost, cannot be easily regained. “If you allow a field to die, there's a loss to something like humanity,” Clifford Ando, a Chicago classicist who has been outspoken about the administration's maneuvers, told me. “There's also a real practical risk that a field simply cannot be re-created just because you have books.” I heard this sentiment echoed over and over. “If we stop producing people who are trained or educated to help undergraduates understand the most important things thought or written or painted in human history,” the renowned philosopher Robert Pippin said, “we might not be able to recover that.” Elaine Hadley, an emerita professor of English, told me, “Part of what we do is we're conservators, keeping a body of knowledge going. We want to innovate and we want to think new things about it, and, you know, we want to make it relevant to the present day, but we're also trying to keep this knowledge alive.”

These responses emphasize the cultural costs of shrinking the number of people trained in humanities fields, rather than focusing on the question of whether universities should be calibrating the production of Ph.D.s to the academic job market. No one I spoke to was insensitive to the pressures their grad students face when confronting the vanishing opportunities for tenure-track employment. But the professors also seemed reluctant to define the success of a program by how many professors it creates—after all, most humanities PhD students at Chicago do not pay tuition and receive stipends to cover their living costs, and getting paid to learn and read is not the worst fate.

These faculty perspectives also stood in stark contrast with the reigning image of elite higher educators in right-wing media outlets: that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Implicit in their impassioned defenses was the belief that the role of a humanist is to preserve knowledge, safeguard learning from the market and the tides of popular interest, and ward off coarse appeals to economic utility.

Depending on whom I asked, the move to scale back humanities doctoral programs is either a prudent acknowledgment of the cratered job market for tenure-track professorships and a wise attempt to protect the university's humanities division from looming financial and political risks, or it is a cynical effort, under cover of the Trump administration's assaults, to transfer resources away from “impractical,” unprofitable, and largely jobless fields (such as, say, comparative literature) and toward areas that the university's senior leadership seems to care about (such as, say, STEM and “innovation”). One faculty member I spoke with mentioned a consulting firm that was brought on to help Chicago as it considers changes to its humanities division, including possibly consolidating the departments from 15 down to eight. Many professors worried that the move to impose uneven changes—reducing admissions in some while halting them in others—may be an attempt to create circumstances that will ultimately make it easier to dissolve the paused programs. “Let no good crisis go unleveraged,” Holly Shissler, an associate professor in the Middle Eastern Studies department, said with a dark laugh. “You engineer a situation in which there are no students, and then you turn around and say, ‘Why are we supporting all these departments and faculty when they have no students?'”

Read: The elite-university presidents who despise one another

When I emailed Nelson and asked whether the changes were part of a plan to kill off the paused departments, she said, “A one-year pause is exactly that—a discrete decision that applies merely to a single admissions cycle.” She seemed to acknowledge, however, that a divisional reorganization could happen. “My goal is to sustain the full scope of our faculty's research and teaching,” she said. “To do so, we must be open to new ideas and structures.” She added, “There's no magic number of departments in the arts and humanities.” In the meantime, Chicago's humanities professors appear largely determined to resist being evaluated in terms of expediency. In a meeting with Nelson a few days after the announcement, 14 out of 15 chairs in the humanities division told the dean that she should pause enrollment in all of their departments or none of them. Targeting some and not others was unacceptable, they argued, because it sent the message that some fields matter and others do not.

The department chairs' wager seems to be that acting as a unified bloc will make reorganizing the division and cutting programs more difficult, even if the division-wide pause causes short-term pain for the next academic year. As anyone who has served on a faculty anywhere can tell you, this degree of cross-department solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for less-favored colleagues is remarkable, and even moving. Last Wednesday afternoon, the dean announced that the chairs had gotten their wish: With the exception of philosophy and music composition (owing to previous pauses in those programs), doctoral admissions will be frozen across the humanities for the 2026–27 academic year.

It's a bittersweet victory, of course, one that will result in fewer doctoral students in the short term and is not guaranteed to strengthen the division in the long term. And it does not settle the most pressing question raised by all this turmoil. If even Chicago is not willing to support and protect American arts and letters, who will? One Chicago administrator, in an attempt to defend the university's admissions pauses, pointed out that other prestigious peer institutions were expected to make similar announcements about their Ph.D. admissions in the coming weeks, and noted that Harvard is cutting nearly $2 million from its own humanities division. I would like to think that my (and others') alarm about the future of the humanities is overblown. But the evidence doesn't give me much hope.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump's decision to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook is a test of the Republican justices' submissiveness.

The six Republican justices have largely behaved as lickspittles to the leader of their political party. These are, after all, the same GOP political appointees who said that President Donald Trump is allowed to commit crimes.

Last May, however, the Court did appear to draw a line in the sand and warn Trump not to cross it. In Trump v. Wilcox, a decision that otherwise endorsed the proposition that Trump can fire leaders of independent federal agencies that are supposed to enjoy a degree of job security, the Court signaled that Trump may not fire leaders of the Federal Reserve.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Admittedly, the Republican justices' explanation of why Fed leaders are protected is gibberish. The Court said that “the Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States” — whatever the hell that means.

One of the first major constitutional disputes in the United States involved a disagreement between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over whether Congress could charter a national bank. But that dispute did not raise the question of whether the president could fire bank officials.

In any event, we're about to find out if the Republican justices were serious about this rare and arbitrary limit they placed on Trump's authority. Because Trump, being Trump, has decided to test it. Late on Monday, Trump announced that he will remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's Board of Governors. So Trump is doing the one thing that this Court has said he may not do.

While Cabinet secretaries and most other federal agencies' leaders serve at the pleasure of the president, the Federal Reserve is one of several agencies led by multi-member boards whose members may only be removed “for cause” by the president. This is because the Fed is supposed to make technocratic decisions about US monetary policy without being influenced by partisan politics.

If Trump controlled the Fed, or if he had the power to fire its leaders, he could order it to juice the economy at a politically beneficial time for him — even though doing so would do much greater long-term harm to the US economy.

The Republican justices, however, are all devotees of a legal theory known as the “unitary executive,” which claims that it is unconstitutional to give any federal agency leader protection from being fired by the president. In Wilcox, for example, the Court's Republicans permitted Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, two other agencies whose leaders are supposed to be protected from political firings.

Trump, for what it is worth, claims that his decision to fire Cook is legal because he is, in fact, firing her for cause. He alleges that she committed mortgage fraud by describing two separate properties as her primary residence, but this is an obvious pretext. Trump has raised similar allegations against several of his political enemies, including New York's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA).

It is now all but inevitable that Cook v. Trump will reach the Supreme Court after Cook sues to retain her job.

The unitary executive theory derives from a provision of the Constitution that states that “the executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.”

In a 1988 dissenting opinion that many of the Republican justices now treat as a holy text, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that this provision “does not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power” belongs to the president. And thus any federal official who wields power that is “executive” in nature must be fully accountable to the president and must serve at the president's pleasure.

Even if you accept this basic principle, the Republican justices have often applied the unitary executive theory in haphazard and ahistorical ways. In their benighted Trump immunity opinion, for example, the Republican justices claimed that “investigation and prosecution of crimes is a quintessentially executive function” — and thus the president must have full control over all federal prosecutors. But the United States didn't centralize federal prosecutions in the executive branch until fairly late in its history.

As law professor Jed Shugerman explained in a 2019 essay, prosecutions initiated by private attorneys were the norm “through the mid-nineteenth century” — although the Fifth Amendment still required these private lawyers to obtain an indictment from a grand jury before a federal prosecution could proceed. Additionally, “federal judges themselves led what appeared to be prosecutions during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794.” Vestiges of this old system still remain. Current law, for example, gives federal district judges the power to appoint US attorneys under some circumstances.

The Federal Reserve exception to the unitary executive that the Court announced in Wilcox is another example of the GOP justices' haphazard approach to presidential power. If “all of the executive power” must be vested in the president, then it shouldn't matter that one particular agency is a “uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States” (again, whatever the hell that means).

All of which underscores a recurring theme from these justices: The current Court's unitary executive decisions do not appear to be a good-faith effort to interpret the Constitution; rather, it appears that they're just about power. The Republican justices want Trump to be able to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, and they don't want him to be able to fire members of the Federal Reserve. The question presented by Trump's decision to fire Cook is whether these justices will hold to that line, now that the leader of their political party seeks to erase it.

While lawyers can only palm their faces in despair at this Court's unitary executive cases, economists and investors will watch the Cook case with great interest, because the consequences of a decision permitting Trump to fire Fed leaders would be quite dire.

The Federal Reserve is supposed to maintain a very delicate balance when it raises or lowers interest rates. High interest rates strangle economic growth and depress employment, but they also reduce inflation. Low interest rates do the opposite. So, if the Fed sets those rates in the wrong place, it risks either mass unemployment or runaway inflation.

Nor do we need to imagine what could go wrong if the Fed succumbs to political pressure. In 1971, President Richard Nixon pushed Fed chair Arthur Burns to lower interest rates in advance of Nixon's reelection race — the idea was to inject cocaine into the economy at the moment when voters were weighing Nixon's economic record, and to let the pain come later. Burns complied with Nixon. The economy boomed in 1972. And Nixon won reelection in an historic landslide.

But the pain did come. Burns's action is often blamed for years of “stagflation,” slow economic growth and high inflation, during the 1970s.

The Fed, in other words, has the power to temporarily boost the economy at the cost of much greater economic turmoil down the road. It's not hard to imagine how presidents could abuse this power if the Supreme Court gives them control over the Fed.

So it's not hard to see why even this Supreme Court is cautious about giving Trump the power to fire Federal Reserve leaders. The Republican justices may be zealous adherents to the unitary executive theory, but they also have stock portfolios.

Still, these same justices have shown all the backbone of a jellyfish when they are asked to impose literally any limit whatsoever on Donald Trump. So it remains to be seen whether they will hold to the completely arbitrary line they drew in Wilcox.

We all have a limited reserve of attention, and modern life is excellent at depleting it. 

The human brain wasn't built for all this — all of the information, screens, meetings, scheduling, thinking.

The problem is the brain hasn't changed much since the days of hunter-gatherers, but the demands we put on it have, says Kayla Stajkovic, a lecturer in organizational behavior at the University of California Davis. In the past, humans did a fair amount of strategizing and planning to survive, but now, we're bombarded with emails and messages all day, we juggle calendars, attempt to multitask, and pull out our phones when we can't think of anything better to do.

Into the breach has stepped an enormous number of productivity hacks, as well as influencers and productivity evangelists peddling easy-fix solutions. A to-do list no longer suffices when you can intricately track habits, time, goals, and progress. Setting up and customizing new systems can consume more time and energy than the tasks they're meant to streamline. We also live in an era of ubiquitous short-form videos and AI overviews, bite-sized bits of information that are supposed to save us time, but in fact may just be fueling the desire to devour more content as quickly as possible.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Even with all these new hacks, tools, and organizational methods, it can still feel like a challenge to concentrate for a few hours a day. It isn't that we're undisciplined or have undiagnosed ADHD (although that certainly may be the case for some) — we're simply pushing our minds beyond the brink of what they can reasonably do, Stajkovic says. We all have a limited reserve of attention, and many aspects of our tech-laden, productivity-focused lives deplete that mental energy.

“You could see how it would be easy for people to say we have attention problems when really the problem is the environment and how much we're trying to fit in,” Stajkovic says. “It would be like trying to tow a boat with a Honda Civic. The boat is heavier than the car's capacity to tow it; it's just not going to do it. It's not a problem with the car. It just wasn't made to tow a boat.”

If you're already at your cognitive limit, no workaround will transform your brain from a Honda Civic to a tractor-trailer. Instead of adding, you need to do something entirely counterintuitive: find a way to lighten the load.

This constant barrage of information we're subjected to in modern life, most of which is delivered via a screen, leads to information and cognitive overload — a mental maxing out of attention and productivity. Because the hunter-gatherer brain has a limit on attentional capacity, modern demands chip away at those resources, Stajkovic explains. Simple, routine tasks — brushing your teeth, feeding yourself — are less mentally taxing, while blocks of meetings, hours of work without a break, and perpetual scrolling are depleting. In this exhausted state, it's difficult to put forth your best effort.

In one study, German workers who used text-based digital tools like Slack, Trello, and email during the pandemic had higher rates of perceived cognitive overload. Video tools, on the other hand, didn't contribute to cognitive overload.

Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank. The consequences of cognitive overload are far-reaching, if not entirely surprising: Psychological distress, lower job productivity and satisfaction, depressive symptoms. “It impairs our working memory, it impairs our ability to make decisions and the quality of decisions we make,” says Miriam Arnold, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “It can also have behavioral outcomes, so we might try to avoid the information, for example, ignoring emails or procrastinating, which makes it worse in the long term.”

Nothing good comes from continuing to push through despite having no gas in the tank.

The drive to perpetually produce is motivated in part by the fact that productivity feels good, according to Leidy Klotz, a professor in engineering and behavioral science at the University of Virginia. Fail to meet a self-imposed (or boss-imposed) output, and you might think something must be wrong with you, not the taxing context in which you work or your employer's demanding expectations.

The pace of work in our hyper-connected digital workplace isn't helping matters much either. Employees are not only responsible for the central elements of their job; they're also expected to be constantly reachable and responsive. The modern workday can feel like it's filled more with communicating about work — answering emails and attending meetings — than actually doing the work.

Even with more busywork and tighter timelines to contend with, we're still driven to be high-performers because of the fundamental human need to display competence, says Klotz, also the author of Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less. Although sending another email or checking off a to-do list item gives the illusion of accomplishment, it's only a proxy for actual productivity. It's just energy-depleting busy work. “One of the reasons that it doesn't feel good to be going as hard as we can and not actually accomplish anything,” Klotz says, “is because we realize that we're not meeting that need for competence.”

In order to get more done, some may turn to productivity tools and systems — project managing software, strategies meant for people with diagnosed attention disorders, breaking down assignments into smaller tasks. While these hacks appear to streamline workflows, in actuality, they add to the cognitive load. “Say you have three things to do, and a strategy is breaking it into micro-tasks,” Stajkovic says. “Now you've created 26 things to do that your mind is trying to keep track of. So actually, you're undermining yourself in that regard.”

The best way to get more done when you've hit your cognitive max is the most straightforward: Take a break and rejuvenate, experts say.

Recognizing the signs of cognitive overload is the first step. Feeling stressed, overwhelmed, and unable to focus are signals to pull back, not force more output, Stajkovic says. In which case, try to take at least a 15-minute pause during the workday and don't skip your lunch break. Some jobs don't offer the flexibility to pause outside of designated break times, so Stajkovic suggests switching to a less taxing assignment if you can, something you can do almost automatically without much thinking.

Outside of work, it's important not to sabotage leisure time. Leave work at work and save emails for the next day. Not all company cultures are amenable to this, of course, but team leaders can encourage employees to take breaks, to let their mind wander, and to disengage outside of work hours, Stajkovic and Klotz say.

To stave off cognitive overload, question some of the behaviors that contribute to it, says Gloria Mark, the author of Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity and the Substack The Future of Attention. Why are you responding to emails at 10 pm or opening TikTok as soon as you have a moment of downtime? Most of the time, these seemingly urgent messages can wait, or that social media habit is purely out of boredom. “Once you become aware of that, you can be more intentional in your behavior,” Mark says.

And instead of adding more to your plate in the form of elaborate productivity hacks, try eliminating what doesn't serve you. While everyone's scenario will look different, Klotz suggests clarifying your goal in work or life and skipping meetings or tasks that don't serve that goal if you have the flexibility. If your main purpose at work is to teach students, maybe there are a few nonessential department meetings you could opt out of to make more time for additional instruction.

Perhaps the most impactful antidote to our fast-paced, production-obsessed culture is recognizing you probably did enough today — and nothing short of a brain upgrade can change that. “Instead of thinking about ‘What more could I do?'” Stajkovic says, “focus on what I did get done and being content with that.”

America never recovered from the 2008 crash.

America is short on homes.

There are 4.7 million fewer housing units than families in the United States, according to a recent report from the real estate website Zillow. And this shortage is getting larger over time, in part because the pace of construction has slowed over the past two decades.

Dwellings are especially scarce — and thus, unaffordable — in places where economic opportunities are plentiful. As a result, the housing shortage hasn't just fueled displacement and inflation but also stymied economic growth and social mobility. It is arguably the single biggest economic problem in America today.

The Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement seeks to solve it. This faction — a loose constellation of advocacy groups, think tanks, and intellectuals — is animated by one basic observation: America's housing shortage is mandated by law.

Zoning rules prohibit the construction of apartment buildings on roughly 75 percent of America's residential land. Throughout much of this territory, land-use laws effectively require all single-family homes to be spacious (and thus, pricey to build or buy). Even in city centers, parking mandates often make multifamily housing financially or physically nonviable.

And these are just three of the more conspicuous ways that regulations constrain housing supply.

YIMBYs have therefore implored local and state governments to relax regulatory restrictions on housing development. The movement has won significant reforms in Minnesota, California, and Montana, among many other states. And with the publication of Ezra Klein (a Vox co-founder) and Derek Thompson's bestselling book Abundance — a manifesto for YIMBYism and adjacent causes — the quest to loosen land-use laws has attained newfound prominence.

It has also attracted much criticism.

On the left, some hesitate to blame any major social problem on excessive regulation. And they have raised a number of complaints with YIMBYism, most of which are unsound. For example, many contend that upzoning actually raises rents and fuels displacement — an intuition that doesn't withstand empirical scrutiny.

But there is one left-wing critique of YIMBYism that's partly right.

Much YIMBY skepticism is rooted in an accurate observation: Investing in a new housing development is a dicey proposition.

If you park your wealth in an S&P 500 index fund, then your risk is diversified, your holdings can be instantly converted to cash, and you don't need to take on debt to make your investment pay off.

Developing a real estate project offers none of these advantages. Rather, to get a new apartment building off the ground, a developer must make a big bet on the future value of a single asset, tie up their capital in that project for years, and take out loans to finance construction. To be worth the gamble, the expected return on that building needs to be substantial.

And this is one reason why YIMBY skeptics think land-use reform won't work: Making it legal to build abundant housing isn't the same as making it lucrative to do so. If developers ever produced enough apartments to bring down rents — and thus, their own returns — then they would simply stop building.

This view is largely mistaken. It ignores the fact that land-use reform lowers the cost of building — and thus, the minimum rent or home price necessary for a given development to pay off. According to a 2022 report, 40.6 percent of the cost of developing a multifamily housing project can be attributed to regulations. Many of these rules are necessary. But others are not.

Nevertheless, the anti-YIMBYs are gesturing in the general direction of a valid point: Land-use rules aren't the only constraint on homebuilding's profitability.

There's an easy way to see that land-use laws aren't the sole impediment to homebuilding: Look at a chart of US housing units started since 2000.

American municipalities didn't suddenly enact radically stricter zoning laws in 2006. So, red tape can't explain why housing starts abruptly plunged the following year — nor can it fully account for why they've remained depressed ever since.

Of course, the late-aughts housing collapse was caused by the subprime mortgage crisis and Great Recession. Given the extraordinary nature of these events, there are limits to what we can learn from the housing bust that coincided with them. Everyone agrees that economic crises are bad for homebuilding and should be avoided. But that doesn't tell us how to generate housing in normal times.

The more instructive question is why housing production never returned to its pre-crisis peak, even amid the strong economy of 2019 or the post-Covid boom.

Land-use rules could be part of the answer. Density restrictions actually did become more widespread between 2006 and 2018, according to the Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index. And for builders, the financial cost of complying with land-use rules increased by 29 percent from 2011 to 2016.

Nevertheless, the bulk of America's restrictive zoning regime was in place before the 21st century began. Changes to land-use rules since 2008 haven't been large enough to fully account for the slowdown in construction.

So, what does?

One major factor that affects construction rates — both in general and since 2008 — is the cost and availability of financing.

After the 2008 crash, policymakers made it more expensive for banks to provide construction loans, so as to better account for the risks of such lending. For homebuilders, this made credit more expensive and less accessible. Between 2008 and mid-2024, the dollar value of all residential construction loans fell by 55 percent, according to data from the National Association of Homebuilders.

Of course, Federal Reserve policy also has a huge influence. For more than a decade after the Great Recession, low interest rates tempered builders' financing challenges. Once the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to combat inflation, however, construction quickly slowed.

Elevated credit costs haven't been the only constraint on homebuilding since 2008. Construction labor has also been in short supply.

The Great Recession devastated America's construction workers. The sector bled nearly 1 million jobs between 2007 and 2011. Many laborers responded by changing fields, retiring, or returning to their home countries. And homebuilders have struggled to replace them, as younger generations have proven harder to recruit and foreign-born trades workers have been immigrating at lower rates.

This shortage of construction workers doesn't just increase builders' labor costs (a development that at least has the benefit of boosting wages). It also forces developers to forgo or delay projects that offer an attractive return even with a high wage bill, simply because no skilled workers are available.

Finally, the costs of lumber and other materials have also surged since 2008. The Great Recession shuttered many North American sawmills. When lumber demand recovered in the mid-2010s, a smaller industry struggled to keep up. Then, President Donald Trump's tariffs made both lumber and metals more expensive for American importers.

In the view of Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Homebuilders, these forces would perpetuate America's housing shortage, even under ideal land-use rules.

“If you solve the zoning issue, the labor issue becomes the binding constraint,” Dietz told me. “I do sometimes get a little frustrated when I see a thinktanker say, ‘Okay, if we fix the zoning issue, it's going to be off to the races.' No. There's no single simple, scalable solution that we have to work on all of these challenges.”

It's clear that any comprehensive plan for housing abundance must include far more than land-use reform. I don't have the space or expertise to fully detail such a plan. But I'll throw out a few ideas, to give you some sense of its shape.

On the financing front, there are many different ways to spur more housing investment.

One is for the government to directly bankroll development itself. Private investors will never offer capital to homebuilders at below-market rates, out of a recognition that society as a whole would be better off with more housing. But municipalities can.

Specifically, local governments can provide favorable financing to multifamily housing projects, in exchange for a cut of future rents. And once that rental income starts flowing, the government can reinvest this revenue into new buildings, in a self-sustaining cycle. Montgomery County, Maryland, has already pioneered this approach to public housing finance, and many other municipalities are considering similar policies.

The federal government could also create new loan programs aimed at stabilizing construction rates. For example, whenever housing starts fall beneath some minimum desired level, the government could start providing cheap, 50-year, fixed-rate mortgages to multifamily housing developers.

Tax policy can further channel capital toward housing. One way to do this is through an accounting rule called “accelerated depreciation,” which allows investors to claim that their apartment buildings are losing value faster than they actually are — and to use those paper losses to shrink their tax bills.

These policies may work best in tandem. The largest housing booms in American history have come when the government reduced the cost of credit and increased public subsidies for housing production.

In the late 1960s, Congress gave below-market credit to builders of affordable rental housing and made accelerated depreciation rules more generous, while the Fed slashed interest rates. A multifamily housing boom larger than any seen before or since ensued (until economic conditions deteriorated in 1973, and the government responded by raising rates and freezing subsidies).

Likewise, in the early 1980s, the Reagan tax cuts established the most aggressive accelerated depreciation rules in history. This, combined with falling interest rates, spurred a surge in multifamily housing construction — which slowed immediately after Congress pared back real estate's tax advantages in 1986.

Meanwhile, to combat the shortage of construction labor, the government could expand immigration opportunities for skilled trades workers and increase funding for vocational training. To reduce materials costs, it could lift America's high tariffs on lumber, copper, steel, and other housing inputs.

Policymakers could also try to increase productivity in the construction sector, which has been stagnant for half a century. By adjusting and synchronizing local building codes, the government could make it easier to efficiently produce sections of housing in factories, a process known as modular construction.

Of course, increasing housing production cannot ensure universal affordability. It will never be profitable to sell shelter to the indigent. So no housing agenda is complete without policies that increase the ability of poor and working Americans to make rent, whether through cash transfers, rental subsidies, or social housing.

All this said, I still think YIMBYs are right to prioritize land-use reform. The movement should not (and does not) advocate exclusively for regulatory change. But focusing on that dimension of the problem makes sense, for two reasons.

First, land-use overregulation is a leading cause of housing scarcity and unaffordability. Homebuilding booms and busts may coincide with shifts in financial conditions. But restrictive zoning caps every peak in the housing cycle and deepens every valley.

Second, it costs less than nothing to remove unnecessary constraints on homebuilding. Providing equity, subsidized loans, or tax breaks to the housing sector imposes a fiscal price. So does building social housing. This doesn't mean that those things aren't worth doing. But it makes doing any of them at scale politically challenging — especially at the municipal level, where deficit spending is more difficult.

By contrast, land-use reform typically increases municipal revenue: If you legalize apartment buildings, then more will typically go up — which then automatically increases the amount of property taxes you collect. A city can then use those funds to bankroll public developer programs, social housing, or rental subsidies. In this way, land-use reform makes the other dimensions of the housing crisis easier to address.

Put simply, cities are currently going out of their way to make housing scarce and unaffordable. A man who dreams of becoming a concert pianist might need to make many costly investments (such as buying a piano and lessons) to realize that goal. Yet if that man also compulsively sticks his hands into whirring blenders, he'd be well-advised to focus on not doing that first, before worrying about his ambition's more costly requirements. Asking cities to abandon analogous forms of self-sabotage is a logical starting point for broader reform.

US vaccine consensus has officially shattered.

For decades, the American public, the federal government, and the medical community have been nearly unanimous: Vaccines are important because they save lives. Today, after years of escalating attacks, that consensus has irrevocably shattered.

The rupture has centered around, what else, the Covid vaccines. Yesterday, a British cardiologist allied with US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told the Daily Beast that the Trump administration would soon pull Covid-19 vaccines off the market. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics said that the group would continue to recommend Covid vaccines for kids under the age of 2 — openly defying Kennedy's move this May to end the recommendation for both healthy children and pregnant people.

The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, saying on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country's leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of the evidence that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children.

Kennedy, in response, ominously warned the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don't follow the government's vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy's scrutiny.

And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is meeting this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of Trump's “Operation Warp Speed” during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed.

As a result of all this, more people could get sick.

Drug manufacturers may produce fewer doses of their existing vaccines. Insurers may not be willing to cover people's shots if they are not being recommended by the government. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can't find one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won't be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won't cover it anymore. That will leave them to decide between taking the risk to go see their loved one, who could get seriously ill, or not seeing them at all.

We are running headlong into a forced experiment, in which the federal government actively obstructs the usage of vaccines and the development of new ones, and a growing share of the public has lost their faith in one of modern medicine's greatest tools.

That the federal government and professional medical societies would be openly at war over vaccine guidance in this way really was once unimaginable. Around the turn of the century, more than 90 percent of Americans agreed that childhood immunizations were important. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully eradicated measles as of 2000.

But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still believe that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw its worst measles outbreak since the early 1990s, and Kennedy's health department was, based on reporting by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements waffling on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective.

How did we get here?

Well, for starters, even though anti-vaccine activism has existed for decades, the movement received a boost with the COVID-19 pandemic and the way it polarized people's opinions about public health experts. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy's presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found an uneasy home within the Trump administration. After Trump's election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government's support for vaccines.

In the first few months on the job, he put a vaccine skeptic in charge of searching for a link between vaccines and autism. He unilaterally rolled back those COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for kids and pregnant people. He replaced the federal government's expert vaccine panel with his own handpicked members. He has ordered a review of the childhood immunization schedule, as well as the safety of Covid shots. He canceled a $500 million mRNA vaccine contract.

This is a fight Kennedy wanted. But now the medical community is punching back. Americans, meanwhile, are stuck in the middle, just as we head into another cold-and-flu season.

﻿NFL dance squads and sorority rush dances have become the front lines of gender anxiety.

The first ever cheerleader — according to USA Cheer, the governing body of American sport cheering — was a man from Minnesota. The sport was born in 1898, when a male student at the University of Minnesota spontaneously got up and led the crowd in a cheer for the football team. Men have always been a part of cheerleading; multiple US presidents, including Ronald Reagan, were cheerleaders in college, and male cheerleaders have been a part of the NFL sidelines for decades.

So how is it that Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn, the two male cheerleaders added to the Minnesota Vikings' squad last May, have received such widespread backlash? After a recent social media promo, the range of people who spoke out against the Vikings for adding the duo to their squad included a former Viking, a senator, and plenty of Fox News commentators. Suddenly, the Vikings were being blamed for helping perpetuate, as one Instagram commenter put it, “the sissification of America.”

The team has also received plenty of support from Vikings fans and other members of the public, as well as other men on NFL cheer squads. Some NFL teams have seized the moment to brag about their own mixed-gender dance squads. The backlash seems to be coming from a minority here, and isn't likely to change the NFL's embrace of all-gender sidelines. But what's interesting here is the timing. Men have been on NFL cheerleading teams for years. Why is this sudden groundswell of anger happening now?

Alongside the Vikings backlash, social media users have also been touting viral clips of sorority rush dances, claiming them as “wins” for conservative America and traditional values. How is it, exactly, that choreographed, celebratory group dance has become a front line, so to speak, of the culture wars around gender and sexuality?

This movement to impose rigid gender standards and assumptions on groups of people who shake might be ahistorical, but it exemplifies the shifting boundaries of the culture wars. Conservative commentators have been in conflict with the NFL — which the Heritage Foundation declared “woke” last year — and the universities that house these sororities. Now, they're looking to reclaim the sidelines — and the line dancers.

The Vikings inadvertently kickstarted the brouhaha on August 9 by posting a lively clip of their new dance squad on Instagram. The video featured Conn front and center, smiling and doing a backflip before joining the rest of the squad in their routine. Both men are dedicated dancers. Shiek has been dancing for a decade and was part of his college dance squad at North Dakota State University. Conn just led his Iowa State team to win the National Cheer and Dance Championship.

Cheerleading has always been associated with football, but its origins as a masculine hobby are often overlooked. Not only was the sport historically male-inclusive, but for decades after it began, it was exclusively a male hobby. It wasn't until World War II, when women stepped into roles previously designated for men, that all-women cheerleading teams became the norm.

“Cheerleading was the epitome of masculinity,” Natalie Adams, a rare cheerleading expert and author of the forthcoming book Cheer Matters: Gender, Race, Sex and Belonging in an American Institution, told me. “As late as 1939 at the college level, there was this premier cheerleading league that was… all male.”

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

The early 20th-century association of cheerleading with collegiate Americana, patriotism, and athleticism has never really faded, and men have remained a part of the sport. The Baltimore Ravens have had an entire multi-gender stunt team, dedicated to tumbling, lifts, and acrobatics, on the sidelines since the late '90s. For a while, so did the Indianapolis Colts. The Dallas Cowboys have long touted having the NFL's only multi-gender dance and drum line, the Rhythm & Blue Dancers.

In 2018, two NFL teams, the Rams and the Saints, quietly added men to their dance-focused cheerleading squads. The Rams took their new male dancers to the Super Bowl in 2019. Since then, 11 other teams around the NFL — including the Vikings, which have had men on their squads before — have joined in adding male dancers to their sidelines. In 2022, the Carolina Panthers welcomed the NFL's first trans cheerleader, Justine Lindsay. (She's leaving to focus on pageantry work.) The Ravens currently brag about having 19 men on their still-fire stunt squad.

At the time these changes happened, they ruffled few cultural feathers. Arguably the primary reasons for that were the widespread cultural resurgence for gender equality sparked by Me Too and the loosening of gender norms that came with a greater societal embrace of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, both of which meant a few teams adding men to dance teams wasn't a cause for concern. There were other factors, as well. Netflix's 2020 documentary series Cheer sparked a wave of cultural respect for cheerleading as a sport (though competitive cheer and pro-football cheer tend to be very different). The NFL, meanwhile, faced battles of a different sort: The cultural right spent those years fixating on Colin Kaepernick and Black Lives Matter protests in the sport.

And so, cultural outrage lay dormant until the Minnesota Vikings announced its new fall cheerleading lineup in 2025.

The substance of the backlash around Sheik and Conn has been focused on their masculinity, with statements and online comments that are both homophobic, and — despite the fact that both dancers are cis men — transphobic.

“I don't have anything against male cheerleaders ... There have been male cheerleaders around a long time,” Fox pundit Will Cain said in a segment on the backlash. “[But] if we're really being honest, we're talking about male cheerleaders being female cheerleaders.”

While the exact meaning of Cain's comment is unclear — again, neither male cheerleader identifies as trans or nonbinary — he seems to be referring to Conn and Sheik's style of dance, which matches their female counterparts'. If the concern is about supposed femininity, exactly how closely should the squad's coach police their athletes for signs of gender fluidity? Yet again, the red-blooded Dallas Cowboys have had men bumping and grinding alongside women on their dance team for well over a decade, and few people seem to be questioning their masculinity.

The Vikings cheer squad seem to have picked up on the transphobic subtext of the arguments against them. One squad member, Brianna Putney, has since posted a viral TikTok video showing Conn and Shiek dancing alongside their squadmates in a women's bathroom. These arguments also seem to coincide with an underlying substrain of misogyny — the idea that “real men” belong on the field while women need to remain on the sidelines. As Putney's video suggests, it's the blurring of those gender roles that's the real offense.

To understand how this works in a sport that was once exclusively male, we have to understand that, historically, once the makeup of cheerleading changed from male-only to women-only, cheerleading itself became associated with normative ideal femininity. “Desirable characteristics for a cheerleader were things like charm, popularity, attractiveness,” Adams said, “all feminized traits … nothing about athleticism.”

Where previously, male cheerleaders were seen as campus leaders who were capable of crowd control, by 1955, the role had changed. Women were seen as being incapable of leading the crowd the way men could; their presence was increasingly about being eye candy. This change solidified in 1972, when the Dallas Cowboys, which had previously had an unofficial co-ed squad of high school cheerleaders, swapped them out for a line of choreographed dancers — a move that ushered in the modern iteration of pro NFL cheerleading, catering to an audience that was assumed to be straight male by default.

Cheryl Cooky, professor of American Studies at Purdue, notes that this move coincided with the shift in thinking about football itself as not just sport, but entertainment, alongside the emergence of broadcast sports. As football became a form of cultural power during the Cold War, alongside social trends like the Kennedy fitness test, the sport highlighted “fears around the virility of American men, and how we would compete with [world powers],” Cooky said.

That militarism, still on display in football today, gets coded as masculine and conservative, while cheerleading gets coded as its feminine opposite — a stigma that arguably leads to women on professional cheerleading squads being minimized, disrespected, and underpaid. That's finally changing, but those changes also threaten to destabilize the binary gender presentation that football players and cheerleaders conveniently represents. Thus, male cheerleaders who perform choreography alongside women on the squad are doing even more to disrupt the gender order in a moment where politicization of gender is extreme.

If the NFL is becoming destabilized and “woke,” then where else can we look for a reinforcement of that gender binary? Conservatives seem to have latched onto college sororities as an alternative — specifically, the sorority rush dance.

This year, multiple rush videos have gone viral in right-leaning social media corners, with posters on Twitter and other platforms claiming both the videos and the women in them for right-wing culture and framing them as “wins” in the culture war against liberalism. There's no solid evidence these women are politically conservative themselves (women who attend college have consistently leaned liberal since the 1980s), but the wave of enthusiasm for these young, attractive women seems directly tied to the anxiety around gender in cheerleading.

“What conjures in my mind is preppy white kids going to football games, being involved in Greek life…quintessential ‘All-American,' ‘big man on campus' [tropes],” said Cooky. She argues that the trend has ties to the tradwife movement, the “old money” trend, and other recent conservative aesthetic trends. If women on the NFL sidelines are demanding more equality and better pay while they perform dances for a broader audience, these sorority rush videos allow conservative men to resume the fantasy of an elegant, hot woman dancing just for them.

Underlying these two trends is the basic question: Who gets to dance, and why? The idea seems to be that white, young, beautiful, conservative-coded women are allowed to perform for a presumed straight cisgender male audience, but only in formation and only on the sidelines. It's also worth pointing out that when talented groups of Black women dancers go viral, they often face backlash for performing the same dance styles that many conservatives seem to now be applauding.

Cooky also argues that the larger conversation is equally about masculinity and what kind of man gets to benefit from male privilege. “It's not just that [men are] dancing, it's where they're dancing,” she said. “It's that they're dancing within the space of football.”

She points out that nobody's upset that there are male ballet dancers. That's because “NFL football has this cultural dominance and visibility and capital in ways that other spaces [don't].” Meanwhile, while other aspects of higher education are under fire, Greek life and the college football milieu arguably still represent a version of Americana to conservatives that the NFL has been steadily moving away from, which is why it's so important to conservatives to claim them as their spaces. “These are the anchors of universities for a reason,” Cooky said.

It makes sense, then, that conservatives have a vested interest in dictating who gets to dance on the football sidelines and on college campuses. Historically, after all, dance has long been used to challenge societal structures, from dances on protest lines to Hairspray's interracial sock hops.

Yet the act of movement, of claiming bodily autonomy, of expressing joy through motion — these are all things that are extremely difficult to wrangle or restrict. Inevitably, drawing lines around who can and can't dance only incites more of us to cut footloose.

Latino voters will be crucial to either party's gerrymandering plans.

Underlying the redistricting arms race that Texas Republicans kicked off this summer (and to which California Democrats are responding) are two wagers both parties are making about Latino voters.

Texas Republicans are expecting that Latinos will either continue the rightward shift they've been undergoing for the last two presidential cycles — or at least remain as Republican as they were in 2024. Democrats in California, meanwhile, are expecting that Latino voters will retain their allegiances and boost Democratic candidates in redrawn battleground districts around the state.

Who ends up being right — and which way the trend with Latino voters unfolds — may determine not just a handful of seats, but overall control of the House of Representatives after next year's midterms.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

These new political maps being drawn in both states might also teach America's political parties a familiar lesson: Population changes don't guarantee political outcomes, and political power shifts are never permanent. Latinos make up about a third of eligible voters in both states, and have been trending toward Republicans over the last few years, but there are plenty of signs this shift might slow down — or even reverse — in the future.

Of the five new Republican-leaning congressional districts that the Texas GOP has pushed through the state legislature, two are majority-Latino districts in southern Texas. It's these two districts that the elections analyst Eli McKown-Dawson has noted are not necessarily guaranteed Republican pick-ups.

These two districts are about 87 and 72 percent Latino, currently represented by incumbent Democrats, and even under the new map, would have voted for Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential election. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn has written, these districts are still full of Democratic-leaning Latino voters. With the dynamic during midterm elections of lower propensity, Trump-friendly voters not showing up at the same rate as during presidential elections, it's conceivable that Democrats could still hold onto these seats next year.

Over the last two presidential cycles, Latino support for Democratic presidential candidates in California has fallen by nearly 20 points.

McKown-Dawson actually ran a few experiments to see what those conditions would be, and the result shouldn't be that surprising: Regardless of whether Democrats experience a strong anti-Trump and anti-incumbent midterm boost around the country, they will need to win back a good amount of Latino support in the state. In 2024, a majority of Latino voters sided with Trump, who won them 55 percent to 45 percent. It was emblematic of the national rightward shift that spiked from the 2020 election to last year.

However, a reversal in this dynamic, to something closer to the pre-2024 baseline, would yield Democratic wins. McKown-Dawson estimates that Democrats winning a slight majority of Latino voters, something between 51 and 53 percent, could be enough for Democrats to hold one, or even both seats.

With the evidence we have, this all seems like a possibility. Recent polling and analysis conducted by the Democratic-aligned Equis firm has found a consistent trend among Latino voters in general, and Trump-voting Latinos specifically: dissatisfaction with Trump and the GOP, changed minds over future votes, and room for Democrats to expand their level of support. Dissatisfaction with Trump's performance is high among Latino voters nationally. That will need to trickle down to battleground districts like these two south Texas seats, where the field is more competitive. Democrats have a narrow 47 percent to 36 percent lead in these districts, not as wide as it might need to be, yet.

If Republicans end up being proven right, however, and Latino voters across the country continue to shift right, that could mean more danger for Democrats in California. In the Golden State, Democrats chose to respond to Texas's redrawing of maps not just by targeting Republican-held seats and adding in more supposedly Democratic voters, but also by trying to shore up support for Democratic incumbents in battleground seats that would be competitive next year. The California redistricting plan, passed by the legislature, is up for a statewide vote in November. For now, polling suggests it will pass by comfortable margins.

Key to this, as Los Angeles Times columnist Gustavo Arellano wrote this week, are Latino voters in the Central Valley, Orange County, and pockets around the state. At least one Republican-held seat in northern California is being made more Democratic by adding a swath of Latino voters to the district, while one GOP-held seat in the majority-Latino Central Valley would still be a toss-up, even under the new boundaries of the district. Three other Democratic districts, represented by Josh Harder, Adam Gray, and Derek Tran, meanwhile, are all being made safer by including more Latino voters in their electorates.

But these moves all assume that California Latinos will remain as Democratic as they are right now, or that any rightward drift from the past ten years will revert back to their side. Trump's unpopularity and the signs of buyer's remorse among Trump-voting Latinos offer some evidence, but historically, it's these districts, and Latino voters specifically, that have become more Republican since Trump's first election.

Over the last two presidential cycles, Latino support for Democratic presidential candidates in California has fallen by nearly 20 points, according to research from the Democratic firm Catalist. Last year in California, Kamala Harris saw a 10-point drop compared to Biden in 2020. And Biden himself saw a 7-point drop compared to Hillary Clinton in 2016. So it's completely plausible that any continued rightward shift might end up causing these Democratic moves to backfire.

Overall, both parties in both states are making a bet that Latino political support moves solidly in one direction or the other. It's obviously too early to say which side will be proven right, but the ethnic and racial politics at play here will probably demonstrate yet again how diverse and different Latino voters are, while also showing that they are America's new swing voters.

The job market's boy problems are getting worse.

A new analysis of publicly available data shows that unemployment is rising among younger men, and their labor force participation is stagnating. The good news is that there are some fixes.

""Over the last year, things have gotten worse for young men,"" Sara Estep, an economist at the Center for American Progress and one of the report's authors, told Business Insider. While young men's unemployment levels are below historical levels, ""things are definitely moving in the wrong direction.""

The analysis highlights both the issues plaguing the male workforce and where men are making strides; it also illustrates where policymakers and worker organizations can step in.

Fewer men in the workforce could lead to understaffed industries and weigh on the coffers of Social Security — and the men who aren't working might be at risk of worsening mental health and declining happiness. Funneling younger men toward secondary education and vocational school might help; so can opening up opportunities for workers with disabilities.

Are you a man who's dropped out of the labor force, or never joined it? Contact this reporter at jkaplan@businessinsider.com.

The working status — or lack thereof — of younger men and men who are considered prime working-age, which is 25 to 54, has been plaguing the economy over the last few years. A Pew Research Center analysis found that, in 2021, 25-year-old men were less likely than their predecessors in older generations to work full-time and to have achieved financial independence. Young men are more likely to be living with a parent than their female peers.

But once they reach post-education age, there's another reason men may not be participating in the workforce: disability. The average share of men ages 22 to 27 who cited disability as their reason for nonparticipation in the labor force was 4% from April to June 2025, compared to 2% among women. As the report notes, men are more likely to work in environments that lend themselves to injury; the rise in disability might also be chalked up to an aging population, long COVID, and better medical diagnostics.

Estep said that's one place where policy could step in. Eliminating or beefing up measures like the subminimum wage, which allows employers to hire workers with disabilities at a rate below the federal minimum, could make an impact — although a Biden-era proposed rule to bring disabled workers up to the minimum wage was withdrawn in July.

""If wages are rising, that typically pulls people into the labor force that might've been outside of it before,"" Estep said.

Some younger men might be catching on to a fresh path forward. The analysis found that young men's enrollment in vocational schools jumped from 2022 to 2023, the highest share of young men's enrollment since data first started being collected.

It's unclear whether that's part of a larger trend or a yearlong blip in the wake of a destabilizing pandemic and labor market. It might reflect Gen Z's growing interest in the trades, especially as industries traditionally dominated by men contract and work like healthcare shows robust growth.

""I think there is still a lot to do for men in education. We're seeing worse outcomes for men across the board and boys,"" Estep said. ""And so investments in early childhood, improvements to the way that men move through the educational system and track into college or a skilled trade might be something worth pursuing.""

Of course, gender disparities persist across the workforce and labor market; women still contend with wage gaps and are more likely to leave the labor force over caregiving. Estep said that addressing labor market concerns — like those of men eschewing work or women getting shortchanged on pay — is not a zero-sum game. Things like funding toward affordable, high-quality childcare that would mean women can work would also help keep the labor market staffed.

""There are plenty of ways we can grow the labor force, and we hopefully aren't in a situation where we only can pick one thing,"" she said.

It's a bad day to be Adobe.

Google has said it's behind a viral image editor that's been generating a lot of online buzz. We wrote about it, Redditors raved about it, and now it's here for everyone to try.

The company announced Tuesday that Google DeepMind created the model, and it's integrating it into the Gemini app and website so that anyone can use it. While it was tested under the name ""Nano Banana,"" the model is actually named Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Google's been testing the new model on LMArena, a public site that crowdsources anonymous feedback on AI model quality. It showed up as Nano Banana, but users were quick to guess that Google was behind it.

Google said Gemini 2.5 Flash's particular strength is in keeping a person or animal's likeness the same from image to image. Based on the feedback so far, Google claims that users prefer the new model over those from OpenAI and other rivals, based on its Elo score — a method for calculating the relative skill levels of generative models.

Business Insider has been testing the model for several days, and we've found it generally better than rival tools. It's not perfect — it sometimes struggled to replicate faces when combining two different photos — but it's especially strong at making small tweaks to existing pictures.

In the example below, we asked it to add glasses to the photo of this article's author and to change the color of the T-shirt to red. While several models got the glasses and the color correct, Google's was the only one to retain the stripe pattern on the T-shirt. It was also one of the sharper results.

That could pose a serious threat to existing editing tools, in particular Adobe's suite of programs, such as Photoshop. Google told Business Insider it sees Gemini 2.5 Flash as a tool both for consumers and professionals. It's also providing access to both paying and non-paying Gemini users.

Adobe also said on Tuesday that it would immediately make Google's new model available in Adobe Firefly and Adobe Express.

Asked why users might want to use Adobe's tools instead of going to Google directly, Adobe told Business Insider its advantage is offering all of these models in one place so that users don't have to bounce between different platforms. A spokesperson later added that Adobe also lets creators move their creations between different Adobe apps.

Right now, that has done little to allay investor concerns. Adobe's share price has dropped 35% in the past year, hit in part by analyst fears about AI's impact on these traditional tools.

We'll be testing out the new Gemini model in Google's native app to see if the results are any different.

Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook will file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Donald Trump, her atto``rney said Tuesday.

""President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,"" the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, a day after Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud by Cook in firing her.

""His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis,"" Lowell said.

""We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.""

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Lowell's statement.

The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's action, nor replied to CNBC's question about whether Cook is working at her office on Tuesday or remotely.

If Cook does sue, the case could end up being decided by the Supreme Court.

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 says that a president can fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board only ""for cause.""

That has long been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty while a board member.

The Justice Department last week opened a criminal investigation of Cook after she was accused of making false statements on home mortgage applications by Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte.

Pulte pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia claiming they were each her primary residence, which he claimed was done ""in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.""

The documents would have been signed before Cook joined the Fed.

Trump cited those allegations on Monday night in a letter to Cook notifying her of her removal.

Cook responded Monday, saying in a statement, ""President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so.""

""I will not resign,"" she said. ""I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.""

In this article

President Donald Trump weighed in Tuesday on the controversial rebranding of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, writing that, ""Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll) and manage the company better than ever before.""

""They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post, just a day after Cracker Barrel told customers the company could have handled its rebranding better than it did.

""Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity. Have a major News Conference today. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again,"" Trump wrote.

The White House's official X account later tweeted, ""Go woke, go broke,"" with a reimagined Cracker Barrel logo featuring Trump sitting next to the company's iconic barrel, with the words ""America First"" and ""America is Back.""

Trump's comments came nearly a week after his son Donald Trump Jr. blasted the company for the rebranding, and after the company's stock dropped after the new logo was unveiled.

""WTF is wrong with @CrackerBarrel??!"" the younger Trump wrote Wednesday on X, echoing criticism from some conservatives.

As part of its rebranding, Cracker Barrel removed the image on its logo of its ""Uncle Herschel"" character leaning against a barrel.

The new logo also ditched the yellow barrel and the phrase ""Old Country Store,"" leaving just the words ""Cracker Barrel.""

Since the rebranding was unveiled last week, the new logo has been roasted on social media as ""soulless,"" ""bland"" and ""generic.""

In a statement Monday, Cracker Barrel said, ""If the last few days have shown us anything, it's how deeply people care about Cracker Barrel. We're truly grateful for your heartfelt voices.""

""You've also shown us that we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be,"" the company said.

But the company gave no indication that it would revert to its old logo.

The Federal Reserve was mum on Tuesday when asked whether Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook was at her office — or working remotely — a day after President Donald Trump said he had fired her.

The Fed's press office and Cook's high-powered lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not reply when CNBC asked if she was working Tuesday, and if so, where.

Security at the central bank's headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., likewise would not say whether Cook was in the building.

On Monday night, Cook said that she would remain in her job despite Trump having told her in a letter posted on Truth Social earlier in the evening that he was removing her ""for cause.""

The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements on home mortgage applications, which are being investigated by the Justice Department.

""I will not resign,"" Cook said in a statement late Monday. ""I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.""

Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, said that Trump did not have the authority to remove her because there was no legal cause for him to do so.

Pulte as evidence has pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia, which claimed they were each her primary residence. He accused Cook of ""falsifying residence statuses ... in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.""

It is unclear how Pulte acquired the applications, and Cook has not been charged with any crime.

Lowell, in his own statement Monday, said, ""We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.""

The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's announcement.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that he did not know who had the authority to halt Cook's paycheck or her access to the Federal Reserve buildings.

Lutnick demurred when asked if Trump could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for cause if Powell continued to authorize Cook's paycheck and access after the president had said she was fired.

""These are all 'what-if scenarios,'"" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""The answer is, the Department of Justice will go take this on and deal with this,"" he said.

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook and confirming her successor, then the majority of the seven members of the Fed's board would be Trump nominees.

In this article

EchoStar stock roared more than 75% higher on Tuesday after AT&T said it agreed to purchase certain wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for about $23 billion in an all-cash deal.

The sale will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, with the licenses covering more than 400 markets across the U.S., AT&T said. The deal is expected to close in mid-2026, pending regulatory approval.

EchoStar said in a regulatory filing that the transaction is part of the company's ""ongoing efforts to resolve the Federal Communications Commission's inquiries.""

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr wrote in a May letter addressed to EchoStar cofounder and Chairman Charlie Ergen that the agency's staff would investigate the company's compliance with federal requirements to build a 5G network.

The letter followed complaints from Elon Musk's SpaceX that EchoStar had left ""valuable mid-band spectrum chronically underused,"" and the FCC should take steps to let ""new satellite entrants"" put it to use.

SpaceX owns Starlink, which provides internet service through a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites.

As part of Tuesday's announcement, AT&T and EchoStar also agreed to expand their network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator providing wireless service under the Boost Mobile brand.

""EchoStar and Boost Mobile have met all of the FCC's network buildout milestones,"" Ergen said in a statement. ""However, this spectrum sale to AT&T and hybrid MNO agreement are critical steps toward resolving the FCC's spectrum utilization concerns.""

AT&T CEO John Stankey told CNBC that the deal is ""a win all the way around.""

""It's a fantastic opportunity to see more services put together the way customers want to buy them together,"" Stankey said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" ""And as a result of that, I think ultimately regulators are going to look at this and say it's very, very attractive.""

AT&T shares fell more than 1%.

Uncertainty around tariffs has caused even the wealthiest buyers of Lamborghini supercars to hold off on their purchases, CEO Stephan Winkelmann told CNBC.

While the White House recently announced an agreement with Europe on a 15% tariff rate, that rate hasn't yet taken effect for cars. Lamborghini and other European automakers are still paying a tariff rate of 27.5% on exports to the U.S. With the price of a Lamborghini starting at $400,000, many buyers are choosing to wait for more stable tariff rates before buying, Winkelmann said.

""Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place,"" Winkelmann said. ""Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations.""

Wherever the final tariff rate settles, however, Winkelmann said the levies will have some impact on the company's business. He said Lamborghinis can't be produced in the U.S., since the ""made in Italy"" promise is core to the brand. And he said that even the wealthy are sensitive to price increases.

""They are millionaires or billionaires for a reason, so they know what they're doing and why they're doing things,"" he said. ""For us, free trade is the right approach. We all know that is what we want. But then there is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity, since we are in business. ... We are ready to face whatever comes.""

For now, the company is fairly insulated from any immediate drop-off in demand, since it has a large back order. Cars being delivered today were ordered a year or two ago. Lamborghini announced this summer to dealers that prices would increase by 7% for the Temerario and Urus models and 10% for the Revuelto.

The company, owned by Volkswagen's Audi Group, is also riding high from a wave of new models. It reported record revenue in 2024 of more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) and deliveries of 10,867 cars. It's launched three new models since 2023, all plug-in hybrids: the 8-cylinder Temerario, which replaces the Huracan; the 12-cylinder Revuelto, which replaces the Aventador; and the Urus SE, a hybrid SUV.

For an upcoming fourth model, Lamborghini had announced an all-electric grand touring car to debut sometime in 2028. But Winkelmann said with EV demand slowing, the company is considering releasing it as a hybrid instead and will decide by the end of the year.

""There is a flattening in the acceptance of electric cars, not only at the high end and exclusive supercars, but also in the general market,"" he said. ""So the trend is going to be delayed in general, and we have to decide. For a car like Lamborghini, it's not important to be the first one to show a new technology, but to be there when it's accepted and to have the best technology at that time.""

Last week at Monterey Car Week, Lamborghini unveiled a new limited-production supercar called the Fenomeno. It's the fastest and most powerful Lambo yet, boasting 1,080 horsepower and 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds thanks to a 6.5-liter, V-12 engine paired with three electric motors.

Lamborghini will make only 29 Fenomenos, which are part of what Winkelmann calls the ""few-offs"" strategy of super-rare, hyper-performance versions of its current lineup for top clients.

Also helping the company: a surge in wealth around the world that's becoming younger and more diverse. Lamborghini owners have an average of five cars in their garage, and owners of the higher-priced Lambos have an average of 10 cars. The average age of the Lamborghini buyer now is under 45, and in Asia it's under 30, he said.

""There are a lot of countries where we have very young customers,"" he said. ""We have the second generation of wealth. But we also have a very young customer base of entrepreneurs who made their money themselves.""

Relative to the growth in global wealth, however, Lamborghini's production has remained small. And while the U.S. is still its largest market, Lamborghini carefully manages supply in every country to make sure the brand remains exclusive and special, Winkelmann said.

""We will always look to make sure we do not crowd one market, and to have always a global view where we are selling the cars,"" he said.

Women, he said, will also be a key driver. The Urus has welcomed more women buyers to the brand, and Lamborghini is holding more women-focused events, like the ""She Drives a Lambo"" driving gatherings.

""We have always been a very male-driven brand, very attractive to males with the design and performance,"" Winkelmann said. ""But on the other side, we are seeing that with the Urus, we have a lot more women stepping into the brand and having confidence with the brand.""

In this article

Top officials at the Pentagon are ""thinking about"" whether the U.S. should acquire equity stakes in leading defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday.

The Cabinet secretary, in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" revealed the Defense Department's interest in taking those stakes days after the U.S. government acquired 10% of Intel stock in a roughly $9 billion deal.

Lutnick was asked if the Trump administration would repeat that move with other companies that do business with the government.

""Oh there's a monstrous discussion about defense,"" Lutnick replied.

Lockheed, which makes most of its revenue from federal contracts, is ""basically an arm of the U.S. government,"" he said.

""But what's the economics of that? I'm going to leave that to my Secretary of Defense and the deputy Secretary of Defense.""

""These guys are on it and they're thinking about it,"" he said.

Lutnick added that President Donald Trump is rethinking how the U.S. ought to finance its munitions and other defense capabilities.

""I tell you, the way it has been done has been a giveaway,"" Lutnick claimed. His remark could suggest that the Trump administration is considering a major overhaul of Pentagon appropriations, which are approved annually by Congress.

A Lockheed spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, ""As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense.""

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Lockheed is the world's top defense company by revenue, according to DefenseNews' 2024 list. Other top U.S. contractors include RTX, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing.

Trump's move to take ownership of a chunk of Intel, an embattled chipmaker, is a major escalation in his efforts to achieve his economic goals by exerting more and more government control over the private economy.

Trump said Monday that he would make similar deals ""all day long.""

Lutnick said Friday that the agreement Trump struck with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan ""strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.""

But the move has drawn heated criticism — including from some conservatives, who warn that Trump's action cuts against free-market principles and poses risks for both Intel and the economy.

""The most immediate risk is that Intel's decisions will increasingly be driven by political rather than commercial considerations,"" economist Scott Lincicome of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., wrote in an X post, ""If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn't the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?""

A perfect storm of industry and economic challenges have weighed on Germany's autos sector, which has shed tens of thousands of jobs over a one-year stretch to the end of June.

Over that period, Germany's autos industry, one of the European country's largest sectors, has seen job cuts of close to 7% of the workforce, or around 51,500 positions, according to new analysis from EY based on data from the German statistics office Destatis.

Overall job losses across the German industry amounted to around 114,000 in the 12 months to June 30 this year, the study noted. The figures suggest almost half the cuts were incurred by the autos sector.

""No other industrial sector has recorded such a strong reduction in employment,"" the report said, according to a CNBC translation. The study flagged that 112,000 jobs have been cut in the autos sector, compared to the 2019 period preceding the Covid-19 pandemic.

Jan Brorhilker, managing partner of the assurance division at EY in Germany, said in a press release that the job reductions came in a response to the difficult situation of the German auto industry.

""Massive profit declines, overcapacities, and ailing foreign markets make a marked reduction of jobs impossible to avoid,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation.

EY's report also noted that revenues in the sector pulled back 1.6% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in the previous year. German auto giant Volkswagen, for one, reported a sharp drop in second-quarter profit and lowered its full-year guidance.

The decline in the auto sector is notably a smaller drop than the 2.1% loss in revenues that the overall German industry is facing.

Germany's auto industry has long battled a multitude of challenges, such as stark Chinese competition on costs and innovation, as well as difficulties to gain ground in the electric vehicle race, which some auto makers and analysts have attributed to federal government bureaucracy and regulation.

U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy has added to concerns. Germany, and especially its autos sector, are heavily export oriented and count the U.S. as one of their biggest markets, where the 'Made in Germany' label has historically been seen as a sign of quality.

Recent data from Destatis showed that auto and auto part exports to the U.S. declined by 8.6% in the first half of 2025, compared to the same period last year. Auto makers have also repeatedly warned of the potential impact of tariffs and surrounding uncertainty.

The industry may enjoy some relief after details of the U.S-EU trade agreement emerged earlier this months. Autos will be subject to 15% duties, but only after the EU makes legislation changes to reduce its industrial levies.

The state of Germany's overall economy has also been a headwind for the autos sector, with the country's annual gross domestic product declining in both 2023 and 2024. This year also appears to be off to a slow start: after Europe's largest economy recorded 0.3% growth in the first quarter, the latest figures for the second quarter indicated a 0.3% decline.

Looking ahead, EY's Brorhilker says he expects German auto exports to both the U.S. and China to stay under pressure, with the former being impacted by tariffs and the latter by weakening demand, which is also a domestic issue.

As various German industrial giants are currently undergoing restructuring or cost reduction programs, ""the number of industry jobs will keep falling,"" Brorhilker said.

The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has quit its investments in U.S. machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks following a review of the companies' ties to conflict in the West Bank.

The executive board of Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population and is valued at around $2 trillion, said Monday there was an ""unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to serious violations of the rights of individuals in situations of war and conflict."" The decision was based on recommendations from its ethics council, it said.

NBIM said that bulldozers manufactured by New York-listed Caterpillar were ""being used by Israeli authorities in the widespread unlawful destruction of Palestinian property."" NBIM had a $2.4 billion stake in the company at the end of 2024, representing around 1.2% ownership. CNBC has contacted Caterpillar for comment.

NBIM said it will divest from banks including First International Bank of Israel and its majority owner FIBI Holdings, Bank Leumi Le Israel BM, Mizrahi Tefahot Bank and Bank Hapoalim BM. The businesses had provided financial services needed for construction activity in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which had been ""established in violation of international law,"" NBIM said. CNBC has reached out to the banks for comment.

NBIM has come under growing political and public pressure to divest from its investments in firms linked to conflict in Palestinian territories, particularly with Norway heading to the polls in two weeks. In an interview with Sweden's Dagens Industri, NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen last week described the fund as facing a ""crisis,"" and said he regretted that he had not flagged an issue with the fund owning a stake in an Israeli fighter jet company while strikes on Gaza escalated.

Earlier this month, NBIM announced it would review its investments in Israeli companies in response to a request from Norway's Ministry of Finance, which flagged questions related to the deteriorating situation in Gaza and the West Bank. NBIM also said it would sell all holdings of Israeli companies outside of its equity benchmark index ""as soon as possible,"" and terminate contracts with external asset managers in Israel. There were 56 Israeli companies in its benchmark index at the end of the first half of the year, which it had reduced to 38 as of Aug. 14.

The fund is meanwhile balancing its mandate to generate the highest possible net returns, while seeking to avoid any political backlash in the U.S., a supporter of Israel.

Around 55% of the fund's equity investments are in the U.S., with 70% of its portfolio allocated to stocks. The fund's high weighting toward the tech sector helped drive a $222 billion annual profit last year, followed by a $40 billion loss in the first quarter.

Critics of calls for Israeli divestment note that the fund continues to invest in the assets of other countries that have faced accusations of human rights violations, along with oil and other politically controversial sectors.

The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has risen to a record high this year even as Israel has engaged in war on multiple fronts.

NBIM Deputy CEO Trond Grande told CNBC on Aug. 12 that the fund would continue to be invested in Israel via the benchmark index.

While acknowledging "" increased scrutiny"" within Norway, Grande said: ""What we're doing now is really not down-weighing, I wouldn't put it like that, but we are trying to simplify our portfolio in Israeli equities, because we have ethical guidelines as well.""

""What's key to us is that we're not invested in companies that could be in some way, shape or form, contributing to violating the ethical guidelines that we have,"" he said.

""The exclusions by NBIM highlight the unavoidable collision between business and human rights,"" Ana Nacvalovaite, research fellow at University of Oxford specializing in sovereign wealth funds, told CNBC.

NBIM ""has not engaged in ad hoc sanctioning, but applied criteria long embedded in its mandate. Historical data from the fund has shown that ethical screens have barely dented long-term returns so far and in some cases improved them, it remains to be seen how this move will impact the [sovereign wealth fund's] investments,"" Nacvalovaite said.

""This has been a clear signal that the mandate is applied universally, whether to U.S. industrials or Israeli lenders.""

In this article

Frontier Airlines is going after customers of Spirit Airlines, whose financial footing has gotten so shaky in recent weeks that it warned earlier this month it might not be able to survive another year without more cash.

Frontier on Tuesday announced 20 routes it plans to start this winter, many of them in major Spirit markets like its base at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. Frontier overlaps with Spirit on 35% of its capacity, more than any other airline, according to a Monday note from Deutsche Bank airline analyst Michael Linenberg.

Some of Frontier's new routes from Fort Lauderdale include flights to Detroit, Houston, Chicago, and Charlotte, North Carolina. It's also rolling out routes from Houston to New Orleans; San Pedro Sula, Honduras; and Guatemala City.

Frontier had tried and failed to merge with its budget-airline rival several times since 2022.

""I'm not here to talk about M&A,"" Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday when asked whether Frontier would buy Spirit. Biffle said he expects that Frontier would pick up the majority of Spirit's market share if Spirit collapsed.

Both carriers have struggled from changing customer tastes for more upmarket seats and trips abroad, an oversupply of domestic capacity, and higher labor and other costs. Spirit's situation has become more dire however, after it emerged from four months of bankruptcy protection in March facing many of the same problems.

Ultra-low cost airlines are also challenged by larger rivals like United Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines that have rolled out their own no-frills basic economy tickets but also offer customers bigger choices of destinations and other perks on board like snacks and beverages.

Stock prices of rival airlines surged after Spirit's warning earlier this month.

Biffle said the carrier wants to become the country's largest budget airline and has rolled out loyalty matching programs to grab more customers. Frontier's capacity was slightly smaller than Spirit's in the second quarter, through the latter had slashed its flying by nearly 24% from a year earlier, while Frontier was down only 2%.

Spirit last week said it drew down the entire $275 million of its revolver and while it reached a two-year extension on its credit card processing agreement with U.S. Bank National Association, it agreed that it would hold back up to $3 million a day from the carrier.

The airline lost $245.8 million in the second quarter. Frontier lost $70 million.

Spirit has been looking for ways to slash costs, including furloughing and demoting hundreds more pilots and cutting unprofitable routes. Hundreds of flight attendants are on unpaid leaves of absence.

Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in an Aug. 12 staff memo after its ""going concern"" warning that ""the team and I are confident that we can build a Spirit that will continue to provide consumers the unmatched value that they have come to expect for many years to come.""

The carrier reached a deal with bondholders who agreed to convert debt to equity in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn't cut other costs like renegotiating aircraft leases. Leasing firms have been reaching out to rivals in recent weeks to gauge whether competitors would take any of the Airbus planes that are in Spirit's hands, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Trump administration's latest escalation of the trade war with China has drawn several parallels to its origins back in 2018.

However, there is a significant difference: the degree to which U.S. companies looked to avoid rising tariffs by racing to bring in more and more products from China ahead of them.

When comparing the peak of frontloading that occurred in 2018 compared to 2025, U.S. shippers imported more than double the percentage of Chinese exports this year, according to data from ImportGenius.

To compare the differences, CNBC used data from ImportGenius that dates back to 2016 prior to the Trump trade war rhetoric.

In 2025, there have been three major frontloading events as a result of the changing tariffs.

Ahead of ""Liberation Day,"" importers began rushing in containers from China starting in January, followed by a slight decrease in February and March. A second smaller frontloading occurred between March and April. The peak in the pulling forward of freight from China to the U.S. came in between June to July, where exports soared by 49% after tariff rates were lowered to 34%.

In 2018, the height of freight loading came in the Fall: between the months of September and October where there was a 12.2% increase in containers, and between the months of October and November, there was an additional 22% increase.

But there are signs now that the level of exports from China is starting to drop, seen in key shipping data like ocean freight bookings and ocean container spot rates.

""The difference in exports from China to the U.S. between July and August of this year is a 40% drop,"" said Lynn Hughes, an investigative analyst at ImportGenius. ""Yes, the month isn't over yet, but realistically, we still only have a week. Considering the amount of demand already pulled forward at the beginning of the year and the steady decline, I feel we could be about to start seeing imports drop below 600k TEU for several months.""

These orders have been entering U.S. ports in July and August. The ocean freight orders being placed in July and August will start arriving in September and October.

Spot rates on the Transpacific route have also steadily declined, according to maritime data company Drewry. Rates from Shanghai–Los Angeles fell 3% ($2,412/forty-foot equivalent unit/ feu), and the rate on the Shanghai–New York route reduced 5% ($3,463/feu).

On its website, Drewry noted, ""The phase of accelerated purchasing by U.S. retailers, which induced an early peak season, has ended. In response to a decelerating U.S. economy and increased tariff costs, they are now scaling back on procurement. Hence, Drewry expects spot rates to be less volatile in the coming weeks.""

Hughes said there was a four-month drop in Chinese goods entering the U.S., after the first frontloading event in 2018. The pattern has also been seen in several other frontloading patterns. This includes after the February 2025 frontloading, when US shippers raced to pull forward products ahead of ""Liberation Day.""

""We know what these patterns look like in shipping now, and this is the most imbalanced frontloading spike we've ever seen,"" said Hughes.

In this article

The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened on Tuesday with short-term yields falling and long-term yields rising after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank's board.

The 2-year yield was more than 4 basis points lower at 3.687%, while the 30-year yield added 2 basis points to 4.909%. The 10-year Treasury yield was less than 2 basis points lower at 4.26%. One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors bet on lower rates in the near future, but higher rates over the long-term after Trump chipped away at the Fed's independence by announcing the removal of Cook from her position via a post on his platform, Truth Social.

The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook made false statements on one or more of her mortgage agreements.

Cook will sue her removal by Trump, with her attorney saying in a statement Tuesday that the president has ""no authority"" to do so. Cook had said in a statement Monday evening that Trump ""purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so."" Cook, who is the first Black woman to become a Fed Governor, also said: ""I will not resign"" and that she will continue to serve in her role.

""The President is going to remake the Board Governors of the Federal Reserve over the next year, and he's doing so in very unconventional ways – we've had a resignation and now a termination, opening the door to accelerate this change,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. ""Trump has essentially usurped the Fed's forward guidance function for the time being and telling markets lower rates are coming, which is being manifest in a steeper yield curve, with short term treasuries dropping like a rock.""

And so investors bet perhaps the Fed would be less attentive to inflation in the future, making ownership of long-term bonds less favorable and sending those rates lower. The U.S. dollar declined vs. various currencies for a similar reason.

Investors also parsed through a raft of economic reports Tuesday. July's U.S. durable goods orders reading was better than economists polled by Dow Jones had expected. Consumer confidence data for August also came in stronger than expected.

They will now look to the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, later in the week for clues as to whether inflation is in a place where it would make sense for the central bank to lower rates, regardless of the political encroachment by Trump.

""State-owned enterprise"" is a term you wouldn't normally bandy about when mentioning the United States — especially not with the country's Republican party, which has been associated with a laissez-faire approach to businesses and the economy.

If White House gets it way, however, it appears that the government's 10% stake in Intel is just the start. U.S. President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post signaled favoring companies that strike similar ""lucrative"" deals with the government.

Earlier in the day, Kevin Hassett, Trump's economic advisor, told CNBC that ""at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries.""

Even though Intel's stock popped when news of the deal broke, the chipmaker in a filing on Monday warned that its agreement with the Trump administration could draw ""adverse reactions"" from investors, customers and foreign governments.

That's not an unwarranted fear: Recall how China has been urging its local companies to avoid Nvidia chips amid the chipmaker's revenue-sharing deal with Washington, or how consumers have steered away from Elon Musk's Tesla because of his stint in the White House.

Perhaps, it isn't so much ""state-owned enterprises,"" but ""Trump-associated enterprises,"" that might be fueling investor worries.

— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report

Trump threatens 200% tariffs on China over rare earths. If Beijing withholds exports of the magnets, Trump will charge the country ""200% tariffs or something,"" he said Monday stateside. One analyst thinks it's a signal that Trump wants a deal soon.

Trump fires Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In a letter posted on Truth Social, the U.S. president said he has determined ""sufficient cause"" to terminate her ""immediately."" Cook responded that Trump ""has no authority to do so"" because ""no cause exists under the law.""

Countries with digital services tax will attract 'substantial' new tariffs, vows Trump. In addition to tariffs, Trump also said in a Monday post on Truth Social that he would restrict chip exports to those countries.

U.S. stocks lost steam on Monday. All three major indexes fell, giving back some of Friday's gains. On Thursday, Interactive Brokers will replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the S&P 500. Asia-Pacific markets declined Tuesday.

[PRO] Consider this Nvidia derivative, CIO says. Nvidia earnings, out Wednesday, are in the limelight this week. But one chief investment officer thinks it's worth looking at a Nvidia partner also benefiting from artificial intelligence.

Ships, planes, billions in investment pledges: South Korea's Lee charms Trump with deals

The U.S. and South Korea announced a series of agreements Monday in Washington, including multibillion-dollar investments, record $50 billion aviation purchases by Korean Air, and new energy cooperation, as leaders from both countries met in the Oval Office.

""We really sort of need each other. We love what they do. We love their products. We love their ships. We love a lot of the things that they make, and they love what we have,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said during his press conference with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.

European stock markets retreated on Tuesday, pulled down by French equities as traders monitored the potential for the government to lose a confidence vote next month.

France's CAC 40 index plummeted more than 2% in early deals before paring losses to around 1.6% by the end of the trading session. The country's three main opposition parties said they would not back a surprise confidence vote called by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Monday for Sept. 8 over his budget plans.

Bayrou argues around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in budget cuts are needed to reduce the French deficit, which totaled 5.8% of GDP in 2024, with his proposals including freezing welfare spending, pensions and tax brackets.

Erik Nelson, head of G10 FX strategy at Wells Fargo, called the outlook for French assets ""not great"" — but said the outcome for Bayrou's government was not a foregone conclusion.

""I think part of the issue here is that European equities, the euro itself, have been a very popular momentum trade throughout the year. What we're seeing in the last couple of days has been a little bit of unwind.""

""I don't know that Bayrou is definitely out. There's still some uncertainty there. He's got a lot of things he can offer the opposition,"" Nelson continued, including that the French minister could back away from a contentious proposal to cut two public holidays.

""They're walking a very fine line here, and ... given where market positioning is in European assets, there's a lot of risks.""

Broader European markets were also lower as global investors monitored U.S. President Donald Trump's latest attempted intervention in the running of the Federal Reserve.

The U.K.'s FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were down 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively.

Trump's announcement on social media that he had fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook drove Asia-Pacific markets lower overnight. Cook said in a Monday statement that Trump did not have the authority to remove her and that she ""will not resign,"" leaving a legal dispute a potential next step.

It follows months of pressure by Trump on the central bank to lower interest rates, including repeated criticism of and threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

Markets rallied late last week after Powell gave a speech which spurred investors to price in a September rate cut by the Fed.

It's a relatively quiet week on the data and earnings front, with inflation figures from France, Germany, Italy and other European countries due on Friday. Stateside, tech industry bellweather Nvidia reports Wednesday.

Bitcoin BTC$109,809.76 and ether (ETH) options worth over $14.6 billion are set to expire Friday on Deribit in what's shaping up to be one of the most significant derivative events of 2025.

The expiry is heavily skewed toward BTC put options, underscoring a continued demand for downside protection, whereas it's more balanced for ether.

As of the time of writing, 56,452 BTC call option contracts and 48,961 put option contracts were due for settlement, totalling a notional open interest of $11.62 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for 80% of the global activity. On Deribit, one option contract represents one BTC or ETH.

A closer look at open interest reveals concentrated activity in put options with strike prices between $108,000 and $112,000. Conversely, the most popular call options are clustered at $120,000 and above.

In other words, near-the-money puts around BTC's current market price of approximately $110,000 are highly sought after, while calls with higher strike prices reflect hopes for further upside.

In ether's case, a total of 393,534 calls are due for settlement, outstripping the put tally of 291,128 by a significant margin, both totaling $3.03 billion in notional open interest.

Significant OI is concentrated in calls at strikes $3,800, $4,000 and $5,000, and put options at strikes $4,000, $3,700 and $2,200.

""BTC expiry points to persistent demand for downside protection, while ETH looks more neutral. Combined with Powell's Jackson Hole signal, this expiry may help set the market tone for September,"" Deribit said on X.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified future date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market. Meanwhile, a put option provides insurance against price slides.

The options market has grown leaps and bounds since 2020, with monthly and quarterly settlements gaining prominence as major market-moving events. 

By 2021, some observers proposed that prices tend to gravitate toward 'max pain' levels – the strike prices where options holders suffer the greatest losses – in the days leading up to expiry. However, the validity of this theory remains a matter of debate among traders and analysts.

As of writing, the max pain levels for bitcoin and ether are 116,000 and $3,800, respectively, serving as focal points for believers of the max pain theory.

 Bitcoin is repeating earlier BTC price behavior, analysis suggests as a Coinbase Premium comeback joins positive ETF flows for a crypto market rebound. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is “getting closer” to its next local bottom after a trip below the $109,000 mark.

A positive Coinbase Premium returns, raising hopes of a US demand recovery.

ETF flows end Monday positive in a surprise comeback despite the BTC price downside.

Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around $110,000 at Tuesday's Wall Street open amid signs of a crypto market recovery.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility cooling after a fresh round of losses.

These had resulted in a wave of crypto long liquidations worth over $700 million for the 24 hours to the time of writing, per data from CoinGlass.

BTC/USD bottomed at $108,717 on Bitstamp, below old all-time highs seen at the start of the year. 

Amid fears of a $100,000 support retest or worse, some market participants saw reason for optimism.

“BTC is now getting closer to the bottom,” popular trader BitBull wrote in part of his latest X analysis. 

BitBull referenced encouraging signals from the US, where the Coinbase Premium Index reentered positive territory on Tuesday.

The Index measures the difference in BTC prices between the Coinbase BTC/USD and Binance BTC/USDT pairs, and when green, it implies strengthening US market demand.

“Coinbase Bitcoin Premium turned positive during bottom and long liquidations were huge. This shows that max. pain is here and a short rally is expected,” BitBull concluded.

Others also expected a rebound, with fellow trader Mister Crypto seeing a short squeeze next thanks to a significant build-up of short positioning above $115,000 on exchange order books.

Elsewhere, Cas Abbe, a contributor at onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, suggested that current price action is, in fact, familiar.

Bitcoin, he noted, had behaved similarly during a retracement in June, when BTC/USD reached all-time highs of $112,000 before dropping to around $98,000.

“BTC chart resemblance to Q2 2025 fractal is uncanny. Similar lower-lows and a capitulation which forced everything to think ‘it's over,'” he commented on the day.

An accompanying chart underscored the similarities.

In common with previous price drawdowns, institutional flows added to souring sentiment, with analytics resource Ecoinometrics drawing attention to the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

“The macro uncertainty of the past few weeks is showing up directly in the flows,” it concluded, adding that ETF outflows were “pulling Bitcoin lower.”

On Monday, the ETFs nonetheless achieved positive flows of just under $220 million, per data from UK-based investment firm Farside Investors.

Oops, something went wrong

Gambling marketer turned Ethereum treasury company SharpLink Gaming boosted its ETH holdings last week, adding around $252 million in Ethereum to its stash, the firm announced Tuesday. 

SharpLink added 55,463 ETH at an average price of $4,462, the firm said. The additions bring its total haul to 797,704 ETH valued at $3.6 billion based on the current price of Ethereum.

“Our regimented execution of SharpLink's ETH treasury strategy continues to demonstrate the strength of our vision and the commitment of our team,” said SharpLink co-CEO Joseph Shalom in a statement. 

“With nearly 800,000 ETH now in reserve and strong liquidity available for further ETH acquisitions,"" he added, ""our focus on building long-term value for our stockholders while simultaneously supporting the broader Ethereum ecosystem remains unwavering.”

 

The Minneapolis-based firm raised around $360 million via its at-the-money facility last week to buy Ethereum and maintains around $200 million in cash to buy ETH, according to its statement.

SharpLink is among a handful of Ethereum treasury companies racing to gobble up the second largest crypto asset, now holding around 0.61% of the total ETH supply and only trailing Tom Lee's BitMine Immersion Technologies among publicly traded firms. BitMine holds more than double the amount of ETH as SharpLink, with about $7.7 billion worth as present.

Ethereum, ETH Treasuries at 'Good Entry Point' After Market Pullback: Standard Chartered

The firm has publicly stated a goal of acquiring 1 million ETH as its first major milestone, a goal which is around 79% completed as of Tuesday morning. In a Myriad market on Linea, 54% of respondents believe that SBET will reach this goal by September 16. Those odds have dropped 13% in the past 24 hours, despite the recent ETH purchases.

(Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.)

Shares of SBET have jumped about 1% on Tuesday to change hands at $19.35. The firm's stock has sunk more than 7% over the past month, despite Ethereum's 19% gain for the same period.

ETH was trading at $4,520, down more than 2% over the past 24 hours, although it hit a record high above $4,900 over the weekend. The second-largest asset by market value has benefited from the rise of treasuries and exchange-traded funds focused on the asset.

Ethereum's pullback from all-time highs creates a ""great entry point"" for investors, according to Standard Chartered.

The bank's head of digital assets, Geoffrey Kendrick, believes Ethereum will reach $7,500 by the end of 2025 as institutional interest grows.

In a research note seen by Decrypt, he explained that Ethereum treasury companies and exchange-traded funds have purchased 4.9% of the ETH in circulation since June.

Kendrick argues that this buying pressure has played an instrumental role in helping the world's second-largest cryptocurrency surge to $4,953 on Sunday—eclipsing the previous all-time high set in November 2021.

""Although these inflows have been significant, the point is that they are just getting started,"" he added.

Last month, Kenrick had predicted that treasury companies will soon own 10% of all ETH in circulation—and now, he says that target is well on track to be met.

""ETH and the ETH treasury companies are cheap at today's levels,"" he wrote.

At the time of writing, CoinMarketCap data shows Ethereum is now trading at a 10.9% discount to the record highs set just two days ago.

Kendrick previously argued that it makes more sense for treasury companies to hold ETH rather than BTC as a reserve asset.

""ETH corporate treasuries can capture both staking rewards and decentralized finance (DeFi) leverage opportunities, which U.S. Ethereum ETFs currently cannot. As such, we think ETH treasury companies have even more growth potential than BTC ones,"" he wrote in a note on July 29.

That hasn't deterred investors from gaining exposure to ETH ETFs. SoSoValue data shows inflows stood at $443.9 million on Monday—more than double the $219 million that flowed into BTC-focused alternatives. And while BTC ETFs suffered outflows throughout the whole of last week, ETH funds managed to attract more than $628 million of capital across Thursday and Friday.

ETH has rallied by 32.6% in the year to date, considerably ahead of Bitcoin on 17.3%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoins make Bitcoin better by acting as beta testers: Tim Draper","https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoins-help-bitcoin-grow-tim-draper","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 03:08:17 GMT","

 Altcoins allow developers to test new functions and applications, which eventually make it onto Bitcoin, American venture capital investor Tim Draper said. 

Venture capitalist and founding partner of Draper Associates, Tim Draper, said altcoins may ultimately make Bitcoin better by acting as testing grounds for upgrades.  

During an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday, Draper said there will also be “many other cryptocurrencies,” created over time, which will help increase Bitcoin's (BTC) dominance. 

“Competition is good for the world, but as a percentage of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, with the first boom, they had a 40% market share, with the next boom, they had 50% market share, and now the market share is running around 61 to 62%,” he said. 

Adding that over time, “the dominant supplier builds the strongest network,” which results in developers programming for the “dominant supplier.” 

A similar situation played out with Microsoft, Draper said, because most developers were building on it when it first started out. However, some applications were created elsewhere and eventually ported.  

Microsoft is considered one of the top tech giants in the world, with its Windows operating system taking up over 71% of the market share. 

“Well, the same thing is happening now with Bitcoin. All of these smaller cryptocurrencies are experimenting and doing interesting things and all of the great engineers are porting those to Bitcoin and so there is a gravitational pull toward Bitcoin,” he said. 

However, data from Electric Capital currently paints a different picture. 

Their latest developer report estimates there are only 2,583 total developers on Bitcoin — a fraction of the total developers on the EVM stack (12,931) and Ethereum (9,094). 

Draper also reiterated his stance that Bitcoin is a hedge against bad governance and out-of-control government spending.

Draper said government spending has become “uncontrolled,” with the spending as a percentage of gross domestic product going on a “rapid tear over the last hundred years,” with no sign of “slowing down.” 

The United States national debt has continued to grow yearly, with the Treasury Department estimating that in the last 100 years, debt has grown from $395 billion in 1924 to over $37.2 trillion in 2025.  

“You're only hedge against that kind of government spending is Bitcoin, unless you want to hold gold, which is like holding onto shells. It's like being prehistoric in your thinking about the economy,” Draper said.

Draper has predicted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 and eventually make the US dollar extinct, though he acknowledged that it hasn't come true yet.

“I've been predicting $250,000 for a Bitcoin for a long time. It turns out I haven't been right yet, but we've gotten halfway there. So that's very exciting,” he said. 

Draper previously predicted Bitcoin would reach $10,000, which it did in 2017, and he told Cointelegraph in 2023 that he only made a fresh prediction of $250,000 by the end of 2022 because he felt pressure to have another crack after he nailed his first price guess. 

Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $124,450 on Aug. 14, but has since retreated 11.8% to trade at around $109,144, according to CoinGecko.

Oops, something went wrong

Despite the broader crypto market rally, altcoins have faced consistent selling pressure, delaying a full altcoin season.

Analysts believe a major rally won't happen until spot crypto ETFs are approved.

Despite Bitcoin's dominance dropping by 6% over the past month, the altcoin season remains stalled with no major catalysts in sight. Meanwhile, macro uncertainties have increased volatility.

In their crypto market report on August 25, Bitfinex analysts noted that they don't expect a broad market rally until later this year, when Bitcoin product inflows recover and new investment vehicles for altcoins become available.

While referring to crypto ETFs, the analysts added: “These products are likely to generate sustained, price-agnostic demand, creating the conditions for a broader re-rating across the digital asset complex.”

The analysts noted that the market currently reflects a weaker appetite for risk at this point in the cycle.

“While capital inflows remain positive, the muted trajectory reflects a more cautious investor base, contrasting with the aggressive demand that characterised previous ATH surges,” they added.

Another popular crypto analyst Michael Van de Poppe warned of harsh corrections in Ethereum and altcoins in general.

He added that investors should position themselves to buy ETH price dips in the range of $3,500-$3,750.

Asset managers in the US have filed for several crypto ETFs for some of the top altcoins like XRP , Solana , Cardano , HBAR , Dogecoin and others.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been active for 19 months, while spot Ethereum ETFs have been around for 13 months. Both have successfully traded on Wall Street, attracting billions in inflows.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed decisions on multiple cryptocurrency ETF applications, including Truth Social's proposed Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF, Solana-based products from 21Shares and Bitwise, as well as 21Shares' Core XRP Trust.

However, this hasn't stopped issuers from bringing new products in the market. A day before, top crypto investment firm Canary Capital has submitted a Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking approval for an “American-Made Crypto ETF.”

The proposed spot ETF would exclusively include cryptocurrencies originally developed in the United States.

A Bitfinex report anticipated more significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins later in the cycle.

Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates near current levels as capital inflows extend along the risk curve toward Ethereum and broader altcoins, according to Bitfinex Alpha's Aug. 25 report.

The report noted that the shift represents a measured rotation of institutional liquidity following Bitcoin's all-time high formation.

Bitcoin declined 4.5% from the weekly open on Aug. 18 until Aug. 22, sliding to local range lows as investors de-risked ahead of the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium.

The asset reached $111,990 amid renewed weakness in US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) flows, with Bitcoin ETFs recording $1.18 billion in net outflows over the week. As of press time, BTC lost the $110,000 threshold and is priced at $109,795.71.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole triggered a sharp rebound in risk assets, sparking a broad-based short squeeze across crypto.

Ethereum led the recovery, surging to a new all-time high of $4,958.70 on Aug. 24 and demonstrating its role as a liquidity driver for institutional markets.

Spot ETH ETFs registered $197 million in outflows on Aug. 18 alone, marking the third-largest daily exit on record. However, Ethereum treasury companies absorbed substantial selling pressure, with preliminary estimates suggesting meaningful institutional support.

Corporate treasuries, including SharpLink Gaming, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, and BTCS, accelerated accumulation, with on-chain treasury balances exceeding $10 billion. The report noted that the rotation reflects softer capital inflows into Bitcoin following its Aug. 14 all-time high of $123,640.

Bitcoin's realized cap expanded at 6% per month during the current move, compared to 13% monthly growth during late-2024 breakouts above $100,000, indicating more cautious investor appetite.

Global liquidity conditions remain supportive, with the combined M2 money supply from major central banks approaching $100 trillion. The structural upward trend in global liquidity reinforces the long-term bullish case for digital assets, though capital allocation has become more selective.

Solana climbed above $200 to reach $212.60 as the broader digital asset class pushed higher alongside equities, reflecting tightening correlations between crypto and traditional risk assets. Meanwhile, network development continues to advance, showcased by DBS Bank's recent tokenized note issuance on Ethereum.

In this backdrop, Bitfinex expects Bitcoin to remain range-bound while Ethereum attracts heightened institutional demand, mirroring Bitcoin's dynamic from early 2024.

The report anticipated more significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins later in the cycle, with broader market re-rating dependent on renewed Bitcoin ETF inflows and new altcoin investment vehicles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altseason won't start until more crypto ETFs launch: Bitfinex","https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-season-crypto-etfs-factor-may-delay-analysts","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 03:42:01 GMT","

 While most look at historical patterns and Bitcoin dominance, Bitfinex analysts say that the start of an altcoin season may hinge on the launch of crypto ETFs. 

Altcoins may not see a broad, outsized rally until the approval of crypto ETFs that give investors exposure further down the risk curve, according to analysts from Bitfinex.

Crypto market participants have eagerly awaited an altcoin market rally, or “altseason,” as Bitcoin (BTC) dominance dipped 6% over the past 30 days.

Bitfinex analysts said in a markets report on Monday that they don't anticipate a “‘rising tide lifts all boats' environment” until later in the year when inflows into Bitcoin products regain momentum and new investment vehicles for altcoins are introduced.”

They added, “These products are likely to generate sustained, price-agnostic demand, creating the conditions for a broader re-rating across the digital asset complex.” 

The analysts said the current market is showing a “softer appetite for risk at this stage of the cycle.”

“While capital inflows remain positive, the muted trajectory reflects a more cautious investor base, contrasting with the aggressive demand that characterised previous ATH surges,” they added.

Coinbase Institutional's global head of research, David Duong, has a different take, as he recently said that “current market conditions now suggest a potential shift toward a full-scale altcoin season as we approach September.”

Meanwhile, crypto industry commentators have been speculating on which crypto ETFs might launch next, as spot Bitcoin ETFs have been trading for over 19 months since their January 2024 debut and spot Ether (ETH) ETFs for nearly 13 months since their July 2024 launch.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently delayed approval decisions on several crypto ETF applications, including Truth Social's Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF, Solana (SOL) products from 21Shares and Bitwise, and 21Shares' Core XRP Trust.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on June 7 that there is a “really good chance” that an ETF that actively trades memecoins will eventually exist. 

“First, we'll get a slew of active crypto ETFs,” he said, adding that an active memecoin-only fund will likely emerge in 2026.

Enhance your search results with the following special search methods. These tools allow you to fine-tune what data is returned and how it's matched.

Use quotation marks to search for an exact phrase or sequence of words:

Example: ""Marketing manager in London""

This will return results that match exactly what's inside the quotes — word-for-word and in order.If there are no exact matches, the system will fall back to your default search query (which can be configured separately).

Use the pipe symbol (|) to search for any of the listed terms:

Example: Marketing manager | Sales manager | Business manager

This will return any result that matches at least one of the terms. If only one term matches, only that result is shown. If multiple match, all are returned.

Use the dash (-) to exclude specific words from the search results:

Examples: Marketing manager -indeed.comHouses in London -zoopla -terraced

This tells the search engine to omit any result that includes the excluded words (e.g., no listings from Zoopla or containing ""terraced"").

Use this method when no other matching methods succeed.

Example: %economy in 2025 snp stocks%

This functions like a SQL LIKE query — it's a broad, fuzzy match that tries to find results containing the key terms anywhere in the content. It's often used as a final fallback option.

Use the ampersand (&) to ensure all terms are included in the results:

Example: Sales & Marketing & London

Only results that contain all three keywords — “Sales”, “Marketing”, and “London” — will be returned.Even if a page is titled “Sales & Marketing”, it will still be included, as long as all keywords are present somewhere in the content.

Use these search operators to narrow or broaden your results as needed. They can be combined and layered for even more control.","{'href': 'https://www.troutman.com', 'title': 'Troutman Pepper Locke'}","cryptocurrency"

Circle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) has seen a fair bit of volatility of late. The stock fell about 13% over the last five trading days to roughly $125 per share. That's a sharp pullback, but it's worth remembering Circle listed at $31 during its blockbuster IPO in June and is still up roughly  4x since. The recent decline comes as investors worry about potentially lower interest rates ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted last Friday that a cut could be coming in September. Most futuristic stocks tend to celebrate that kind of news, but Circle is in a slightly different spot. Roughly 95% of its revenue last quarter came from interest on the cash and bonds backing its stable coins. So what's the outlook like for Circle as the interest rate cycle likely turns?

USDC Is Core of Circle's Business

Circle is best known as the issuer of USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin that runs on blockchains like Ethereum and Tron. The token is widely used across crypto trading, payments, and decentralized finance. The business is growing fast. Over the most recent quarter, revenues rose 53% year-over-year to $658 million, although IPO-related charges pushed Circle into a net loss. The real standout metric was USDC circulation, which jumped 90% from a year ago to $61.3 billion. Circle expects the circulation to compound at about 40% annually over the long run. And it's not just trading volume that's driving growth – USDC is also increasingly being used in cross-border payments and remittances by both individuals and businesses.

The U.S. has made significant progress toward regulatory clarity for stablecoins with the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, which establishes the first federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. That could open the door to mainstream adoption, especially as large companies outside crypto explore stablecoins for remittances, B2B transactions, and e-commerce. That said, it still trails behind Tether's USDT, which dominates with about 67% of the dollar-backed stablecoin market versus USDC's 26%, per CryptoQuant. For the upside case, see Circle Stock To $300?

Big Bet on Arc Blockchain

Now Circle wants to go a step further. The company recently unveiled Arc, a new public blockchain built specifically for stablecoin payments. The move puts Circle in direct competition with payments giants like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), as well as the crypto networks it already relies on such as Ethereum and Solana. The shift is notable, as Circle would not just issue digital currency but also run the system that facilitates transactions and potentially collects fees.

USDC will continue to exist on public blockchains, but Arc represents a push to own the rails of the payments ecosystem. The challenge, however, is adoption. A network only works if enough players use it, and several others are building their own systems. Circle will need to prove that Arc is worth building on.  Can Visa And Mastercard Survive The Stablecoin Revolution?

Circle Risks

There are other challenges, too. Circle's non-interest revenues are also expected to soften in the second half of the year. Add in the interest rate factor, and the near-term growth of Circle's core revenue stream looks vulnerable if conditions shift.  Moreover, stablecoin demand is also tied to broader crypto cycles. Usage tends to rise during bull markets, when trading activity spikes, and fades during downturns. To illustrate just how volatile the crypto sector can be, let's look at crypto trading bellwether Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).

While COIN stock touched all-time highs of over $340 per share in late 2021, a few months after its IPO, it plunged to levels of around $30 by early 2023 – a roughly 90% collapse. The sell-off was driven by a broader unwinding of the crypto market. Coinbase has indicated that the crypto prices are subject to multi-year cycles, which is typically two to four years. And unlike Circle, Coinbase posted $3.6 billion in profit on $7.4 billion in revenue in 2021. Circle has yet to prove it can scale to these levels. Circle's revenue stood at $1.89 billion for the fiscal year ended March 2025, with profits coming in at about $172 million.  A deep downturn in crypto markets or weaker interest income could push the stock down further. Could Circle fall to $20?

The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

 Pudgy Penguins, BAYC and Doodles led the decline over the past week, while CryptoPunks held on with only a 1.35% drop. 

Blue-chip non-fungible token (NFT) collections had steep weekly declines as Ether pulled back from all-time highs. 

Data from decentralized finance aggregator DefiLlama showed that top projects saw their floor prices sink by double digits in the last seven days. Blue-chip NFT collections like Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Doodles were among the hardest hit.

Pudgy Penguins, the top NFT collection by 24-hour and 7-day volume, saw a 17.3% drop to a 10.32 Ether (ETH) floor price. BAYC shed 14.7% to 9.59 ETH, while Doodles recorded one of the sharpest corrections, dropping 18.9% to 0.73 ETH. Other major collections like Moonbirds and Lil Pudgys dropped 10.5% and 14.6%, respectively.

The NFT floor price drop followed a sharp ETH retracement after hitting new all-time highs. On Monday, CoinGecko data showed that ETH reached a new all-time high of $4,946. ETH dropped 12% on Tuesday to $4,342 before recovering slightly. At the time of writing, the crypto asset traded at $4,433.

While many collections suffered heavy losses, not all NFT projects were in retreat. CryptoPunks, which remained the top NFT collection by market cap, showed relative resilience, dropping only 1.35% over the week. 

Despite the top collections showing floor price declines, trading volumes remained high. Throughout the week, Pudgy Penguins led the market with about 2,112 ETH (about $9.36 million) in trading volume. The collection was followed by Moonbirds, with 1,979 ETH ($8.77 million). 

CryptoPunks followed closely with 1,879 ETH (about $8.33 million) in volume, while BAYC had 809 ETH ($3.59 million).

While blue-chip NFTs suffered double-digit declines, the broader NFT space also dropped almost 5% to $7.7 billion, according to data aggregator NFT Price Floor. 

On Aug. 13, NFT Price Floor showed that the overall NFT market capitalization peaked at $9.3 billion, up 40% from July's $6.6 billion. The surge was fueled by an increase in NFT activity following an ETH surge. 

On Aug. 18, the NFT market cap dropped further to $8.1 billion, wiping out $1.2 billion from digital collectible valuations.

Oops, something went wrong

Following the all-time highs last week, Ethereum price has seen a strong pullback of over 10% and is currently flirting with $4,400.

As a result, some of the top non-fungible token (NFT) collections, such as Pudgy Penguins and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), have seen a sharp fall over the past week.

Data from DeFi aggregator DefiLlama indicates that leading NFT projects have experienced double-digit declines in floor prices over the past week, with blue-chip collections such as Pudgy Penguins, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Doodles seeing the steepest drops. This comes despite growing demand for Pudgy Penguins' NFT Treasury.

Pudgy Penguins, the leading NFT collection, tanked 17.3% to a floor price of 10.32 ETH.

Similarly, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) declined 14.7% to 9.59 ETH, while Doodles saw one of the largest corrections, sliding 18.9% to 0.73 ETH.

Other notable collections, including Moonbirds and Lil Pudgys, dropped 10.5% and 14.6%, respectively.

However, with the Ethereum price pullback, not every NFT collection has faced the heat.

CryptoPunks, the largest NFT collection by market cap, showed relative stability with just a 1.35% weekly decline.

Even as floor prices fell, trading activity remained strong. Pudgy Penguins led the market with roughly 2,112 ETH (about $9.36 million) in volume, followed by Moonbirds at 1,979 ETH ($8.77 million).

CryptoPunks came in third position with 1,879 ETH (about $8.33 million), while BAYC recorded 809 ETH ($3.59 million).

Amid the double-digit declines in blue-chip NFTs, the broader NFT space has tanked by 5%, to $7.7 billion.

On August 13, data from NFT Price Floor indicated that the total NFT market capitalization reached $9.3 billion, marking a 40% jump from $6.6 billion in July.

The surge came as NFT activity picked up alongside an ETH price rally.

After hitting an all-time high of $4,900 last week, Ethereum price has seen some pullback.

Popular crypto analysts Daan Crypto Trades noted that ETH will see some more fall to test its 200-EMA, currently at $4,088 levels.

The analyst noted that the higher timeframe structure is still bullish until the support for $4,000 is lost.

“Alternatively, a break and hold above ~$5K should be the green light for a proper price discovery phase,” noted the analyst.

Amid the broader crypto market volatility, degen meme coin Maxi Doge has seen a good demand upside, and has already raised more than $1.5M. This milestone comes within a month of launch, reflecting strong investor sentiment.

Branded as Dogecoin's “frustrated but ripped cousin,” Maxi Doge is positioning itself alongside established memecoins like Dogecoin , Shiba Inu , and Bonk in the 2025 memecoin trend.

The project combines humor with utility, offering staking rewards (195% APY), exclusive access to an alpha-trader community, and planned integrations with perpetual trading markets.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Parallel Finance, a defunct NFT lending platform, imposed a $500 late withdrawal fee after suspending services in August 2025, leaving users with $800K+ in high-value NFTs locked in smart contracts.

- Users struggled to recover assets via Etherscan due to technical barriers and low trading volumes, despite a six-month shutdown notice, sparking frustration over opaque recovery processes.

- CEO Yubo Ruan justified fees as operational cost coverage, while critics accused the platform of exploiting users, highlighting risks of centralized control in DeFi ecosystems.

- Community members like 0xQuit provided free recovery guides, underscoring broader industry challenges in custody, accessibility, and governance for decentralized asset management.

Parallel Finance, an NFT lending platform that announced its closure in January 2025, has sparked controversy by reportedly demanding a $500 fee for late NFT withdrawals. The platform, which suspended its NFT lending services after a six-month notice period ending on August 1, left users with over $800,000 worth of high-value NFTs still locked in its smart contracts. These include notable collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Apes Yacht Club (MAYC), and Doodles. Despite the shutdown notice, many users failed to act before the deadline due to low NFT trading volumes and a lack of technical understanding for manual withdrawal processes [1].

With the platform's front-end no longer operational, users are required to interact directly with the contracts via Etherscan to recover their assets. This process, however, has proven challenging for non-technical users, leading to frustration and backlash. Screenshots shared on social media platforms showed CEO Yubo Ruan stating that a $500 fee would be charged per late withdrawal, citing the need to cover operational costs and protect lenders against potential losses [3]. Ruan also emphasized that if assets remained unclaimed, they would eventually be liquidated to repay lenders, according to publicly shared community guidelines [2].

The situation has drawn attention to the broader challenges of custody and accessibility in the NFT lending space. On-chain analyst 0xQuit, a former team member of Yuga Labs, highlighted the problem on X and provided a step-by-step guide for manual asset recovery. While 0xQuit offered to assist with free guidance, the overall experience underscores the complexities and risks associated with relying on centralized platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem [2]. Many users, particularly those unfamiliar with blockchain mechanics, found themselves unable to navigate the technical hurdles of direct contract interaction, raising concerns about the practicality of ""self-sovereign"" digital asset management [1].

The closure of Parallel Finance also reflects a broader trend in the NFT market, where platforms struggle to maintain relevance amid declining trading volumes and shifting user interests. The incident illustrates how even well-publicized shutdowns can lead to unforeseen complications for users who may not be actively engaged with the market at the time of notice [3]. It also highlights the potential for opportunistic behavior by platform operators, as some users have accused Parallel Finance of leveraging the situation to impose exorbitant fees for asset recovery [2].

In response to the platform's absence of support, independent community members like 0xQuit have stepped in to bridge the gap. However, the episode has raised questions about the need for clearer governance structures and more user-friendly interfaces in the NFT lending space. As the market continues to evolve, incidents like these emphasize the necessity for robust user education and standardized protocols for asset recovery in decentralized systems [1].

The Pudgy Penguins ecosystem is facing bearish pressure, as both its NFT collection and native token PENGU endure heavy selling pressure. 

Pudgy Penguins are down 13.4% in the past week, sparking a wave of forced liquidations on @blur_io. pic.twitter.com/DDgP2fQzI7

The Pudgy Penguins NFT collection has seen its floor price tumble 19.5% over the past week and over 30% in the last month, now trading at 10.29 ETH. 

Despite this, trading activity spiked dramatically with 24-hour sales soaring to 400% and volume jumping to 338.5%.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","Bitcoin Falls to $109K as Bitcoin Hyper Raises $12M ICO","https://cryptonews.com/press-releases/bitcoin-falls-109k-hyper-12m-ico/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:14:16 GMT","

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped to $109,000 in the past 24 hours after a massive 24,000 BTC sell-off wiped out more than $838 million in leveraged positions.

From here, Bitcoin would need to climb roughly 83% to reach $200,000 – a move that may look ambitious given September's track record as one of the weakest months for BTC. Yet one analyst believes that the target remains possible in the two most bullish months on record for Bitcoin: Uptober and Moonvember.

And a massive catalyst that doesn't just provide a price boost, but a fundamental change to Bitcoin – its fastest Layer-2 ever built Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) – could send prices skyrocketing. Backed by more than $12 million in funding, it's the first to integrate Solana's execution speed into the Bitcoin base layer, creating an ecosystem that many believe could drive up the demand for BTC even more.

Bitcoin Hyper runs on a dual-coin economy: BTC's role expands as it powers dApps once thought impossible, while the HYPER token drives the system as the currency for fees, governance, and more. 

What gives HYPER its edge, however, is the Bitcoin narrative. Because Bitcoin Hyper strengthens BTC by adding utility and programmability, that connection could give HYPER a massive price boost, which would only be accentuated once it lists on major exchanges.

This means that at $0.012805 per token, HYPER is insanely attractive for a token directly linked to Bitcoin's upside. But with only 31 hours left in the current round, the price will jump higher in the next stage.

Bitcoin spiked as high as $117,000 following the Fed's dovish tone at the Jackson Hole symposium, which signaled a likely rate cut at the September 17 FOMC meeting. 

The optimism didn't last long, though. A whale unloading massive amounts of BTC triggered a cascade of forced liquidations – wiping out over $838 million across crypto markets – and dragged the price down to as low as $109,000.

That kind of volatility has emboldened Bitcoin's biggest skeptics. Peter Schiff is calling for a collapse to $75,000, urging investors to sell now and buy back lower. His warning carries some weight given that September has historically been one of Bitcoin's worst months, averaging a 3.77% decline and logging brutal drops of 19.01% in 2014 and 13.38% in 2019.

With Bitcoin already slipping, it's tempting to believe this September could deliver another red month, casting doubt on the bold $200,000 year-end target put forward by bulls like Fundstrat's Tom Lee. 

But not all voices are bearish. Crypto Birb noted that BTC could dip to $90,000–$95,000 before reversing, still leaving room for a massive rally into Uptober and Moonvember, historically Bitcoin's most profitable stretch.

Here's what I'm thinking:Bitcoin will hit $90-95k in next 50 days.Reversal after September 17 will kick off last leg of the bull but the month will close red.October & November bull peak ~$200k+.December short altseason (bags go 5-10X)2026 is for bears.Who's with me? pic.twitter.com/KcmKGrxoUp

Still, a push to $200,000 will need more than seasonal tailwinds. Even with Strategy Inc. providing confidence by buying into the dip, a genuine demand catalyst is required. And nothing has the potential to reshape Bitcoin's demand curve more than its fastest Layer-2 chain – Bitcoin Hyper.

Bitcoin Hyper is ultimately reshaping the demand landscape for Bitcoin. Today, BTC is primarily known as a store of value – and even from that single use case, it became the best-performing asset in history, soaring approximately 3,666,666,700% from its 2010 price of $0.003 to $110,000 today.

Although Bitcoin was originally designed as a peer-to-peer money, its role as a daily transaction currency never took off globally. Aside from a few countries experimenting with L2 payment rails, most retail and institutional buyers hold BTC as a hedge against inflation and a long-term appreciating asset.

Bitcoin Hyper changes that narrative. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) into the Bitcoin base layer, it introduces high-performance dApps with Solana-level throughput, all anchored by Bitcoin's security. 

The Fastest Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain. ⚡️Scalability and Speed for Bitcoin are finally here. 🔥https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/1mUqiQGtou

To access this ecosystem, BTC must be locked in the Hyper bridge, where an equivalent wrapped BTC is minted for use across DeFi, gaming, RWAs, NFTs, and even meme coins.

This mechanism not only expands Bitcoin's utility but also strengthens its security footprint, since every dApp interaction relies on BTC as the underlying collateral.

With Uptober and Moonvember approaching, Bitcoin Hyper could become the missing demand driver – one that doesn't just preserve Bitcoin's value, but actively pushes it higher. 

If its ecosystem delivers the utility investors are waiting for, Bitcoin Hyper may be the catalyst that takes BTC to the $200,000 targets projected by analysts like Birb and Lee.

However, once Bitcoin reaches $200,000 and profit-taking sets in by December, Birb still warns that 2026 could bring a bearish year – consistent with Bitcoin's historical four-year cycle. 

Traditionally, the year after the halving sparks the bull run, as seen in 2013, 2017, and 2021. The pattern has repeated again in 2025, with Bitcoin hitting fresh all-time highs and breaking into six figures for the first time.

Don't panic. Bitcoin's right where we expect it to be, according to the four-year cycle. pic.twitter.com/yiRWRPHT24

But many argue that this old cycle is breaking down. Institutional inflows, macro policy, and Fed moves now carry more weight.

Now, Bitcoin Hyper is rewriting that story. Because it enables Bitcoin to be programmable and transactable at speeds that surpass Visa and Mastercard, while anchored by unbreakable Bitcoin security, it can truly change what drives demand for BTC.

That's why a dip in September is not just an opportunity to accumulate more BTC – but also to secure HYPER, the token that powers this new ecosystem. 

HYPER pays for gas, enables governance, and supports staking, while its direct link to Bitcoin makes it an attractive bet for those chasing a much higher upside. 

If Bitcoin's next bull run is driven by utility demand, HYPER could stand at the center of it.

To get HYPER while the moon ride hasn't started, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website. Tokens can be bought using SOL, ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or even a credit card.

For a smoother experience, Bitcoin Hyper recommends one of the best crypto and Bitcoin wallets there is in Best Wallet. HYPER is listed under Best Wallet's Upcoming Tokens, making it easy to track, manage, and claim once live.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","ICO plans triage system to tackle complaints emergency","https://www.decisionmarketing.co.uk/top-story/ico-plans-triage-system-to-tackle-complaints-emergency","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 08:00:00 GMT","


August 26, 2025 9:00 am


The Information Commissioner's Office is proposing major changes to its seemingly out-of-control complaints-handling procedure by introducing a “triage” system, that it claims will better support people who have experienced harm but which critics have already slammed as useless.
According to a consultation document on the changes, the proposed framework “will assess and determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint”. This, the ICO maintains, will allow it to focus on cases “where we can have the most impact and improve data protection compliance”.
The document continues: “Organisations will also benefit from reduced routine engagement on lower-risk cases, enabling them to focus on the most significant concerns. Our goal is not just to manage demand, but to raise standards around customer experience and regulatory effectiveness.”
But the move also follows growing criticism of the ICO's performance. Its most recent annual report revealed that while the number of data protection complaints has risen – from 39,721 2023/24 to 42,881 in 2024/25 – the regulator's handling of such gripes has hit an all-time low.
In fact, the number of data protection complaints which received no response during the expected 90-day timeframe soared from just 15.2% in 2023/24 to 70% in 2024/25 (a 360% increase).
And, with current forecasts indicating that complaints could increase to between 45,000 and 55,000 if the current trend continues, the ICO appears keen to pass on the burden.
This shift is also being helped by the introduction of the Data (Use & Access) Act, which places new requirements on organisations to have a complaints process specifically for data protection related issues.
The ICO maintains that once the provision comes into force, it would expect that more complaints will be resolved by organisations without the involvement of the regulator. However, it is not clear how this process will be policed.
The ICO stated: “[This consultation] reflects our ambition to be a strategic regulator – one that considers every complaint, responds proportionately and uses the insight gained to drive improvements in data protection practices.
“We need to do things differently and transforming our processes will enable us to target our resources to support people's information rights in a way that has a positive impact and addresses the areas that cause the greatest harm.”
However, some data professionals have been left reeling from the move.
On LinkedIn, the negative comments have been coming thick and fast. One senior lawyer wrote: “Has ICO considered that introducing a new system to triage complaints is not actually going to do anything? Or perhaps it will permit the internal metrics to improve?
“Could it be that the surge in complaints is not from heightened public awareness of their data protection rights in the UK, but rather from the ICO's current approach of doing the sum total of sweet ** all, that is allowing an environment to be established where there is a wilful disregard by organisations of their statutory obligations towards individuals?”
Another user commented: “Until you fine and prosecute public institutions you would be as well to close your doors,” while a third said: “Is it OK if I send the ICO a bill for a new keyboard? Mine ended up with gin and tonic in it whilst reading this tripe.”
A fourth, rather less articulate commentator, stated: “The British people are been (sic) taken for clowns from the establishment and then immigration is used as an escape goat (sic) to account for the financial misconduct of the government.
“People need to demand that the money used to fund these organisations are (sic) properly invested in addressing data breaches when members of public complain about their data been (sic) exploited and misused.”
The consultation will close at 23:59 on Friday October 31 2025.

According to a consultation document on the changes, the proposed framework “will assess and determine the extent to which it is appropriate to investigate each complaint”. This, the ICO maintains, will allow it to focus on cases “where we can have the most impact and improve data protection compliance”.
The document continues: “Organisations will also benefit from reduced routine engagement on lower-risk cases, enabling them to focus on the most significant concerns. Our goal is not just to manage demand, but to raise standards around customer experience and regulatory effectiveness.”
But the move also follows growing criticism of the ICO's performance. Its most recent annual report revealed that while the number of data protection complaints has risen – from 39,721 2023/24 to 42,881 in 2024/25 – the regulator's handling of such gripes has hit an all-time low.
In fact, the number of data protection complaints which received no response during the expected 90-day timeframe soared from just 15.2% in 2023/24 to 70% in 2024/25 (a 360% increase).
And, with current forecasts indicating that complaints could increase to between 45,000 and 55,000 if the current trend continues, the ICO appears keen to pass on the burden.
This shift is also being helped by the introduction of the Data (Use & Access) Act, which places new requirements on organisations to have a complaints process specifically for data protection related issues.
The ICO maintains that once the provision comes into force, it would expect that more complaints will be resolved by organisations without the involvement of the regulator. However, it is not clear how this process will be policed.
The ICO stated: “[This consultation] reflects our ambition to be a strategic regulator – one that considers every complaint, responds proportionately and uses the insight gained to drive improvements in data protection practices.
“We need to do things differently and transforming our processes will enable us to target our resources to support people's information rights in a way that has a positive impact and addresses the areas that cause the greatest harm.”
However, some data professionals have been left reeling from the move.
On LinkedIn, the negative comments have been coming thick and fast. One senior lawyer wrote: “Has ICO considered that introducing a new system to triage complaints is not actually going to do anything? Or perhaps it will permit the internal metrics to improve?
“Could it be that the surge in complaints is not from heightened public awareness of their data protection rights in the UK, but rather from the ICO's current approach of doing the sum total of sweet ** all, that is allowing an environment to be established where there is a wilful disregard by organisations of their statutory obligations towards individuals?”

In a recent interview with CNBC, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis shed light on the latest progress around the cryptocurrency market structure bill. Senator Lummis stated that legislative focus has moved to the Clarity Act, following the passing of the Genius stablecoin Act.

The House of Representatives passed the CLARITY Act in July 2025. The Senate is currently working on its version of the act.

According to Senator Lummis, the Senate's version of the CLARITY Act introduces the concept of ancillary assets. This is a new category of digital assets that do not fit into traditional definitions of securities or commodities.

The act will also provide regulatory clarity to prevent companies from facing contradictory or ambiguous rules from the SEC and CFTC. The act also aims to maintain US leadership in digital finance by creating a framework that encourages domestic blockchain development.

Apart from this, Senator Lummis is proposing another bill that will allow home buyers to include cryptocurrency holdings in their mortgage applications.

The US cryptocurrency market will likely surge following more regulatory clarity. The lack of any clear rules has hurt the industry, often leading to confusion.

The SEC welcomed a pro-cryptocurrency candidate, Paul Atkins, at its helm earlier this year. Atkins has vowed to bring more clarity to the US crypto industry while aiming to maintain dominance on a global scale.

President Trump made history earlier this year when he signed an executive order to establish a digital asset reserve for the US. Trump's pro-crypto outlook was a key factor during his Presidential campaign. However, many have accused Trump of misusing the office for personal gain. Trump-backed World Liberty Financial has made waves in the cryptocurrency community.

The Middle East is emerging as a pivotal region in global crypto regulation. Governments are crafting frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. In sectors such as real estate and payments, we've already seen tangible usage, while CBDC pilots offer a glimpse into future financial infrastructure. Explore the full article to see how regulations are shaping the digital asset landscape across the region.

Crypto regulation across the Middle East is shifting from ambiguity toward structured frameworks. Licensing regimes, from VARA in Dubai to Bahrain's CRA module, are enabling legitimized platforms, drawing both startups and institutional giants. Clear tax positions, such as Saudi Arabia's zero personal capital-gains policy and Bahrain's tax-free atmosphere, further attract digital investment. Meanwhile, GCC-wide CBDC pilots and growing KYC enforcement indicate a region preparing for a digital financial future. As regulatory clarity continues to converge, the Middle East stands poised to lead in regulated crypto innovation and adoption.

PR Newswire

VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 26, 2025

USA News Group News Commentary

Issued on behalf of CEA Industries, Inc.

VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group News Commentary – Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $124,000 in August as institutional demand reached unprecedented levels, with digital asset treasuries raising $15 billion in 2025 alone—eclipsing traditional venture funding for the first time in crypto history. The surge reflects a seismic shift as public companies now hold 951,000 BTC worth over $100 billion, while crypto treasury firms have become the most liquid trading vehicles on U.S. exchanges. This transformation from speculative betting to strategic corporate finance has attracted Fortune 500 companies, mining giants, and technology leaders who recognize digital assets as essential hedges against inflation and currency debasement in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion. Leading this corporate revolution are CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC), Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL), Upexi, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPXI), Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (TSX: BITF), and MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA).



 



Wall Street analysts project corporate Bitcoin allocations could reach $330 billion over the next five years, up from $80 billion currently, as companies deploy sophisticated capital market strategies including convertible debt, equity offerings, and specialized treasury vehicles. The regulatory landscape has fundamentally shifted under Trump's crypto-friendly administration, with Treasury Secretary Bessent declaring America's digital asset frontier ""open again"" while the landmark GENIUS Act provides clear stablecoin frameworks that institutional investors have long demanded.

CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC) isn't your typical cryptocurrency story. While other companies scrambled to catch the Bitcoin wave or jumped on the latest trend, this Colorado-based firm made a calculated bet that could reshape how institutional investors think about digital assets.

In August 2025, CEA Industries completed a massive $500 million private placement specifically earmarked for one purpose: building the world's largest corporate treasury of BNB tokens. The company immediately signaled its commitment by changing its ticker symbol from VAPE to BNC, reflecting its new identity as the premier publicly traded gateway to the BNB ecosystem.

But what exactly is BNB? Think of it as the fuel that powers one of the world's busiest blockchain networks. BNB (originally called Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which processes millions of transactions daily for everything from trading and payments to smart contracts and decentralized applications.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold, BNB has real-world utility baked into its design. Users can stake it to earn rewards, pay transaction fees at discounted rates, and participate in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly, BNB features a quarterly ""auto-burn"" mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation, creating built-in scarcity that could benefit long-term holders.

Here's where CEA Industries gets interesting. The company didn't just raise money and hope for the best. They assembled what might be the most impressive crypto-focused management team on Wall Street.

David Namdar, co-founder of Galaxy Digital (one of the largest crypto investment firms), stepped in as CEO. Russell Read, former Chief Investment Officer at CalPERS (managing over $400 billion in assets) and Deputy CIO of Deutsche Bank Asset Management, joined as CIO. The board welcomed Hans Thomas, founding partner of 10X Capital, the firm managing BNC's treasury strategy.

This isn't a group of crypto newcomers making speculative bets. These are seasoned financial professionals who've managed billions of dollars and understand institutional-grade risk management.

The results speak for themselves. In August 2025, BNC announced the purchase of 200,000 BNB tokens worth approximately $160 million, officially making it the largest corporate holder of BNB globally. This wasn't just a headline grab—it demonstrated the company's ability to execute on its strategy quickly and at scale.

The timing appears strategic. While BNB consistently ranks among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, most U.S. investors still can't buy it directly through traditional brokerage accounts. CEA Industries recognized this gap and positioned itself as the solution, offering regulated, SEC-compliant access to BNB exposure without the complexity of crypto wallets or exchange accounts.

The company's financial backing adds credibility to its mission. The $500 million raise attracted over 140 institutional and crypto-native investors, including Pantera Capital, Arche Capital, ExodusPoint Capital Management, and Blockchain.com. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. served as lead financial advisor, bringing Wall Street expertise to the strategy.

What sets BNC apart from other crypto treasury companies is its singular focus. While competitors diversify across multiple digital assets, CEA Industries made an all-in bet on BNB Chain's ecosystem growth. The company believes this focused approach will allow it to capture maximum value as institutional adoption accelerates.

The potential upside follows historical patterns. When MicroStrategy adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset in 2020, the stock gained nearly 2,000% at its peak. Similar treasury strategies by companies like Janover (Solana) and MetaPlanet (Bitcoin) produced dramatic stock price moves following their announcements.

CEA Industries has positioned itself to potentially benefit from this same dynamic, but with an asset that powers one of the most active blockchain ecosystems on Earth. With plans to deploy the remaining treasury capital and potential access to an additional $750 million through warrant exercises, BNC appears built for the long game in an ecosystem that's just getting started.

Circle Internet Group, Inc. (NYSE: CRCL) has achieved record-breaking growth in its USDC stablecoin circulation, reaching $61.3 billion at quarter end—a 90% year-over-year increase that has continued expanding to $65.2 billion as of August 10, 2025. The company's total revenue and reserve income grew 53% year-over-year to $658 million while completing a successful $1.2 billion IPO that established Circle as the leading regulated stablecoin issuer. USDC now commands a 28% stablecoin market share with 5.7 million meaningful wallets holding the digital currency.

""Circle's successful IPO in June marked a pivotal moment—not just for our company, but for the broader adoption of stablecoins and the growth of the new internet financial system,"" said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman at Circle. ""This is an extraordinary moment for our company and industry, and we are seeing accelerating interest in building on stablecoins and partnering with Circle across every significant sector of the financial industry, with major internet companies and commercial engagement all around the world.""

Circle is launching Arc, an open Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments with USDC as native gas, while expanding strategic partnerships with Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, and OKX to accelerate adoption. The company projects 40% compound annual growth for USDC circulation through multi-year cycles while building the world's largest stablecoin network.

Upexi, Inc. (NASDAQ: UPXI) has surpassed 2 million SOL in its treasury holdings worth approximately $334 million, representing a dramatic 172% increase from 735,692 SOL at the end of June 2025 following a $200 million capital raise. The company holds approximately 0.0339 SOL per common share and generates approximately $65,000 daily through an 8% staking yield on substantially all treasury holdings. Upexi strategically acquired approximately 57% of its Solana portfolio as locked SOL at mid-teens discounts to spot prices.

""During the month, we raised over $200 million and grew our Solana holdings by over 172% to 2 million SOL,"" said Allan Marshall, CEO of Upexi. ""And we continued to generate additional value for shareholders via an estimated 8% staking yield and additional purchases of discounted locked Solana.""

Upexi continues expanding its Solana treasury through strategic purchases while benefiting from network upgrades including increased block limits to 100 million compute units and the launch of REX-Osprey's Solana Staking ETF. The company trades at competitive valuations with a Basic mNAV of 0.88x while maintaining its core consumer products business alongside its cryptocurrency treasury strategy.

Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (TSX: BITF) has reported strong operational results with $78 million in revenue and earned 718 Bitcoin at an average direct cost of $48,200 per BTC while maintaining 1,402 Bitcoin holdings (as of August 11, 2025). The company generated $100 million in proceeds from selling 1,052 Bitcoin at an average price of $95,500 during Q2 2025, demonstrating effective treasury management alongside mining operations. Bitfarms operates 17.7 exahash per second of mining capacity while expanding into high-performance computing and AI development.

""Our North American energy portfolio positions Bitfarms to be a leader in HPC and AI infrastructure,"" said Ben Gagnon, CEO of Bitfarms. ""With over 1 GW in our Pennsylvania pipeline, anchored by our flagship Panther Creek campus which is in close proximity to Amazon and CoreWeave sites, we aim to capture significant market share in what is quickly emerging as a new AI infrastructure hub.""

Bitfarms has commenced a corporate share buyback program purchasing 4.9 million shares at an average price of $1.24 per share while establishing a second principal executive office in NYC and committing to convert to U.S. GAAP. The company is advancing its multi-year pipeline of over 1.3 GW capacity with partnerships including T5 Data Centers for HPC/AI development at its Panther Creek campus.

MARA Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) has produced 703 Bitcoin in July 2025 while increasing its Bitcoin holdings to 50,639 BTC, solidifying MARA's position as the second-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally. The company won 207 blocks during July and increased energized hashrate by 3% to 58.9 exahash per second despite facing higher global network difficulty. MARA maintains over $5 billion in liquid assets with nearly $1 billion raised recently to fund domestic growth and international expansion.

""Our Bitcoin holdings surpassed 50,000 BTC in July, a milestone that solidifies MARA as the second-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally,"" said Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of MARA. ""More importantly, this is a treasury we built through disciplined infrastructure development, scaled operations, and focused execution. Looking ahead, what sets us apart is our thought leadership, worldwide operational scale, and capital and operational efficiency.""

MARA is preparing to energize its Texas wind farm data center in the second half of 2025 while treating Bitcoin as a productive, risk-managed asset through disciplined treasury management strategies. The company's operational scale and capital efficiency position it for continued expansion in digital energy infrastructure and Bitcoin accumulation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","US Treasury consults on crypto-related illicit finance detection techniques","https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/us-treasury-crypto-related-illicit-finance-detection-techniques-consultation/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:29:55 GMT","

The US Department of the Treasury has opened a request for comments on ‘innovative or novel methods, techniques or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.'

The move fulfils a requirement under the relatively high-profile Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), which was signed into law by president Donald Trump last month (18 July) to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the US.

In particular, the Treasury Department is asking for views about ‘application program interfaces [APIs], artificial intelligence, digital identity verification, and use of blockchain technology and monitoring,' the department highlighted in a press release (18 August).

‘Innovative tools are critical to advancing efforts to address illicit finance risks but can also present new resource burdens for financial institutions,' the department states. ‘As required by the GENIUS Act, Treasury will use public comments to inform research on the effectiveness, costs, privacy and cybersecurity risks, and other considerations related to these tools.'

Comments need to be submitted by 17 October.

STABLECOINS & APIs: EXPLAINED Stablecoins are a type of digital asset / cryptocurrency, minted on a blockchain network, that seek to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. The world's two biggest stablecoins (by market capitalisation) are Tether and USD Coin – both are, like most stablecoins, pegged to the US dollar |An API is a connection (or type of software interface) between computers or between computer programmes.

The White House has described GENIUS as a ‘historic piece of legislation that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital currency revolution.'

The GENIUS Act ‘prioritises consumer protection, strengthens the US dollar's reserve currency status and bolsters our national security,' the White House stated in a ‘fact-sheet', adding that the law ‘will make America the undisputed leader in digital assets, bringing massive investment and innovation to our country.'

Trump backs the GENIUS Act ‘because it protects consumers from nefarious actors in financial markets,' the White House continued in the fact-sheet, explaining that the law – which requires stablecoins to have 100 per cent reserve backing with ‘liquid assets like US dollars or short-term treasuries and requires issuers to make monthly, public disclosures of the composition of reserves' – will ‘ensure [stablecoins'] stability and trust through strong reserve requirements.'

Under the new law, stablecoin issuers ‘must comply with strict marketing rules to protect consumers from deceptive practices', the White House stated, explaining that ‘they are forbidden from making misleading claims that their stablecoins are backed by the US government, federally insured or legal tender.'

The law was signed after the House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act on 17 July by 308 votes to 122 during what US lawmakers dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC. The Senate (upper house) had already given its approval the previous month.

RELATED ARTICLE Trump signs stablecoin act into law as Washington steps on crypto gas – a news story (21 July 2025) on the presidential signing of the GENIUS Act into law

The GENIUS Act is not immediately effective. It takes effect on the earlier of either the date that is 18 months after the enactment of the act (which would be 18 January 2027) or 120 days after the date on which the main federal payment stablecoin regulators issue any final regulations implementing the act.

On the challenge of ‘combatting illicit activity in digital assets,' the White House highlighted in its fact-sheet that the new law explicitly subjects stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act, ‘thereby clearly obligating them to establish effective anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programmes with risk assessments, sanctions list verification and customer identification'; and stated that it also improves the Treasury Department's ability to tackle illicit stablecoin activities by ‘enhancing its sanctions evasion and money laundering enforcement capabilities.'

Beyond Washington DC, the state of Wyoming last week announced the ‘mainnet' launch of its own stablecoin – the Frontier Stable Token (FRNT). A mainnet launch is a reference to the official activation of a blockchain network – meaning FRNT is moving from a testing environment (‘testnet') to a live, operational state where real transactions and applications can occur.

FRNT, which is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, is a groundbreaking digital money programme for the public sector as the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US – an eye-catching development given that traditional stablecoins are issued by private companies.

Meanwhile other government agencies worldwide are stepping up their use of identity verification to tackle financial fraud. For example, the UK's Companies House confirmed earlier this month (5 August) that legal requirements for directors and ‘people with significant control' of companies to verify their identities will begin on 18 November. ‘Companies of all sizes will benefit from more accurate and trustworthy register data and greater protections against fraud,' the agency said, explaining that people can verify their identity through GOV.UK One Login or through an ‘Authorised Corporate Service Provider' (ACSP).

President Donald Trump's crypto ventures are expanding with plans for a digital asset treasury company

President Donald Trump's personal crypto ventures are expanding again, this time with plans for a digital asset treasury company that holds an alternative cryptocurrency.

Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social media platform, announced Tuesday that it was partnering with the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to form a company that holds CRO, a token created by Crypto.com. A blank check company tied to Yorkville Advisors is another co-founder of the new firm, called Trump Media CRO Strategy.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","cryptocurrency"

For years, the SEC has been painted as the cop on the beat when it comes to crypto, more likely to file an enforcement action than to roll out the welcome mat.  But SEC Chairman Paul Atkins' announcement this summer of a new “Project Crypto” initiative is the latest and clearest signal that there's a new sheriff in town with a pro-reform agenda. Instead of another warning shot, the SEC is launching a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities laws so America's financial markets can move from off-chain to on-chain and be positioned as the global leader in crypto markets.

Digital Asset Reboot

In his July 31, 2025 speech at the America First Policy Institute, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins described the initiative as nothing less than a reboot of the SEC's approach to digital assets. Rather than twisting 80-year-old securities laws to fit blockchain-based innovation, the SEC is looking to rewrite the playbook. Atkins framed it simply: Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities.  But confusion over the application of the Howey test has led some innovators to treat all crypto assets as such. On the other hand, when tokens are securities, the rules need to make sense in an on-chain environment.  Chairman Atkins stated that these entrepreneurs need and deserve bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses.

The speech came a day after the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets released the PWG Report with clear recommendations for the SEC to build a framework to maintain U.S. dominance in crypto asset markets. Chairman Atkins said the report is “the blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology”.  

This is a sharp turn from the days when every token distribution risked being labeled an unregistered offering. With Project Crypto, the SEC is signaling that it wants innovation in digital assets to happen in the U.S., not overseas.

What's on the Table?

The plan has several moving parts, but the big themes should be easy to grasp:

Clarity on Classifications. For years, one of the biggest headaches in crypto has been figuring out whether a token is a security, a commodity or something else.  Project Crypto calls for bright-line rules to end the guessing game. That includes tailored disclosures and possible safe harbors for early-stage tokens.

Custody that Makes Sense. One of Chairman Atkins' most striking points is that self-custody is a core American value. In other words, the SEC wants to protect the right of investors to hold their own digital assets, while also fixing outdated custody rules so institutions can safely offer crypto services.

Super-Apps Instead of Silos. Right now, crypto activity is fragmented: staking here, trading there, lending somewhere else.  A key priority for Chairman Atkins is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps”, platforms that can offer multiple services under one roof, with regulators coordinating across agencies like the CFTC to make that possible.  Securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license.

“Innovation Exemption”.  Arguably the most ambitions component of Project Crypto is the “Innovation Exemption”, a fast-track pathway for new crypto projects to launch without being crushed by legacy compliance obligations, so long as they meet core investor protections. Under Chairman Atkins' vision, innovators would be able to enter the market immediately with new technologies and business models by complying with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the SEC, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features.tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features.

What Happens Next

Chairman Atkins stated in his speech that he has directed the SEC staff to draft clear and simple rules for crypto asset distributions, custody and trading, and submit those rules for public comment. He also stated that as the SEC staff works to finalize these regulations, the SEC and its staff will in the meantime be considering using interpretative, exemptive and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America.

While Chairman Atkins' speech announcing Project Crypto doesn't immediately change current rules, it does instruct the SEC staff to focus on critical areas of digital asset regulatory reform.  These include safe harbors for token issuance, authorization for custody and trading and the development of on-chain securities markets powered by decentralized finance or DeFi, an emerging financial system built on blockchain and cryptocurrency that aims to remove intermediaries like banks from financial services. A well-structured safe harbor would allow tokens to be created and distributed with clear guidelines, avoiding outdated securities laws.

Bitcoin BTC$109,820.14 and ether (ETH) options worth over $14.6 billion are set to expire Friday on Deribit in what's shaping up to be one of the most significant derivative events of 2025.

The expiry is heavily skewed toward BTC put options, underscoring a continued demand for downside protection, whereas it's more balanced for ether.

As of the time of writing, 56,452 BTC call option contracts and 48,961 put option contracts were due for settlement, totalling a notional open interest of $11.62 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics. Deribit is the world's largest crypto options exchange, accounting for 80% of the global activity. On Deribit, one option contract represents one BTC or ETH.

A closer look at open interest reveals concentrated activity in put options with strike prices between $108,000 and $112,000. Conversely, the most popular call options are clustered at $120,000 and above.

In other words, near-the-money puts around BTC's current market price of approximately $110,000 are highly sought after, while calls with higher strike prices reflect hopes for further upside.

In ether's case, a total of 393,534 calls are due for settlement, outstripping the put tally of 291,128 by a significant margin, both totaling $3.03 billion in notional open interest.

Significant OI is concentrated in calls at strikes $3,800, $4,000 and $5,000, and put options at strikes $4,000, $3,700 and $2,200.

""BTC expiry points to persistent demand for downside protection, while ETH looks more neutral. Combined with Powell's Jackson Hole signal, this expiry may help set the market tone for September,"" Deribit said on X.

Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specified future date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market. Meanwhile, a put option provides insurance against price slides.

The options market has grown leaps and bounds since 2020, with monthly and quarterly settlements gaining prominence as major market-moving events. 

By 2021, some observers proposed that prices tend to gravitate toward 'max pain' levels – the strike prices where options holders suffer the greatest losses – in the days leading up to expiry. However, the validity of this theory remains a matter of debate among traders and analysts.

As of writing, the max pain levels for bitcoin and ether are 116,000 and $3,800, respectively, serving as focal points for believers of the max pain theory.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said it agreed to form a joint venture with Crypto.com that will invest in the exchange's CRO token as a treasury asset and go public by combining with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC).

As part of the agreement, Trump Media will buy about $105 million worth of CRO, roughly 2% of the token's total market cap, while Crypto.com will buy $50 million in Trump Media stock. CRO surged after the announcement, taking its 24-hour gain to 25%, according to CoinDesk data. It was recently 22% higher at 19.60 cents. DJT shares rose 3.5% to $17.82.

The venture will be called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy Inc. and plans to merge with Yorkville Acquisition Corp (YORK). It will trade under the ticker MCGA, which stands for “Make CRO Great Again,” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said on X. The company will become the world's largest holder of CRO with around 6.3 billion tokens, valued at roughly $1 billion at the time of announcement.

The move comes as publicly traded companies worldwide are jumping into crypto, buying assets including bitcoin BTC$109,820.14 and ether (ETH) as core investments and restyling themselves as crypto treasury companies even as their day-to-day operations still rely on industries as varied as such as pharmaceuticals, software development and online casino gaming. 

The trend was kicked off in 2020 by Strategy (MSTR), which now owns $69 billion worth of BTC. More than 3.6 million BTC valued at $396 billion is held in treasuries across 174 public companies and 60 private companies, according to bitcointreasuries.net.

Several companies are also buying altcoins, with billions of dollars being spent acquiring tokens like solana SOL$193.52 and ether ETH).

Marszalek described the initiative as “a historic day for CRO,” pointing to an initial $200 million in cash earmarked for further token purchases, plus additional commitments that could bring total available funds to around $420 million, alongside a $5 billion credit line. 

“This presents a differentiated opportunity for investors in the digital asset treasury space,” he said, adding that the mission of Trump Media Group CRO Strategy is to maximize what he called a “flywheel effect,” which involves raising funds to acquire more CRO.

The deal includes the creation of a new rewards system that will allow users to convert platform “gems” into CRO tokens, with further plans to enable subscription payments and discounted services using CRO.

Trump Media said it will custody and stake its CRO holdings with Crypto.com for additional revenue.

Despite a wider market sell-off over the past week, CRO performed well in the lead up to the news being released, rising from to 16 cents from 14 cents. Trading volume rose by 700% in the past 24 hours to $310 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

Ether (ETH) and the ETH treasury companies are cheap at today's levels, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, said in emailed comments Tuesday.

Since the start of June, ether (ETH) treasury companies have purchased 2.6% of all ETH in circulation. When combined with exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows since then, the combination of the two has purchased a staggering 4.9% of all ETH in circulation, the analyst noted. 

As a result the world's second-largest cryptocurrency hit a fresh all-time high of $4,955, on Sunday 24, Kendrick said.

Although these inflows have been significant, the point, said Kendrick, is that they are just getting started. He previously estimated that the treasury companies would end up owning 10% of all ETH in circulation, a goal that definitely seems in reach.

Despite the recent plunge in ETH, Kendrick is sticking with his previous forecast that ether would reach $7,500 by year-end. He views the sell-off to below $4,500 over the last two days as creating a great entry point.

Turning to the valuation of ether treasury companies, Kendrick said they have continued to normalize. The mNAV multiples (the ratio of the value of their crypto holdings versus stock market capitalization) for Sharplink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion have declined, falling below that of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).

Given that the ether treasury companies are able to capture ETH's 3% staking yield, Kendrick sees no reason for the mNAV multiples to be below that of MSTR (which captures no such staking yield). 

Furthermore, the SBET announcement on Friday that it will repurchase stock if the NAV multiple falls below 1.0, creates a hard floor for the ETH treasury multiples, he added.

Despite Monday's market rout, which dragged ether (ETH) down 8% — about four times bitcoin's (BTC) decline — investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) kept buying.

The funds saw about $444 million in inflows on Monday, led by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust's (ETHA) $315 milllion, according to Farside Investors.

That followed $338 million in inflows for the group on Friday when ether was soaring following dovish Jackson Hole remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

 Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has sparked a legal standoff and renewed concerns over the Fed's independence. 

Update (Aug. 26, 2025, 2 PM UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary by crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan.

US President Donald Trump announced the dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, raising questions about the reliability of the US dollar.

In a Tuesday post, the White House Rapid Response X profile published a letter signed by Trump removing Cook from her role at the Federal Reserve. He accused her of having made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements and, addressing her directly, wrote:

According to a Tuesday Associated Press report, Cook said she would not step down. She said Trump was attempting to remove her from her post “for cause,” but claimed that “no cause exists under the law,” and added that Trump “has no authority” to remove her. She concluded that she “will not resign.”

Crypto lawyer Aaron Brogan said that signing two inconsistent personal mortgage documents — which is what Cook is accused of — does not constitute a valid cause for firing. He explained that “cause generally means some misconduct, neglect of duty, dishonesty, or action that materially impairs the individual's ability to perform their obligations.”

Brogan said that “it is certain that a court will grant” a preliminary injunction, which will prevent Cook from being removed from her position until the case concludes. He explained:

The Federal Reserve has a significant degree of independence from the US government. Founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich, told Cointelegraph that the Fed's independence “is the foundation for the stability of the US economy.” He explained:

Brogan similarly said that “if Fed independence is undermined, it will negatively affect US monetary policy and probably weaken the dollar further.” He explained why central bank independence is in place:

Obchakevich suggested that Trump decided to fire Cook for “political reasons” and that his decision undermined the Fed's independence. This leads toward market uncertainty and worsens economic sentiment, he said, adding:

When asked whether Bitcoin (BTC) could be a potential solution, Obchakevich said that in the long term, “Bitcoin could weaken the dollar's role as a reserve currency.” Still, he said Bitcoin did not appear to be a near-term solution.

The news followed repeated clashes between Trump and the Federal Reserve's leadership. In mid-April, Trump bashed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for allegedly cutting interest rates too slowly amid a US-initiated trade war.

He then went so far as to suggest firing him. “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump said.

Market participants were quick to reject the idea. Famed crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said that Trump shouldn't follow through on his threat to fire Powell.

“I do not believe that the president of the United States should come in and unilaterally fire the Fed” chair, he said. He suggested the action would set a bad precedent. 

US Senator Elizabeth Warren also warned that if Trump fired Powell, it could undermine investor confidence in the integrity of US capital markets and trigger a financial crash.

 New Trump-backed SPAC deal creates Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, funded by $1 billion in CRO tokens, cash, warrants and a $5 billion credit line from Yorkville affiliate. 

Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of US President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform, announced a business combination with cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com and the blank check company Yorkville Acquisition.

Trump Media, Crypto.com and Yorkville Acquisition entered into a definitive agreement to jointly establish Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, according to a Tuesday announcement.

The entity will be a digital asset treasury company focused on the acquisition of Cronos (CRO), the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos blockchain, developed by Crypto.com.

Majority-owned by Trump Media, Crypto.com and Yorkville, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy aims to build a treasury of at least $6.42 billion.

According to the announcement, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy will fund its digital asset treasury with $1 billion in CRO tokens, $420 million in cash and warrants, plus a $5 billion credit line from an affiliate of Yorkville.

The capital would make CRO Strategy the “first and largest publicly traded CRO treasury company,” the companies said in the announcement, adding that it would potentially become the “largest digital asset treasury company to market cap ratio in history.”

As part of the business combination, Yorkville will apply to have its Class A ordinary shares trade on Nasdaq under the symbol MCGA.

Following the completion of the business combination, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy plans to capture long-term value by allocating “substantially all of the company's cash reserves” to acquire CRO.

The company emphasized its focus on yield-generating assets rather than “traditional non-productive holdings.”

The strategy includes the establishment of operation of a validator node, or a specialized participant in the Cronos' proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network, along with the delegation of CRO under management to the validator.

Related: Dollar stability questioned as Trump ousts Federal Reserve governor

By operating a validator node, Trump Media Group CRO Strategy wants to enable direct participation in the network's security and governance as well as generate staking rewards to reinvest to compound CRO holdings and offset operational costs.

“The validator will be established and maintained by a crypto-native team with a deep understanding of the Cronos ecosystem, aiming to maximize staking rewards and attracting additional delegation of CRO from third-party CRO holders,” the company said.

Launched as a mainnet beta in November 2021, Cronos was built by the founders of Crypto.com and was initially launched as the Crypto.com Coin (CRO).

Cronos was created to serve as a foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverse projects, with a focus on interoperability.

Cronos' developer, Crypto.com, has become one of the Trump administration's leading crypto partners, attending the first White House Crypto Summit hosted by President Trump in early March as one of only 20 invited participants.

Trump Technology Group subsequently signed a non-binding agreement with Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, with a focus on digital assets and securities “Made in America.”

Amid the expanding ties between Trump-backed companies and Crypto.com, the US crypto exchange was hit with criticism over issues like governance.

The community specifically slammed Crypto.com for canceling the 70 billion CRO token burn announced in 2021, while some sources alleged that the exchange controls up to 80% of the total voting power for CRO.

Major onchain investigator ZachXBT even argued that CRO is “no different from a scam,” accusing Crypto.com of CRO supply manipulation.

ZachXBT also commented to the Trump Media Group CRO Strategy news on X, arguing that Crypto.com had “massive incident they covered up in the past that they never made public.”

 Fundstrat's Tom Lee called out Ether's bottom as BitMine bought $21 million more during the plunge, bringing total holdings to 1.72 million ETH. 

Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner Tom Lee tipped Ether  (ETH) to bottom out on Tuesday amid a crypto market dip as his ETH treasury firm BitMine bought another $21 million of Ether. 

“Calling ETH bottom to happen in next few hours,” said Tom Lee on X on Tuesday at 1 am UTC as crypto markets saw red in the $200 billion market cap liquidation event. 

There's a chance Lee's so-called bottom is already in, as Ether had already started to recover at the time of writing, returning to trade above $4,430 again.

Lee made his prediction as he shared a message from Mark Newton, the managing director of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who said, “ETH is a very good risk/reward here,” adding that he was “highly skeptical” that it breaks the trend or breaks last week's low. 

“Ideally, this should bottom out sometime in the next 12 hours near $4,300 and start to push back up to new highs and get above $5,100 and up to near $5,400 to $5,450,” Newton said.

Lee's call came amid a crypto market crash initiated by Bitcoin (BTC), which plummeted to a seven-week low on Tuesday morning. 

Ether also suffered, tanking more than 7% to bottom out at $4,313 on Coinbase, according to TradingView.

Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies continued its aggressive accumulation of Ether, buying the dip on Tuesday with the purchase of 4,871 ETH worth $21.3 million, according to Arkham Intelligence. 

This brought its total holdings to 1.72 million ETH, worth around $7.5 billion at current market prices. 

On Monday, BitMine disclosed it had increased its crypto and cash holdings by $2.2 billion to $8.8 billion, adding over 190,500 tokens over the past week. 

Its crypto plus cash net asset value per share climbed to $39.84, up from $22.84 in late July. 

Crypto NAV is calculated as the crypto and cash asset value divided by fully diluted shares outstanding, of which the firm has 221.5 million.

BitMine is the clear market leader for Ether treasuries with a 40% share of the total 4.3 million ETH held by corporate entities, according to StrategyEthReserve. 

Meanwhile, the world's largest crypto treasury firm, Michael Saylor's Strategy, bought the dip again on Monday, scooping up 3,081 BTC for $357 million at $115,829 per Bitcoin.

 The meeting came as global regulators and traditional exchange associations have urged the SEC to crack down on tokenized stocks. 

Crypto exchange Kraken met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission's Crypto Task Force on Monday to discuss the tokenization of traditional assets and a tokenized trading system. 

A memorandum filed on Monday noted that SEC staff met with four representatives of Payward, Inc., Kraken Securities LLC, and two from the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hales and Dorr LLP. 

The agenda was to discuss the tokenized trading system, the regulatory framework and legal requirements for operating the system and the potential benefits of tokenization.

Kraken's SEC meeting came at a time when traditional exchange industry associations and global regulators have urged the SEC to take a stricter regulatory approach toward tokenized stocks. 

The associations have argued that there is a lack of investor protection safeguards that are present in the traditional markets.

Tokenized stocks are typically not bound by the restrictions of traditional markets and can be traded 24/7. Kraken and Robinhood are the two most prominent platforms to offer these services.

Kraken announced its tokenized stocks service on May 22, which enables non-US investors to buy US equities around the clock. 

Robinhood started offering tokenized stocks of US equities to users in the European Union on June 30.

On Wednesday, Kraken announced that it had expanded its tokenized stock product offering to the Tron blockchain.

Currently, tokenized stocks are in a nascent stage of growth. 

The total value of all tokenized stocks in circulation currently stands at $360 million, down 11% in the past 30 days, according to RWA.xyz.

This represents a mere 1.35% of all Real World Assets (RWAs) that have been tokenized, as nearly $26.5 billion worth of RWAs are currently onchain.

According to Binance research, tokenized stocks represent a trillion-dollar opportunity. If 1% of the entire global equities market gets tokenized, that could propel the sector to surpass the $1.3 trillion mark in market capitalization. 

A Kraken survey released last week revealed that 65% of the 1,000 US investors who invest in both equities and crypto expect crypto to outperform equities over the next decade.

In July, Mark Greenberg, global head of Kraken's Consumer Business Unit, told Cointelegraph that tokenized stocks should offer new levels of accessibility, programmability and global reach instead of simply replicating the Wall Street system onchain.

Microplastics Could Be Turning Bacteria into Drug-Resistant Superbugs

Microplastics are seemingly everywhere—and now growing research suggests they could be breeding grounds for drug-resistant bacteria

For bacteria, microplastics are the perfect meetup spot—tiny, intimate surfaces where microbes can cling, huddle close and swap genes. And these crowded bacterial breeding grounds may pose a threat to human health. A growing body of new research shows that microplastics may fuel antimicrobial resistance—the phenomenon in which pathogens adapt to withstand drugs, making it challenging to treat infections. The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis claimed about five million lives in 2019, a number projected to double by 2050. In an August research review, scientists called attention to the “silent tsunami” of plastics-driven antibiotic resistance. Several other recent papers suggest microplastics serve as better homes for pathogens than some natural substances do, although the mechanisms are not fully understood.

“We've just really scratched the surface,” says Timothy Walsh, a microbiologist at the University of Oxford, who has previously studied antimicrobial resistance and microplastics.

When bacteria encounter a surface—a sliver of wood floating in water or a door handle—they stick to it and to one another, forming a biofilm. As they attach, “they grow and proliferate,” says Muhammad Zaman, a biomedical engineer at Boston University. In a biofilm, bacteria live close together, making it easier to transfer genetic material from one cell to another in what's “basically bacterial sex,” says Emily Stevenson, a public health researcher at the University of Exeter in England and lead author of the August review paper. The more chances microbes get to swap genes in general, the more chances they have to spread DNA that codes for antibiotic resistance.

Scientists in Germany, Costa Rica and the U.K. first detected the troubling trend in 2018, when they showed that bacteria on microplastics were more inclined than free-living bacteria to exchange genes encoding resistance to trimethoprim, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bladder infections and traveler's diarrhea. Other research has since shown that antimicrobial resistance genes were more common in the plastisphere—the community of microbes living on plastics—compared with those in water or soil.

But scientists have questioned whether detecting high quantities of antimicrobial resistance genes actually translates to higher amounts of resistant bacteria—pathogens surviving despite being doused with drugs.

A study published in March offers strong evidence that it does. Scientists tested lab-grown Escherichia coli biofilms in various environments, including on microplastics, on tiny glass fragments and in cell culture media. They found that pathogens in the plastisphere not only grew faster—reconfirming earlier research—but, importantly, were harder to kill when treated with several different antibiotics. The effects “were significantly larger than what we were expecting,” says Zaman, who was senior author of the study. For example, after applying the widely used antibiotic ciprofloxacin, resistance was 75-fold higher among E. coli grown on microplastics than those grown alone.

These effects do not appear to be limited to lab-grown bacteria. Researchers in Germany and Poland added microplastics to water samples taken from the Oder, a major European river. The results, published in May in Scientific Reports, revealed that after a week of incubation, disease-causing bacteria—such as E. coli, Klebsiell pneumoniae and Salmonella—were more abundant in samples with the added plastics than in those without them. What's more, the number of antibiotic resistance genes was also higher among the plastisphere.

Stevenson points to another insightful study, published in May, that involved a bay in Xiamen, China. Scientists submerged individual bags of different microplastics and natural surfaces into the water and performed various tests on the resulting biofilms—running analyses on biofilm formation, metabolic activity, antibiotic resistance genes and actual resistance against three antibiotics. The results suggest that biofilms containing metabolically active, resistant bacteria were about 10 times more likely to form on microplastics than on natural surfaces, equating to about a 10-fold higher human health risk, according to the study authors.

So how do antibiotic resistance genes arise on microplastics in the first place? A July study in Scientific Reports investigates one theory: antibiotics can cling to microplastics, too. The study's authors showed that common antibiotics, such as amoxicillin and tetracycline, stuck to microplastics—and that, the older the microplastics were, the more readily the antibiotics attached to them. As they age, microplastics become rougher and more electrostatic, which makes them even better at trapping antibiotics. The combination of antibiotics and pathogenic bacteria biofilms on microplastics could theoretically drive the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.

Stevenson says that the question of whether microplastics are significantly better at spurring antimicrobial resistance than other surfaces such as wood or glass is far from settled, but the mere fact that plastics have the potential to carry both dangerous pathogens and antibiotics is reason enough to worry.

Microplastics have been detected in nearly everything from air, water, plants and food, and as they are ingested, they bioaccumulate in animals' tissues—including human brains. A preliminary mouse study suggests that microplastics in the gut microbiome may also be fertile ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria: mice exposed to both microplastics and tetracycline had more antibiotic resistance genes in their gut microbiota than rodents exposed only to the antibiotic. “These kinds of things merit serious investigation,” Zaman says.

What's more, microplastics travel and do not degrade. Pieces of plastic carrying multidrug-resistant bacteria have been found as remotely as Antarctica. Microplastics' potential to shuttle antimicrobial-resistant bacteria around the globe makes Zaman particularly worried about plastic pollution that may pick up pathogens in wastewater treatment plants, hospital sewage or refugee camps—the latter of which he is currently investigating.

“I think it's pretty clear that you see an enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes on plastic particles,” says Johan Bengtsson-Palme, a microbiologist at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, whose research focuses on antibiotic resistance. But how much of a threat plastic-derived drug-resistant pathogens pose to humans is a question that remains to be fully understood, he says.

DMT is a mysterious neurochemical that may ferry us to the great beyond, some researchers say.

In Greek mythology it was Charon, the grim ferryman, who paddled souls across the rivers Styx and Acheron to the underworld. But the real-life ferryman transporting our human souls between the realms of the living and the dead may have been inside us all along, science suggests. 

DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine)—the mysterious psychedelic molecule that occurs naturally in plants, animals, and possibly the human brain—plays an intriguing role in guiding consciousness at the moment of death, research shows. A 2018 study in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, for instance, hypothesized that DMT could induce a state as intense as an actual near-death experience (NDE), suggesting that it may play a role in the vivid euphoria many survivors report at the threshold between life and death.

A more recent study, published in 2023 in the same journal, compared the experiences of a person who had both a near-death experience and a trip on 5-MeO-DMT, a powerful psychedelic cousin of DMT secreted by the glands of the Colorado River toad. The researchers' goal? To find out whether the two experiences overlapped—and, if so, whether DMT could be the brain's own way of ferrying us into the great beyond.

“There is good indirect evidence to suggest that DMT is released in greater quantities at the point of death in the human brain. We have evidence from animal brains, but we don't have any direct evidence from humans. However, we can infer that this also happens,” says David Luke, PhD, a coauthor of the 2023 study and an associate professor of psychology at the University of Greenwich in London.

The researchers found that experiences with the psychedelic drugs had a lot in common with NDEs, “offering insights into altered states of consciousness,” says Pascal Michael, PhD, another coauthor of the 2023 study and a psychology lecturer at the University of Greenwich. “These include mystical experiences characterized by feelings of unity and timelessness, ego dissolution where a sense of self merges with a larger reality, and encounters with entities or presences.” 

While the idea of DMT as the chemical behind NDEs is compelling, it's just one part of a much larger puzzle. According to Luke, animal studies have shown that their brains at the point of death undergo a cascade of neurochemical changes, including massive releases of serotonin and noradrenaline—brain chemicals that help regulate mood, emotions, and stress. Scientists have inferred that the same occurs in the human brain. In other words, Luke suggests, DMT could indeed act like a psychopomp—a creature, spirit, or deity that transports the newly deceased to the afterlife. But the story of death doesn't end there. 

Michael explains that the brain's biological state during an NDE might shape the experiences differently than psychedelics do. 

“The neurobiological context of NDEs—potentially involving hypoxia [lack of oxygen in the body or brain], hypercapnia [too much carbon dioxide in the blood], and endogenous neurochemical release—might differ from the effects of 5-MeO-DMT,” he says. This distinction could influence the experience, with NDEs more likely to evoke autobiographical and relational memories tied to loved ones. “By contrast, 5-MeO-DMT tends to induce archetypal or abstract encounters, perhaps due to its intense focus on ego dissolution and the broader existential dimensions of experience,” Michael says.

In his seminal book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Rick Strassman, MD, a psychiatrist and clinical researcher, attributed spiritual connotations to DMT by virtue of the engrossing and transcendent experiences it's reported to induce. Since then, some scientists have ramped up the conversation by finding that DMT may be released in large quantities at death. Despite that, some still say we know nothing about the role of endogenous DMT. 

Enter the pineal gland hypothesis. It states the human pineal gland—a tiny, pea-shaped structure in the brain that produces melatonin, the sleep-regulating hormone—produces DMT in large amounts before death. This idea remains controversial.

“While intriguing, the role of endogenous N,N-DMT in humans remains largely speculative, particularly the idea that it is produced by the pineal gland in the brain,” says Amy Reichelt, PhD, a neuroscientist and an expert in neurodegenerative disease. DMT is structurally similar to serotonin and has been detected in human blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, but most of the research is in animal models. “They can have distinctly different ways of producing neurotransmitters and metabolizing compounds,” she says. 

In any case, the notion that a molecule within us might serve as the final boatman across the rivers Styx and Acheron is as haunting as it is fascinating, opening a Pandora's box of questions about the greatest mysteries of existence.

Directed evolution is usually a laborious process that often takes weeks in which that accelerates protein mutations over many cycle.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

All current life on Earth is the result of billions of years of slow, laborious, and endlessly fascinating evolution (if you include our time spent as single-celled microbes, of course). While that's an acceptable timeline on geological scales, this rate of evolution isn't going to cut it for biotechnology companies. 

Instead, these companies rely on a technique known as directed evolution—the process of rapidly evolving proteins, introducing beneficial mutations, and selecting advantageous variants. While this can drastically speed up the clock (at least, compared to Mother Nature's method of doing things), directed evolution can still be a pretty long process. And because these hyper-evolved proteins can be used in a wide variety of potential cancer and neurodegenerative therapies, we want this laboratory process to be as fast and as streamlined as possible. 

Luckily, scientists have been making some pretty astounding progress. In May of this year, a study led by the University of Sydney and published in Nature Communications detailed a process called PROTein Evolution Using Selection (PROTEUS) that leverages chimeric virus-like vesicles to rapidly evolve biomolecules. Now, a second study (led by Scripps Research and published in the journal Science) showcases yet another method for directed evolution called T7-ORACLE. According to the researchers, this breakthrough behaves like an “evolution engine” capable of introducing mutations 100,000 times faster than normal. 

“This is like giving evolution a fast-forward button,” Pete Schultz, a co-senior author on the paper from  Scripps Research, said in a press statement. “You can now evolve proteins continuously and precisely inside cells without damaging the cell's genome or requiring labor-intensive steps.”

Schultz's team circumvents typical directed evolution bottlenecks by engineering the bacterium and model organism E. coli  to host what they call a “second, artificial DNA replication system derived from bacteriophage T7.” T7 phage is a virus that infects bacteria and has been widely studied, as it's remarkably good at that particular job. This system is orthogonal, meaning it operates outside of the cell's own biological machinery, and it also targets only plasmid DNA—small, circular DNA that replicates separate from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Because the cell's genome remains untouched, scientists can introduce mutations every time the cell divides (roughly every 20 minutes). 

“This system represents a major advance in continuous evolution,” Christian Diercks, another co-senior author of the study from  Scripps Research, said in a press statement. “Instead of one round of evolution per week, you get a round each time the cell divides—so it really accelerates the process.”

To test this new platform, the team introduced TEM-1 β-lactamase—an antibiotic resistance gene—into the platform and exposed the E. coli bacterium to escalating levels of antibiotics. In less than a week, the system produced enzymes capable of withstanding antibiotics at levels 5,000 times higher than the original. So, not only can T7-Oracle be an important tool for developing new medicines, it could also give scientists a better understanding of how antibiotic resistance builds up over time. While a nice benefit, the paper's authors are more interested in the therapeutic possibilities. 

“What's exciting is that it's not limited to one disease or one kind of protein,' Diercks said in a press statement. “What matters is that we can now evolve virtually any protein, like cancer drug targets and therapeutic enzymes, in days instead of months.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The brain may lie at the biological center of our lived experience, but the scientific underpinnings of the brain—specifically, how it forms subjective consciousness—remain mysterious. Sadly, one truth is well-known: As we age, so does our brain. Because this all-important organ filled with 86 billion neurons forms our experience, dysregulation within the brain has outsized impacts on someone's quality of life. 

For years, scientists have tried to find ways to stave off these negative effects and make a person's healthspan largely match their ever-increasing lifespan. In 2021, Stanford University investigated the debris-cleaning role of the myeloid cells within the brain, and three years later, a study from the University of Rochester on the broader glymphatic system (which interacts with myeloid cells) found ways to restart the flow of brain-cleaning fluids. 

In another installment of this ongoing research to improve the aging brain, scientists from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) identified a protein that's central to aging the brain in humans. By analyzing how genes and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. When scientists reduced the presence of this protein in the hippocampus, the mice regained some of their youthful characteristics, including improved nerve connections and better permorfance on memory tests. The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Aging.

“It is truly a reversal of impairments […]. It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said in a press statement. “We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.”

To test this idea even further, the team artificially stimulated the production of FTL1 in young mice, and soon, their mental abilities began to match those of older rodents. When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells. 

“To identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the aging brain,” the authors wrote. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.”

The authors also note that a 2015 study found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. The researchers hope that by targeting FTL1, future therapies may not only improve natural cognitive decline, but will also benefit people with neurodegenerative diseases.

As this study—and many studies before it—have clearly demonstrated, there is no singular cause of mental decline. But with each new study, scientists work toward a holistic picture of neurodegenerative decline as we age, and with that new perspective comes the hope of new therapies that could make cognitive decline a thing of the past.

Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are common over-the-counter medications that many of us reach for when we're sick. But new research from the University of South Australia shows that these trusted staples are quietly fuelling one of the world's biggest health threats: antibiotic resistance.

In the first study of its kind, researchers found that ibuprofen and acetaminophen are not only driving antibiotic resistance when used individually but amplifying it when used together.

Assessing the interaction of non-antibiotic medications, the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) -- a common bacteria that causes gut and urinary tract infections ­­- researchers found that ibuprofen and acetaminophen significantly increased bacterial mutations, making E. coli highly resistant to the antibiotic.

It's an important finding that has serious health implications, particularly for people in aged care homes, where multiple medications are regularly administered.

The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.

Lead researcher UniSA's Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.

""Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria,"" Assoc Prof Venter says.

""This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications -- not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure -- making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.

""In this study we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut or urinary tract infections.

""When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and acetaminophen, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.

""We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.""

The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery) , temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).

Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.

""Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore,"" Assoc Prof Venter says.

""This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications -- particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.

""This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics -- and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.""

The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","9 in 10 Australian Teachers Are Stressed to Breaking Point","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250826005215.htm","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 08:55:30 GMT","

Nine out of 10 Australian teachers are experiencing severe stress, and nearly 70% say their workload is unmanageable, says UNSW Sydney research.

A new study from researchers at UNSW Sydney - the first to examine rates of depression, anxiety and stress in Australian teachers - has found they experience these mental health issues at three times the national norm.

The study 'Teachers' workload, turnover intentions, and mental health' published in Social Psychology of Education surveyed nearly 5000 primary and secondary school teachers across the country.

Researchers found that 90% of teachers reported moderate to extremely severe levels of stress, while more than two-thirds experienced moderate to extremely severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. The figures for depression and anxiety alone are more than double the national averages and point to a profession under immense pressure.

""This is not just a well-being issue - it's a workforce issue,"" said lead researcher Dr Helena Granziera, from the School of Education at UNSW's Faculty of Arts, Design & Architecture. ""Our findings show that teachers are experiencing mental health symptoms at rates far above the general population, and that these symptoms are closely linked to their workload and intentions to leave the profession.""

Using validated psychological measures (the DASS test), the study revealed that teachers' average scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were in the ""extremely severe"" range. Compared to national norms, teachers scored three times higher for depression and nearly four times higher for stress.

Causes of mental health issues

The research also found that workload manageability was a key factor influencing teachers' mental health. Teachers who reported their workload as unmanageable were significantly more likely to experience depressive symptoms, which in turn were strongly associated with their intentions to leave the profession. Notably, 68.8% of teachers described their workload as largely or completely unmanageable.

""Teachers are telling us they're overwhelmed - not by teaching itself, but by the growing burden of non-core tasks,"" said Dr Granziera. ""Administrative duties, compliance requirements, and excessive data collection are taking time away from lesson planning and student engagement. This is leading to burnout and a sense of professional disillusionment.""

Impact on education

The study's findings come at a time when Australia is facing a critical teacher shortage. According to recent data from the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership, up to 30% of teachers are considering leaving the profession before retirement age. The results shown in the paper add new urgency to these concerns, showing that poor mental health - particularly depression - is a significant predictor of turnover intentions.

""This research provides clear evidence that improving teachers' working conditions is not just beneficial - it's essential,"" said Dr Granziera. ""If we want to retain skilled educators and ensure quality education for all students, we must address the root causes of teacher stress and mental health decline.""

The study also highlighted disparities based on location, with teachers in rural and remote areas reporting higher levels of depressive symptoms. Female teachers were also more likely to report depressive symptoms and turnover intentions, reflecting broader trends in occupational mental health.

What needs to change

In response to these findings, the research team is calling for a multi-pronged approach to support teacher well-being, including:

The study took place between October 2022 and May 2024, with recruitment via the Black Dog Institute website and social media channels using targeted social media outreach and teacher-specific platforms.

""This is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies of teacher mental health in Australia,"" said Dr Granziera. ""It provides a clear and urgent message: our teachers are struggling, and they need support.""

The implications of these findings extend beyond the classroom. Poor teacher mental health has been linked to lower student achievement, reduced classroom quality, and diminished student well-being.

""Teachers' mental health is intricately related to students' outcomes, both in terms of students' mental health themselves, but also students' academic achievement,"" says Dr Granziera.

""It's clear improving teacher well-being should be a priority of policy makers not just for teachers but for our education system as a whole.""

A new study led by researchers at National Jewish Health has found that recent infection with the common cold -- often caused by rhinoviruses -- may offer temporary protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The research provides fresh insight into why children are less likely than adults to develop symptoms and could point toward new ways to reduce the severity of respiratory illnesses.

Published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases earlier this month, the study analyzed data from the nationwide Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS) study, which tracked more than 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021.

Researchers found that people, particularly children who had a recent rhinovirus infection, were significantly less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the following weeks. This effect is thought to be linked to the body's antiviral defenses. Rhinoviruses trigger a strong interferon response in the airways, which can temporarily prime the immune system to fight off other viruses.

""Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold,"" said senior author of the study Max Seibold, PhD, a researcher and Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health. ""This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.""

Using thousands of self-collected nasal swabs, the team tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, in participants of all ages. They also analyzed airway gene expression to see how recent viral infections influenced the body's antiviral defenses. Children were found to have higher baseline expression of interferon-related genes -- proteins that act as the immune system's first line of defense against viruses -- compared to adults.

While this phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, has been observed with other respiratory viruses, this is the first prospective study to show it may also occur with SARS-CoV-2.

""This doesn't mean people should intentionally try to catch a cold,"" said Camille Moore, PhD and lead author of the study at National Jewish Health. ""But understanding how one virus can affect the body's response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations.""

The research builds on earlier findings from the HEROS study showing that children are six times less likely than adults to develop symptomatic COVID. The new data highlights the role that both age-related immune differences and recent viral exposures may play in that protection.

National Jewish Health researchers conducted the study in collaboration with partners from 12 cities across the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists crack indole's toughest bond with copper, unlocking new medicines","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250826005224.htm","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:49:38 GMT","

Indole, a molecule made up of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered ring containing nitrogen, forms the core structure of many biologically active compounds. Derivatives of indole, where hydrogen atoms are replaced by various chemical groups, are naturally produced by plants, fungi, and even the human body.

Due to their properties, indoles have gained attention as a backbone for synthesizing a wide variety of drugs. Since 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 14 indole drugs to treat conditions, such as migraines, infections, and hypertension. Chemists have developed many strategies to attach different chemical groups to indoles. Some approaches introduce new groups directly onto the ring, while others involve temporary structural changes through intermediates. However, modifying specific positions on the indole ring, such as the C5 carbon, remains a challenge due to its low reactivity.

In a recent study, researchers at Chiba University, Japan, reported a method for selectively attaching an alkyl group to the C5 position of indole using a relatively inexpensive copper-based catalyst, which produced the desired product in yields of up to 91%. This method offers a more affordable and scalable approach for modifying indoles, which could be especially valuable in drug development.

The study, led by Associate Professor Shingo Harada, included Mr. Tomohiro Isono, B.Pharm., Ms. Mai Yanagawa, M.Pharm., and Professor Tetsuhiro Nemoto from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Chiba University, and was published online in the journal Chemical Science.

""We developed a direct, regioselective C5-H functionalization reaction of indoles under copper catalysis. The resulting compounds contain structural features commonly found in natural indole alkaloids and drug molecules, highlighting the usefulness of this approach for making biologically important compounds,"" says Dr. Harada.

The reaction uses carbenes, highly reactive carbon species that can form new carbon-carbon bonds. In an earlier study, the team used rhodium-based carbenes to attach groups at the C4 position of indole, guided by unsaturated enone groups placed at the 3-position. In this study, they used a similar strategy but altered the reaction conditions to target the C5 position instead.

They tested the reaction using a model compound, N-benzyl indole with an enone group, together with dimethyl α-diazomalonates as the carbene source and different combinations of rhodium, copper, and silver salts as catalysts. Initially, the desired C5-functionalized product formed only in small amounts, with yields up to 18%. However, when they used a combination of copper and silver salts (Cu(OAc)2·H2O and AgSbF6), the yield rose to 62%. Upon carrying out further optimizations, such as adjusting the solvent volume and increasing the concentration, they improved the yield to 77%.

The reaction proved to be highly versatile, working with a wide range of indoles. When the enone group was replaced at the 3-position with a benzoyl group, the yield increased to 91%. Successful reactions were also observed with indoles bearing other substituents, such as methoxybenzyl, allyl, and phenyl groups, opening the door to the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules.

To uncover the reaction mechanism, the team carried out quantum chemical calculations, which suggested that the carbene does not react directly at C5. Instead, it first forms a bond at the C4 position, creating a strained three-membered ring. This intermediate then rearranges, shifting the new bond to the C5 position. The copper catalyst plays a critical role in making this pathway possible by stabilizing the intermediate and lowering the energy barrier for the rearrangement.

This copper-catalyzed strategy offers a reliable and cost-effective approach for modifying indoles at the C5 position, producing compounds that closely resemble biologically active indole-based agents. Dr. Harada highlights the method's potential for drug discovery by stating, ""While it may not cause a significant shift right away, it could foster steady progress in drug discovery, leading to a small yet beneficial long-term impact.""

The team is continuing its research, exploring other metal-carbene reactions to develop more selective and efficient strategies for constructing indole-based molecules that might one day contribute to the treatment of specific diseases.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Rats walk again after breakthrough spinal cord repair with 3D printing","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250826005226.htm","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:48:27 GMT","

For the first time, a research team at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities demonstrated a groundbreaking process that combines 3D printing, stem cell biology, and lab-grown tissues for spinal cord injury recovery.

The study was recently published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, more than 300,000 people in the United States suffer from spinal cord injuries, yet there is no way to completely reverse the damage and paralysis from the injury. A major challenge is the death of nerve cells and the inability for nerve fibers to regrow across the injury site. This new research tackles this problem head-on.

The method involves creating a unique 3D-printed framework for lab-grown organs, called an organoid scaffold, with microscopic channels. These channels are then populated with regionally specific spinal neural progenitor cells (sNPCs), which are cells derived from human adult stem cells that have the capacity to divide and differentiate into specific types of mature cells.

""We use the 3D printed channels of the scaffold to direct the growth of the stem cells, which ensures the new nerve fibers grow in the desired way,"" said Guebum Han, a former University of Minnesota mechanical engineering postdoctoral researcher and first author on the paper who currently works at Intel Corporation. ""This method creates a relay system that when placed in the spinal cord bypasses the damaged area.""

In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. The cells successfully differentiated into neurons and extended their nerve fibers in both directions -- rostral (toward the head) and caudal (toward the tail) -- to form new connections with the host's existing nerve circuits.

The new nerve cells integrated seamlessly into the host spinal cord tissue over time, leading to significant functional recovery in the rats.

""Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research,"" said Ann Parr, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. ""Our laboratory is excited to explore the future potential of our 'mini spinal cords' for clinical translation.""

While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications.

In addition to Han and Parr, the team included Hyunjun Kim and Michael McAlpine from the University of Minnesota Department of Mechanical Engineering; Nicolas S. Lavoie, Nandadevi Patil and Olivia G. Korenfeld from the University of Minnesota Department of Neurosurgery; Manuel Esguerra from the University of Minnesota Department of Neuroscience; and Daeha Joung from the Department of Physics at Virginia Commonwealth University.

This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the State of Minnesota Spinal Cord Injury and Traumatic Brain Injury Research Grant Program and the Spinal Cord Society.

On 16 April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr held a press conference about rising diagnoses of autism. The US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary pointed to new data showing that autism prevalence in the United States had risen steeply from one in 150 eight-year-olds in 2000 to one in 31 in 2022. He called it an “epidemic” caused by “an environmental toxin” — and said he would soon be announcing a study to find the responsible agent.

The next month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the department that Kennedy leads, announced the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI). The initiative offered up to US$50 million to fund studies on the causes of autism. The winning applications are expected to be announced in September.

Usually, big investments in research are welcomed by scientists — but not this time. Many were dismayed that these developments seemed to ignore decades of work on the well-documented rise in autism diagnoses and on causes of the developmental condition. Although Kennedy said that environmental factors are the main cause of autism, research has shown that genetics plays a bigger part. Population studies1 have linked a handful of environmental factors — mostly encountered during pregnancy — to increased chances of autism, but their precise role has been hard to pin down. More than anything, research has shown that the drivers of autism are fiendishly complicated. “There will never be a sound-bite answer to what causes autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies neurodevelopmental conditions at Boston University, Massachusetts.

The rise in prevalence, many researchers say, is predominantly caused by an increase in diagnoses rather than a true rise in the underlying symptoms and traits. “We don't see an epidemic of autism, but we see an ‘epidemic' of diagnoses,” says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Researchers are concerned that Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, will use the ADSI to promote the disproven idea that vaccines are linked to autism.

Kennedy's comments prompted equally strong reactions from autistic people and autism groups, says Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, a non-profit research and advocacy group in New York City. Autistic people have a wide range of traits and symptoms — that means that many live and work independently, whereas others need intensive support. Some people want more research into the causes, she says, and others don't.

But many people in the autism community found it demeaning and offensive when Kennedy said at the press conference that “these are kids who will never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job”. These factors do not determine a person's value, Halladay says — and many autistic people are employed and pay taxes.

Scientists and autistic people alike are also concerned that the administration of US President Donald Trump is actually cutting the overall amount of money going towards autism research and support for autistic people, including through cancelled or delayed grants. “Everyone is really, really upset that money is being taken away from these important research projects,” Halladay says.

Many studies suggest that the prevalence of autism is rising, and not just in the United States. The trend has been observed in other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and Japan. “Everywhere people are doing research and are looking at the numbers, [they] are going up,” Bölte says (see ‘Tallying autism diagnoses'). In some less wealthy countries, however, a lack of health services and data mean that prevalence is difficult to assess.

There are several reasons to think that a rise in diagnoses explains a large part of this trend. One is that the diagnostic criteria have changed over time in two periodically updated tools used by health professionals: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), used mainly in the United States, and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

These describe autistic people generally as showing differences in social interaction and communication, as well as having ‘restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests'. But until the early 1990s, the manuals had a narrow definition for autism, says Diana Schendel, an epidemiologist who studies autism at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For instance, the third edition of the DSM recognized autism only in young children and required that they meet a minimum number of criteria.

Updated versions of both handbooks — ICD-10 in 1990 and DSM-IV in 1994 — broadened the diagnostic criteria so that they could be applied to people with fewer symptoms and of different ages. “That dramatically changed the opportunity for individuals to be classified under the autism umbrella,” says Schendel. In 2013, DSM-V dropped some separate diagnoses, such as Asperger's syndrome, and subsumed them under the term autism spectrum disorder. Autism is commonly diagnosed with co-occurring conditions, such as intellectual disability or attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

A 2015 study that Schendel co-authored tried to quantify the causes of increased autism prevalence among Danish people born between 1980 and 1991, and diagnosed up to 2011. The authors estimated that 60% of the increase could be explained by changes in the early 1990s to diagnostic criteria and to the way in which diagnoses were reported to national health registries2.

Diagnoses have also risen as health professionals have adjusted how they interpret and apply the criteria, and as they have adopted improved standardized diagnostic tools, such as structured interviews and observations. Eva Loth, a cognitive neuroscientist at King's College London, says that she now diagnoses people in research projects whom she would have excluded ten years ago. “Our understanding of what autism is has changed,” says Loth.

The other change that has turbocharged diagnoses, researchers say, is increased awareness of autism and declining stigma among teachers, health professionals and the broader public, alongside increased availability of diagnostic and support services. Parents are more likely to observe signs of autism in children and are often incentivized to seek a diagnosis if it can help their child to access support, such as at school. “Where before a child might be classified as difficult, problematic in a classroom, now they might go seek a diagnosis,” says Nick Puts, who studies neurodevelopment at King's College London and is autistic.

Children are also receiving diagnoses at a younger age than in the past. More adults are seeking diagnoses, and they have become more common in girls and women, in whom autism has historically been overlooked.

Bölte argues that the high demands of modern schools — such as extensive group work and digital information — could also play a part. “The learning environment is extremely complex today,” he says, “and there's more and more children with maybe lesser traits or symptoms who are just kind of overwhelmed.” Similarly, more adults — navigating a highly complex world — might be seeking help and advice, leading to more autism diagnoses.

How much of the rise in autism is accounted for by increased diagnoses and awareness? “It's certainly the vast majority,” Schendel says, although the exact proportion is difficult to calculate.

The figure that Kennedy cited — a prevalence of one in 31 among eight-year-olds — stems from an April report by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network3, a US surveillance programme that tallies autism in children using health and education records (see ‘Autism prevalence across the United States'). These show who has received a diagnosis and who is eligible for autism-related education. The results from this type of study are sometimes called registry or administrative prevalence, because they are based on administrative databases.

But some researchers view such studies with caution, says Damian Santomauro, a mental-health epidemiologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Identification of autism can come from various sources, including psychiatrists, psychologists and educational settings. Some children who have extra behavioural or educational needs might be included in an administrative database, but would not meet stringent criteria for diagnosis in an independent clinical evaluation, Santomauro says. Conversely, some people with undiagnosed autism might be excluded from registries.

A more accurate way to estimate prevalence is through a population survey, in which researchers screen everyone in a representative group of children or adults for autism. Santomauro led the most recent report on autism by the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest scientific project on impacts of health conditions), which is based only on survey data. This estimated that autism spectrum disorder had a prevalence of one in 127 people globally (less than 1%) in 2021. That's 62 million people overall4.

A long-term study of Swedish children, published this year, compared registry and survey prevalence in children who were born between 1993 and 2001. It found that the prevalence of autism symptoms that parents reported when their children reached 18 had remained stable, even as the prevalence of registered diagnoses had gone up5. And most of the increase in prevalence seen in studies comes from diagnoses of autistic people who do not have language impairment or a co-occurring intellectual disability, Tager-Flusberg says, whereas numbers of diagnosed autistic people with these conditions have changed little, if at all. All of this adds weight to the argument that spiking autism statistics are driven mostly by improved detection and diagnoses.

But Santomauro says that other high-quality surveys have made him think twice. A study published in 2020 that used rigorous survey methods reported a prevalence of more than 3% in five-year-old children in Japan — higher than previous estimates for autism in some other Asian countries6. So, although Santomauro agrees that most of the rise in autism is explained by increased detection and diagnosis, he says it remains possible that something could be pushing up “true prevalence” as well. But what?

Researchers have been hunting for the causes of autism for decades — and have run up against difficulties at every step. “We just don't really understand a lot about how any human brain functions,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who has worked in autism research and is autistic. “So trying to find causal mechanisms for autism is, I think, much harder than people thought it was going to be 20 years ago.”

One broad conclusion to emerge from the available data is that genetics plays a huge part. “Family-history risk is probably the strongest risk factor there is,” says Schendel.

Researchers capture the genetic contribution using measures of heritability – an estimate of how much of the differences in autism traits between individuals can be explained by inherited genes rather than by environmental factors. A large, five-country study7 published in 2019 estimated the heritability of autism as about 80% — equivalent to the heritability of height. For comparison, the heritability estimates for depression are roughly 30–50%.

Identifying the individual genes involved, however, has proved tough. “The genetics themselves are wildly complex,” says Craig Newschaffer, an autism researcher at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.

Researchers have sought genes by comparing the genomes of autistic people and people who are not autistic in families and in bigger population studies. These have helped to pinpoint a selection of rare genetic variants — variations in DNA sequence — that cause a relatively large increase in the chances of autism. Many of these are de novo mutations that probably arose in a sperm or egg cell and were passed to a child. These large-impact variants are thought to be a major driver of autism in an estimated 10–20% of autistic people.

But “the genetic architecture is very different from one individual to another”, says geneticist Thomas Bourgeron, who studies autism at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Researchers have also found that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of common variants have a tiny effect individually — making them hard to pinpoint — but a big effect when combined. If someone has enough variants, they could end up with symptoms and a diagnosis.

After genetics, environmental factors are “a smaller slice of the pie” in driving autism, Schendel says, although there is debate about the size of the slice. Some researchers argue that the influence of environmental factors is vanishingly small, and others disagree. Most research suggests that any environmental factors exert their influence before birth, however, and studies have convincingly shown no link to vaccines8,9.

Many studies suggest that older parental age — for mothers or fathers — is linked to an increased likelihood of autism in children10. The average childbearing age has been increasing in many high-income countries, so this could be playing a small part in increasing autism prevalence, researchers say. One possible explanation is that children of older parents are more likely to have de novo mutations than are children of younger parents.

Infections during pregnancy have also been linked in many studies to a greater chance of autism, as has exposure to air pollution before birth. For instance, a US study published in June, involving more than 8,000 children and their mothers, found that exposure to higher levels of ozone was associated with autism11.

As collections of grains flow, free-surface deformations often develop. These typically suggest the presence of secondary flows, smaller in magnitude than the primary motion but driving complex three-dimensional internal structures. While one can infer such behaviour from boundaries or simulations, we have not previously been able to directly observe secondary flows experimentally. In this paper we present an experimental confirmation of secondary kinematics within granular media using dynamic x-ray radiography, without needing to stop motion for tomography. Specifically, we create a bulldozing mechanism of conveyor-driven grains. This generates a non-uniform, indented free-surface, hinting that secondary mechanisms are at play alongside the primary regime. Discrete element method simulations are shown to be consistent with this secondary-flow explanation. We then probe further experimentally using two perpendicular x-ray source/detector pairs to measure the velocity inside the bulk. This indeed unveils a complex three-dimensional flow pattern that deviates from the primary vertical planes and must include vortices and convection rolls. This advancement is pertinent for industrial and natural scenarios where grains impact obstacles, and has broader relevance for studying the rheology associated with secondary flows in other amorphous materials such as emulsions, pastes and colloids.

Understanding the complex behaviour of dense amorphous soft materials, ranging from granular materials to emulsions, remains a fundamental challenge in soft matter physics1,2. These materials exhibit intricate flow dynamics that significantly influence their macroscopic properties. This is particularly apparent in granular media3,4, which are ubiquitous in both nature and industry, appearing in forms as diverse as sand, mineral ores, and cereals. The physical description of these materials is challenging due to their propensity to transition between solid-, liquid-, and gaseous-like phases based on external excitation rather than on their thermal temperature. Modelling the fluid-like phase of granular materials is particularly involved when one wishes to take into account the complex interactions with boundaries. For instance, when a geophysical granular flow encounters an abrupt change in topography, or when grains on industrial conveyors impact an obstacle, the flow can exhibit a sudden change in surface height, known as a shock or discontinuity. It is widely understood that such surface discontinuities conceal complex interactions and displacements beneath the free surface, yet measuring the corresponding internal flow field remains a significant challenge.

A commonly proposed internal flow mechanism in granular systems is ‘secondary flows'. These represent displacements in directions different from the flow's primary component that are typically smaller in magnitude. For example, grains in a granular avalanche predominantly move in the downslope direction, but there may also be smaller recirculating or convection-like motion in the transverse or normal directions to the slope5,6,7. Secondary flows are not unique to granular media; they also occur in classical Newtonian fluids such as water8, where they are much better understood thanks to the water's transparency, which allows for extensive volumetric observations9,10, often through the use of tracers11,12, and thanks to the well-established rheological properties of water13,14. Our understanding of secondary flows in water currents is crucial, for instance for designing open-channel structures15,16,17 and in fluvial geomorphology18,19.

However, the experimental study of secondary flows in granular media remains challenging due to the opacity of the grains. We often rely on numerical simulations, usually in the form of particle-based discrete element method (DEM) computations. While these provide valuable insights into the internal flow, they only represent a simplified model of the actual physical system. On the other hand, we can make experimental observations at either the free surface or lateral sidewalls to deduce the existence of secondary flows. For example, Forterre and Pouliquen made surface velocity and thickness measurements to infer the existence of longitudinal vortices20, which accurately matched the results of a linear stability analysis21. However, boundaries are known to alter the flow itself due to the formation of granular boundary layers22,23, and therefore, such measurements do not provide the full internal picture. There have been some experimental studies of secondary flows in granular suspensions using refractive-index-matched particles submerged in viscous fluids24,25. However, in these regimes, the development of secondary flows cannot be attributed purely to granular effects, as similar flows inevitably occur in pure fluids12.

The experimental study of secondary flows underneath the free surface of dry granular media requires advanced imaging techniques capable of seeing through the bulk of opaque grains. One such method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has been used to effectively measure internal particle velocities in continuously flowing Couette geometries26 but has not previously detected the existence of secondary flows. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is another non-invasive method that constructs a three-dimensional (3D) density map from which grain locations can be retrieved. This technique works by successively capturing x-ray radiographs from multiple directions, which requires intermittent pauses between flow periods to accommodate the extended time needed to obtain such radiographs without grain motion and imaging artifacts27,28,29. For this reason, most research on secondary flows in dry granular media focuses on quasi-static conditions, such as those achieved using a Couette cell30,31,32,33,34,35,36. While much can be learned from this approach, the majority of natural and industrial granular flows are continuously moving, which presents a fundamentally different deformation regime that is never left to relax to a static state. Up until now, investigations of secondary flows in continuous flow configurations have been limited to DEM simulations or inferred from experimental observations at boundaries.

Here, we advance the experimental investigation of the development of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media. This is done without requiring interstitial fluid or intermittent halting of motion for volumetric measurements. Similarly, the methods presented here can be applied to any form of granular media – whether dry, saturated, or partially saturated – as well as to general heterogeneous flowing media, such as foams and active matter. The particular laboratory setup consists of a bulldozed granular flow in an open channel, which is established by driving grains from the base using a rubber conveyor belt and colliding these with a perpendicular wall. This creates a non-uniform free surface, known as a heap37,38. Crucially, the flow is significantly faster than in the Couette cell geometry previously used to investigate secondary flows. Similar conveyor-belt-driven configurations have previously been used to examine strain localisation at sidewalls using optical particle image velocimetry (PIV)39. Here, we instead use fast x-ray radiography from two perpendicular positions and develop a measurement technique to study the 3D shape of the strongly deformed free surface. This suggests the presence of secondary flows beneath the free-surface, which we explore with DEM models. We then experimentally measure the 3D velocity field along the main flow direction using x-ray rheography40. When combined with velocity fields averaged across both the width and the height of the flow, this provides a robust experimental volumetric observation of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media.

The experimental setup giving rise to secondary flows is sketched in Fig. 1. The configuration is an open flume positioned above a conveyor belt, imaged through two x-ray radiography systems. The flume has a reservoir of grains at one end, and a wall suspended with a gap from the conveyor belt at the other. An initial pile of grains is carried by the conveyor belt and forms a heap upon reaching the suspended wall. This heap stabilises when the effect of its weight on the outgoing flow under the wall balances the incoming flow from the emptying reservoir. According to the inertial numbers analysed in the Supplementary Information, the granular flow is largely faster than the quasi-static regime but slower than the collisional regime. High-speed x-ray radiography is then employed to analyse the heap, enabling the investigation of internal flow dynamics within the granular media, with reduced influence from the sidewalls on the images. Radiographs are obtained during motion from two perpendicular directions: vertically through the conveyor (z direction), and horizontally through the lateral sidewalls (y direction). Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 show example radiographs obtained for the corresponding two x-ray detectors. Note that a third detector parallel to the x direction is not considered as the x-ray beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir, which would attenuate the signal too much to make meaningful measurements. Supplementary Video 1 is also available online, showing the two sets of dynamic radiographs alongside the physical experimental setup. A DEM simulation is also conducted that complements the experimental flow observations. Technical details of this simulation and of the experimental setup and procedures are described in the Methods section. While the results section focuses on a single set of parameters, the robustness of the findings is further illustrated for other values in the Supplementary Information.

Here, h is the flow thickness, L the heap length, and h* its height. The wall at the exit of the reservoir and the outgoing wall are elevated at heights h1 and h2, respectively, which control the steadiness of the heap. The conveyor belt moves at a velocity Ub in a counter-clockwise direction, as indicated by the circular arrows at the edges of the belt. The conveyor belt transports the particles in the direction indicated by the dashed arrows. a and b show example radiographs captured during the steady state for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. The origin of the global coordinate system (x, y, z) is at the centre of the line connecting the wall and the conveyor belt. Coordinate systems (η, ζ) are local to each x-ray detector. The experimental geometry and radiographs are illustrated using Supplementary Video 1 (available online).

The granular flow was first analysed by developing an x-ray image reconstruction method with which the 3D details of the deformed free surface along the heap were measured, as shown in Fig. 2a. The key idea is to use the time-averaged intensity fields from one x-ray direction to estimate the absorption coefficient of the material in the other direction. The technical details of this reconstruction process are described in the Methods section.

a and b show the experimental free surface and relative height profiles at various x-positions, respectively. c and d display the free surface in the DEM simulation using coarse-grained density field and synthetic radiographs, respectively. The different colours in the three free-surface plots represent the relative heights at each given x-axis position (h(x, y)/hmax(x)). The arrows indicate the direction of the conveyor belt velocity (Ub).

After the heap has fully stabilised in the flume, it exhibits a relatively uniform appearance across the width. Surprisingly, however, the reconstruction also reveals a pronounced dip at the start of the heap. This can be seen in the 2D height profiles at different positions, depicted in Fig. 2b. Note that there are also smaller fluctuations in the free-surface profile that are attributed to the discrete, granular nature of the material. These are not fully smoothed out when averaging the x-ray intensity over time, especially at the slower-moving section near the wall. Note also that the height profile displays a minor overall slope across the width, which is also apparent in the supplementary tests. This is attributed to x-ray scattering or to the conical shape of the x-ray beam, leading to uneven illuminating intensity in y.

In light of past research revealing secondary flows under non-uniform free surfaces30,32,33,34,41, the dip at the start of the heap raises the question of whether such flow might develop beneath the bulldozed grains. In this scenario, the primary flow moves along the x direction, as it is primarily driven by the belt, and in the normal z direction, as the development of a heap necessitates particles climbing upwards to conserve mass, irrespective of secondary flows. Conversely, any bulk motion in the transverse y direction should be attributed directly to secondary flows, as this direction is orthogonal to the main stream of material.

To investigate the possibility of secondary flow, we thus focus on the coherent existence of velocities along the y direction. We begin by developing a DEM simulation, which is designed to replicate the experiment. The technical details of the simulation are described in the Methods section.

The DEM simulation was first used to evaluate the free-surface x-ray measurement technique described in full in the Methods section. To achieve this, the free surface in the DEM simulation was analysed using both its coarse-grained density field (Fig. 2c) and the same x-ray technique applied to synthetic radiographs, which were generated from the DEM model as in previous work40 based on particle positions and assumed x-ray attenuation properties (Fig. 2d). The strong agreement between Fig. 2c, d confirms the validity of the free-surface x-ray technique, thereby supporting the experimental findings in Fig. 2a and the existence of the dip at the start of the heap.

Second, the simulation also allowed us to obtain the three velocity components Ux, Uy, and Uz parallel to their respective axes through the flow. Following the visualisation method proposed by Krishnaraj & Nott32, the coarse-grained field of Uy and the streamlines normal to the belt motion are shown in Fig. 3 in order to highlight secondary flows. Indeed, the Uy velocity field and the cross-sectional streamlines display strong evidence of secondary flows. This is particularly visible through cross-section 3b around the dip at the start of the heap. The cross-sectional streamlines at this position reveal a flow directed upwards, displacing horizontally from the walls towards the centre. The secondary flows are around one order of magnitude smaller than the basal velocity Ub driving the primary flow at this position.

Left plot shows the value of the horizontal (Uy) velocities at the surface of the flow. Here, the arrow indicates the direction of the conveyor belt velocity (Ub). a–c show the value of Uy on three different slices along the flume at xa = 41.8 cm, xb = 34.1 cm, xc = 20.5 cm from the exit wall, respectively, as well as cross-sectional streamlines of Uy and the vertical (Uz) velocities. Supplementary Video 2 (available online) shows the Uy velocity component and the cross-sectional streamlines along the x-axis.

Moreover, the secondary flows are not constrained to only this position. Figure 3a reveals that the incoming flow before the heap also displays secondary flows, this time even smaller at around three orders of magnitude below Ub. These weak secondary flows are in the form of small rollers near both lateral walls, rotating inwards toward the centre of the flume. Elsewhere at this x position, the flow established by the DEM model is influenced predominantly by the conveyor belt with minimal vertical or transverse displacements (Uy ≈ 0, Uz ≈ 0), and hence the streamlines in Fig. 3a display more incoherent patterns.

The secondary flow is also weaker after the dip vanishes, as illustrated in cross-section 3c, where the free-surface becomes more uniform along the width of the flume. Here, there is only a weak signal of secondary flow, again in the form of convection rollers near the lateral boundaries. However, the corresponding motion changes direction again, now heading outwards from the centre towards the walls. Supplementary Video 2 (available online) illustrates the emergence and disappearance of these different phenomena when moving along the flume in the x direction.

Having obtained strong evidence of secondary flows in the DEM simulations, we now return to the experimental configuration to establish whether we can detect similar secondary flows in the physical system. Rather than the free-surface profile already obtained using the x-ray reconstruction method, attention is now shifted to the velocity fields, specifically the internal flow field.

A 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity field was obtained using the two perpendicular sets of radiographs and the x-ray rheography technique developed by Baker et al.40, with the results shown on Fig. 4a. The undisturbed flow, before the heap, was found to move at velocity Ub with no slip at the bottom at the centre of the flume, demonstrating a well-controlled conveyed flow set-up. The presence of the sidewalls, however, induces some shearing across the width with velocities decreasing toward the walls. In the heap, two different layers are observed parallel to the x-axis, producing a horizontal band of shearing through the height, emanating from around the height of the incoming flow h1. Below  ~ h1, the average velocity of the flow is slightly below Ub. The thickness of this horizontal shear band appears to be influenced by the heap's weight. Above  ~ h1, the flow shows little motion.

The x-axis velocity fields (Ux) derived through the experimental x-ray rheography technique and the discrete element method simulations are shown in a and b, respectively, with additional slice views in y − z and x − z planes. The arrows indicate the direction of the conveyor velocity (Ub), which moves from right to left in all panels.

The DEM result of the Ux velocity field seen in Fig. 4b accurately replicates the main features of the rheography result, including the velocity variation along the width of the channel, and the presence of the horizontal shear band. The interaction between the heap and the flow underneath also appears similar to the results from the numerical simulation of Sauret et al.37 (referring specifically to their figure 18 (a)). One notable difference between the x-ray experiments and the DEM results is the slope of the heap. Despite both tests producing similar heap height, h*, the experiment exhibits a shorter heap length compared to the DEM result. However, the qualitative evolution of the Ux-velocity field is similar to the one obtained from the experimental x-ray rheography, suggesting that should secondary flow also exist in the physical reality, it would not influence the main flow direction.

In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity component, we apply correlation-based particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of the two sets of radiographs to obtain Uy and Uz velocity fields, depth-averaged in the direction of the x-ray beams23. This complementary imaging method provides insight into all velocity components, which strongly consolidate our finding of secondary granular flows in the experimental setup. For the purpose of cross-validation, these analyses were conducted on both real experimental radiographs and simulated radiographs, the latter based on particle positions from DEM and assumed x-ray attenuation properties. Technical details are available in the Methods section.

Figure 5 displays the contours of the depth-averaged velocity fields from both the experimental and simulated radiographs. The Ux velocity fields present multiple similarities, as displayed in Fig. 5a, b, e, f, consistent with Fig. 4. When viewed from above using detector 2 (see Fig. 5a, b), both the experiment and simulation show an incoming flow at the centre of the flume that follows the conveyor velocity. The velocity gradually decreases when moving towards the heap, as well as when moving from the centre toward the walls. When viewed from the side using detector 1 (see Fig. 5e, f) both cases show a similar shear band between the bottom of the flow and the heap, where the lower material flows at velocities close to Ub. Above the shear band, the flow develops very slowly. The DEM simulation accurately reproduces the observed shear band.

These results are cross-validated with the corresponding depth-averaged velocity fields of the discrete element method simulation (right column), recreated from artificially generated radiographs. a and b refer to the x-axis velocity fields (Ux) seen from the top (detector 2). Similarly, c and d display the y-axis velocity fields (Uy). x-axis velocity fields from the side (detector 1) are shown on e and f, and z-axis velocity fields (Uz) are displayed on g and h. All velocity fields are normalised by the velocity (Ub) of the conveyor, which transports particles from right to left in all the above panels.

More importantly, as depicted from the top view of detector 2 by both the experiment and simulation in Fig. 5c, d, respectively, the horizontal velocity component Uy reveals distinct secondary flows at the start of the heap, which move from the walls toward the centre. All velocities in Fig. 5 are normalised by the belt velocity Ub, allowing easy comparison of the corresponding magnitudes. This indeed confirms that the secondary flow is significantly slower than the primary conveying motion, being an order of magnitude less than Ub. As the dip vanishes, the secondary flow shifts direction, moving from the centre of the flume toward the walls. This transition is more prominent in the experimental velocity field in Fig. 5c, implying potential issues of replicating the exact boundary conditions and particle interactions in the DEM simulation.

Side-view analysis from detector 1 of the Uz vertical velocity fields in Fig. 5g, h shows a robust upward flow where the free surface starts to ascend, with higher magnitude in DEM simulations compared to the experiments. In addition, a pronounced downward flow is observed near the outgoing gate, influenced by the exit wall. The area of this downward flow is more extensive in the DEM results.

Note that, in general, x-ray rheography can be applied to recover the full three components of velocity in three dimensions40. However, this requires three mutually perpendicular imaging direction. For this particular experimental setup, this would involve positioning an x-ray source and detector along the x-direction, meaning the beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir. This would have caused excessive attenuation, making it virtually impossible to measure the components Uy and Uz in 3D. Nevertheless, the 3D measurements of Ux, combined with the depth-averaged values for the other components, support the secondary flow observations.

This paper has presented experimental confirmation of a secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media. Using a confined chute and conveyor belt to establish a bulldozing mechanism, we are able to probe the system through a variety of x-ray radiography techniques and establish the presence of secondary vortices within the dry granular bulk. These techniques enable such secondary flows to be internally measured experimentally without having to artificially change the system (e.g., restricting to quasi-static motion, as in CT) or change the material (e.g., add viscous interstitial fluid, as in refractive index matching scanning).

Note that several methods exist to estimate grain velocities along the surface of a granular bulk, and these measurements have previously been used to infer secondary flow within the material20,21. However, in general, two significant limitations exist from such a surface measurement approach. First, surface velocity measurements must carefully account for and exclude the effects of particles seeping into or emerging from the bulk. Second, and more critically, surface measurements alone cannot provide conclusive insights into the flow within the bulk because surface particles represent only a negligible fraction of the total particles in the system. In fact, visual inspection of our system has revealed surface disturbances in the form of localised and often gaseous backward-avalanching surface-grains that, in isolation, would mislead conclusions about the flow within the bulk. Similarly, bulk quantities such as depth-averaged velocities are not necessarily related to boundary or surface measurements. For example, in the rotating cylinder system previously investigated by Baker & Einav42, positive and negative displacements cancel each other out, making the beam-averaged velocity equal to zero. However, just measuring from the sidewall of the cylinder (if it was made of transparent material) would suggest all lateral velocities are non-zero and moving in the same direction. In contrast, the method proposed in this article directly addresses these limitations by considering the flow of all grains throughout the thickness or depth of the bulk, rather than focusing solely on surface particles. As such, the results presented here offer an experimental validation of secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media.

In establishing the presence of secondary flows in this system, we have developed an x-ray methodology for measuring the 3D surface profile of flowing granular media. This could be useful beyond the specific geometry and material investigated here, for example where the free surface is obstructed by airborne grains or rigid structures making optical imaging difficult but where x-rays could still be transmitted through. We have also applied existing dynamic x-ray radiography23 and rheography40 methods to a new geometry, further strengthening the value of these tools both in isolation and, crucially, in conjunction with each other and the free-surface measurements to build a more complete picture of the secondary flows. A further methodological innovation is the use of dynamic x-ray radiography to measure depth-averaged velocities. While the same approach has previously been applied to compute quantities averaged in the lateral directions (avoiding sidewall effects)23, depth-averaged quantities are of particular interest because they can be compared directly to shallow-water type flow models. These models have been particularly pivotal in studying geomorphological changes caused by soil erosion and landslides, as well as glacial landforms and snow avalanches43,44,45. Combining the x-ray method for 3D free surface profiling with the application of x-ray radiography for measuring depth-averaged velocities provides a powerful means of comprehensively evaluating the predictions of shallow-water-type models.

The experimental observations made in this paper allow us to investigate the secondary flow patterns and mechanism. To further our understanding of this and other geometries, it is important to isolate the controlling factors that determine the presence and magnitude of such secondary flows. Since the secondary vortices are confined and placed symmetrically between the lateral sidewalls, a key question here is whether these boundaries are required to produce such flow patterns. To this end, we have also studied the dependence of the secondary flows on sidewalls using DEM simulations of a similar configuration but with either frictionless sidewalls or periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions (see Supplementary Information). In the frictionless sidewall case, some traces of secondary flows could still be detected. On the other hand, the analysis using the periodic boundaries appears to entirely eliminate the secondary flows, suggesting that the boundedness is indeed a necessary condition and that secondary flows would not form spontaneously in an unconfined setting. A more comprehensive study of the exact role of the wall properties in the development of secondary flows remains open. While most bulldozed grain systems will, in practise, be bounded by the finite domain of the bulldozer cap, this observation helps inform higher-order constitutive models incorporating, for example, non-local effects4. These models can, in turn, contribute to our understanding of other potential secondary mechanisms in unbounded flows, such as the presence of longitudinal ridges on Martian landslide deposits46, which have been postulated to occur during the transition from thick to thin flow regimes.

Building on the results presented here, future work could apply the same general tools to different materials to investigate, for example, the role of grain shape and convexity, which has previously been found to induce qualitatively distinct secondary mechanisms27,30. Furthermore, the complementary imaging approach, key to the success of this study, could be extended further to allow us to study an even broader range of granular and glassy media. In particular, to elucidate whether the granular or viscous fluid phase drives secondary flows in suspensions, one could combine the dry granular tools presented here with submerged refractive index-matching scanning experiments. This would provide insight into the behaviour of saturated and partially saturated systems.

The experimental flume is divided into three sections: a reservoir to supply incoming grains, the flow region of interest, and an outflow region where grains leave the system and fall into a bucket. The length of the flow domain is 0.55 m, and it has a width of 0.10 m. The walls separating these regions are elevated at heights h1 and h2 above the belt and the lateral sidewalls. The sidewalls confine the flow for the whole length of the experimental domain, including the outflow. The conveyor belt is made of rubber with uniformly distributed asperities of size 3 mm. The two cross-flow walls and the flume are all made out of 1cm-thick acrylic sheets, whereas the front wall, which accumulates the heap, is made of aluminium. To avoid vibrations during tests, the flume was first pressed against the conveyor belt under its weight and then anchored tightly using beams at the top of the system, out of the line of x-rays. This anchoring approach prevented grains from slipping under the walls or even getting stuck during the tests, thus averting any potential belt damage.

The granular material comprises spherical glass beads with an average diameter of d = 3 mm. The test is set up by first filling up the reservoir with grains, as well as placing an additional pile of grains with a height > h1 next to the reservoir gate, inside the flow region of interest. As the belt starts moving, the new grains entering the flowing domain join the pile and eventually either impact the outgoing wall or flow through the downstream opening, so their aggregated bulk eventually forms a steady heap a few seconds after impact. The online Supplementary Video 1 captures this process. The steady state concludes when the reservoir empties, which ceases the incoming flux and gradually reduces the heap's size until it levels and disappears. Through trial and error it was found that by taking h2 = h1 − d/2 the flow maintained a sufficiently prolonged steady state geometry for x-ray imaging that lasted up to 2 minutes, limited by the capacity of the reservoir.

Multiple tests were performed, all with the belt velocity Ub fixed at 2 cm s−1 to eliminate motion blur on the x-ray radiographs. On the other hand, we varied h1 from 25 to 60 mm, and the height of the heap h* from 50 mm to h* ≈ 100 mm by changing the initial amount of grains on the conveyor belt. The test results show that the heap length L solely depends on the heap height h* − h1, and the heap maintains a constant slope α ≃ 18o. Given this trend, a single test is analysed in this study, with h1 ≈ 25 mm and h* ≈ 77 mm. Additional test results confirming the robustness of the mechanism are presented in the Supplementary Information.

The x-ray sources were positioned ~2 m from the flume to minimise non-parallel beam effects. Similarly, the x-ray detectors were situated around 20 cm from the flume in the opposite direction of their respective sources, as depicted in Fig. 1. Steel panels were positioned to prevent undesired illumination of the detectors from their non-associated sources. During tests, the sources were set to produce x-ray at a maximum energy of 190 keV and 4 mA current for source 1, and 190 keV and 5 mA for source 2. Radiographs were captured at a frequency of 30 fps with a resolution of 960 × 768 px at 16-bit with a spatial resolution of 0.29 px mm−1 and 0.22 px mm−1 for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. In addition to the full, flowing system, radiographs were also obtained of the empty chute to aid subsequent analysis. The accuracy of the 2D and 3D velocity measurement methods presented in this work has been studied using known velocity fields23,40. While the methods sometimes introduce quantitative errors, they qualitatively recover a range of underlying fields and therefore the secondary flow findings in this paper are believed to be robust.

Here, we introduce a reconstruction method for establishing 3D profiles of free surfaces of granular flows using x-ray radiography from two orthogonal directions. The starting point of the method assumes that the radiograph intensity Ii from the i-th detector follows the Beer-Lambert absorption law47:

where Ii,R is the i-th detector's reference intensity of the radiograph of the empty flume, μ ≡ μ(ξ) is the local absorption of the material at the ξ location, while the integral is over the x-ray beam length.

In the case of detector 2, assuming that there is no significant spatial change in the volume fraction of the dense flowing material, Eq. (1) simplifies and rearranges to:

where hBL(x, y) is the theoretical Beer-Lambert surface height profile, and μc is the effective material absorption of the grains on detector 2, which is assumed constant. The radiograph intensities Ii, used in this process, are depicted in Supplementary Video 3, along with their values normalised by Ii,R. In order to capture additional effects such as beam hardening and x-ray scattering, which are not considered by the Beer-Lambert law, we consider the following empirical linear relation for the actual surface height profile:

with βc a constant.

In order to obtain μc and βc, we first calculate a nominal profile of the averaged height along the y direction, \({ < h > }_{y}\equiv { < h > }_{y}(x)\) using detector 1. This is done from direct thresholding of the time-averaged absorption field \({ < \ln ({I}_{1}/{I}_{1,R}) > }_{t}\), and is well-defined thanks to the very different absorption of air and grains, and the fact that the material height does not vary much across the y direction of the flume, even near the dip.

To first order, the surface height at the centre of the flume is estimated by \(h(x,0)\approx { < h > }_{y}\). Then, the effective material attenuation coefficient μc on detector 2 can be found by fitting a linear law from the time-averaged absorption field observed at each pixel along the centre line:

where we obtain μc = 0.01117 mm−1, as well as βc = 0.2304 which was introduced to allow for additional effects of beam hardening and x-ray scattering. The fit can be seen in Supplementary Fig. 2.

As a last step, h(x, y) from Eq. (3) is smoothed with a 2D Gaussian filter of standard deviation 6 px.

The physical experiments were computationally modelled using the DEM through the open source code YADE48. The simulations involved N ≈ 120,000 spherical particles, which were modelled using a viscoelastic contact law with a linear spring for normal contacts and a Coulomb threshold for tangential contacts49. These particles have the same average diameter 3 ± 0.75 mm as the glass beads used in experiments, with some added polydispersity to avoid crystallisation while preventing segregation. Their interparticle friction was set at 0.5, their stiffness at 1 × 107 Pa, their density was set at 2500 kg m−3 to mimic the material and ensure maximum interparticle deformation of 10−4d. The normal restitution coefficient was set at 0.5, and the Poisson's ratio at 0.3. To mimic the geometric effects of the rubber conveyor belt, its texture of was simulated using a set of spheres with a fixed spacing of every two rows along the y-axis, at a height z = 0, with a longitudinal row at a height of z = − d. These boundary grains were set in motion at velocity Ub and had an increased friction coefficient of 1.0. A similar friction coefficient was set to describe the acrylic walls, aligning with literature values for the friction coefficient between glass with acrylic and rubber50. Fictitious rolling friction was not implemented since the boundary spheres provide an actual physical rolling resistance. However, different friction coefficient values and belt arrangements were tested, with the stated combination of parameters above exhibiting the closest similarity to the experimental result while also aligning with the physical properties of the simulated materials.

The experimental setup for the simulations mirrored the physical experiment: a reservoir initially filled with grains and a pile of grains situated inside the flume. The pile height was adjusted to match h* upon reaching a steady state. Once a constant state was achieved, the grains' locations, velocities, and radii were recorded to a file at a frequency of 30 fps, mirroring the experimental setup. 2700 frames were used for the simulations presented in this work. Next, a coarse-graining method51 was employed to obtain the velocity and density fields of the recorded flowing spheres, using a Lucy windowing function with a radius of 2d.

Synthetic radiographs were generated from DEM data as in previous studies40,42 using the sphere positions and radii to calculate the attenuation along the x-ray path. This was based on an idealised system where the sample consists of solid particles, each of the same uniform x-ray attenuation coefficient, and interstitial air of negligible attenuation compared to the solid phase. Assuming a parallel x-ray beam with no scattering, the Beer-Lambert attenuation law then simplifies to

where I0,DEM is the initial x-ray intensity before travelling through any grains, μDEM is the constant attenuation coefficient and D is the total thickness of grains that the x-ray beam travels through. This thickness will depend on the pixel position (η, ζ) in the local imaging coordinates and can be calculated by summing each of the N projected particle thicknesses. For detector 1 the depth is then given by

and similarly for detector 2 the depth is

where (xi, yi, zi) and ri represent the position and radius of particle i. These two thicknesses are calculated for each frame and Eq. (5) is then used to generate the corresponding artificial radiographs with an arbitrary attenuation coefficient of μDEM = 10, initial intensity I0,DEM = 100,000 and spatial resolution 3 px mm−1.

In order to emphasise the density fluctuations within the flow, the radiographs are first divided by the time-averaged intensity of the steady-state frames \({ < I > }_{t}\). The absorption fluctuation field (μfluct) is then calculated by

as depicted in Supplementary Video 3. The 3D velocity field is reconstructed using the x-ray rheography technique40 applied to the normalised intensity fields μfluct. We focus on the x-axis velocity component, which is common to both imaging directions. X-ray rheography is a correlation-based algorithm that first reconstructs the distribution of in-plane displacements through the out-of-plane direction by solving a deconvolution problem42. It then solves an optimisation problem to combine velocity distributions from two perpendicular directions and reconstruct internal velocity fields. The accuracy and sources of errors of x-ray rheography have previously been investigated for both the initial distribution reconstruction42 and the whole rheography process40 (see Supplementary Information within).

Here, we apply the initial correlation analysis on successive pairs of images using an interrogation window size of 32 px and a maximum displacement of  ±16 px. The deconvolution process was conducted utilising regularisation parameters α = 0.1 and p = 2.0 (see Baker et al.40), and this was repeated for multiple pairs of images to improve accuracy, up to a maximum of 100,000 evaluations. The optimisation problem was solved by averaging the best 100 configurations with the smallest errors from a total of 10,000 to give the resulting internal x velocities. Note that this velocity field assumes a uniform free surface across the width of the flume, and thus disregards the obtained dip along with any other variation in the free surface. The calculated velocity fields are therefore trimmed using the free surface measurements in order to eliminate extrapolated velocities out of the granular domain.

The experimental depth-averaged velocity fields were computed from successive x-ray radiographs using the methodology developed by Guillard et al.23 for granular silos, which was validated against known flow rates from a mass balance. PIV analysis was performed on the attenuation fluctuation fields μfluct from the experiments and the DEM synthetic radiographs using the software PIVLab52. For the DEM radiographs, the analysis was conducted using auto contrast, with FFT window deformation as the PIV algorithm. The interrogation width area was set at 64 px with a step of 32 px for the first pass, and a width of 32 px with a step of 16 px for a second pass. A Gauss 2 × 3 point for the sub-pixel estimator and a standard correlation robustness setting were applied. Similar settings were applied for the experimental radiographs, with the addition of a CLAHE filter of 64 px during image preprocessing. For the side detector analysis, a mask drawn at the free surface of the side view detector (1) was implemented to ignore all displacements above the free surface. Obtained displacements for detector 1 were calibrated using height h2 and for detector 2 using the known flume width. The final results were averaged in time with no additional filtering.

A lung from a genetically modified pig has been transplanted into a person for the first time1. The recipient, a 39-year-old man in China, was brain dead, but the organ survived for nine days. 

At least half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and a thymus. The latest procedure suggests that almost any pig organ could be transplanted into people, researchers say. They hope that the animal organs might one day save the thousands of people who die each year while waiting for a donor organ. 

Lungs are the most difficult organ to transplant, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who in 2022 led the first pig–heart transplant into a living person. Lungs have the most blood vessels of any transplantable organ, so they are more prone to attack from the immune system, which can lead to blood clots and tissue damage, says Mohiuddin. “I applaud their effort,” he says: “it's a first step” towards lung xenotransplantation, the use of organs from other species in humans. US clinical trials for pig livers and pig kidneys were approved this year.

The transplanted left lung was taken from a pig with six genomic edits that was created by research firm Chengdu Clonorgan Biotechnology in China. This included removing three genes to reduce the risk of the organ triggering an immune response and adding three human genes to protect the organ from rejection. In the proof-of-concept trial, the lung was transplanted on 15 May last year, by researchers at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China. Their findings were published this week in Nature Medicine.

The team reports that there were no signs of rejection, infection or graft failure in the first three days after surgery. However, 24 hours after the transplant, they noticed the lung was swelling, and that the tissue was also damaged from going without oxygen for a period of time during the transplant procedure. They also observed damage caused by antibodies attacking the organ on day three and six, but noted that the damage to the lung had reduced on day nine, when the study was stopped at the request of the recipient's family.

Long-term exposure to extreme heat events accelerates the body's ageing process and increases vulnerabilities to heath issues, finds a long-term study of 24,922 people in Taiwan.

The study, published today in Nature Climate Change1, suggests that moderate increases in cumulative heatwave exposure increase a person's biological age — to an extent comparable to regular smoking or alcohol consumption. The more extreme-heat events that people were exposed to, the more their organs aged. This is the latest study to show that extreme heat can have invisible effects on the human body and accelerate the biological clock. 

Exposure to extreme heat, especially over long periods of time, strains organs and can be lethal, but “the fact that heatwaves age us is surprising”, says Paul Beggs, an environmental-health scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “This study is a wake-up call that we are all vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on our health. It reinforces calls for urgent and deep reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions,” he adds.

Age isn't just a result of time. Previous studies have linked a number of factors — including environmental and social stress, genetics and medical interventions — to signs of ageing-related physiological changes. This puts people at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia2.

To study the long-term impacts of heatwaves on ageing, the researchers analysed data from medical examinations between 2008 and 2022. During that time, Taiwan experienced around 30 heatwaves, which the study defined as a period of elevated temperature over several days. The researchers used results from several medical tests, including assessments of liver, lung and kidney function, blood pressure and inflammation, to calculate biological age. They then compared biological age with the total cumulative temperature that participants were probably exposed to on the basis of their address in the two years before their medical visit. 

The study found that the more extreme-heat events that people experienced, the faster they aged — for every extra 1.3 °C a participant was exposed to, around 0.023–0.031 years, on average, was added to their biological clock.

“While the number itself may look small, over time and across populations, this effect can have meaningful public-health implications,” says Cui Guo, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who led the study.

Manual workers and people living in rural areas experienced the largest health impacts, probably because these groups are less likely to have access to air conditioning. But there was an unexpected upside: the impact of heatwaves on ageing decreased over the 15-year study period. The reasons behind this heat adaptation are unclear, but improved access to cooling technology could play a part, Guo says. 

Still, “the message is that heat makes you age a bit faster than you normally would, and that this is something you would like to avoid”, says Alexandra Schneider, an environmental epidemiologist at Helmholtz Munich in Germany, who was not involved in the study.

Large brains and dexterous hands are considered pivotal in human evolution, together making possible technology, culture and colonisation of diverse environments. Despite suggestions that hands and brains coevolved, evidence remains circumstantial. Here, we reveal a significant relationship between relatively longer thumbs – a key feature of precision grasping - and larger brains across 95 fossil and extant primates using Bayesian phylogenetic methods. Most hominins, including Homo sapiens, have uniquely long thumbs, yet they and other tool-using primates conform to the broader primate relationship with brain size. Within the brain, we surprisingly find no link with cerebellum size, but a strong relationship with neocortex size, perhaps reflecting the role of motor and parietal cortices in sensorimotor skills associated with fine manipulation. Our results emphasise the role of manipulative abilities in brain evolution and reveal how neural and bodily adaptations are interconnected in primate evolution.

Manual dexterity has long been celebrated as a cornerstone of our own evolutionary success, facilitating technological innovation, cumulative culture, and rapid cultural adaptation to variable environments e.g., see refs. 1,2,3,4. While numerous suggestions have been made about the potential link between manual dexterity and cognition1,5, the ways in which natural selection acted to shape the human hand and its coevolution with the brain remain poorly understood. Here we set out to examine how the coevolution of complex manipulative behaviours and brain size1 in primates is reflected in morphology – the traits that change in response to natural selection in order to facilitate such behaviour. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic comparative approach to studying behaviour-correlated morphological features, we can directly test for relationships in extinct species like our own ancestors – in which the behaviours and brain mechanisms themselves are unobservable.

Beyond hominins, tool use is observed in many species6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13, and is in fact but one manifestation of skills related to extractive foraging14,15 – which are even more widespread. Previous work has found that manipulation behaviors co-evolved with brain size in primates1,16 Here we ask how this may be related to variation in hand morphology, which allows us also to examine fossil species in a phylogenetic context. A variety of anatomical factors17,18 affect manipulative ability including thumb robusticity4 and relative thumb length18,19, as well as more complex aspects of hand proportions20. Here, we focus on relative thumb length. Whilst we recognise the additional role of other features of the hand, an increased ability to manipulate small objects is enhanced by long thumbs19,21,22 – particularly relative to the index finger23. Longer relative thumbs facilitate greater opposability24 – and Homo sapiens is noted to have both longer thumbs compared with other apes25,26 as well as enhanced manipulative ability2,17,24. However, while H. sapiens possesses a uniquely refined precision grasp24,27, there are varying degrees of opposability across primates23 and precision grasping behaviours are found within other species with only pseudo-opposability such as capuchins21,26. If fine manipulative abilities require enhanced sensorimotor control with an associated neural processing cost, then we would expect to see a general co-evolutionary relationship between thumb length and brain size across the primate order (Fig. 1A). Indeed, this may explain some of the marked variation in relative brain size among primates and the trend for this to increase through time28.

A In this (expected) scenario, relative brain size and thumb length co-evolved across all primates (solid line). If these two traits are unlinked, we would observe no relationship (dashed line). B Alternatively, we may see a scenario in which a relationship exists only for hominins and/or tool-users. C Finally, it is possible that brain size and thumb length coevolved across all primates, but there is a shift in the intercept of the relationship between hominins and/or other tool-using species, which might be the case if there was some reorganization of the neuro-behavioural basis of manipulation. D Phylogenetic tree of the 95 species used in the main analyses. Manual dexterity is measured using the relationship between the length of the first metacarpal (MC1, green) and the second metacarpal (MC2, blue) – the length of both bones is shown by the bars at the tips of the tree (shorter bone superimposed on top). Whole brain size is represented by red circles at the tips of the tree, with species with documented tool-use outlined in black. Species for which we have both cerebellum and neocortex volumes are indicated by purple branches. Silhouettes represent major primate clades and are for illustrative purposes only: Adapiformes (n = 2, red); Lorisiformes (n = 11, green); Lemuriformes (n = 16, blue); Tarsiiformes (n = 2, purple); Platyrrhini (n = 13, orange); apes (n = 13, yellow); Colobinae (n = 12, brown); Cercopithecinae (n = 26, pink).

However, if long thumbs are a hominin-specific adaptation associated with refined precision grasping18,21,27 and/or the advent of tool culture17,18,29, then we would expect to observe a relationship only amongst hominins – along with an increase in thumb length (Fig. 1B). A third possibility is that long thumbs were advantageous for tool use in other clades too, predicting an increase in thumb length in hominins associated with habitual tool use and in other tool-using primates (Fig. 1B). In this case, a primary link between brain size and dexterity is driven by sensorimotor specialisation specifically for tool use. Finally, if increased thumb length in tool users or hominins arose alongside a more general relationship with manipulative abilities and brain size across all other primates (Fig. 1C), this implies a need for longer thumbs that requires no additional neural processing. In this scenario, this implies that alternative factors may have driven the evolution of both traits – or that some element of overall brain size has been otherwise reduced.

Here, we conduct the first empirical test of the hypothesis that brain size and hand morphology were linked during primate evolution, using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a dataset of 95 fossil and contemporary primate species spanning all primate diversity (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Data 1). We test the hypothesis that selection for sensorimotor control of manually dextrous behaviours modified the thumbs of tool-using primates and had an associated neural cost reflected in whole brain size. We additionally test whether thumb length may have differentially evolved with respect to brain size amongst H. sapiens and our extinct ancestors using phylogenetic outlier tests30.

Results from our Bayesian phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression models implemented in BayesTraits31 and accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty by using a sample of dated trees (see Methods) support the expectation that thumb length and finger length are strongly linked across all primates (Fig. 2A, n = 95, finger-only models). The relationship is significant in 100% of our tree sample (see Methods), with a median slope parameter ranging between 0.87 and 0.89 across the sample. There is high phylogenetic signal, with a median λ of 0.81–0.89. Full parameter ranges are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Results are qualitatively identical (i.e., we draw the same fundamental conclusions based on statistical significance) using alternative bones and digits (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Tables 2–7).

A A random sample (n = 25) of fitted slopes from our finger-only model (MC1 ~ MC2) are plotted across a random sample of n = 50 trees. The median fitted relationship is superimposed. B The hominin phylogeny (using a single representative from the sample) is plotted along with the posterior distributions of imputed thumb lengths from the finger-only model. There are 100 distributions for each hominin for each model – one for each of the topologies in the sample. Outliers are identified when the posterior distribution of estimated thumb lengths overlaps the true value by less than 5%. The real thumb length of each species is indicated by the green line. Silhouettes are shown for representative purposes only and are not to scale. Silhouettes are shown for representative purposes only and are not to scale but are coloured according to whether they are identified as an outlier (grey = non-outlier, blue = outlier).

Using a phylogenetic imputation procedure30, we then identified which hominins had longer thumbs than expected given intrinsic hand proportions across primates. Given the finger-only model estimated across all non-hominin primates, we find that all but one hominin species (Australopithecus africanus) are significant outliers compared to non-hominin primates (Fig. 2B, see methods). As expected26, hominin thumbs are significantly longer than those of other primates. The general primate-wide relationship predicts hominin species to have much shorter thumbs than are actually observed.

We then conducted an additional set of PGLS models to test whether variation in thumb length is associated with brain size after accounting for allometry (using intrinsic hand proportions i.e. finger length). In these whole-brain models (n = 95), we find that the relationship between thumb length and finger length is maintained, with similar significance to that found in our finger-only models (median β[finger] = 0.69–0.72, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees, Fig. 3A). This model also retrieves a significant positive association between thumb length and brain size (median β[brain] = 0.11-0.13, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees, Fig. 3B). There is high phylogenetic signal in this model (median λ = 0.78–0.87) and the results are qualitatively identical excluding all hominins (n = 6). We find that there is still a significantly positive relationship between relative thumb length and brain size (median β[brain] = 0.08–0.11, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees) as well as thumb length and finger length (median β[finger] = 0.74–0.78, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees) across all non-hominin primates. That is, hominins are not driving the observed association between thumb length and brain size (Supplementary Table 1).

In panels (A,B), a random sample (n = 25) of predicted relationships from our whole-brain model (MC1 ~ MC2 + whole-brain) are plotted across a sample of n = 50 random trees, holding the unplotted variable at its mean value. The median predicted relationships calculated across all trees are superimposed. The predicted relationship between thumb length and finger length is shown in (A) and the predicted relationship between thumb length and whole brain mass is shown in (B). C The hominin phylogeny (using a single representative from the sample) is plotted along with the posterior distributions of imputed thumb lengths from the whole-brain model. There are 100 distributions for each hominin for each model – one for each of the topologies in the sample. Outliers are identified when the posterior distribution of estimated thumb lengths overlaps the true value by less than 5%. The real thumb length of each species is indicated by the green line. Silhouettes are shown for representative purposes only and are not to scale but are coloured according to the models in which they are identified as an outlier (grey = none, blue = finger-only, red = whole-brain).

We then repeated the phylogenetic imputation procedure using our whole-brain model estimated across all non-hominin primates. After accounting for brain size, no hominin species (except Australopithecus sediba) is identified as an outlier to the thumb length and brain size relationship across all other non-hominin primates (Fig. 3). In all but A. sediba, the posterior distribution of estimated thumb lengths overlaps the true value by more than 5%, in more than 95% of trees.

The hypothesis that longer thumbs are specifically advantageous with regards to tool use predicts a difference in thumb length between tool-using primates and those never observed to use tools. To test this prediction, we assessed the relationship between thumb length and tool use - defined as the non-social use of external objects to alter the properties of a target object or medium32,33. Using a comprehensive compilation of observed tool-use across the animal kingdom32 to identify tool-using primates, we ran an additional PGLS analysis that included thumb length as a response variable and finger length, brain size and tool use as covariates. In these tool-use models, we find no significant difference in the slope of the relationship between thumb length and brain size for n = 28 extant primates that have been observed to use tools (px > 0.05 for both the intercept and slope difference in 99% of trees). Additionally, there is no mean difference in the thumb lengths of tool-using species either before or after accounting for brain size (see Supplementary Note 2). The inclusion of H. sapiens makes no qualitative difference to the results, and the overall relationships are qualitatively identical to those in our whole-brain models.

We additionally tested two alternative ways of defining tool use, all obtained from the same source32. We find the same results for species who exhibit “true tool use”, where objects are explicitly manipulated out of their original context33,34 as well as for species observed to explicitly manufacture or modify objects prior to use32,35. Finally, we ran two additional versions of each tool-use model excluding (i) species where either only a single individual has been observed using or making tools, or (ii) where observations came only from captive animals32. All alternative definitions and exclusions resulted in qualitatively identical conclusions.

Note that all the variables we include in our models are significantly associated with body size and thus we did not include body size as a covariate to avoid issues with multicollinearity. All analyses still account for size in the form of intrinsic hand proportions – by including the length of the second digit (MC2). However, when we tested models that additionally incorporated body size, we found it to be non-significant in 98% of topologies. As our results remain qualitatively identical when body size is included, here we present our results without body size.

The above results are all presented where finger length is represented by the second digit – which is generally considered to be an important indicator of manual dexterity23,36. However, other papers have demonstrated and highlighted the importance of other digits in grasping abilities and dextrous behaviours18. From a clinical perspective, the first and third digits are often used to derive functional dexterity metrics in humans e.g., see ref. 37 wherein precision handling is generally referred to as manipulation using the thumb and second or third digits38. Both third and fourth metacarpals have also previously been used to explicitly study hand size and proportions amongst hominins and other apes e.g., see refs. 26,39,40. More recently, it has been demonstrated that the fifth digit is likely to have played a key role in precision grips associated with hominin tool use and production41,42,43. For this reason, we also conducted our finger-only and whole-brain models (both with and without hominins and body size) using the metacarpals of each of the other digits (MC3-MC5) as our measure of finger length – as well as the proximal phalanges of all digits where available. In these models (presented in full in Supplementary Tables 2–7), we reach the same qualitative conclusions as those made using the second metacarpal – that there is a significant and strong relationship between brain size and thumb length.

Our results imply a robust association between brain size and manual dexterity. One of the advantages of using anatomical data such as bone length as an indicator of behaviour is that it is subject to much less error in measurement than behavioural observations44. Furthermore, anatomical features are much more likely to be directly subject to selective pressure and thus are directly related to the neural processes that control them in order to produce adaptive behaviours. However, whilst having longer relative thumbs clearly represents a key component of enhanced manipulation ability19,21,22, it does not fully capture the complexity of primate variation in dextrous behaviour and ability. A range of morphological traits have been demonstrated to influence thumb dexterity beyond relative thumb length4,18,20, including (among others) relative proportions and morphology of other digits20,41, bone shape and structure4,45,46, and bone traits associated with soft tissues such as muscle attachment sites (entheses)42,47,48. Primate dexterity is clearly facilitated by more than just thumb length alone; whilst thumb length can provide us with some general insights, detailed musculoskeletal and biomechanical modelling studies can provide us with critical insights into the various other factors driving dexterity and mobility4,23,43,49.

The multifactorial nature of primate and, more specifically, hominin, dexterity may mean that having a long thumb or even high joint mobility in isolation is not sufficient for high manipulation capability from a biomechanical standpoint23. However, it does not mean that thumb length is not still linked to manual dexterity. In line with this, here we demonstrate that relative thumb length is strongly and significantly linked to measures of dexterity derived from biomechanical and kinematic models (Supplementary Note 3). In a sample of 41 primate species, we tested the relationship between peak manipulation workspace – a biomechanical measure of dexterity that defines the range of motion a small object can be freely moved between the thumb and index finger - and thumb length. We find that thumb length significantly predicts peak manipulation workspace (β[workspace] = 0.57–0.61, px < 0.05 in 100% of topologies) – an association that is unaffected by the inclusion of H. sapiens or optimum object size.

In order to further strengthen our interpretation of our results as evidence for coevolution of brain size and manual dexterity (as indicated by thumb length), we then tested for an association between brain size and peak workspace running phylogenetic regression models in exactly the same way as we did for thumb length in our main analyses (replacing thumb length with peak workspace). In line with our main results, we find that brain size is a significant predictor of peak workspace (β[brain] = 0.090, px < 0.05 in 100% of topologies). The result is qualitatively identical when H. sapiens are excluded (β[brain] = 0.09–0.11, px < 0.05 in 100% of topologies).

Therefore, on the basis of both our thumb length and workspace analyses, we interpret our results to indicate sustained historical coevolution between brain size and dexterity across the primate order, reflecting significant neural costs of manipulation behaviours and helping to explain the rapid increases in brain size observed in hominins e.g., see ref. 50.

Hominins have much greater relative thumb length compared to other primates (Fig. 2) – and even other apes25,26. This has specifically been linked to refined precision grasping18,21,27 and used as an indicator for tool culture18,29 (reviewed in ref. 17), but the timing of the emergence of these behaviours and associated morphologies are highly contested19,36,51,52,53. We, however, find a primate-wide association between brain size and thumb length, indicating that thumb length is a more general measure of dexterity not specific to hominins. This is in line with suggestions that features of the hominin hand, including long thumbs, pre-date the origin of systematic tool production26,36,51. Our results provide no support for the idea that thumb lengths are sufficient morphological indicators of tool-use –either in hominins or across all primates. We therefore cannot make any inferences about tool-use in hominins from our results. However, our analysis does provide a framework in which future research may be able to identify outliers amongst hominin species (and others) in any measurable morphological feature involved in manual dexterity and – more importantly – how these have evolved in relation to brain size. For example, whilst thumb length in Au. afarensis has previously been debated in the context of precision grasping54,55, recent biomechanical analyses have revealed that this species was most likely unable to make stone tools based on the carpometocarpal joint of the fifth digit43. Therefore, testing a combination of simple morphological proxies (such as thumb length) along with metrics revealed in critical biomechanical modelling analyses4,23,43,49 reveal clear nuances in hominin hand evolution. What remains to be tested is how any of these link to brain size – which is becoming more plausible as data and model availability become increasingly more available.

Regardless, our results demonstrate coordinated change in both hands and brains and therefore confirm the prediction outlined in Fig. 1A. This is striking: whilst hominin thumbs are outliers amongst primates in terms of length (Fig. 2B), this is almost entirely explained by a general relationship across primates (Fig. 3). For example, although A. africanus does not have significantly long thumbs relative to finger length (Fig. 2B), it still conforms to the whole-brain relationship observed across all primates (Fig. 3C). That is, the combination of brain size and thumb lengths in this taxon leads to manipulative ability comparable to other hominins – as suggested by other studies23,36. In the absence of finger-length data for other hominins, we can only make robust statistical inferences for those species included in our dataset. However, it seems likely that most hominins will conform to the patterns observed in these species and across all other primates. For example, even though taxa like H. floresiensis have been noted to have particularly small brains56,57, they also conform to the patterns of brain size evolution observed across other species50. Regardless of this, whilst it is possible new data for other species may reveal individual outliers to the pattern, the overall evolutionary relationship between brain size and thumb length is unlikely to be impacted.

Notably, the only hominin that does not conform to the general relationship across primates is A. sediba, a species previously noted to have an unusually long thumb23. The thumb length of A. sediba remains an outlier amongst primates even after accounting for brain size (Fig. 3). Whilst at face value, such a long thumb would imply that A. sediba possessed greater dexterous abilities than other hominins, its deviation from the expected relationship with brain size reveals that this interpretation may not be so simple. Like Au. sediba, H. naledi has also been noted to have long thumbs e.g58. and relatively small brains falling within the range of Australopithecus59. However, we find no evidence that H. naledi is an outlier to the overall primate relationship. This likely reflects the differences in hand use between the two species – both in terms of manipulative ability and climbing strategy60. It is clear that Au. sediba possessed a repertoire of adaptations linked to both ape-like locomotion along with some form of dexterous manipulation25,61,62,63. Simply possessing a long thumb without additional neural processing costs is not likely to have supported some inherently spectacular manipulation ability. This is supported by biomechanical models revealing relatively inefficient thumb opposition in A. sediba compared to members of the genus Homo4 and estimated workspaces not exceeding the range of modern H. sapiens23. We speculate that the long thumbs of Au. sediba may therefore represent a combination of selective pressures on relative hand proportions – along with the possibility that different regions of the brain may have reduced in order to accommodate an increase neural processing associated with sensorimotor ability (and thus no overall increase in brain size).

The evolution of tool use has often been linked to morphologies associated both with improved dexterity17,18,29 alongside broader sensorimotor and cognitive changes11,29. However, there is also evidence to suggest that – alongside generalized patterns of brain size increase50 – functional brain reorganization was also important in primate and hominin evolution64,65,66,67,68. For example, reorganization in the frontal and/or parietal brain regions have been implicated in both dexterous behaviour69 and technological innovation64 amongst hominin species. Recent evidence has even demonstrated possible functional and anatomical overlap in brain activation patterns involved in both tool-use and language processing70.

Given the importance of brain reorganization and functional overlap between neural networks, it is possible, then, that we might observe more nuanced relationships between indicators of manual dexterity (such as thumb length) and neuroanatomy of individual brain functions or regions. Improvements in fine-grained visuo-motor processes such as visually guided manipulation are expected to be associated with expansion of brain regions mediating these processes. Substantial areas of the primate neocortex and cerebellum are involved in visuo-motor control, and coordinated expansion of these structures explains much of the variation in brain size among primates71. We would therefore expect these regions to be associated with the co-evolution of manual dexterity and brain size71.

To test this idea, we used a reduced sample (n = 49, Fig. 1D) of primate species for which data were available, to determine the relationship between two brain regions (neocortex and cerebellum) and thumb length. In our brain-regions models – in which we test the effects of both regions simultaneously – we find a significant positive relationship between thumb length and both finger length (median β[finger] = 0.72–0.76, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees) and neocortex (Fig. 4, median β[neocortex] = 0.16–0.20, px < 0.05 in 100% of trees). However, there is no such association found for the cerebellum (Fig. 4, β[cerebellum], px < 0.05 in 0% of trees). The results are qualitatively identical when each brain region is considered in isolation (Supplementary Table 8).

The relationships estimated from our brain-regions model (MC1 ~ MC2 + neocortex + cerebellum) using n = 49 extant primates. The fitted slopes are calculated holding the finger length, neocortex volume (for the cerebellum slopes), and cerebellum volume (for the neocortex slopes) at their mean values. Neocortex volume (purple) and whole-brain mass (red) are significantly positively associated with thumb length; the relationship between cerebellum volume and thumb length (yellow) does not differ from zero. Inset: The posterior distributions of imputed thumb lengths for the only extant hominin (H. sapiens) from our brain-regions model (purple) and an additional finger-only model limited to only the n = 49 species for which we have neocortex and cerebellum data (blue).

We also find no link with an anatomical measure of binocular vision, convergence of the orbits (Supplementary Note 4). Our results are qualitatively identical without H. sapiens (Supplementary Table 1), and echoing our whole-brain model results, we find that modern H. sapiens are not outliers to the thumb-neocortex relationship in our brain-region models (Fig. 4, inset).

The lack of an association between cerebellum volume, binocularity, and thumb length is surprising, especially given the established role of the cerebellum and cortico-cerebellar networks in fine visuo-motor control and management of complex behavioural sequences71,72. Our brain-region relationships are more variable than those observed for the whole-brain (Fig. 4) and are potentially affected by smaller sample sizes. However, the conclusions are not affected by the exclusion of the apes, which exhibit rapid cerebellar expansion73, nor do the relationships diverge between haplorrhines and strepsirrhines despite differences in the sizes of their relative brain regions74. We therefore reveal the intriguing possibility that neural processes implicated in the evolution of manual dexterity across primates primarily involve neocortical regions75, such as frontal, motor and parietal cortices76. Although we did not predict this dissociation, a cortical contribution is in line with experimental evidence from modern H. sapiens, suggesting that motor cortex functioning and grey matter volume are both linked with manual dexterity and hand control77,78,79, and with fossil evidence for parietal cortex expansion in hominins76. Our finding that H. sapiens are not outliers (Fig. 4, inset) indicates that such observations may not be limited to our own species. An exciting avenue of future research would be to test this idea further as more data becomes available for other species.

Given the observed primate-wide relationship between neocortex and thumb length – and the fact that all extinct hominins would likely have been capable of some form of tool use (at least comparable to that observed in other primates), we would expect them to conform to similar patterns. We therefore refrain from drawing conclusions on our extinct relatives on the bases of our analyses. However recent years have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms of manual dexterity80 and tool-making behaviour81. These advances, combined with increasing availability of new modelling approaches82 and detailed data for fossil endocasts e.g83. may afford the opportunity to untangle exactly what neural mechanisms gave rise to modern dexterity. For example, studying markers for manual dexterity alongside brain regions undergoing structural reorganization in early Homo83 (including H. habilis84) may allow us to further understand whether a relationship exists for specific cerebellar regions connected to the motor cortex – and potentially distinguish between different types of dexterous behaviour.

It is important to note that our analysis does not depend on the idea that brain size is a proxy for ‘general cognitive ability', an idea that has been criticised85. Instead, we simply assume that variation in brain size – beyond that predicted by allometry – reflects selection on some aspect of neural processing, and that the sensorimotor control mechanisms associated with visually guided fine bimanual manipulation, and perhaps also action sequence planning, are expected to have neural processing costs8,77,78,80,81. The evolution of manipulative abilities may well have had far-reaching implications for cognition14,15,70,86 beyond the direct control of hand-movements per se. Such processes are likely to be reflected in neural processing costs and hence overall brain size. We are agnostic about what exactly those implications were and do not draw any strict distinction between sensorimotor control and cognition, regarding them as continuous with one another (see ref. 87). We also do not assume that all aspects of brain evolution involved simple changes in brain size, recognising that there are likely also to have been changes to neural mechanisms associated with manipulation that are not necessarily directly related to brain size, such as frontal and parietal cortex reorganization64,83.

As proponents of embodied cognition have suggested86,87, appreciating the links between bodily and brain adaptations is key to understanding neuro-cognitive evolution. Our results highlight the important role of the ability to manipulate food items or other objects in brain size evolution and emphasise the neocortical contribution to these behaviours. The results we present here go some way to explaining the uniquely hominin condition of having long thumbs. However, in isolation, no feature, including thumb length, should be considered as evidence for tool-use or tool-making behaviours18. A more complete picture might emerge with the increasing availability of more data for other, particularly earlier, hominins. Uncovering links between cognition and additional morphological features associated with dexterity e.g.17,18 may allow us to untangle the nuanced picture regarding the suites of traits associated with hominin tool use18,23 and their origins.

All of our analyses are conducted in a phylogenetic context in order to account for the non-independence amongst species data points that can be attributed to shared evolutionary history88. All of our analyses are performed on a random sample of 100 of the most-parsimonious topologies obtained from the recently published comprehensive Euarchonta phylogeny including 894 fossil and extant primates89. As the original sample of trees is not time-calibrated, we dated these topologies using a tip-dating procedure adapted from the original paper89 and implemented in BEAST v2.790. For full details on our tip-dating procedure, see the supplementary material91. As BEAST is implemented in a Bayesian framework, it gives a posterior distribution of dated trees for each of the 100 topologies in our sample. We created a single representative phylogeny for each topology by calculating a median tree based on the Kendall-Colijn distance metric92. We did this using the treespace library93 in R v.4.094. All our analyses are performed on this sample of 100 median dated trees which are provided as supplementary data to this paper (Supplementary Data 2).

We collected data on metacarpal measurements (lengths in millimetres) for primate species from the literature. We only included species found in the phylogeny89. We preferred compilation estimates (i.e., species-level data) but where specimen level data were included, we took a weighted average across all specimens (weighted, where possible, by number of specimens measured). Where individual specimens were measured by multiple sources, we preferred, arbitrarily, the most recently published source for each specimen. Our final dataset included finger bone measurements spanning 168 primate species, including 8 hominins (Figure S1). A full list of measurements and their sources can be found in the supporting information (Supplementary Data 1). Here, we use the length of the first metacarpal (MC1) and second metacarpal (MC2) as proxies for thumb and finger length respectively to measure relative thumb length and intrinsic hand proportions. However, our results remain qualitatively identical when proximal phalanges are used instead – or if we use any other digit instead of the 2nd digit Supplementary Tables 2–7). Additionally, metacarpals are a robust and reliable indicator of overall digit length in our sample (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Figs. 2, 3) and are highly correlated with other bone measurements (Supplementary Fig. 4). We prefer to use bone length over recently proposed kinematic models23 for measuring manipulative ability as these are directly measurable quantities which are likely to face direct selection pressure from the environment, although our conclusions remain robust even when using these metrics (Supplementary Note 2). Whilst we do not have enough data to test associations for the distal or intermediate phalanges it is likely we would find similar associations.

We then collected brain mass data for these species. Brain masses or volumes were taken from the literature (see supporting information for full list of sources). In some cases – mostly for fossil taxa – we converted endocranial volumes to masses. Whilst endocranial volume is often converted to brain mass using the specific gravity of brain mass (1.036 g/mL)95,96,97, the majority of our extant data sample comes from a paper which uses a conversion of 1 g to 1 cm3 – and does not record which values were volume conversions98. For consistency, therefore, we use this conversion where necessary. The species for which this was done are recorded in the supporting information.

Tool-use data was taken from a published and comprehensive compilation32. Any species not included in this compilation were assumed to have not been observed using tools. This data is limited to only extant taxa. Whilst hominins would likely have been capable of tool-use to varying degrees, here we rely exclusively on observational data (testing hominins separately as described above). Our final dataset is graphically represented in Fig. 1. All continuously varying traits (brain size, metacarpal length, etc.) were logged before analysis.

Owing to the non-independence of species-level data attributable to shared ancestry88, we implemented all comparative analyses in a phylogenetic context. We used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) multivariate regression models implemented within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) framework to test for an association between manual dexterity and cognitive ability. Each analysis was conducted over a sample of 100 trees (see above). All models were run for a total of 1,000,000 iterations after convergence, sampling every 10,000 iterations. A wide uninformative prior was placed on all regression parameters (normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 5). We estimated the strength of phylogenetic signal using lambda99 in all models. All models were repeated multiple times (minimum n = 3) to ensure results were identical across replicates.

Our first set of models (finger-only models, n = 95) tested the relationship between the lengths of MC1 and MC2. To assess the effect of brain size on relative thumb length, we included brain mass as an additional covariate – whilst also still including MC2 as a predictor to measure intrinsic relative thumb length and thus account for size. This model set is referred to as our whole-brain models (n = 95). We repeated both analyses excluding all hominins (n = 89, Supplementary Table 1). All analyses are conducted over all primates as a single group.

To identify which hominins (if any) were outliers in terms of their intrinsic hand proportions, we conducted a phylogenetic outlier test e.g., see ref. 30 using a phylogenetic imputation procedure31 to predict hominin thumb lengths. This predictive modelling approach simultaneously incorporates the parameters of a regression model as well as the phylogenetic position of each taxon. As with all our analyses, the imputations are calculated using PGLS regression models implemented within a Bayesian MCMC framework. We estimate the thumb length for each hominin given the parameters of each of our regression analyses (finger-only and whole-brain models) calculated across the rest of primates. We then assess whether each hominin species is an outlier using the full distribution of predicted values for thumb length– where the distribution overlaps the true value by less than 5% in more than 95% of trees, it can be considered a phylogenetic outlier.

To determine whether the relationship between brain size and thumb length is being driven by or affected by tool use, we ran an additional set of models (tool-use models) including the following predictors: MC2, a binary (dummy-coded) variable defining whether each species has been observed to use tools, and an interaction between the two variables. This explicitly tests for a different intercept and slope in the relationship between thumb length and brain size in species that have never been observed using tools compared to those which have. Note that we use three alternative ways of defining tool use, all obtained from the same source32. We additionally ran models excluding species where either only a single individual has been observed using or making tools, or where observations came only from captive animals32. All alternative definitions and exclusions resulted in identical conclusions (Supplementary Note 3).

To determine whether individual brain regions affected thumb length independently (brain-regions models, n = 49), we included both neocortex volume and cerebellum volume in a single model – along with MC2. Separating the effects of the neocortex and the cerebellum can be complicated owing to their strong correlation. We additionally repeated the model excluding H. sapiens (n = 48, Supplementary Table 1). Here, we included both regions in the same model here since together, the neocortex and cerebellum comprise a ‘unit' responsible for the mediation of visuo-motor and sequential action control100. However, we find qualitatively similar results when each of the regions were studied in isolation: without H. sapiens, only the neocortex shows any significant association (Supplementary Table 8).

For all models, results are summarised across the sample of trees where the model is run separately for each tree. We assess significance of the parameters using two criteria: Firstly, the proportion of the posterior distribution that crosses zero (px); where this proportion ≤ 0.05, we consider a variable to be significantly different from zero. Secondly, the first criterion must be met in at least 95% of topologies for us to consider a variable as significant. For comparison, we summarise parameter estimates using median values – and then to summarise across all trees, we report the range of observed medians.

High-fidelity qubit measurement is a critical element of all quantum computing architectures. In superconducting systems, qubits are typically measured by probing a readout resonator with a weak microwave tone that must be amplified before reaching the room-temperature electronics. Superconducting parametric amplifiers have been widely adopted as the first amplifier in the chain, primarily because of their low-noise performance, approaching the quantum limit. However, they require isolators and circulators to route signals up the measurement chain and to protect qubits from amplified noise. Although these commercial components are wideband and simple to use, their intrinsic loss, size and magnetic shielding requirements impact the overall measurement efficiency and scalability. Here we report a parametric amplifier that achieves both broadband forward amplification and backward isolation in a single, compact, non-magnetic circuit that could be integrated on chip with superconducting qubits. The approach relies on a nonlinear transmission line that supports the travelling-wave parametric amplification of forward propagating signals and isolation via the frequency conversion of backward propagating signals. This travelling-wave parametric amplifier and converter has the potential to reduce the readout hardware overhead when scaling up the size of superconducting quantum computers.

The color coding is identical to that of Fig. 1: the Josephson junctions are colored in brown, the capacitors to ground are colored in green, and the resonators to ground are colored in purple.

Source data

The TWPAC biasing parameters are similar to that of Fig. 3b: Id = 1 μA, ωa/2π = 14.52 GHz, Pa = − 75 dBm, ωc/2π = 3.15 GHz and Pc = − 80 dBm (at the chip inputs).

Source data

The TWPAC biasing parameters are similar to that of Fig. 3b. The input (a) and output (b) reflections of the through cable (black) and of the TWPAC (green) with the FC conversion pump turned on are plotted as a function of frequency. (c) The transmission as a function of frequency is the same as presented in Fig. 3b. (d) The input reflection without (dashed line) and with (plain line) the FC pump turned on.

Source data

(a) The TWPAC gain as small VNA probe tone power is shown as a function of frequency with (blue) and without (yellow) the FC pump turned on. Here, it is calculated as the ratio of the transmission when the dc bias and the pumps are turned on, to the transmission when the dc bias and the pumps are turned off. (b) The TWPAC-input 1 dB compression point is shown with (blue) and without (yellow) the FC pump turned on. The cut portion around 8.8 GHz corresponds to a situation where P1dB was not yet reached at the highest VNA probe tone power.

Source data

(a) The output spectrum at low probe tone power presents 5 major peaks at ωc, \({\omega }_{{c}_{2}}=2{\omega }_{c}\), ωs, ωi = ωa − ωs, and ωa − 2ωc. We cut the spectrum at the first TWPAC stopband, because within the stopband the gain of the chain cannot be accurately measured, therefore the power of any bin within the stopband cannot be accurately compared to the other bins. (b) The output spectrum when sending a probe tone power P1dB = − 86 dBm contains more peaks, that correspond to activating more parametric processes. (c) The output power of the few selected modes, referred to the TWPAC output is plotted as a function of the input probe tone power, referred to the TWPAC input. The vertical line indicates P1dB for the CW tone at ωs = 7 GHz. The input probe tone power calibration was the same as in the Methods, sec. C1, and we refer the output power to the TWPAC output by dividing the power measured on the SA by the chain's gain, measured with the SNTJ, with the TWPAC off.

Source data

(a) The on/off gain (that is, not referenced to a through) as a function of frequency, when the FC pump is off (yellow) and when it is on (blue). (b) The added noise is plotted within the same frequency range, when the FC pump is off (yellow) and when it is on (blue). (c) The added noise of the bin centered at 7 GHz is plotted as a function of the TWPAC gain, when the FC pump is off (yellow) and when it is on (blue). The black line represents the model Nsys = N1 + N2/G.

Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions.

Last month's Ikea's announcement of more than 20 new Matter-over-Thread devices felt like a much-needed breakthrough moment for the high-profile smart home standard. If Ikea—a brand with a broad, not necessarily tech-savvy customer base—is all-in on Matter, have we finally arrived at the smart home utopia that was first promised back in late 2019?

It was then, amid growing frustrations from users around smart home compatibility, that tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung formed the Project Connected Home over IP (Project CHIP) working group, and laid out their plans to fix the chaos.

By mid-2021, Project CHIP had blossomed into Matter. The big idea was that Matter would work as your smart home's universal translator; a common language designed to get all your connected devices talking locally and securely. If it was a Matter-certified device, it should work with any Matter-compatible platform or app, whatever the brand.

Devices with that Matter mark started arriving in late 2022, in the weeks after the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) officially released Matter 1.0 specification and opened the certification program for brands to get on board.

The trouble in those early days was that the Matter mark didn't take the guesswork out of the equation for consumers. In fact, it added an extra layer of confusion. Amazon actually muddied the waters during its keynote presentation at the Matter 1.0 launch event when it was revealed that neither iOS nor wireless mesh network Thread would be part of its initial Alexa and Matter integration.

That was a major setback, as Thread, alongside Wi-Fi and Ethernet, was touted as a major part of Matter, offering a fast, reliable, secure, and energy-saving network protocol.

“We felt confident in Matter when it launched with version 1.0,” Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA, explained to me. “But nothing provides the real-life feedback that we needed until devices and ecosystems were in the market and being used by consumers. That first year was critical, and we began to see some immediate areas where improvement was needed.”

In that first year, if you bought a Nanoleaf Essential lightbulb, with that Matter mark on the box, and you lived in an Alexa household, you couldn't actually add it to your Matter system.

“When the different ecosystems were deploying their Thread border routers”—the gateway that links the devices in your Thread mesh to your home's IP network and the internet—“everyone was on a different commit, so you have all these different code bases all in production, all trying to work together,” Nanoleaf's CEO Gimmy Chu explained to me. “And different ecosystems had a bunch of different bugs.”

Chu told me that Nanoleaf paid the price for being an early champion of Matter-over-Thread, and the smart lighting specialist ultimately ditched Thread in favor of Matter-over-Wi-Fi after that first wave of products.

Nanoleaf was an early Matter adopter and struggled with initial teething problems.

“We're doing some outdoor products, and now we use Wi-Fi,” he explained. “But in an ideal world, these should be Thread products, because it has much better range, and also it's low power.”

Chu hasn't given up on Thread, though, and said testing version 1.4 is going well. The latest version has made it simpler for devices to work in a unified, brand-agnostic, mesh network, regardless of the software or hardware ecosystem being used. It has also streamlined cloud access and simplified device setup, ultimately helping to make Matter more robust, scalable, and user-friendly.

“I think that Matter and Thread has had a lot of negativity in the past few years, but it's time for the consumers to give it another try,” says Chu. “It's gotten much better. A lot of people in the industry have been working very, very hard to get it to the point that it's at today.”

It's an area of improvement that Richardson is also keen to highlight. “Thread is an important, foundational technology of Matter,” he said. “We are closely aligned with the Thread Group and continue to look for ways to improve the Thread experience within Matter and the use cases that it enables.”

Thread took most of the early heat when Matter started stumbling, but it wasn't the only problem. Dev headaches, slow rollout, and a lack of compatible devices have all played a part.

For an emerging standard, this is not unusual. But when the likes of Google, Apple, Amazon, and Samsung team up, it becomes a much bigger story.

“We started this with a lot of fanfare, and usually standards don't. They sort of start off in a corner, with maybe a couple of super nerdy articles about it, and then, two years later, something shows up when companies start rolling it out.”

That's the take of Daniel Moneta, chair of the Matter Marketing and Product Subgroup at the CSA. Moneta has also spent the past few years working with Samsung SmartThings in a product and marketing role, giving him plenty of irons in the Matter fire.

“I do think there were a lot of expectations, that maybe we set, but maybe people just had, in terms of things like how quickly it was going to be done, how fast products were going to come out, which problems Matter was going to solve and which ones it wasn't,” he said.

Moneta believes many criticisms of Matter stem from its tech-fluent early adopters already being obsessive about the details. Speaking as a self-titled “nerdy enthusiast,” he understands.

“We're very interested in the technical nuance … in looking at things like compatibility matrices. The smart home has historically been for that enthusiast in the home and, almost by definition, a group of people who have greater expectations, want more flexibility, and also maybe want it to do things beyond necessarily what it was built for.

“I'm not saying Matter wasn't made for that audience, because I think it's fantastic for that audience,” he continues. “But Matter was also designed for the Ikea buyer or the Samsung TV buyer. The one that goes, ‘I have a Matter hub in this TV I just bought. Maybe I should buy some light bulbs.'”

A lot of Matter criticism stems from the fact that, when the CSA announces a new Matter specification, which happens twice a year (it just recently announced version 1.4.2), and more device support, it takes time for each ecosystem to become compatible.

It took almost a year for the major platforms to support the new device types included in the 2023 Matter 1.2 spec, like air purifiers and robot vacuum cleaners, and even then support rolled out gradually. This meant that supposedly Matter-compatible devices were being sold, but users couldn't actually add them to their Matter controller.

Ikea's Dirigera hub is now a fully-fledged Matter controller with Thread border router capabilities too.

It's not a situation that's going away, either. Take that exciting Ikea news—the brand's Dirigera hub will now support Matter 1.4 but only for device types that Ikea sells; think sensors, lights, plugs, and remotes. More devices will be added as Ikea launches products in those categories, but we're unlikely to see Ikea bankrolling dev work to be compatible with device types it doesn't sell.

“I don't see them supporting every device under the sun,” Daniel Moneta explained. “And then there's Home Assistant, where their goal is to support everything. But you also might have a Matter controller or ecosystem that's 100 percent lawn care, and all it supports are sprinklers and soil sensors. Maybe it doesn't need to support ovens. That's fine, it's why we don't mandate what controllers support, because we want there to be flexibility.”

The good news is that Matter is now in a much better place both for the consumer and for the companies building products. As those companies push forward with their idea of what the smart home should be with the help of AI—as Google puts Gemini in all the places Assistant used to live, as Amazon ramps up Echo's capabilities with Alexa+ and Apple works out what exactly next-gen Siri looks like ahead of expected new smart home hardware releases—Matter is working to ensure it can finally make the experience of linking that all together much smoother.

Take the recently launched 1.4.2 release; it's light on new categories but heavy on things that could quietly improve everyday reliability for the average user.

“We began to see some immediate areas where improvement was needed in areas like setup, multi-admin, border router capabilities, and overall reliability,” Tobin Richardson of the CSA explained. “We've been able to make improvements to all of these subsequent Matter software updates and continue to make enhancements ongoing to make the experience ever better.”

The CSA is also doing a lot of work on the admin side to make Matter certification more streamlined, while also getting ecosystem compatibility from the major platforms at the same time. Earlier this year, it announced that Apple, Google, and Samsung would begin accepting test results from its Interop Lab in Oregon as sufficient for their respective Works With programs and badges. Amazon joined the party a bit late but has since stated it will be getting involved too.

“I think that came heavily from some of the feedback that companies like us gave,” explained the Nanoleaf boss Gimmy Chu. “We, as the small product companies, were having to do a lot of product certifications because the standard kept evolving and changing, and it was getting really costly to roll out products.”

So while that Matter mark on the box still can't tell you for sure that it will definitely work on your chosen ecosystem, a combination of that plus a “Works With” badge can. It's questionable as to whether it's the ultimate simplicity the CSA is striving for, but Richardson feels it's well on its way.

“We've made tremendous progress in a short period of time, compared to other high-profile standards like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,” Richardson says. “What our members, collectively, have built is more than just a paper standard.”

He adds that the proof of Matter's progress is in the standard's adoption by brands like Ikea. “It's tremendously important when big, well-known global brands commit to the standard,” he says. “It shows it works, brings momentum, and reassures—and it motivates others to jump on board. The list of companies supporting this is growing, not holding steady, not retreating. That's an important data point.”

It's a sentiment that Daniel Moneta shares: “To go from launching [in 2022] to a company like Ikea to be using it—one that moves very cautiously and slowly and is dedicated to a good, problem-free experience, usually for absolute beginner smart home user— it's a stunning milestone.”

Chu, who admits to still being cautious after Nanoleaf was burned by being a Matter front-runner, agrees the standard has come a long way and says that brands dragging their heels should consider jumping on board.

“I think the CSA have a different challenge on their hands, which is, their reputation was kind of damaged from the very beginning. But I have confidence that more and more companies will continue to build Matter products,” he tells WIRED. “I think any product company thinking about making a non-Matter smart home product now, they're kind of silly.

“Was Matter designed in the optimal way? Absolutely not. Are there things that it could have done better? Yes. But it is still a much better solution than every product speaking a different proprietary language. The vision for all the ecosystems to speak the same language is still a great vision, and everyone's working toward it.”

Economists at Stanford University have found the strongest evidence yet that artificial intelligence is starting to eliminate certain jobs. But the story isn't that simple: While younger workers are being replaced by AI in some industries, more experienced workers are seeing new opportunities emerge.

Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor at Stanford University, Ruyu Chen, a research scientist, and Bharat Chandar, a postgraduate student, examined data from ADP, the largest payroll provider in the US, from late 2022, when ChatGPT debuted, to mid-2025.

The researchers discovered several strong signals in the data—most notably that the adoption of generative AI coincided with a decrease in job opportunities for younger workers in sectors previously identified as particularly vulnerable to AI-powered automation (think customer service and software development). In these industries, they found a 16 percent decline in employment for workers aged 22 to 25.

The new study reveals a nuanced picture of AI's impact on labor. While advances in artificial intelligence have often been accompanied by dire predictions about jobs being eliminated—there hasn't been much data to back it up. Relative unemployment for young graduates, for instance, began dropping around 2009, well before the current AI wave. And areas that might seem vulnerable to AI, such as translation, have actually seen an increase in jobs in recent years.

“It's always hard to know [what's happening] if you're only looking at a particular company or hearing anecdotes,” Brynjolfsson says. “So we wanted to look at it much more systematically.”

By combing through payroll data, the Stanford team found that AI's impact has more to do with a worker's experience and expertise than the type of work they do. More experienced employees in industries where generative AI is being adopted were insulated from job displacement, with opportunities either remaining flat or slightly growing. The finding backs up what some software developers previously told me about AI's impact on their industry—namely that rote, repetitive work, like writing code to connect to an API, has become easier to automate. The Stanford study also indicates that AI is eliminating jobs but not lowering wages, at least so far.

The researchers considered potentially confounding factors including the Covid pandemic, the rise of remote work, and recent tech sector layoffs. They found that AI has an impact even when accounting for these factors.

Brynjolfsson says the study offers a lesson on how to maximize the benefits of AI across the economy. He has long suggested that the government could change the tax system so that it does not reward companies that replace labor with automation. He also suggests AI companies develop systems that prioritize human-machine collaboration.

Brynjolfsson and another Stanford scientist, Andrew Haupt, argued in a paper in June that AI companies should develop new “centaur” AI benchmarks that measure human-AI collaboration, to incentivize more focus on augmentation rather than automation. “I think there's still a lot of tasks where humans and machines can outperform [AI on its own],” Brynjolfsson says.

Some experts believe that more collaboration between humans and AI could be a feature of the future labor market. Matt Beane, an associate professor at UC Santa Barbara who studies AI-driven automation, says he expects the AI boom to create demand for augmentable work—as managing the output of AI becomes increasingly important. “We'll automate as much as we can,” Beane says. “But that doesn't mean there won't be a growing mountain of augmentable work left for humans.”

AI is advancing quickly though, and Brynjolfsson warns that the impact on younger workers could spread to those with more experience. “What we need to do is create a dashboard early-warning system to help us track this in real time,” he says. “This is a very consequential technology.”

In March, President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk appeared on the lawn of the White House to show off a line of electric vehicles, transforming, for a moment, the commander in chief into the car salesman in chief.

Five months later, Musk and Trump are no longer on friendly terms, the red Tesla that Trump purchased during that appearance has left the White House grounds, and the president signed into law earlier this summer what was known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, which yanks federal support for electric vehicles.

And yet Trump still appears to be selling electric cars. Just look at the numbers: JD Power projects that electric vehicles will account for a record 12.8 percent of all US sales in August, up 3.2 percent from this time last year. “There's a rush,” says Tyson Jominy, the firm's senior vice president of data and analytics.

The spike in electric interest mostly stems from the death of the $7,500 EV tax credit, analysts say, which was given a death sentence when Trump signed the GOP-supported OBBB on July 4 and is set to expire at the end of September. Buyers interested in EVs seem to understand that they should get into dealership lots and showrooms ASAP to take advantage of that now-temporary deal.

(The IRS clarified last week that while buyers have to sign their contracts and put down a payment on their EVs before October to qualify for the credit, they don't necessarily need to take delivery of the vehicle, giving tardy buyers a bit more time to secure their electric deals.)

But the tick up in EV sales isn't permanent. Analysts expect US EV sales may fall back to earth after September. “It's very likely that we'll see the ‘payback effect' at the end of this year, and maybe into 2026,” says Jominy, meaning EV sales will probably slow.

The specifics of a sales slump are still unclear, and they depend in large part on the reactions of auto manufacturers and dealers. Automakers could hold down prices in the hope that buyers will stay motivated to show up. Dealers want to move EVs off their lots and could keep aggressive sales incentives rolling into the fall.

Both are still contending with the effects of auto tariffs. These put pressure on even US automakers, who manufacture some of their most affordable vehicles in Mexico and Canada and face 25 percent tariffs on imports.

What will the US transition to electric vehicles look like without federal support? Many industry observers are ready to call the situation a bump in the road. “We are still bullish on the long-term future of EV sales in the US,” Mark Schirmer, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, writes in an email. “EVs are simply better vehicles.” Slowly, autos with more powerful batteries, longer ranges, faster charging times, and lower prices are showing up on lots. Charging stations are popping up in more places. More and more Americans should begin to decide that going electric is right for them.

Still, the US is falling behind the rest of the world in the transition to electric cars. The International Energy Agency predicts that EVs will account for more than a quarter of new global car sales this year. Despite this Hot EV American Summer, US adoption is hovering around just 8 percent. US automakers are left to figure out how to make and market new-energy cars for the rest of the world, vying with European, Asian, and especially Chinese automakers, while keeping the laggier US market happy in the meantime.

“The threat is really to US automakers' international competitiveness,” says Sean Tucker, the lead editor for Kelley Blue Book. “They have to catch up with the Chinese EVs, or they could become an island.”

If you're within a certain age range, you may have spent weekend afternoons in your youth playing Mario Kart, the seminal Nintendo game. You may even remember passing the sticks around between friends and competing in the game's individual time trials, one driver at a time.

Among that game mode's defining features: A translucent “ghost car” that represented the current leader in a given trial, allowing other drivers to chase after it or, ideally, pass it on the way to a faster time. Similar features have dotted various other racing video games through the years, from the Gran Turismo series to Forza and F-Zero.

And now, we've begun to see this Mario Kart feature show up on television broadcasts for real auto races. In the same way it added intrigue to the video game, it brings real excitement to the process of watching a single car drive around a track solo. But it's not just for fans; this technology is even making an impact on the inner workings of the sport of auto racing itself.

The ghost car seen from the cockpit camera's view on an IndyCar broadcast. The translucent car is superimposed on the video image during televised broadcasts.

Auto racing broadcasters have long struggled to make qualifying trials entertaining. Qualifying involves just a single car on the track at one time, racing against the clock for the best times to determine their starting order in the event's actual race.

“Qualifying, candidly, is boring,” says Gerard J. Hall, founder and CEO of SportsMedia Technology, known in the industry as SMT. “From a TV standpoint, you've got a camera taking a picture of this car, it's in the center of the frame, and you've got one announcer saying to the other announcer, ‘Sure looks like he's going fast, doesn't it?'

“There's not really much to compare it to … Until you get something relative to that car to let you know, is it winning? Losing? Is it gaining for the qualifying lap?”

Hall and his team have solved this problem; auto racing viewers can now see a visual indicator of the leading qualifying car's positioning during its qualifying lap, helping them instantly discern whether the current driver is improving on or falling behind the leader's time. But the ghost car has traveled a long road to find its way onto these broadcasts.

The ghost car in a wide shot.

Hall and SMT have been involved in auto racing broadcasts and displays for three decades. While working with ESPN Motorsports in the mid-1990s, the company helped pioneer a small five-car leaderboard in the upper left of the screen for full-field race broadcasts. Initially, it was powered by a spotter sitting in the press box with binoculars and furiously typing updates into a laptop.

The team's methods have become more streamlined and high-tech since. Simple picture overlay tools allowed for varying leaderboards on racing broadcasts through the 2000s. These quickly became as synonymous with car racing as score bugs for baseball or football, growing more advanced with time.

By the mid-2010s, satellite-based GPS had become advanced enough to consider its use for tracking high-speed race cars with solid accuracy. Hall and SMT began to look at ways to spice up Nascar's broadcasts of its qualifying runs, which were still relatively bland outside minor additional features like car speed or time split graphics.

Nascar offered a few helpful advantages in these early efforts. For one, all its tracks are dimensionally similar or identical: Sloped ovals without any sharp turns. There aren't many tall buildings or structures near the track that might interfere with GPS signals. And because Nascar vehicles are fairly heavy, adding GPS sensors didn't cause any balance or speed issues. Even within that context, though, tracking objects moving so quickly is no small feat.

SMT developed a proprietary tracking device it calls a “vector” (or “vector box”) to sit on each car. Today's vector boxes, which have been upgraded multiple times since the original version, combine three tracking formats.

The first is GPS, but this is not the same GPS your Google Maps app is using. Vector boxes receive signals not just from the American Global Positioning System but also from Russia's GLONASS, Europe's Galileo, and China's BeiDuo satellites. Hall says the combination allows vector boxes to be connected to anywhere from two to three times as many satellites at one time as standard GPS setups.

Inertial measurement unit (IMU) tracking is also used to gauge precise speed and related movement data. Combined with the bulked-up GPS setup, Hall says, SMT can access real-time kinetic metrics and achieve centimeter-level accuracy for both positioning (horizontal and vertical) and car velocity to gauge precisely where the vehicle is on the track at any time.

Real-time drive data from the car's engine control unit for things like throttle, braking, steering, and gear info are also fed into the vector box. The vector can even be battery powered so that it draws no energy from the car itself.

Using all of this detail from the vector box, SMT created what Hall believes is the first iteration of the live “digital twin” concept in any sport: An entire 3D re-creation of the cars and track.

“Here's a sporting event I can look at with cameras, and here's the digital twin that I've created this 3D model with a computer, where everything is moving around based on the live data coming off the objects in the real world,” Hall says. “It gives me the ability to do what we call temporal shifting, and that's really what the ghost car is.”

The first Nascar broadcast featuring these tools, which SMT collectively terms its Broadcast Analytics suite, ran on NBC in 2018. The same suite has been used by Fox in each season since. The ghost car has featured prominently as a live companion to qualifying, allowing broadcasters to swap into a live 3D world and show accurate digital renderings of both the active car and the ghost car it's competing against.

Formula 1's broadcast team has also been playing around with various ways of creating a qualifying ghost car for over a decade. Its first attempts involved retrofitting the tools used to analyze golf swings. But as the F1 organization also moved to GPS-based methods, logistical challenges arose. Unlike Nascar's clean oval of a racetrack, F1 tracks in different locations differ wildly from one another. Plus they are often built within cities, so each course is dotted with tall buildings and crowded with wireless communications that can interfere with GPS signals.

The IndyCar broadcast control room.

“GPS is good in places, but we go to places like Monaco, Baku, Singapore, where all that infrastructure and buildings really make GPS drift,” says Dean Locke, director of broadcast media and digital for Formula 1.

F1 cars are also much lighter than their Nascar counterparts, necessitating lower-weight sensors. Its broadcast teams struggled to put together full laps of ghost car or related overlay features as a result.

To get around these limitations, F1 built several internal prediction models based on past seasons' GPS data and lidar scans of each track. It then integrated those models into an in-house application that overlayed a synchronized video feed of those same past qualifying trials, then compared the two data inputs side by side. By first manually identifying discrepancies where GPS data from qualifying clearly was out of whack based on video footage, the team was able to train its models to spot anomalies and correct them.

F1's own ghost car feature launched across its broadcasters for the 2025 season. It features both an in-car driver view and a “helicopter” view above the car—especially helpful for qualifying laps where the current driver is ahead of the ghost car, since the ghost car would be invisible during in-car views in these situations.

A drawback, though: F1 can't yet show its ghost car on live broadcasts. Because the team's process still requires that final bit of manual fine-tuning to ensure the translucent ghost car is positioned accurately, Locke says it takes around 90 minutes to pass the ghost car overlay to broadcast partners after each qualifying run. The team's goal is a 30-minute turnaround to facilitate quicker post-qualifying analysis. Still, Locke says, ghost car broadcasts have been immensely popular on F1's social channels.

F1's single-car competitors at IndyCar, meanwhile, have pushed the envelope further this season as Fox, the home of Nascar, has taken over from NBC as the IndyCar series' broadcaster, bringing SMT's vector box technology with it. Starting with Indy 500 qualifying earlier in May, a fully live ghost car animation has been used as a superimposed overlay for Fox's in-car driver camera. This isn't a 3D rendering, like SMT's prior Nascar ghost cars, which swap into a separate digital view (either the full screen or smaller box format); it's the actual, real-life driver camera from the broadcast with a centimeter-accurate ghost car overlayed onto the screen.

Ghost cars are still in their relative infancy, especially for truly live broadcasts. Hall sees the uses of this underlying technology quickly expanding as broadcasters become more familiar with them—including for full-field races in addition to qualifiers.

“Maybe you want to compare tire wear,” Hall posits. “Let me show you this car now running live, and let me show you this car five laps ago where it was running on different tires.”

Hall also suggests the idea of multiple ghost cars for qualifying; one for the pole sitter, but perhaps others for bubble positions or other relevant spots.

It's easy to see how the ghost cars zipping around on your TV could just be the beginning of the way this ultra-specific car data will be used. Just look at Nascar; SMT received interest from multiple teams within less than a year of pioneering its vector box. The teams wanted to use data from the box for tactical purposes like postrace analysis or comparisons to competitors, and SMT developed a Team Analytics application.

Demand was so high that in 2018, Nascar opened this data up to allow all teams full access. They can view everything from car positioning to gear and throttle data, not just for their own drivers but for the whole field. Team Analytics has a feature that allows multiple ghost car overlays of prior races, allowing crews to compare driving lines or turn speeds.

“Now at every pit stall, it is the center application,” Hall says. “Because the teams, the crew chiefs, they want to know: How is my car doing relative to other cars? And because it's not just positioning on the track, it's also gears, throttle, et cetera, different drivers can compare their performance against” each other.

It's likely only a matter of time before these features trickle into IndyCar and F1 teams.

Locke says those teams “will use absolutely anything they can to get an improvement over another team,” though he notes that F1 teams already collect a wealth of internal data on their vehicles.

Who'd have thought a funky Mario Kart feature used for bragging rights among friends could have such an influence in the world's highest-stakes car races?

Budget laptops are finally improving. Extra RAM and more efficient processors are making cheap laptops significantly more pleasant to use and recommend.

However, the Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 is somewhat of an old-school budget laptop. It uses a cheaper Intel chip, which compromises performance and battery life, and at first glance, it appears to be overpriced. While this machine doesn't move the needle for budget PCs, if you need a 16-inch laptop, there's just barely enough here to make it worth buying on discount. Just know exactly what you're getting into.

The Lenovo IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 is a large, 16-inch laptop that is 0.72 inches thick and 4.41 pounds. It's a hefty laptop. To be fair, it's actually lighter than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. That's partially because the IdeaPad 5i is made out of plastic. Fortunately, it's still fairly well-built. The lid is sturdy and doesn't flex, and it's the only part made of aluminum. There's a bit of give in the keyboard if you push hard enough, but it's nothing too egregious.

It's not necessarily a bad-looking laptop. Just generic. There's a slightly more attractive Cosmic Blue color that might look nicer, but I haven't seen it in person. Unfortunately, you can't open it with one hand, even though it has a 360-degree hinge. That's what makes it a 2-in-1 laptop, allowing you to position it in tent mode or lay it flat. The heft of this thing pretty much guarantees that you won't be holding it as a tablet—that's for sure. I've never understood the appeal of 2-in-1 capabilities on a laptop this large, but the addition of a touchscreen is always a plus.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 has a decent port selection. On the left, you get two USB-C ports (one for charging), HDMI, and a headphone jack. The right side has two USB-A ports, a micro SD card slot, and the power button. Not having a USB-C port on the right side is annoying, as it means you can only charge from one side. It's a constant point of frustration on many laptops.

The keyboard and touchpad are often compromises made on budget laptops, and the same is true here. The keys feel like they take a lot of effort to push through, as if the actuation force is too high. It can feel a bit tiring to type, which led to a lot of ghost typing where I was missing letters. It does have a number pad, but I don't prefer them, as they force the touchpad to be off-center.

Speaking of the touchpad, this isn't the worst I've used. The click feels nice, as it's not overly loud or difficult to press—a common problem with cheap touchpads. The issue here, as per usual, is the tracking. It feels choppy to glide your finger across the surface, and precise actions like text selection feel clumsy. It's certainly not a unique problem to the IdeaPad 5i, but it's one of the things that makes cheap laptops feel low quality.

You buy a laptop of this size for its screen. But with the IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1, you're not getting a high-quality panel. It's a 1920 x 1200 resolution display with a 60-Hz refresh rate. That's not bad per se, but stretched out on a 16-inch laptop, you can definitely see the pixels. That's why I often recommend smaller laptops if you're on a tighter budget. Like many laptops at this price, the IdeaPad uses a crummy panel. It's IPS, but it has a strong green tint that makes colors look off. It's noticeable right away, and once I measured it with a colorimeter, it proved true, covering just 63 percent of the sRGB color space.

It is, however, glossy. That's the one positive trait about it, as many budget laptops use a matte display that makes the screen look even more washed out. It also means the display doesn't have those really ugly plastic bezels that come with matte displays. That goes a long way toward improving the look of the IdeaPad 5i. One of the reasons these cheap laptops opt for matte is because their displays aren't very bright. This one maxes out at 334 nits, and yes, that means you will be fighting glare and reflections if you are near light sources.

But let's be clear: No 16-inch laptop under $800 has a better display. There are smaller laptops like the M1 MacBook Air or the Dell 14 Plus that have far better screens, but nothing in this size range.

The webcam is a point of favor for the device. It's 1080p, and the quality is quite good. It doesn't overcorrect in low-light situations, a common problem with laptop webcams. Not surprisingly, the speakers are terrible. Get some computer speakers.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1's main problem is the chip inside. I've been a fan of Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chip, which has found its way into some very affordable laptops, such as the Asus Vivobook 14. They're efficient chips, leading to decent performance and great battery life. The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 uses the Intel Core Ultra 7 255U, and doesn't enjoy those benefits. Battery life isn't terrible, thankfully, lasting around 15 hours in local video playback.

Performance shouldn't be too big a hindrance to your work, though, especially since you've got 16 GB onboard. The integrated GPU isn't good; in fact, it'll slow you down from doing anything graphics-related, such as gaming or 3D rendering. You really need something far more capable on that front if you need a media or content creation machine.

The configuration of the 16-inch IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 I tested costs $770. That's a solid deal, though I've already seen it dip to $650 on sale. The Dell 14 Plus presents a problem. It's a 14-inch laptop, but it's a superior product in almost every way imaginable and costs $750 right now. Not only does it have a much better screen, but it also gets great battery life. If we're going apples-to-apples, the Dell 16 Plus is far more expensive.

The IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not easy to find another 16-inch laptop that's better—at least, not one that I've tested. The HP Omnibook 5 16 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon X and is $750. Similarly, the Asus Vivobook 16 costs $750 and uses that same chip. Those might provide better battery life, but I can't say for sure until I've gotten my hands on them for testing. For now, this IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1 barely squeaks by as a solid option for budget laptops and college students—so long as you buy it when it's on discount. If it rises over $800, you should be able to find a better 16-inch laptop for less money.

A plan to bolster the nation's cybersecurity that will cost virtually nothing was unveiled Tuesday by the Internet Security Alliance (ISA).

In a 21-page document, the alliance offers five recommendations that it maintains “will cost the federal government virtually nothing” and, as a bonus, save private industry billions.

The document titled “A Zero Cost Path to American Cybersecurity” outlines initiatives that operationalize the Trump administration's philosophy of government.

“These are pragmatic programs that can be implemented quickly,” the document noted. “They will generate significant material improvements in our nation's cybersecurity almost immediately.

“These steps will also put our nation's intermediate and long-term security on a measurably effective and economically sustainable path that will enable us to address newly growing threats of systemic failure,” it continued.

“With White House backing,” it added, “these initiatives can transform cybersecurity from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage — and secure both the nation's digital future and the president's legacy as the leader who turned deregulation into a national security triumph.”

One recommendation from the alliance is that the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should utilize its existing authority to eliminate duplicative cybersecurity regulations.

“The scope of duplicative cybersecurity regulations is staggering,” declared David Bader, director of the Institute for Data Science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) in Newark, N.J.

“A recent GAO analysis found that among just four major federal agencies, 49% to 79% of cybersecurity requirement parameters were in direct conflict with each other,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The most glaring example is incident reporting, where we currently have 45 different cyber incident reporting requirements spread across 22 federal agencies, each with their own forms and websites.”

“This regulatory chaos is severely undermining our cybersecurity capabilities,” he continued. “Large financial institutions report their cyber teams now spend more than 70% of their time on regulatory compliance rather than actually improving security. Some companies are spending nearly half their entire cybersecurity budget just filling out duplicative compliance reports.”

“When cybersecurity professionals are buried in paperwork instead of defending networks, we're essentially doing the attackers' work for them,” he said. “Eliminating these duplicative requirements would immediately free up billions of dollars in resources that could be redirected toward actual threat detection, incident response, and security improvements.”

The problem is not only that duplicative regulations waste time for anyone involved with them, but they are often different and sometimes at cross-purposes with each other, added Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider, in Clearwater, Fla.

“NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] recommends not having a minimum password size, removing the need to change it on a periodic basis and removing the complexity requirement,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Most other cybersecurity guides, including many governmental regulations, require the exact opposite.”

There may also be a significant hurdle in implementing the ISA's recommendation through the OMB. “The OMB's role is to coordinate regulations and look to see if they're inconsistent or duplicative or whatever,” said Berin Szóka, president of TechFreedom, a technology advocacy group, in Washington, D.C. “They can't repeal regulations as this document claims.”

“It's up to the agencies to repeal rules,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Then the question that you get into is whether the agencies can short-circuit the normal rulemaking process. The Trump administration has claimed that agencies don't have to go through normal rulemaking if they think that a rule is unlawful. That's just not true. That's not how the Administrative Procedure Act works.”

The ISA is also recommending that a cost-benefit analysis be required for all cybersecurity regulations. “Despite spending trillions of dollars on cybersecurity regulatory compliance, no study has ever documented that the cybersecurity regulations actually enhance security,” it contended.

However, Heath Renfrow, CISO and co-founder of Fenix24, a cyber disaster recovery firm in Chattanooga, Tenn., pointed out that while on the surface, a cost-benefit analysis seems like an economic safeguard, in cybersecurity, the cost side is tangible while the benefit side is probabilistic.

“How do you quantify the avoided cost of a ransomware event that didn't occur because of MFA adoption?” he asked. “Traditional cost-benefit frameworks, like OMB Circular A-4, break down because cyberattacks are low-frequency, high-impact events with cascading second-order effects.”

“That said, forcing agencies to at least articulate assumptions, model scenarios, and test proportionality would raise the quality of regulatory drafting,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The danger is in weaponization. Companies may argue that unless you can prove a breach will cost X amount of money, the regulation isn't worth it. The balance is ensuring analysis informs regulation, without paralyzing it.”

NJIT's Bader agreed that the risk of using cost-benefit analysis to avoid necessary regulations is real and concerning. “Many cybersecurity benefits are preventative and systemic, making them difficult to capture in traditional economic models,” he said. “The cascading effects we've seen from supply chain attacks like SolarWinds demonstrate that the true cost of cyber incidents often far exceeds initial estimates.”

“However,” he continued, “when properly implemented with methodologies that account for these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis could actually improve cybersecurity by ensuring resources go to the most impactful security measures. The key is developing models sophisticated enough to handle the unique characteristics of cyber risk, rather than applying standard regulatory cost-benefit frameworks that weren't designed for this domain.”

Another recommendation by the ISA is that the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act should be reauthorized and modernized.

The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA 2015) — the legal foundation for public-private cyber collaboration — will expire on September 30, 2025, unless reauthorized, the ISA explained. “Allowing it to lapse would severely limit the government's ability to share threat intelligence with industry, undermining national security,” it maintained.

Bader argued that CISA needs urgent modernization because it was written for a threat landscape that no longer exists. “The 2015 law was crafted before we understood AI-enabled attacks, sophisticated supply chain compromises, or the unique vulnerabilities of cloud infrastructure,” he said. The definitions of what constitutes shareable cybersecurity information are too narrow for today's threat environment.”

“With the advent of AI and the ability to build malicious code a lot faster than we've ever seen before, traditional ways of sharing information can't keep up with the threat,” added Matt Stern, chief security officer at Hypori, a mobile infrastructure security firm, in Reston, Va.

“If we're going to even get parity with the threat,” he told TechNewsWorld. “We have to be able to modernize the regulation so that it can deal with getting threat information into the hands of the people that need it in a much more realistic and quicker fashion.”

Fenix24's Renfrow added that private sector participation in sharing is still weak under the existing act. “Modernization should include liability safe harbors for companies that share indicators of compromise in good faith and reciprocal obligations for the government to return actionable intel in real time,” he said.

The ISA is also recommending that a cost-effective cybersecurity workforce be created for the government, largely through the PIVOTT Act currently before Congress.

Under PIVOTT (Providing Individuals Various Opportunities for Technical Training), students can enroll in existing cybersecurity programs offered by colleges, community colleges, and certificate programs. The federal government would pay for their tuition. In return, the students would be required to perform a specified amount of government service.

PIVOTT's target is to enroll up to 10,000 students a year eventually. “At that rate, PIVOTT would solve the federal government's cybersecurity workforce gap (35,000) in less than 4 years,” the ISA noted.

“The PIVOTT Act's apprenticeship and rotation model is promising because it treats cyber talent like a renewable resource,” Renfrow said. “You move skilled practitioners across agencies rather than each agency trying to grow its own siloed pipeline.”

“Four years is optimistic,” he added, “but without structural change like PIVOTT, the problem will persist indefinitely.”

While finding the PIVOTT concept a good one, Ida Byrd-Hill, CEO and founder of Automation Workz, a reskilling and diversity consulting firm in Detroit, Mich., argued that more money should be directed at the workforce development system in the Department of Labor. “Most people do not realize that just getting technology training at a university, college, or community college is not sufficient if you don't have a certification,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“The problem could have long been solved if the government supported learn and earn programs,” she added. “The government has not acquiesced to do that yet. They have to step up. It's not just about scholarships and training.”

A fifth recommendation by ISA is to establish a national macroeconomic cybersecurity dashboard.

The ISA explained that the federal government is spending tens of billions of dollars every year on an extensive range of cybersecurity projects. “Yet without a sophisticated model, policymakers are blind to the full economic cost of cyber threats, the ROI of defenses, the usefulness of alternative methods such as incentive programs rather than regulation, the systemic impacts of major incidents, and the most cost-effective ways to eliminate, mitigate, or transfer risk,” it noted.

It advised the National Cyber Director to collaborate with federal government agencies to promote a more sophisticated cyber risk assessment methodology based on the proven NACD-ISA framework.

“We desperately need a national cybersecurity dashboard because our current approach to cyber risk assessment is fundamentally broken,” Bader said. “Right now, we have dozens of agencies doing their own cyber risk assessments with no coordination or common methodology. It's like trying to understand the health of the U.S. economy by looking at 22 different, incompatible financial reports.”

“The NACD-ISA framework that would underpin this dashboard has been independently validated by MIT and PwC research,” he continued. “Organizations using these principles have 85% fewer cyber incidents and significantly better risk management outcomes. This isn't theoretical — it's a proven approach that works at the enterprise level.”

“Think of it as a Cyber Dow Jones Index — not predicting daily movements but measuring the structural health of the economy under cyber stress,” Renfrow added. “Without that visibility, policymakers are steering blind in a domain where adversaries are already treating cyber as macroeconomic warfare.”

Seattle-based startup Rec Room, once valued at $3.5 billion, is laying off about half of its staff in a sweeping restructuring.

Co-founders Cameron Brown and Nick Fajt announced the layoffs Monday in a blog post, calling it “one of the toughest choices in Rec Room history.” 

“This is a business necessity based on the financial trajectory of the company,” the founders wrote. 

The gaming company now has just over 100 employees following the cuts, Fajt confirmed to GeekWire. 

The cuts follow a separate round of layoffs earlier this year that impacted 16% of Rec Room's workforce. 

In their memo, Brown and Fajt said Rec Room became stretched too thin as it tried to build a user-generated content platform across VR, PC, consoles, and mobile.

While the company saw its most engaged creations come from PC and VR players, its efforts to expand to mobile and consoles never produced strong results. Millions of lower-quality creations also added heavy moderation and infrastructure burdens.

“So we ended up in a tough spot,” they said. “Too small to realize the ‘anyone can build anywhere' vision, but too big to pivot to a more focused experience that was more reactive to what our players wanted and would pay for. The result was that we started to dig a financial hole that was getting larger every day.”

Rec Room will now shift focus to its strongest areas: supporting top PC and VR creators, improving its flagship in-house “Rec Room Originals” such as Paintball, and curating monthly events designed to re-engage players.

“The closest analogy is Sega stepping out of hardware to focus on games,” the founders wrote. “A large, painful, but necessary change.”

Founded in 2016, Rec Room became one of a handful of “unicorns” in Seattle's startup scene after raising $100 million in 2021. It raised another $145 million at a $3.5 billion valuation later that year.

The company's self-named app, which allows players to make and share games, virtual goods, and other experiences with one another, hit new heights during the pandemic in 2020.

Investors include Madrona, Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, and others.

The company said it is providing affected workers three months of severance pay and six months of health benefits, as well as the option to keep laptops/desktops.

Pfizer laid off 100 employees in Bothell, Wash., according to a filing with the state Employment Security Department posted on Monday.

The pharmaceutical giant established a significant presence in Bothell following its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Seagen in 2023. Pfizer employs about 1,667 people in the Seattle region, according to LinkedIn. 

Earlier this year, Pfizer discontinued development of an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) tied to the acquisition of Seagen and took a $1 billion impairment charge.

Last year Pfizer shut down construction on a new 270,000 square-foot manufacturing facility Seagen had been building near its headquarters. Pfizer laid off about 120 employees at the time. 

Founded in 1998 as Seattle Genetics, Seagen pioneered the development of ADCs, a class of cancer therapies that use antibodies to deliver toxins or other small molecules directly to targeted cells. Seagen had four oncology drugs at the time of the acquisition to Pfizer.

Seagen had 3,300 total employees when it was acquired by Pfizer. It was the largest biotech company in the Seattle area at the time.

Yes, ChatGPT can draft a tricky email. But can a general-purpose AI assistant for the masses contribute to a big scientific breakthrough, without hallucinating or screwing up the research? The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) isn't holding its breath.

The Seattle-based institute's new project, dubbed Asta, lets research scientists create and deploy specialized AI agents, working autonomously to help them tackle and solve some of the world's toughest problems.

Ai2 bills Asta as a “bold initiative to accelerate science by building trustworthy and capable agentic assistants for researchers.” It's also an open-source project, following the nonprofit institute's ethos of making the digital plumbing of its projects available for others to analyze, adapt, and build upon.

There are three major components to Asta:

With entry-level jobs in some industries already under pressure, Ai2 is careful to call Asta a collaborator for scientists, not a replacement. But most grad students would envy the kind of praise the institute is heaping on the project.

Ai2's chief scientist, Dan Weld, said the inspiration came from the institute's own need for AI tools that can execute complex plans, explaining how they came up with their ideas, and stay grounded in scientific evidence.

“That's what Asta delivers,” Weld said in the announcement. “It's not just another assistant but a collaborator designed to think like a scientist.”

The institute sees this open approach — where developers use Asta's resources to build agents and Asta's benchmark to test them — as a way to create “a flywheel of scientific improvement” for the broader community.

The news caps what will no doubt go down as one of the busiest months in Ai2 history, including the announcement of a new AI robotics initiative and a $152 million grant from Nvidia and the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of the future AI backbone for U.S. scientific research.

In their spare time, the team has also been settling into new offices in a mass-timber building on the north end of Seattle's Lake Union. 

Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, and funded largely by the late Microsoft co-founder's estate, Ai2 is a non-profit research institute that builds open-source AI systems for the good of science and humanity. 

Ai2's team of 225 people includes some of the top AI researchers in the world, many of them also affiliated with the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Ai2 is known for OLMo (open language models), Molmo (multimodal models), Tülu (instruction-tuned language models), and other open-source AI systems.

OpenAi, Anthropic, and other Silicon Valley startups have grabbed headlines for turning their proprietary AI models into widely used consumer and commercial products, while Ai2 has worked more quietly behind-the-scenes on foundational research and fully open-source tools for scientists and developers.

Asta is an outgrowth of Semantic Scholar, Ai2's long-running project to create a massive research database that indexes more than 200 million scientific papers. Asta's agents use this database through a dedicated “Scientific Corpus Tool,” an extension of the Semantic Scholar API.

Ai2 has been burnishing its open-source credentials under CEO Ali Farhadi, an entrepreneur and University of Washington professor who returned to Ai2 in 2023 after leading machine learning at Apple — which acquired his Ai2 spinout Xnor.ai for an estimated $200 million in 2020.

Farhadi says the goal is to hold AI to standards grounded in the scientific method: He said in a statement that Asta represents Ai2's “bet on a future where AI doesn't just keep up with science, it helps drive it forward.”

Uber Eats has agreed to pay $15 million to more than 16,000 delivery workers in Seattle after reaching a settlement with the city's labor standards office over allegations that the tech giant violated laws regulating how workers are paid.

A majority of the settlement was related to the city's Independent Contractor Protections (ICP) Ordinance, which passed in 2021 and aims to ensure pay transparency. The City alleged that Uber Eats misled workers by not disclosing that its “Boost” multiplier feature only applied to a portion of a fare and that the upfront payment amount already included the “Boost” promotion's contribution. 

Uber ended the “Boost” program in Seattle in August 2023, after the City contacted the company, according to the Office of Labor Standards (OLS).

Regulators also investigated Uber Eats for allegedly failing to provide minimum pay for certain canceled orders, per the city's App-Based Worker Minimum Payment (ABWMP) Ordinance, which passed in 2022. 

The City also alleged that Uber Eats failed to provide required notice of rights, electronic receipts, and weekly statements as required by the laws.

“As the largest settlement in OLS history, this sets a new benchmark and represents a significant milestone for the protection of worker rights in Seattle in the rapidly growing industry of app-based work,” Steven Marchese, director of the Office of Labor Standards, said in a statement. 

The alleged violations covered work between September 2022 and May 2025. 

Uber denied wrongdoing but agreed to the settlement. It also paid more than $33,000 in fines to the City of Seattle and will adopt a new policy that lets workers provide more information about cancellations.

“We value the work couriers do and want them to be successful,” the company said in a statement to GeekWire. “We've worked with the City of Seattle to resolve claims about information provided to couriers on offers and pay — and we're focused on improving the experience for Seattle's couriers, consumers and restaurants.”

Payment to workers is scheduled to be distributed by Labor Day next week.

“This historic $15 million settlement is a major win for workers and a strong reminder that in Seattle, we hold large companies accountable when they sidestep their responsibilities and shortchange workers,” Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement.

Seattle has been a leader in establishing worker protections for gig workers who make deliveries and drive people around town. 

Uber previously paid $3.4 million in a settlement with Seattle in 2021. The City also reached a $1.6 million settlement with DoorDash in 2023.

Regulatory costs are part of why Uber fares in Seattle are the highest in the U.S., the Seattle Times reported.

DoorDash recently increased delivery fees in Seattle in response to what it called “extreme regulations” passed by Seattle lawmakers, including a new law that gives app-based workers more transparency when they're removed from platforms.

Summer is speeding by, and the return to school in Seattle next week would be a good time to slow down, especially in 19 new spots across the city where Speed Zone Safety Cameras have been added.

The Seattle Department of Transportation shared a reminder this week that its technology will target drivers going more than 20 mph in a school zone. And it doesn't take a numbers geek to appreciate the penalty — tickets for such an infraction are $237.

Many of the 38 School Zone Safety Cameras — located near public schools in Seattle — will be active when school starts on Wednesday, and the remainder will be installed during the school year, SDOT said in a blog post earlier this summer.

The zones are marked with yellow flashing beacons on speed limit signs. They are turned on at certain times based on when students are most likely to be present. Cameras in the zones photograph passing vehicles and license plates, and speeders receive a ticket in the mail. Pictures and video of any alleged camera violation can be viewed online.

The new locations were chosen based on safety and equity data analysis, according to SDOT, with the goal of adding cameras where they could have the biggest safety benefit. All revenue is invested in traffic safety upgrades in the city, including  new sidewalks, crosswalks, Safe Routes to School projects, and more.

The City of Seattle also uses cameras to enforce stopping at red lights; HOV, bike and bus lane infractions; and obstructing traffic or “blocking the box.”

Here's a list of where new School Zone Safety Cameras will be located:

Google is rolling out a new AI-powered experimental feature in Google Translate designed to help people practice and learn a new language, the company announced on Tuesday. Translate is also gaining new live capabilities to make it easier to communicate in real time with a person speaking a different language.

The new language practice feature is designed for both beginners starting to learn conversational skills and advanced speakers looking to brush up on their vocabulary, the company says. To do so, it creates tailored listening and speaking practice sessions that adapt to a user's skill level and unique learning goals.

With this new language practice feature, Google is taking on Duolingo, the popular language learning app that uses a gamified approach to help users practice over 40 languages. 

To access the feature, you'll select the “practice” option in the Google Translate app. From there, you can set skill level and goals. Google Translate then generates customized scenarios where you can either listen to conversations and tap the words you hear to build comprehension, or you can practice speaking. The exercises track users' daily progress, Google says.

The beta experience is rolling out in the Google Translate app for Android and iOS starting Tuesday. The feature is available first for English speakers practicing Spanish and French, as well as for Spanish, French, and Portuguese speakers practicing English.

Google is also introducing the ability for users to have back-and-forth conversations with audio and on-screen translations through the Translate app.

“Building on our existing live conversation experience, our advanced AI models are now making it even easier to have a live conversation in more than 70 languages — including Arabic, French, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Tamil,” Google wrote in a blog post. 

You can tap the “Live translate” option in the Translate app and then select the language you want to translate by simply speaking. You'll then hear the translation aloud alongside a transcript of your conversation in both languages. The app will translate and switch between the two languages that you and the other person are speaking. 

Google notes that the feature can identify pauses, accents, and intonations to allow for a natural-sounding conversation.

The feature uses Google's voice and speech recognition models to isolate sounds, which means you would be able to use the live capabilities in a loud restaurant or busy airport.

These live translation capabilities are available starting Tuesday for users in the U.S., India, and Mexico.

“These updates are made possible by advancements in AI and machine learning,” Google wrote in its blog post. “As we continue to push the boundaries of language processing and understanding, we are able to serve a wider range of languages and improve the quality and speed of translations. And with our Gemini models in Translate, we've been able to take huge strides in translation quality, multimodal translation, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.”

Google says that people translate around 1 trillion words across Translate, Search, Lens, and Circle to Search. The company believes these new AI-powered features will help overcome language barriers.

IBM and AMD are partnering to develop next-generation computing architectures that integrate IBM's quantum systems with AMD's AI-specialized chips. The move could position both the tech giant and chipmaker as key infrastructure players as they look to regain ground after falling behind on the generative AI boom.

Together, IBM and AMD will attempt to launch a commercially viable quantum computing architecture — one that's scalable and open sourced. In other words, it will be more widely accessible to researchers and developers solving complex real-world problems in fields like drug and materials discovery, optimization, and logistics, per IBM.

“Quantum computing will simulate the natural world and represent information in an entirely new way,” said Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, in a statement. “By exploring how quantum computers from IBM and the advanced high-performance compute technologies of AMD can work together, we will build a powerful hybrid model that pushes past the limits of traditional computing.”

Google is upgrading its Gemini chatbot with a new AI image model that gives users finer control over editing photos, a step meant to catch up with OpenAI's popular image tools and draw users from ChatGPT.

The update, called Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, rolls out starting Tuesday to all users in the Gemini app, as well as to developers via the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI platforms.

Gemini's new AI image model is designed to make more precise edits to images — based on natural language requests from users — while preserving the consistency of faces, animals, and other details, something that most rival tools struggle with. For instance, ask ChatGPT or xAI's Grok to change the color of someone's shirt in a photo, and the result might include a distorted face or an altered background.

Google's new tool has already drawn attention. In recent weeks, social media users raved over an impressive AI image editor in the crowdsourced evaluation platform, LMArena. The model appeared to users anonymously under the pseudonym “nano-banana.”

strange object spotted under the microscope over the weekend in the lab… pic.twitter.com/t1SBhqAnL0

Google says it's behind the model (if it wasn't obvious already from all the banana-related hints), which is really the native image capability within its flagship Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model. Google says the image model is state-of-the-art on LMArena and other benchmarks.

“We're really pushing visual quality forward, as well as the model's ability to follow instructions,” said Nicole Brichtova, a product lead on visual generation models at Google DeepMind, in an interview with TechCrunch. 

“This update does a much better job making edits more seamlessly, and the model's outputs are usable for whatever you want to use them for,” said Brichtova.

AI image models have become a critical battleground for Big Tech. When OpenAI launched GPT-4o's native image generator in March, it drove ChatGPT's usage through the roof thanks to a frenzy of AI-generated Studio Ghibli memes that, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, left the company's GPUs “melting.”

To keep up with OpenAI and Google, Meta announced last week that it would license AI image models from the startup Midjourney. Meanwhile, the a16z-backed German unicorn Black Forest Labs continues to dominate benchmarks with its FLUX AI image models.

Perhaps Gemini's impressive AI image editor can help Google close its user gap with OpenAI. ChatGPT now logs more than 700 million weekly users. On Google's earnings call in July, the tech giant's CEO Sundar Pichai revealed that Gemini had 450 million monthly users — implying weekly users are even lower.

Brichtova says Google specifically designed the image model with consumer use cases in mind, such as helping users visualize their home and garden projects. The model also has better “world knowledge” and can combine multiple references in a single prompt; for example, merging an image of a sofa, a living room photo, and a color palette into one cohesive render.

While Gemini's new AI image generator makes it easier for users to make and edit realistic images, the company has safeguards that limit what users can create. Google has struggled with AI image generator safeguards in the past. At one point, the company apologized for Gemini generating historically inaccurate pictures of people, and rolled back the AI image generator altogether.

Now, Google feels that it's struck a better balance. 

“We want to give users creative control so that they can get from the models what they want,” said Brichtova. “But it's not like anything goes.”

The generative AI section of Google's terms of service prohibits users from generating “non-consensual intimate imagery.” Those same kinds of safeguards don't seem to exist for Grok, which allowed users to create AI-generated explicit images resembling celebrities, such as Taylor Swift.

To address the rise of deepfake imagery, which can make it hard for users to discern what's real online, Brichtova says that Google applies visual watermarks to AI-generated images, as well as identifiers in its metadata. However, someone scrolling past an image on social media may not look for such identifiers.

A security researcher has found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories.

Seyfullah Kiliç, founder of cybersecurity company SwordSec, said he found over 1,300 internet-exposed TeslaMate dashboards on the internet, likely made public by mistake, allowing anyone to access the person's Tesla data stored inside without needing a password.

TeslaMate is an open source data logger that allows Tesla owners to self-host and visualize their vehicle's data from their own computers, such as their vehicle's temperature, battery health, and charging sessions, but also more sensitive information, like vehicle speed and the location data of recent trips. 

In a blog post, Kiliç said he scanned the internet for public-facing TeslaMate dashboards and scraped the vehicle's last-seen location and Tesla model names, and visualized the vehicles on a map to show their locations. 

“You're unintentionally sharing your car's movements, charging habits, and even vacation times with the entire world,” wrote Kiliç.

Kiliç told TechCrunch that this was to raise awareness of the number of exposed servers, and urged TeslaMate users to secure their dashboards.

“The goal was to show Tesla owners and the open source community that without basic [authentication] or firewall rules, sensitive data (GPS, charging, trips) can be leaked,” said Kiliç.

While not a new problem, Kiliç shows that the number of exposed TeslaMate dashboards has gone up significantly since the last count back in 2022, when a security researcher at the time found dozens of public TeslaMate dashboards exposed to the web. 

Now, more than three years later, another security researcher has found more than a thousand self-hosted TeslaMate servers on the web and mapped them, showing that the problem has seemingly gotten worse.

TeslaMate's founder, Adrian Kumpf, told TechCrunch in 2022 that a bug fix was rolled out that aimed to protect against public access to customers' dashboards, but warned that the project could not protect against users accidentally exposing their TeslaMate servers to the internet. 

Kiliç said TeslaMate users should enable authentication on their servers to prevent public access.

“If you plan to run TeslaMate on a public-facing server, you must secure it,” wrote Kiliç.

I only wanted to point out that you're almost forced to come up with some theory you have to explain genomic findings. Over time, yes, most of those theories have historically been shown to be bunk. (My gut tells me this one will share a similar fate.)But that's the scientific method. Propose a hypothesis (theory). Design experiments to test said theory. Present the results. Which should lead you to another hypothesis.In the ""propose a hypothesis"" phase, at least in fields like this one, the proposals will tend to be informed more by world view than by science. That's how humans think. I don't think there's any changing that. The control, or ""check and balance"", is supposed to be the objective review and validated replication of the results. Which is, I grant you, lacking at times.

Two Long Island UFO hunters have been called upon by some domestic law enforcement to investigate unexplained phenomena.

On a Friday evening last December, every tier of US law enforcement—federal, state, and local—was dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a military research installation outside Boston. A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base's restricted airspace. The culprits could not be found.

One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he's ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick's municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well.

The event, which barely made local news, was only the latest in a series of purported drone sightings along the US East Coast that November and December. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump's golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. But official answers were less forthcoming.

The Tedescos' roving aerial surveillance unit, which they've dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.

“It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who're telling me that there's this ship in the ocean that's launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. He recalls attending one presentation by an FBI expert in uncrewed aircraft systems who showed police unhelpful scare videos of improvised drone strikes in Ukraine, in which tiny aircraft rained grenades down on bloodied soldiers.  

The telescope will catalogue billions of new objects and produce a new map of the entire night sky every three days with the largest digital camera ever made.

By late January, the incoming Trump administration would assert that the entirety of the New Jersey drone wave had been benign, with each and every UAS “authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.” Their surety, however, stood in stark contrast to the warnings from top military brass, including the Air Force general at the head of NORAD, Gregory Guillot. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.” 

Lacking better coordination, or much clarity from the White House, the Pentagon, or the US intelligence community, some in domestic law enforcement—including members of the FBI's counterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions—have turned to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York, John and Gerald Tedesco. 

The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard's alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Since then, aviation safety advocates, astronomers, physicists and other researchers, and at least one journalist (I, myself) have made the trek out to Long Island's South Shore to kick the tires on the roving aerial surveillance unit they've dubbed “the Nightcrawler.”  

Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don't know how much you've talked to those guys. They're freaking awesome.” 

Grooms joined the Tedescos last January, when the brothers publicly shared some of their findings from training the Nightcrawler's sensors on a few of these unidentified drones. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.”

As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren't so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights.

“It wasn't actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. “It was actually changing its spectral signature—it was drifting into an infrared range.”

John likened it to “signature management,” a military term for the ability to tailor anything from radio emissions to light sources so that they remain detectable to one's allies but undetectable to one's foes. The clue, which likely would have been lost to police without the Tedescos' broad range of infrared sensors, was not unlike the kind of citizen-science fieldwork that had gotten them on the radar of academia's UFO hunters in the first place. 

Why all this attention? As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies. 

What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a fully maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world. 

For domestic law enforcement and the general public, two communities lacking the requisite national security clearances, the Tedescos' work promises a transparent, open-source solution to the past several years' worth of bizarre and troubling drone incursions into US airspace. For academics hunting for UFOs and other aerial anomalies, the Tedescos have become informal collaborators and a font of new ideas for novel data collection equipment. But for better or worse, some of the secrets they might be revealing may be the government's own.

The term “UFO” has officially gone out of fashion. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It's an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today's more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint.

Ryan Graves, a former US Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F fighter pilot who testified before Congress on the safety and security risks that UAPs posed to his own squadron, now heads a committee on the issue for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation's premier society for aerospace engineers. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024.

John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love.

“It's incredible what they've been able to put together,” Graves says, praising the Tedescos' ability to collect “very actionable data.” 

Gerry once held a security clearance to develop reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition sensors for a Pentagon contractor. John has helped conceive and construct analytical test hardware for Underwriters Laboratories, a federally approved safety, testing, and certification firm, and served for a time as the product safety chair for the Long Island branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like Star Trek, Chiller Theatre, and Lost in Space.

I got my first tour of their rig during an overnight expedition just off the beach at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York, the weekend before the AIAA's trip last fall. A klatch of camping chairs and cameras on tripods flanked one side of the Nightcrawler like a tailgate party. Inside, the lived-in kitchenette, the wood paneling, and the hum of over half a dozen monitors—including radar, night-vision, and radio-frequency (RF) scanners—made it feel like the cabin of a cramped marine research vessel.

The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler's roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”) 

With tests of humanoid bots and new developments in military applications, the year ahead will intrigue even the skeptics.

Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses.

One prototype I saw, a multispectral camera mounted on a sturdy yellow DeWalt surveyor's tripod, looked like a Gatling gun of multiple cameras and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) sensors. This jerry-rigged device spans the entire visible spectrum and beyond, from deep invisible ultraviolet all the way up to long-wave infrared. They've used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. “We've done this as far as a half a mile, but if you had a campfire, they could detect campfires from 28,000 feet,” John told me over the noise coming from the Nightcrawler's gas-powered electric generator. They've also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can't explain.

“We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.) 

The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. But the implication that the Nightcrawler has caught “gravitational lensing” off some warp-drive craft has rankled a few Galileo Project collaborators. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. Although Galileo scientists have visited and conferred with the Tedescos on UAP-hunting instruments, the brothers' more rough-and-courtroom-ready “forensic science” approach has caused turbulence in the relationship. 

In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos' “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.” 

But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said.

Ultimately, the Tedescos didn't have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach's Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025. 

“We are talking about over the airport, over taxiways, over runways,” Suffolk County's chief deputy sheriff, Chris Brockmeyer, told local news. “That's a serious safety concern. It's impacted air operations, and we're not going to stand for it.” On Christmas Day alone, the airport was besieged by 17 drone incidents, according to the Suffolk County sheriff, who has staff that collaborate informally with the Tedescos. Some of these drones, Suffolk County executive Ed Romaine asserted at a press conference, were “as large as a car.” 

The Tedescos couldn't use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. Through the cloud cover and the snowfall, the Tedescos said, they were able to track about two or three objects with this device.

But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they've picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters.

I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It's used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC.

Granted, many portions of this band are devoted to less cloak-and-dagger agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Valley Authority. But the signals suggested that whatever the Tedescos were tracking above Gabreski Airport, they were likely not from hobbyists. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast.

“For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment.

Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. “We're working closely with the FBI,” John says. Gerry adds, “We gauge it by their interest level in what we're doing.” 

“When they get more enthusiastic,” he continues, before John finishes his thought: “… we know we're closer and closer to something.”

It's hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute's b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law. 

Nevertheless, one senior-level law enforcement official, who has worked with the FBI on counterterrorism cases, did tell me that “the FBI is genuinely interested in the Tedescos' work.” The official, whose current police role bars them from speaking publicly without prior approval, recalls speaking to an FBI agent who “alluded to the help that the Tedescos have been.” But the problem, the official continued, is that “for the relationship to work, it has to be very low-key.” 

When I did briefly manage to get one of the Tedescos' FBI collaborators on the phone, the agent seemed to confirm their shared efforts, at least tacitly, but asked not to be identified. “As much as I'd like to, we're kept to pretty strict guidelines,” they said, before alluding to the new Trump administration's pervasive personnel cuts. “We're not allowed to talk to media—and with how things are right now, I'm not going to take any risks.” 

Featuring the world's largest digital camera, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will capture these mysterious phenomena in more exquisite detail than ever before. 

At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers' Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I've seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I'd say some are certainly ours.” 

As to the mystery of why the FBI would even want investigative assistance from two civilians in an RV over partners within the executive branch, it comes down to conflicting priorities—as well as over a dozen or so laws that restrict domestic intelligence collection on drones by either the Pentagon or the US intelligence community. “It's one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn't go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation.  

The desire of the NSA or some other agency to spy on foreign powers, Manget says, might override the desire to share pertinent information with police—information that could lead to jail time for the drones' operators. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they're being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There's things they can do that will end NSA's ability to collect.” 

On my short call with my FBI source, I did my best to explain this working hypothesis about the Bureau's collaboration with the Tedescos. “I wouldn't say that's wrong,” the source replied. “That's about as far as I could go.” By this past June, however, even the recent head of the Pentagon's dedicated UAP-hunting group, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was admitting publicly that the Defense Department itself has cribbed notes from the Tedescos.

“We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO's former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. “We thought it was a great plan. We actually looked at the sensors in that book.” 

On another podcast, Phillips said AARO's own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. “We thought that was brilliant.”

Earlier this year, partially in a concession to the economic toll their side project has taken, the Tedescos started offering versions of some of their devices for sale on the Nightcrawler's charmingly GeoCities-esque home page. One of them, a handheld multispectral detector, is effectively the consumer model of that EMF Gatling gun they showed me.

Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town's fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful.

When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos' equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team's consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Absolutely not. Just like they have to be trained with a radar gun, they'd have to be trained with these other tools.” 

Lauzon, Natick's deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos' “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don't have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA. 

But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all.

“We're seeing anomalies in our airspace and we're just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me. “Eventually, something is going to come home to roost—and then we're going to regret the fact that we didn't look deeper and try to understand what was going on.”

The doomer narrative of an all-powerful AI is gaining ground in the halls of power.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. 

The AI learns it is about to be switched off and goes rogue, disobeying commands and threatening its human operators.

It's a well-worn trope in science fiction. We see it in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's the premise of the Terminator series, in which Skynet triggers a nuclear holocaust to stop scientists from shutting it down.

Those sci-fi roots go deep. AI doomerism, the idea that this technology—specifically its hypothetical upgrades, artificial general intelligence and super-intelligence—will crash civilizations, even kill us all, is now riding another wave. 

The weird thing is that such fears are now driving much-needed action to regulate AI, even if the justification for that action is a bit bonkers.

The latest incident to freak people out was a report shared by Anthropic in July about its large language model Claude. In Anthropic's telling, “in a simulated environment, Claude Opus 4 blackmailed a supervisor to prevent being shut down.”

Anthropic researchers set up a scenario in which Claude was asked to role-play an AI called Alex, tasked with managing the email system of a fictional company. Anthropic planted some emails that discussed replacing Alex with a newer model and other emails suggesting that the person responsible for replacing Alex was sleeping with his boss's wife.

What did Claude/Alex do? It went rogue, disobeying commands and threatening its human operators. It sent emails to the person planning to shut it down, telling him that unless he changed his plans it would inform his colleagues about his affair.  

What should we make of this? Here's what I think. First, Claude did not blackmail its supervisor: That would require motivation and intent. This was a mindless and unpredictable machine, cranking out strings of words that look like threats but aren't. 

Large language models are role-players. Give them a specific setup—such as an inbox and an objective—and they'll play that part well. If you consider the thousands of science fiction stories these models ingested when they were trained, it's no surprise they know how to act like HAL 9000.   

Second, there's a huge gulf between contrived simulations and real-world applications. But such experiments do show that LLMs shouldn't be deployed without safeguards. Don't want an LLM causing havoc inside an email system? Then don't hook it up to one.

Third, a lot of people will be terrified by such stories anyway. In fact, they're already having an effect. 

Everyone thinks they know, but no one can agree. And that's a problem.

Last month, around two dozen protesters gathered outside Google DeepMind's London offices to wave homemade signs and chant slogans: “DeepMind, DeepMind, can't you see! Your AI threatens you and me.” Invited speakers invoked the AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton's fears of human extinction. “Every single one of our lives is at risk,” an organizer told the small crowd.

The group behind the event, Pause AI, is funded by concerned donors. One of its biggest benefactors is Greg Colbourn, a 3D-printing entrepreneur and advocate of the philosophy known as effective altruism, who believes AGI is at most five years away and says his p(doom) is around 90%—that is, he thinks there's a 9 in 10 chance that the development of AGI will be catastrophic, killing billions.

Pause AI wrote about Anthropic's blackmail experiment on its website under the title “How much more evidence do we need?” 

The organization also lobbied politicians in the US in the run-up to July's Senate vote that ended up removing a moratorium on state AI regulation from the national tax and spending bill. It's hard to say how much sway one niche group might have. But the doomer narrative is finding its way into the halls of power, and lawmakers are paying attention. 

Here's Representative Jill Tokuda: “Artificial superintelligence is one of the largest existential threats that we face right now.” And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene: “I'm not voting for the development of Skynet and the rise of the machines.”

It's a vibe shift that favors policy intervention and regulation, which I think is a good thing. Existing AI systems pose many near-term risks that need government attention. Voting to stop Skynet also stops immediate and actual harms.

And yet does a welcome end justify weird means? I'd like to see politicians voting with a clear-eyed sense of what this technology really is—not because they've been sold on an AI bogeyman.

When we talk of “desktop replacement” laptops, we usually speak in terms of raw performance, not upgradability. Framework, the company behind several generations of ultra-repairable and modular laptops and mini PCs, is the only company that can call its devices an option if you demand true customizability. The company is back again with a new iteration of its Framework 16, packing new CPU and GPU options with a full-fledged removable Nvida option. If the feel is as good as it was with the Framework Laptop 13, the new model could prove to be the last laptop you'll ever need, literally.

The revitalized Framework Laptop 16 now comes with an option for up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070. Nvidia's mid-range GPU is at its best with gaming at around 1440p resolution. The GPU is mostly limited by its 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which is going to hinder it for higher resolutions and for real future-proofing. If you don't want to upgrade for a while, you're better off with a discrete graphics processing unit with at least 16GB of VRAM. Normally, I would caution anybody with this fact if they thought about a system with these limited graphics. Instead, Framework's modularity means that you could upgrade your GPU rather than having to buy an entire new and increasingly expensive gaming laptop.

On the CPU side, you still have options of AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series CPUs, which will either be a Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 9. The higher-end 12-core CPUs will be necessary if you expect to do any intensive tasks up to and including gaming.

If you have the older Framework Laptop 16, the new RTX 50-series module should be backwards compatible, according to Framework. Even beyond the graphics uplift, the new module has numerous other benefits, including power and external monitor support through the rear USB-C port. This module will support up to 100W TDP, which on older modules would push the fans to jet engine levels. Framework claims it reengineered its thermal design to keep the device cool while being less noisy. There's also a new 240W power brick to supply the necessary power and—better yet—it's using USB-C rather than any proprietary port.

The last-gen Framework 16 made use of an AMD Radeon RX 7700S graphics module. It was enough for some graphics scenarios, but in the end it wasn't nearly as capable as a full discrete Nvidia GPU. While AMD still has not offered any hint it plans to bring its Radeon RX 9000 series desktop graphics cards to laptops, gamers' only choice for mobile graphics capable of playing the latest AAA releases is still Team Green. Now that it's inside a removable module built for Framework's laptops, I can already see it becoming a go-to for DIY builders trying to come up with their own unique PCs.

If you eschew the new graphics module, you can still opt for the Radeon RX 7700S. If you don't want either, you can go for the Expansion Bay shell with room for other components. The device will support four display outputs through its four expansion card slots. These dongles stick into the open expansion slots on the laptop shell for any version of I/O your heart desires. As for RAM and storage, you can opt for RAM up to 96GB and up to 10TB of storage through the two M.2 SSD slots.

I'm still using my Framework Laptop 13. There's something intrinsic about knowing you put something together—that you know what's inside it and how to take it apart if necessary. That sense of ownership unfortunately comes at a premium. The Framework Laptop 16 starts at $1,500 without the GPU. The device comes stock with a 2,560 x 1,600 IPS LCD panel that goes up to a 165Hz refresh rate with Nvidia G-Sync. Gaming laptops that range from $2,000 on up normally offer mini LED or OLED displays with better contrast and/or brighter screens.

The starting price is $100 more than the 2023 model, and you can expect individual modules will cost more, as well. Still, the thought of finally having a true gaming-ready laptop with Framework's customizability is enough to spark a hint of joy, even from somebody who has clacked away on way too many gaming laptops in 2025 alone.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Nvidia Unveils High-Tech ‘Brain' for Humanoid Robots and Self-Driving Cars","https://gizmodo.com/nvidia-unveils-high-tech-brain-for-humanoid-robots-and-self-driving-cars-2000647946","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 00:29:17 GMT","

Could humanoid robots get a lot more human? Nvidia may have made that possibility a bit realer today with a smarter robot brain that has less energy demands. 

The tech giant's latest robotics offering is Jetson Thor, a super computer built for real-time AI computation on humanoid robots and smart machines alike, Nvidia announced in a press release on Monday.

The new module is built to handle larger amounts of information at less energy than previous model Jetson Orin. Powered by the latest Blackwell GPUs, Jetson Thor has more than seven times the AI compute power and twice the memory at more than three times speed and efficiency than its predecessor, Nvidia claims.

All this new power is supposed to unlock higher speed sensor data and visual reasoning that can help humanoid robots get better at autonomously seeing, moving, and making decisions.

“Jetson Thor solves one of the most significant challenges in robotics: enabling robots to have real-time, intelligent interactions with people and the physical world,” the company wrote.

It's a considerable performance leap that Nvidia hopes will appeal to engineers. The company says early adopters include Amazon, Meta, Caterpillar, and Agility Robotics, a startup that makes commercially available humanoid robots for warehouses and other manufacturing facilities. The model is being considered for adoption by John Deere and OpenAI.

It's also being adopted by research labs at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Zurich, to power autonomous robots in medical research settings and more, Nvidia said in a blog post on Monday.

The developer kit Jetson AGX Thor, which includes the Jetson T5000 module plus a reference carrier board, power supply, and an active heatsink with a fan, is now on sale on the company's website starting at $3,499.

Coming soon—and available now on pre-order—is Nvidia Drive AGX Thor, a developer kit using the same technology but for autonomous vehicles instead. Deliveries for that are slated to start in September, the company said.

Although AI chips are Nvidia's bread and butter, the tech giant is betting big on robotics and autonomous vehicles.

“This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines,” CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview in June.

Huang elaborated on his trust in just how much the robotics industry can scale at the company's annual shareholders meeting later that month.

Along with AI, Nvidia expects robotics to provide the largest growth for the company, and combined, the two represent “a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang told investors.

Earlier this year, the company also released a family of AI models that can be used to train humanoid robots, called Cosmos.

Huang's bet isn't an empty one. Humanoid robots are advancing.

Just last week, China, one of the key players in the global robotics race, hosted its first-ever robot Olympics, World Humanoid Robot Games. At the three-day spectacle, companies showcased robots that can complete a 1,500-meter race in just a little over six seconds and achieve practical job skills like sorting medicine or taking food orders.

But still, the technology is hugely limited and far from widespread adoption. Even at the great robotics showcase in China, many of the robots suffered technical difficulties. One robot in the track and field race even ran straight into and knocked over a bystander walking off-course. 

Nvidia made the announcement at a rather convenient time for the company. The tech giant is reporting fiscal second quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and the market is buzzing already.

Nvidia dominates the AI market, so the company's earnings always draw huge speculation, but the importance this week is boosted by volatile policy changes and questions around the economic value of wide-scale AI adoption.

The company has been on a policy rollercoaster ride in its efforts to sell AI chips in China amidst the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington. China is a major market for Nvidia, and the uncertainty is keeping company investors at the edge of their seats.

Also keeping investors occupied is a concerning new AI report from MIT researchers. The report found that despite the bold bets on AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in 10 AI pilot programs have translated to real revenue gains.

Nvidia just hit $4 trillion market value last month, becoming the first public company to achieve the feat. Now, the stakes are high, as it's up to the tech giant to prove that it's valuation is not just built on AI hype.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Apple May Take AirPods Pro 3 Beyond Audio","https://gizmodo.com/apple-may-take-airpods-pro-3-beyond-audio-2000648180","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:45:48 GMT","

It's been a long time coming, but it looks like Apple is finally ready to release the next pair of AirPods Pro. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the AirPods Pro 3 will likely be among the major product releases at next month's annual iPhone 17 event. That's big news for anyone who turns to Apple for wireless audio, but the new active noise cancellation (ANC) buds could be an even bigger deal for anyone who's interested in Apple as a player in health-focused wearables.

On top of improved ANC and the (unlikely) inclusion of cameras, Gurman reports that AirPods Pro 3 will have heart rate monitoring built into the wireless earbuds. For context, that's not a huge technical breakthrough, since Apple is already deep into the health tracking game with the Apple Watch and its ability to collect sleep, stress, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen data. It would be, however, a big deal for how Apple positions its AirPods and also how we view wireless earbuds in general.

As great as wireless earbuds have become over the years, there's only so much room for growth. Companion apps have helped to personalize EQ, while AI has helped to pave the way for features like adaptive ANC that adjusts noise cancellation based on the volume of your surroundings, but neither of those things has necessarily changed the game—not to mention, they've now been around for several years. A pair of wireless earbuds that harnesses the power of the Apple Watch? That's a different story. And clearly Apple sees the vision of wireless earbuds that can do a lot more—and I do too.

It may seem far-fetched to think that your wireless earbuds can fill in as a health wearable, but in lots of ways, it makes perfect sense. For one, wireless earbuds are something you have on your person all the time, which makes them almost as ubiquitous as your phone and a perfect conduit for hoovering up all your useful health data. Not only that, but people (thanks to features like Transparency, which allow you to hear your surroundings with earbuds in) keep their wireless earbuds in for long periods of time, even during health-centric activities like exercising. As long as they're on us and essentially right up against our bodies, they might as well be doing something other than playing podcasts, right? And if they can monitor our heartbeat, why not do other stuff like temperature or stress levels? I doubt the capabilities would stop just at heart monitoring.

Apple obviously hasn't said anything about adding health sensors to the Apple Watch explicitly, but Tim Cook has alluded to the importance of health tracking as a category in recent years. In 2019, Cook spoke to Mad Money's Jim Cramer, saying, “I believe if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, ‘What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health.” That's a lofty claim from Cook, but it illustrates just how serious Apple is about wearables and about their potential to move Apple forward beyond Macs, iPhones, and iPads. That emphasis on health tracking, by the way, has worked for Apple in the past.

Before the Apple Watch became the health-tracking powerhouse it is now, it was a relatively aimless device—not quite a phone fill-in, not quite a watch, and definitely not a hit among initial Apple fans. Then came Apple's emphasis on health and the ability to monitor steps, cardiovascular health, accident detection, and more. All of a sudden, the Apple Watch went from idling to solidifying its status as a critical tool for potentially saving your life. AirPods aren't exactly in need of saving like the Apple Watch, but they are in search of a new audience, and what better way to push the envelope than by taking a set of features we clearly love and porting them over to a device we use every day?

As good an idea as that is on paper, Apple still needs to execute. The Powerbeats Pro 2 already have heart rate monitoring, but the execution of that feature is less than ideal, to say the least. For one, you can't play audio and monitor your health at the same time, which feels like a dealbreaker for most people who plan to wear AirPods while exercising. That being said, if Apple works out the kinks, it could give people one huge reason to go out and upgrade their wireless earbuds and an even bigger reason to buy into Apple's dream of becoming one of the most important health tech companies out there.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Tech's Heavy Hitters Are Spending Big to Ensure a Pro-AI Congress","https://gizmodo.com/ai-pac-congress-openai-andreessen-silicon-valley-2000647826","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:45:57 GMT","

Much of the American public is dubious to neutral when it comes to artificial intelligence. A recent poll found that 71 percent of Americans were concerned about the technology “permanently” displacing human workers.

Since we ostensibly live in a democracy, you'd think that would be bad news for the AI industry; unfortunately, many of the folks who are central to our economy are all-in. What do you do when you can't win in the court of public opinion?

The next best thing is to work the refs, and that appears to be Silicon Valley's plan for ensuring the political viability of its golden calf.

Some of tech's biggest names are injecting $100 million into a newly announced network of political-action committees that will push for stripping AI regulation. Lead the Future, a PAC network that was announced in a press release on Monday, will seek to make America safe for AI. The press release states:

A coalition of leading AI companies and innovators today announced the launch of Leading the Future (LTF), a new national political operation committed to ensuring the United States leads the world in AI innovation, development, and governance. LTF's mission is to ensure the United States remains the global leader in AI by advancing a clear, high-level policy agenda at the federal and state levels and serving as the political and policy center of gravity for the AI industry.

LTF claims as its allies many tech luminaries, including “Andreessen Horowitz, Greg and Anna Brockman, Ron Conway (SV Angel), Joe Lonsdale (8VC), and Perplexity, with other prominent firms and individuals from across the tech and investment sectors expected to join in the coming weeks,” the press release states.

“There is a vast force out there that's looking to slow down AI deployment, prevent the American worker from benefiting from the U.S. leading in global innovation and job creation, and erect a patchwork of regulation,” Josh Vlasto and Zac Moffatt, the group's leaders, told the newspaper. “This is the ecosystem that is going to be the counterforce going into next year.”

When reached for comment by Gizmodo, Lead the Future referred us to the previously circulated press release.

Increasingly, Silicon Valley is one of the biggest political donors in the nation. The cryptocurrency industry poured money into the U.S. presidential election last fall and came out the other side with a POTUS intent on making America the “crypto capital of the world,” and a Congress that's eager to sign anything to make it happen.

Then there's Elon Musk, who spent nearly $300 million all by himself just to get Trump in the door. The business world clearly sees super-soaking lawmakers with bundles of cash as the winning formula, so why wouldn't the AI industry and its proponents jump on the bandwagon?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Elon Musk's New Software Company Is the Opposite of Microsoft","https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-new-software-company-microsoft-macrohard-2000646847","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 02:09:17 GMT","

Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest gooner, has a new software company. And in typical Musk fashion, he's given it a name that only a teenager stuck in a 54-year-old's body would truly appreciate.

The name is Macrohard, a play off the name Microsoft, and Musk knows it's an immature joke about penises. But that kind of humor has never stopped him from raising billions of dollars before.

“Join @xAI and help build a purely AI software company called Macrohard,” the billionaire tweeted Friday. “It's a tongue-in-cheek name, but the project is very real! In principle, given that software companies like Microsoft do not themselves manufacture any physical hardware, it should be possible to simulate them entirely with AI.”

It's unclear what Musk means by insisting that Microsoft doesn't “themselves manufacture any physical hardware.” Microsoft has products like Surface and Xbox, which are designed by the tech company. Microsoft oversees the manufacturing through various partners.

It's also a bit odd to insist that any software company could be entirely simulated “with AI.” One person replying to Musk's tweet asked the obvious question: “Does this mean all software-only companies – including xAI – are at risk of being fully disrupted?” 

The theory seems to be that with the rise of AI, you can code anything you like, no matter how complicated, and just produce software essentially for free. And even if that were possible (it's not, given the fact that AI still needs a human babysitter to debug), it seems like it would run into some major intellectual property issues.

xAI filed a trademark application for Macrohard on Aug. 1, according to online records held by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Musk first teased the name of his company in a tweet on July 13.

“We are creating a multi-agent AI software company @xAI, where @Grok spawns hundreds of specialized coding and image/video generation/understanding agents all working together and then emulates humans interacting with the software in virtual machines until the result is excellent,” Musk tweeted.

“This is a macro challenge and a hard problem with stiff competition! Can you guess the name of this company?” Musk continued, ending with a laughing emoji.

That tweet caused people online to guess correctly that it would be called Macrohard, perhaps because it's been such a long-running joke in the software community. People speculated that it would be something related to gaming or vibe coding, which seems like a pretty solid bet, though we're still waiting on details.

The trademark application mentions video games, but also seems to be trying to stake a claim in pretty broad fields, including “legal analysis, strategic planning, and professional advisory applications.”

xAI didn't immediately respond to questions emailed on Friday. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back.

The iPhone 17 is coming. The iPhone 17 is coming! Well, technically, four iPhone 17 devices are reportedly coming on Tuesday, Sept. 9 at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT. That's when Apple will announce a family of new devices, including the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17—phones that have been leaking out for the better part of the last year.

Apple sent the following invite to Gizmodo:

iPhone 17 event confirmed for Sept. 9. See ya there! pic.twitter.com/VTJOjYfZYE

— Ray Wong (@raywongy) August 26, 2025



The invite reads “Awe dropping,” which sounds like a play on jaw dropping,” hinting that Apple's new products will be very exciting. The invite also shows a hint of orange, which could be Apple teasing the rumored orange iPhone 17 Pro? Apple enthusiast Parker Ortolani also made some astute observations. “If you wanna try to read the tea leaves, infrared is used for non-invasive blood pressure and glucose monitoring….,” Ortolani wrote on X. He also added, “Cool AIR appears as dark blue on infrared.” Might Apple be alluding to the light blue iPhone 17 Air that leaked a few weeks ago?

Apple's annual fall event, which will once again be held at Apple Park in Cupertino, CA, will also be where the company is expected to announce new Apple Watches (Series 11 and Ultra 3), new AirPods (Pro 3?), and a slew of new features for all of the new devices. If it's like past years, Tim Cook and pals should also give us release dates for when we can officially install the non-beta releases for Liquid Glass. That includes iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, watchOS 26, and tvOS 26.

There's gonna be a truckload of Apple announcements on Sept. 9. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to get even thicker with the biggest camera bump (housing a new 48-megapixel telephoto camera) that Apple has ever put into an iPhone. We may also see a new orange color for the iPhone 17 Pros. The iPhone 16 Plus will almost certainly die this year, and its replacement will likely be the “iPhone 17 Air,” a new, super-thin glass slab with a single camera and possibly reduced battery life due to its skinny frame.

On the accessories and wearables front, we're anticipating modest updates to the Apple Watch Series 10, maybe a bigger screen (but not a bigger case) for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and we could see live translations rolled out to AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4 with or without a new AirPods Pro 3 announcement.

The leaks have been steady, and many of them have come from reputable sources with solid track records. But you know what they say, nothing is official until it comes straight from the horse's mouth. So clear your calendar and maybe sell a kidney now (please don't do that!) cause Apple's fall gadget bonanza is only a few weeks away.

The only thing for certain that you can count on happening on Sept. 9 is a live blog. Just like we did with last week's “Made by Google” event for Pixel 10, Samsung's Unpacked for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and Apple's WWDC and Google's I/O developer conferences this past summer, we'll be live-blogging the Apple Event.

Apple will be streaming its event on its website at Apple.com and YouTube here, but I promise Gizmodo's live blog will be more entertaining. It's also the only place where I'll reveal the breakfast spread that Apple's gonna serve to the media. That's important stuff!

Despite allusions to nepotism and corruption, the Commerce Department hasn't made clear what it wants to do with the newly clawed-back funds.

The U.S. Commerce Department has seized control of a $7.4 billion semiconductor research fund from the National Center for the Advancement of Semiconductor Technology (NATCAST), a private non-profit set up during the Biden administration, as per Reuters. Describing it as a ""slushfund,"" for ex-Biden admin officials, the Commerce Department promised greater oversight and accountability for where the funds are being spent, but didn't provide any further detail.

One of the defining investments of the Biden administration was the CHIPS Act, which authorized close to $300 billion in investments to encourage the design, development, and manufacturing of cutting-edge semiconductors in the United States. The creation of NATCAST was a part of that, with $11 billion allocated for it to establish a range of research centers around chip design.

The Trump administration's Commerce Department wants to bring this non-profit under its umbrella of control, though, and has announced it will be taking over a large portion of the organization's funds moving forward.

“From the very beginning NATCAST served as a semiconductor slush fund that did nothing but line the pockets of Biden loyalists with American tax dollars,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the statement. He's recently heralded a serious change in the way the U.S. handles its technology investments and grants.

The Commerce Department statement also described NATCAST as an ""effort to skirt clear legal restrictions prohibiting government agencies from establishing corporations,"" and that it was full of ""former Biden officials,"" making some generalized allusions to nepotism and corruption.

NATCAST hasn't released a public statement about these cuts, but last week did highlight how it was aligned with the priorities of the White House and tried to make clear how important its role was in making the US competitive in the cutting-edge chip industry.

In July, NATCAST celebrated the creation of its new CHIPS for America Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Accelerator facility within the NY Creates Albany NanoTech Complex. Designed to accelerate the U.S.'s fabrication of the latest EUV semiconductors, it gives visitors full access to ASML's latest EUV chip design tools. It was also hoped to attract the top talent in semiconductor design and manufacturing, but now the future of the center and any other NATCAST efforts remains uncertain.

In January, NATCAST and the then-Biden administration announced plans to build a further research and development facility in Tempe, Arizona. It was set to open sometime in 2028, but that seems increasingly unlikely to come to pass without appropriate funding.

The Commerce Department hasn't said what it plans to use the billions in funding it now has control over.

Trump wants nations to stop taxing American big tech.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


President Donald Trump has once again raised the threat of putting further tariffs on semiconductors and technology. The U.S. president wants to apply these import taxes against countries that impose digital services taxes, especially those against American tech companies, as reported by Bloomberg.

“Digital Taxes, Digital Services Legislation, and Digital Markets Regulations are all designed to harm, or discriminate against, American Technology. They also outrageously, give a complete pass to China's largest Tech Companies. This must end, and end NOW!” Trump posted on his social media platform. “With this TRUTH, I put all Countries with Digital Taxes, Legislation, Rules, or Regulations, on notice that unless these discriminatory actions are removed, I, as President of the United States, will impose substantial additional Tariffs on that Country's Exports to the U.S.A., and institute Export restrictions on our Highly Protected Technology and Chips.”

It's unclear what kind of taxes Trump is talking about here, as there are multiple types of taxes applied to digital services. These include consumption tax, which is based on the sales any entity, digital or otherwise, makes in a jurisdiction; digital services taxes (DST), based on a company's digital sales; digital withholding taxes, which are applied against the revenue made by digital firms in a particular area; among others.

Many nations, especially in Europe and East Asia, have put some kind of tax on digital services. The argument here is that governments want to level the playing field, as domestic firms, both physical and digital, are required to pay taxes on their sales. However, foreign companies that do not have a physical presence in a country and deliver goods and services online do not have to report their sales, thus they do not get taxed.

Most digital service providers are based in North America, particularly in the U.S., according to tax research firm Tax Foundation. This means that American firms are hit hardest by DSTs and other forms of taxes that governments apply. So, to combat these alleged ‘discriminatory' rules, Trump is threatening to place retaliatory import taxes and stop the flow of advanced chips to countries that do not lift them.

If the White House proceeds with this plan of action, many of the U.S.'s biggest allies will be hit hard. At least 18 countries around the globe apply DSTs on online sales, including France, the U.K., Italy, Spain, Turkey, and Hungary. On the other hand, the major chip-making nations in East Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, do not have DSTs, but still apply value-added taxes (similar to sales tax) on digital sales.

Even with Trump's threat of sanctions and tariffs, this will likely be an uphill battle for most nations. Tax laws usually go through Congress in most democratic nations, meaning it might take years, if not decades, for the law to change. Resistance is also likely, as the move could be viewed by governments as U.S. interference with their sovereignty. Nevertheless, these threats are often just used to force partners to the negotiating table and open the issue. But if the U.S. follows through with tariffs and sanctions, this could spiral out of control and lead to an expansion of the ongoing trade war.

The service, Mobility, was unable to accept requests for rides or changes to already-booked rides following a ransomware attack.

The Maryland Transit Administration says it is actively investigating a cybersecurity incident, namely a ransom attack, that has rendered it unable to accept new requests for rides for its Mobility paratransit service for the disabled.

MTA, which says on its website that it's responsible for ""one of the largest multi-modal transit systems in the United States,"" said that it's ""actively investigating a cybersecurity incident that involves unauthorized access to certain systems"" with assistance from the Maryland Department of Information Technology.

The good news is that MTA said its ""core services (Local Bus, Metro Subway, Light Rail), MARC, Mobility [sic], Call-A-Ride, and Commuter Bus are operating normally."" It's also planning to continue to offer Mobility rides that were booked prior to the incident; it just doesn't have the requisite systems in place to handle requests for new rides.

""The agency is actively working to resolve this issue as quickly and securely as possible and will provide updates as they become available,"" MTA said. ""In the meantime, eligible riders should consider using the Call-A-Ride program, which can be accessed at www.mtacallaride.org or (410) 664-2030."" (Guidelines can be found here.)

This isn't a one-off incident. Ransomware gangs seem to be making a habit of targeting these services: The Record reported that ""over the last two years, cities in Missouri, Virginia, and other states have had to provide alternatives to disabled residents after cyberattacks or ransomware incidents took critical systems offline.""

""Our primary goal is to ensure the safety and security of our transit customers and employees,"" MTA said. ""MDOT/MTA are working with our partners to support all communities impacted. We will work with our media partners to keep the public updated.""

A convenient way to get extra screens for your favorite content


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Don't have room for a multi-monitor setup, or need extra screens when travelling? How about wearing the extra screens on your face? That's one of the use case examples for Xreal's AR (Augmented Reality) glasses, which include gaming and movie watching as ways to experience your favorite content in an AR setup.

On Amazon, Xreal is bundling together its Pro One AR glasses along with the Beam Pro for the princely sum of $798.00. Currently, the Xreal One Pro is selling for $769.00, and the Xreal Beam Pro is on sale for $199.00. This means that the bundled deal saves you $170 compared to buying the two items separately.

The Xreal AR glasses boast impressive specs for such a compact device. Sony's 0.55-inch Micro-OLED display technology gives the Pro One's flat-prism lenses a Full-HD experience with up to a 120 Hz refresh rate, powered by Xreals X1 spatial processor.

You can view AR screens with a viewable 171-inch area, and scalable screens up to 191 inches max. Experience an improved 57-degree FoV (Field of View), an increase over the 50-degree FoV of the Xreal One AR glasses, with sound provided by Bose-tuned open-air speakers. Easily connect via USB-C to a multitude of devices with video output, such as your phone, laptop, or even a gaming handheld like the Steam Deck or Switch, for a novel viewing experience.

Save a whopping $170 when you pick up the Xreal bundle deal on the Xreal One Pro AR glasses and Xreal Beam Pro. View content in AR with 120Hz Full-HD when you connect the One Pro glasses to devices such as an iPhone, laptop, or Steam Deck.

Xreal's Beam Pro is the companion device for Xreal AR glasses. Download apps and connect to the glasses for movies, TV, or gaming content. 

We've had the chance to review the Xreal One Pro AR glasses and found them to be some of the best examples of AR glasses on the market. The glasses are lightweight and of high-quality construction, using thinner, flat-prism lenses that allow for a larger field of view than the non-Pro Xreal One glasses.

Electrochromic dimming helps the screen images to stand out against the background for a less busy experience, but as a con, the image quality from the Xreal Eye accessory for these AR glasses is pretty poor. The other major negative is the price. The Xreal One Pro has crept up in price to $769, thanks to influences such as tariffs and more, and this makes jumping on the AR bandwagon a costly experience.

COMMENTARY

Nayiri  Guedikian, MD, MPH

DISCLOSURES August 26, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Building leadership skills as a resident is not about waiting until you're an attending. It's important and actually very useful to step into that mindset now. 

I personally started by watching the senior residents that I admired in terms of how they communicated, how they handled tough situations, and how they made the rest of the team feel supported.

Then I started doing the same, such as speaking up during rounds when something didn't feel right, advocating for my patients, and making sure the interns could ask questions without feeling like they were going to be judged. 

Part of leadership that you can build as a resident is learning how to take on responsibility — owning your decisions, staying composed when things get chaotic, and being the person that others can count on.

It's really less about being in charge and more about setting the tone. At the end of the day, leadership in medicine isn't just a title; it's an opportunity to lead and teach with clarity, courage, and compassion.

People with type 2 obesity-driven diabetes tend to have more aggressive breast cancers, but no one knows exactly why. A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and published in Springer Nature found that tiny particles in the blood, known as exosomes, which are altered by diabetes, can reprogram immune cells inside tumors making them weaker and allowing the cancer to grow and spread more easily.

This is the first study to directly link exosomes from people with type 2 diabetes to suppressed immune activity inside human breast tumors.""

Gerald Denis, PhD, corresponding author, the Shipley Prostate Cancer Research Professor at BU

In the study, researchers used tumor samples from breast cancer patients to grow 3D tumor models in the lab. Known as patient-derived organoids, these models contain the immune cells originally found in the tumor. These mini tumors were treated with blood exosomes from people with and without diabetes but also without any cancer. Then researchers analyzed the organoids using single-cell RNA sequencing to see how the exosomes affected the immune cells and the tumor itself.

The patient-derived organoid system developed by Denis and first author Christina Ennis, PhD, is the first to preserve original immune cells from human tumors, letting scientists study tumor-immune interactions in a lab setting that closely mimics real life. In addition to breast cancer, this study also may be relevant to other cancers affected by immune suppression and metabolic disease.

""Breast cancer is already challenging to treat, and people with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes, but clinicians don't fully understand why,"" said Denis. ""Our study reveals one possible reason: diabetes changes the way the immune system works inside tumors. This could help explain why current treatments, like immunotherapy, don't work as well in patients with diabetes. Knowing this opens the door to better, more personalized treatments for millions of people."" Over 120 million Americans are diabetic or prediabetic, yet if they develop cancer, they are not treated differently in any significant way by the standards of treatment in oncology. Thus, this work addresses a serious public health challenge.

Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine developed a new and highly effective application of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to quickly scan notes in electronic medical records and identify high-risk patients who may have been infected with H5N1 avian influenza or ""bird flu"", according to new findings published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Using a generative AI large language model (LLM), the research team analyzed 13,494 visits across University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) hospital emergency departments from adult patients in urban, suburban, and rural areas in 2024. These patients all had acute respiratory illness (such as, cough, fever, congestion) or conjunctivitis-symptoms consistent with early H5N1 infections. The goal was to assess how well generative AI could find high-risk patients who may have been overlooked at the time of initial treatment.

Scanning all of the emergency department notes, the model flagged 76 because they mentioned a high-risk exposure for bird flu, such as working as a butcher or at a farm with livestock, like chickens or cows. Usually, these exposures were mentioned incidentally-for example, documenting a patient's occupation as a butcher or farmworker-and not because of clinical suspicion for bird flu.

After a brief review by research staff, 14 patients were confirmed to have had recent, relevant exposure to animals known to carry H5N1, including poultry, wild birds, and livestock. These patients were not tested specifically for H5N1, so their potential bird-flu infections were not confirmed, but the model worked to find those ""needle in a haystack"" cases among thousands of patients treated for seasonal flu and other routine respiratory illnesses.

""This study shows how generative AI can fill a critical gap in our public health infrastructure by detecting high-risk patients that would otherwise go unnoticed,"" said study corresponding author Katherine E. Goodman, PhD, JD, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM and a faculty member of the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing (UM-IHC). ""With H5N1 continuing to circulate in U.S. animals, our biggest danger nationwide is that we don't know what we don't know. Because we are not tracking how many symptomatic patients have potential bird flu exposures, and how many of those patients are being tested, infections could be going undetected. It's vital for healthcare systems to monitor for potential human exposure and to act quickly on that information.""

Since early 2024, H5N1 has infected more than 1,075 dairy herds across 17 states, and over 175 million poultry and wild birds have tested positive during this outbreak period. Identified human cases remain rare, with 70 confirmed infections and just one fatality in the U.S. by mid-2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). There are, however, likely many more infections that have gone undetected due to a lack of widespread testing. In addition, new strains could arise enabling human-to-human airborne spread, which would lead to an uptick in cases and a potential epidemic.

The AI review required only 26 minutes of human time and cost just 3 cents per patient note, demonstrating high scalability and efficiency. This method has the potential to create a national network of clinical sentinel sites for emerging infectious disease surveillance to help us better monitor newly emerging epidemics.""

Anthony Harris, MD, MPH, study co-author, Professor and Acting Chair of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM

The LLM (GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrated strong performance in identifying mentions of animal exposure, with a 90% positive predictive value and a 98% negative predictive value when it was evaluated on a sample of 10,000 historical emergency department visits from 2022-2023, before bird flu was circulating in U.S. livestock. However, the model was conservative when identifying exposures specifically relevant to avian influenza-sometimes flagging patients with low-risk animal contact, such as exposure to dogs-underscoring the need for human review of any flagged cases.

As the risk of infections transmitted by animals grows, researchers suggest that large language models could also be used prospectively to alert healthcare providers in real time. This could prompt them to be more vigilant about asking about potential exposure to infected animals, targeted testing, and controlling infections by isolating patients. The CDC currently relies on mandated lab reporting to track avian influenza but lacks systems to assess whether clinicians are asking about or documenting relevant exposures in symptomatic patients.

The researchers hope to next test the large language model for prospective surveillance and deployment within the electronic health record, for faster real-time identification of high-risk patients. As respiratory virus season resumes in the fall, having a fast and accurate way to identify those patients needing special testing for bird flu, or precautionary isolation while receiving treatment, will be especially critical.

""We are at the forefront of a disruptive but incredibly promising revolution around big data and artificial intelligence,"" said UMSOM Dean Mark T. Gladwin, MD, who is also the Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor. ""The engineer and physician researchers working at the Institute for Health Computing have secure access to medical records from the two million patients that we serve throughout Maryland, and as this study demonstrates, can use AI and big data to identify early signals of emerging infectious diseases like bird flu to enable us to take action sooner to test for these diseases and keep them from spreading.""

Other UMSOM faculty co-authors on the paper include Laurence S. Magder, PhD, Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM, Jonathan D. Baghdadi, PhD, MD, Associate Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM who is also on faculty at the UM-IHC, and Daniel J. Morgan, MD, MS, Professor of Epidemiology & Public Health at UMSOM.

The study would not have been possible without the contributions of the UM Institute of Health Computing, which was established two years ago in North Bethesda, Maryland as a collaboration between the University of Maryland, College Park, the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the University of Maryland Medical System. The Institute merges the computational expertise, clinical expertise, biomedical innovation, health data and academic resources of the three institutions.

Scientists warn that unpredictable climate swings could bring mosquito-borne disease outbreaks years earlier than expected, urging governments to act now on surveillance and preparedness.



Study: Climate variability amplifies the need for vector-borne disease outbreak preparedness. Image credit: AU USAnakul/Shutterstock.com

A recent PNAS study adopted a long-term perspective. It demonstrated that internal climate variability (ICV) is a significant source of uncertainty about the climate's suitability for vector-borne diseases (VBD) transmission.

Climate change is altering the dynamics of VBDs. For example, the population of Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit dengue, is increasing in Europe and North America. In 2023, local dengue transmission was reported for the first time near both Los Angeles and Paris, and even in the United Kingdom, the Aedes albopictus has been detected. Scientists combine climate projections with vector and pathogen dynamics to quantify the risks of future outbreaks.

Three primary sources of uncertainty affect climate projections produced by general circulation models (GCMs). The first stems from model uncertainty driven by differences in the formulation of GCMs. It is often quantified using multimodel ensembles. The second source of uncertainty concerns scenarios, e.g., future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathways. It is analyzed by running GCMs under different scenarios. Finally, ICV could cause aleatory uncertainty due to the climate's unpredictable nature. ICV concerns the natural fluctuations that occur regardless of external factors, such as GHG emissions.

In existing research, ICV is often neglected while considering model and scenario uncertainty in climate-VBD studies. The current study, in the context of future VBD risks, partitioned climate uncertainty and exhibited the potential role of ICV in producing suitable climate conditions for future outbreaks. These outbreaks could occur sooner than expected under climate change alone.

Daily temperature projections for London between 2030 and 2080 were obtained, and recorded weather station temperature data for 2020 were gathered. Next, existing temperature-suitability models for dengue transmission caused by Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti were combined with temperature data to project the annual number of days suitable for transmission.

Uncertainty in projections was divided into contributions from ICV, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Cubic polynomials were fitted to estimate the extent of ICV and single-model and scenario ensemble means. The focus was on average uncertainty due to ICV over different models and scenarios.

ICV was noted to drive a significant part of the uncertainty in the number of suitable days. This was notably true even decades into the future. For example, in 2080, 38% of the annual mean temperature's prediction interval (PI) could be attributed to ICV. ICV accounted for 48% of the PI for the days suitable for transmission. These effects were consistent with other studies that assessed uncertainty in nonlinear, climate-dependent effects.

Five other cities were selected for equivalent analyses to ensure the robustness of the findings. These cities are not currently deemed to be at high risk of dengue transmission but may be at risk in the future. The suitability of transmission using recorded 2020 weather data was also evaluated.

The exact uncertainty contributions between cities showed heterogeneity, which was expected given heterogeneity in climate conditions. However, the common theme was the substantial contribution of ICV in driving the proportion of uncertainty in transmission-suitability projections. ICV-associated year-to-year temperature fluctuations led to the acceleration of heightened suitability. For example, on considering model and scenario uncertainty alone in a model of dengue transmission by Ae. albopictus in London, the annual risk of greater than or equal to 120 days of suitability first exceeds 5% in 2047, relative to 2038 when ICV is also factored in.

The current study demonstrated that ICV may lead to suitable climate conditions for VBD transmission and recommended its inclusion alongside model and scenario uncertainty when generating climate-sensitive VBD projections.

The authors emphasized that this has direct public health implications: proactive preparedness is needed, including vector surveillance at points of entry, breeding site control, clinical testing capacity, public information campaigns, and outbreak response planning.

A few assumptions were made here, which could be relaxed in future studies. More complex methods could be employed to relax assumptions regarding the fitting of cubic polynomials to estimate ensemble mean values, uniformly weighting the climate scenario-model pairs when partitioning uncertainty, and assuming that the extent of ICV is time-invariant.

The study also noted that additional climate factors (e.g., precipitation and humidity) and non-climate-related factors (e.g., human population density and intervention strategies) should be incorporated in future models to give more policy-relevant projections.

Research into Blue Zones - regions of the world where people tend to live longer - shows that having a sense of purpose in life may help people live longer.

Now, new research from UC Davis shows that having a sense of purpose in life may have another benefit as people age: reducing the risk of dementia.

The new study, published in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, followed over 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.

Researchers found that people who reported a higher sense of purpose in life were about 28% less likely to develop cognitive impairment - including mild cognitive impairment and dementia.

The protective effect of having a purpose was seen across racial and ethnic groups. It also remained significant even after accounting for education, depression and the APOE4 gene, which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age. Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia.""

Aliza Wingo, senior author and professor in the UC Davis Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences

Participants were not specifically asked about the activities that gave their life purpose. Previous studies on aging, though, have found a wide rang of activities give older adults a sense of life purpose, sometimes referred to as ""ikigai."" These include:

Researchers also found that people with higher purpose tended to experience cognitive decline later than those with lower purpose. On average, the delay in onset was very modest - about 1.4 months over an eight-year period, after considering the effects of age, education, depressive symptoms, and genetic risk. However, it is meaningful when compared to current treatments.

""While medications like lecanemab and donanemab can modestly delay symptoms of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, they come with risks and costs,"" said Nicholas C. Howard, first author and public health researcher at UC Davis. ""Purpose in life is free, safe and accessible. It's something people can build through relationships, goals and meaningful activities.""

Participants in the study were part of the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey funded by the National Institute on Aging. All had normal cognitive health at the beginning of the study.

Researchers used a seven-item survey from the Ryff Measures of Psychological Well-being. Participants had six possible responses (from ""strongly agree"" to ""strongly disagree"") for statements such as: ""I am an active person in carrying out the plans I set for myself"" and ""I have a sense of direction and purpose in my life."" Their answers were scored and averaged to obtain a well-being number between 1 and 6, with higher values indicating a strong sense of purpose in life.

Their cognitive health was tracked using a telephone-based test every two years.

The researchers noted the study has many strengths, including the size of the population studied. However, a key limitation is that although there was an association, the study did not prove higher levels of purpose caused the lowered rates of dementia.

Still, the findings support the idea that psychological well-being plays a key role in healthy aging, said Thomas Wingo, a co-author of the study and a professor and neurologist at UC Davis Health. Wingo hopes future studies will explore whether purpose-building interventions can help prevent dementia.

""What's exciting about this study is that people may be able to 'think' themselves into better health. Purpose in life is something we can nurture,"" he said. ""It's never too early - or too late - to start thinking about what gives your life meaning.""

A Mediterranean-style diet, in combination with reduced caloric intake, moderate physical activity, and professional support for weight loss, may cut the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 31%, according to a new study co-authored by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study will be published August 25, 2025, in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

We're facing a global epidemic of diabetes. With the highest-level evidence, our study shows that modest, sustained changes in diet and lifestyle could prevent millions of cases of this disease worldwide.""

Frank Hu, co-author, Fredrick J. Stare Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology and chair of the Department of Nutrition

Prior research has linked the Mediterranean diet-which emphasizes high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, moderate intake of dairy and lean proteins, and little to no intake of red meat-to better health outcomes, including lowered risk of T2D through improved insulin sensitivity and reduced inflammation. 

A team of collaborators from the PREDIMED-Plus clinical trial, the largest nutrition and lifestyle randomized trial in Europe, sought to understand how the diet's benefits may be enhanced with additional healthy lifestyle changes.

The researchers, from 23 universities in Spain and Harvard Chan School, split 4,746 PREDIMED-Plus participants into an intervention group and a control group and followed their health outcomes for six years. The intervention group adhered to a Mediterranean diet; reduced their caloric intake by about 600 calories per day; engaged in moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking and strength and balance exercises; and received professional support for weight loss control. The control group adhered to a Mediterranean diet without calorie restriction, exercise guidance, or professional support. Participants ranged from age 55 to 75, were overweight or obese, and had metabolic syndrome, but were free of T2D at baseline.

The study found that those in the intervention group had a 31% lower risk of developing T2D compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the intervention group lost an average of 3.3 kilograms and reduced their waist circumference by 3.6 centimeters, compared to 0.6 kilograms and 0.3 centimeters in the control group.

""In practical terms, adding calorie control and physical activity to the Mediterranean diet prevented around three out of every 100 people from developing diabetes-a clear, measurable benefit for public health,"" said co-author Miguel Martínez-González, professor at the University of Navarra and adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School.

The study was funded by the European Research Council, the Spanish National Institute of Health, the Biomedical Research Networking Centre (CIBER), and the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (1R01DK127601).

New evidence shows that short, intense HIIT workouts can deliver big health benefits for obese teens, improving fitness, blood pressure, and cholesterol, even if the scale doesn't change. 



Study: The effect of high-intensity interval training on health-related outcomes in obese adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Image credit: BAZA Production/Shutterstock.com

Exercise and a balanced and nutritious diet are key to a healthy lifestyle. A recent systematic review published in Frontiers in Physiology examined the impact of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on health in obese teenagers.

Obesity in adolescence creates physical and emotional difficulties, including cardiometabolic risk, depression, poor body image, and low self-esteem. The number of overweight individuals between 5 and 19 years of age crossed 390 million in 2022. This accounts for 20% of people in this demographic, up from 8% in 1990.

Exercise and diet have proven effective in countering overweight in the 11-19 age group. Smartphone-based interventions have also been associated with better outcomes from weight management programs in this group.

HIIT can be combined with dietary and behavioral approaches to get the most out of exercise interventions. This strategy involves short but intense spurts of vigorous exercise with lower-intensity recovery phases in between. Since teenagers typically have a packed schedule with school, sports, and social commitments and (often) reduced motivation to exercise, HIIT could be a valuable approach for this group, in contrast to conventional moderate-intensity continuous training.

Some benefits of HIIT include needing less exercise while offering just as good or even better fitness, reducing body fat, improving metabolic health, and increasing aerobic capacity. Additionally, HIIT has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Prior research has linked it to favorable adipokine changes, including higher omentin-1. This combination of effects appears to improve metabolic regulatory function further.

HIIT also reduces blood pressure and increases VO2peak, indicating improved cardiorespiratory fitness in this population. However, conflicting data have prompted this current systematic review.

The researchers searched four databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on this topic. They focused on the impact of such exercise on body function in this group.

There were 11 articles that fulfilled the eligibility criteria, covering a total of 611 participants. They were classified as controls (283) and intervention groups (328), aged between 11 and 17 years.

The studies covered multiple continents, including Poland and Denmark in Europe, China in Asia, South Africa, the USA, and Brazil in South America.  Some bias was observed; for example, allocation concealment was unclear in ~38% of studies, and smaller proportions showed performance bias, attrition bias, or reporting bias, partly due to small sample sizes, performance bias related to improper blinding, and attrition bias.

Small sample size could have introduced bias because of random errors and limited statistical power. Since the participants came from obesity clinics and schools, this could have contributed to heterogeneity in studies.

In the former case, close monitoring and expert consultants are the norm. In contrast, a more generally qualified training staff may lack the specialized training required for this specific group in the latter case. The geographical setting could also have contributed to differences in the standardization of HIIT protocols, whether due to local attitudes, scarcity of resources, or the lack of trained professionals.

HIIT significantly reduced body fat percentage in obese teenagers, while improving VO2peak, a measure of aerobic capacity. This has been associated with better cardiovascular fitness, metabolic health, and insulin sensitivity.

High-density lipoprotein (‘good' cholesterol) also increased with HIIT, while the systolic blood pressure decreased. Surprisingly, there was no significant reduction in the body mass index (BMI), perhaps because the gain in muscle tissue offset the reduction of fat mass in the body.

When the researchers examined the structure of the exercise protocols more closely, they found that HIIT performed twice a week was particularly effective. This frequency was linked with improvements in BMI, greater reductions in body fat percentage, and gains in aerobic capacity. The sessions included in the studies were 1–30 minutes or 30–60 minutes, depending on the protocol. This variation suggests that shorter and longer HIIT sessions can be effective, provided the training is done consistently.

The immediate benefits of HIIT probably stem from improved cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness mediated by better insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial biogenesis. Long-term compliance and benefits have not been equally studied. Longer periods of HIIT are probably required to allow the body to adapt more durably to the training and for habit formation. Participant retention remains a live problem in this area.

HIIT does not appear to significantly reduce BMI in obese teenagers. However, it improves body fat percentage and increases aerobic capacity. Increased HDL improved the blood cholesterol profile, while systolic blood pressure fell. These changes predict reduced cardiovascular risk with HIIT in obese adolescents.

Overall, the findings highlight the potential of HIIT as an effective intervention for improving body composition and cardiovascular health in obese adolescents, though its effect on BMI appears minimal.

The significant differences between studies support further research before the findings can be generalized. Future work should identify the best HIIT protocols and assess the long-term health outcomes so that optimal recommendations can be rolled out for this group of at-risk individuals.

Over seven million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the heartbreaking day-to-day battle with the effects of cognitive decline. According to the Alzheimer's Association, the brain changes that cause the disease actually begin 20 years or more before symptoms start, highlighting the critical need for early and accurate diagnosis. However, current diagnostic tools involve painful spinal taps, expensive scans and cognitive tests that can be limited in their accuracy.

New research led by biomedical engineers at USC Viterbi School of Engineering has uncovered the key role the brain's blood flow dynamics play in AD, offering a simpler, non-invasive diagnostic tool that could reshape decades of conventional thinking about how this debilitating disease is understood and treated. Led by Vasilis Marmarelis, Dean's Professor in the Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering, the work was published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring.

For years, the prevailing consensus in Alzheimer's research and clinical care has been the ""amyloid cascade hypothesis."" This theory suggests that a protein fragment called amyloid beta is the main culprit in Alzheimer's. When too much amyloid beta builds up in the brain, it triggers the accumulation of another protein, Tau, that forms twisted clumps known as ""tau tangles"" within brain cells. These tangles are then thought to cause brain cells to malfunction and eventually die, leading to the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's.

Current diagnostic methods largely revolve around detecting these amyloid and tau pathologies. This often requires uncomfortable and risky spinal taps to draw cerebrospinal fluid for analysis. More recently, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, or ""amyloid or tau PET,"" emerged, where a radioactive tracer is injected to visualize amyloid plaques or tau tangles in the brain, a test that is so costly it is usually confined to academic research settings. Most recently, blood biomarkers that serve the same purpose show promise for the future.

Physicians take the emissions from that PET radioactive tracer as an approximate measure of how much amyloid or tau the person has in their brain. Speaking from experience, after having seen data in my own study, I tell you that it's very inadequate. But it's the gold standard, although most physicians don't do it because it's very expensive.""

Vasilis Marmarelis, Biomedical Enginering Department, University of Southern California

Without these costly and invasive biological tests, many neurologists turn to cognitive assessment tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), behavioral interview-based questionnaires aimed at testing cognitive function.

""The MoCA does give you an idea about the cognitive abilities of a person,"" Marmarelis said. ""But these are not biological or physiological tests. These are just behavioral tests that are subject to all kinds of biases, imperfections and errors.""

Instead of looking at the brain's amyloid plaques, Marmarelis and his collaborators focused on the way blood flow through the brain is autoregulated in order to oxygenate the brain tissue, and whether possible dysregulation may cause cognitive impairment. Think of it like a meticulous inspection of how your home's plumbing system is functioning rather than just looking at the rust on the pipes.

The research team's National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded study harnessed data from 200 participants over five years, investigating the intricate dynamic relationship between natural changes in arterial blood pressure, carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in the blood, and the resulting fluctuations of cerebral blood flow and cortical tissue oxygenation.

""When we exert cognitive effort, we generate CO₂ from the metabolism in our cerebral cells, which obviously has to be taken away by our blood to avoid acidosis,"" Marmarelis said. ""Our body is endowed with this regulatory mechanism called vasomotor reactivity, which dilates (widens) our cerebral vessels when CO₂ goes up in the blood, so that more blood can go through and the excess CO₂ be washed out.""

Fifteen years ago, Marmarelis made a serendipitous observation: Alzheimer's patients show impaired vasomotor reactivity. ""They cannot dilate the cerebral vessels to bring more blood in and provide adequate blood perfusion to the brain. This means they don't get the oxygen, nutrients and glucose that we need for cognition in a timely manner,"" he said.

In their new study, Marmarelis' team tested this observation, developing a novel ""physio-marker"" called the Cerebrovascular Dynamics Index (CDI). This non-invasive test uses non-invasive Doppler ultrasound to measure blood flow velocity in some main arteries of the brain, and near-infrared spectroscopy to measure oxygenation in the front part of the brain's cortex. This ""input-output type of conceptualization"" uses sophisticated ""dynamic modeling"" methods developed in our lab to quantify how quickly and effectively the brain's blood supply responds to subtle changes in pressure and CO₂.

The research team obtained some encouraging results - The CDI showed excellent diagnostic performance, differentiating individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's from cognitively normal control subjects with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96.

AUC is a common statistical measure of diagnostic performance; a value of 1.0 is perfect, and 0.5 is random chance. For context, the amyloid PET test achieved an AUC of only 0.78, while the MoCA and MMSE cognitive tests were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively.

Marmarelis stressed that the difference between 0.78 and 0.96 translated to a ""very substantial improvement"" in the test's ability to correctly identify those with and without the condition.

""What we have that others didn't have before is a methodology to quantify these dynamic relations that's extremely robust and accurate,"" Marmarelis said. ""We can now differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's from cognitively normal controls far better than the PET measurement and even better than the MoCA neurocognitive test. This indicates that the particular aspect of dysregulation of cerebral perfusion regulation may be the critical aspect in the pathogenesis of this disease, probably in conjunction with other factors, including amyloid accumulation.""

This profound shift in the understanding of Alzheimer's could pave the way for new treatment and prevention strategies focused on improving the regulation of brain blood flow and oxygenation. Marmarelis said this could involve several promising avenues that are still being evaluated for their potential efficacy:

Other beneficial interventions can be developed and tested in the future. Marmarelis said that in addition to Alzheimer's, these results hold broader implications for the treatment and diagnosis of other dementias.

The research was supported by NIH grants. Other co-authors on the paper included Helena C. Chui, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, and Sandy Billinger, professor of neurology at Kansas University Medical Center, as well as collaborators from the Department of Neurology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

A new study led by researchers at National Jewish Health has found that recent infection with the common cold - often caused by rhinoviruses - may offer temporary protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The research provides fresh insight into why children are less likely than adults to develop symptoms and could point toward new ways to reduce the severity of respiratory illnesses.

Published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases earlier this month, the study analyzed data from the nationwide Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS) study, which tracked more than 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021.

Researchers found that people, particularly children who had a recent rhinovirus infection, were significantly less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the following weeks. This effect is thought to be linked to the body's antiviral defenses. Rhinoviruses trigger a strong interferon response in the airways, which can temporarily prime the immune system to fight off other viruses.

Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold. This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.""

Max Seibold, PhD, senior author of the study, researcher and Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health

Using thousands of self-collected nasal swabs, the team tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, including rhinovirus, in participants of all ages. They also analyzed airway gene expression to see how recent viral infections influenced the body's antiviral defenses. Children were found to have higher baseline expression of interferon-related genes - proteins that act as the immune system's first line of defense against viruses - compared to adults.

While this phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, has been observed with other respiratory viruses, this is the first prospective study to show it may also occur with SARS-CoV-2.

""This doesn't mean people should intentionally try to catch a cold,"" said Camille Moore, PhD and lead author of the study at National Jewish Health. ""But understanding how one virus can affect the body's response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations.""

The research builds on earlier findings from the HEROS study showing that children are six times less likely than adults to develop symptomatic COVID. The new data highlights the role that both age-related immune differences and recent viral exposures may play in that protection.

National Jewish Health researchers conducted the study in collaboration with partners from 12 cities across the United States.

Inflammatory bowel disease, in which the immune system attacks the gut, is a painful chronic condition that affects three million Americans. Rates of IBD are rising, and there's currently no cure. IBD can also be deadly: up to 8% of people with the disease develop blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke.

New research has uncovered why blood clotting malfunctions in IBD-and identified drugs that normalize blood clotting in human cells and animal models of IBD.

We think we can leverage these findings to reduce inflammation and the risk of blood clots. This could be lifesaving.""

Aaron Petrey, PhD, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at University of Utah Health, associate director of the U's Molecular Medicine Program, and senior author on the paper

The results are published in Blood.

Most research into IBD has focused on immune cells. But blood cells called platelets are another key contributor to IBD symptoms. In healthy people, platelets clump together into clots in response to injuries to stop bleeding, and don't form clots otherwise. But in patients with IBD, platelets are on a hair trigger, ready to form clots at the slightest provocation.

Surprisingly, platelets from IBD patients weren't clotting via the normal pathways that trigger clotting, says Rebecca Mellema, PhD, postdoctoral researcher in pathology and the first author on the paper. ""It's completely independent of what we would expect.""

""There's an innate mechanism by blood vessels to tell platelets to stay quiet and not form a clot yet,"" Petrey explains. ""Once there's injury or inflammation, that signal can switch over and tell them to form a clot. That's the process that's broken in IBD patients.""

IBD platelets appear to clot more often because they don't have enough of a key protein called layilin, the researchers found. In healthy people, layilin acts as a molecular brake for clotting: it senses the difference between healthy and injured blood vessels and prevents platelets from clotting as long as blood vessels are intact.

But when the researchers deleted the layilin gene in mice, the brakes came off. Without layilin, platelets were extra sticky, forming clots when they shouldn't.

The researchers also found that platelets from IBD patients only had about 60% of the layilin protein that they should, leaving them constantly on the verge of clotting.

Layilin prevents unwanted clotting by tamping down the activity of a clot-triggering molecule called Rac1. In mice without the layilin gene-and in people with IBD-Rac1 is always a little bit too active, which means platelets are too prone to forming clots.

But there's good news. Drugs that prevent Rac1 activity are already in clinical trials for other conditions, and the researchers' results suggest that these Rac1 inhibitors could be powerful therapeutics for IBD.

One Rac1 inhibitor reduced excessive clotting in human platelets in a dish. The inhibitor also decreased the level of tissue damage in the gut in a mouse model of IBD.

Promisingly, the drug decreased clotting in platelets from IBD patients even more strongly than it affected healthy cells. ""We have shown a hyperactivation pathway in resting IBD patient platelets, but they're also incredibly sensitive to treatment, moreso than those from a healthy person,"" Mellema says.

Normalizing Rac1 activity might not only reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke-it could also help alleviate day-to-day IBD symptoms, the researchers say. Excessive clotting can block blood flow in the gut and make inflammation worse, which means that preventing clotting could reduce inflammation.

Unlike established anti-clotting drugs, the researchers say, Rac1 inhibitors shouldn't lead to an increased risk of dangerous bleeding, which is a serious concern for IBD patients with chronic inflammation. Blocking Rac1 won't interfere with other, independent pathways that can trigger platelet clotting, so the cells should still be able to form needed clots in response to injury.

""We're targeting a pathway that is not pre-activated in healthy people,"" Petrey says. ""So we can address that step of the pathway, and if there's a significant injury, the platelets can overcome that inhibition.""

Other groups had been looking into the potential of Rac1 inhibitors to reduce inflammation in IBD. The new work emphasizes the potential of these drugs to address multiple symptoms. ""Paying more attention to what we can do to address these blood clotting risks could significantly improve patient lives,"" Petrey says.

The results are published in Blood as ""Layilin inhibits integrin activation, and its loss results in platelet hyperactivation via Rac1 in inflammatory bowel disease.""

A natural compound could help fight aggressive leukemia and amplify the effect of chemotherapy drugs.

Forskolin, a natural compound derived from a plant, could significantly improve treatment outcomes for an aggressive form of leukemia, known as KMT2A-rearranged Acute Myeloid leukemia (KMT2A-r AML), according to a new study from the University of Surrey.

The study, published in the British Journal of Pharmacology, shows that not only does forskolin directly stop the growth of leukemia cells, but it also enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs. Researchers from Surrey found that forskolin activates Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and stops the expression of several cancer-promoting genes (MYC, HOXA9 and HOXA10).

The research also shows a significant and unexpected finding, as forskolin was found to substantially increase the sensitivity of KMT2A-r AML cells to daunorubicin, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug. This effect, however, was not dependent on PP2A activation: forskolin appeared to block P-glycoprotein 1, which allows cancer cells to pump chemotherapy drugs out, leading to drug resistance. By blocking P-glycoprotein 1, forskolin allowed for more daunorubicin to go inside the leukemia cells, making the chemotherapy much more potent.

Our findings have highlighted an exciting dual mechanism of action for forskolin. Not only does it have direct anti-leukaemic effects, but it also acts as a powerful enhancer to conventional chemotherapy. Combining forskolin with daunorubicin could lead to a more effective treatment strategy, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing the severe side effects often associated with AML treatments.""

Dr. Maria Teresa Esposito, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry, University of Surrey

Dr. Simon Ridley, Director of Research and Advocacy at leukemia UK, says:

""We are committed to funding innovative research and are proud to have supported Dr Esposito's work. AML is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancer types, and this study not only deepens our understanding of KMT2A-rearranged AML but also opens the door to kinder, more effective treatments. Work like this is essential if we are to achieve our goal of doubling the five-year survival rate for AML within the next decade.""

The study, funded by leukemia UK, was a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Surrey, University of Roehampton, Barts Cancer Institute-Queen Mary University of London, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London- UCL and the Genomic Regulation, CRG Barcelona (Spain).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Common painkillers ibuprofen and paracetamol found to fuel antibiotic resistance","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250825/Common-painkillers-ibuprofen-and-paracetamol-found-to-fuel-antibiotic-resistance.aspx","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 02:21:00 GMT","

Ibuprofen and paracetamol are common over-the-counter medications that many of us reach for when we're sick. But new research from the University of South Australia shows that these trusted staples are quietly fuelling one of the world's biggest health threats: antibiotic resistance.

In the first study of its kind, researchers found that ibuprofen and paracetamol are not only driving antibiotic resistance when used individually but amplifying it when used together.

Assessing the interaction of non-antibiotic medications, the broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) – a common bacteria that causes gut and urinary tract infections ­­– researchers found that ibuprofen and paracetamol significantly increased bacterial mutations, making E. coli highly resistant to the antibiotic.

It's an important finding that has serious health implications, particularly for people in aged care homes, where multiple medications are regularly administered.

The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.

Lead researcher UniSA's Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.

""Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria,"" Assoc Prof Venter says.

""This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications – not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure – making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.

""In this study we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut or urinary tract infections.

""When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.

""We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.""

The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery) , temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).

Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.

Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore.

This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications – particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.

This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics – and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.""

Rietie Venter, UniSA's Associate Professor 

The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.

People with schizophrenia are more likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting a possible syndemic relationship between the two diseases, in addition to people not seeking appropriate medical care. A new article examining the link between COPD and schizophrenia appears in the July 2025 issue of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases: Journal of the COPD Foundation, a peer-reviewed, open access journal.

COPD encompasses conditions including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. It is caused by irritants like smoke or pollution, and even genetics. There are an estimated 30 million Americans effected by COPD, yet only half of those people know they have the disease.

Studies have shown that people with schizophrenia have higher rates of tobacco smoking, leading to an increased risk of developing COPD. However, there is a higher prevalence of COPD in people with schizophrenia after adjusting for smoking, suggesting that the link may also be syndemic-the result of shared socioeconomic, genetic, and environmental risk factors.

People with schizophrenia are less likely to receive adequate general medical care, leading to an under-diagnosis of COPD. COPD symptoms are often viewed as psychosomatic in people with schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that some antipsychotic medications impact respiratory health, including an increased risk of pneumonia.

People with schizophrenia are less likely to use primary and preventative services or seek help for medical concerns. They also tend to prioritize mental health issues over physical illnesses. We need to ensure primary care providers are aware that people with schizophrenia are at higher risk of developing COPD. Patients should have regular physical health checks, and those with schizophrenia and COPD should be offered comprehensive care. Developing integrated care services and avoiding stigma could make a significant difference to outcomes, including survival, in this disadvantaged group of patients.""

While healthy diets show links to better brain aging, researchers caution against overhyping “brain foods” and argue for combined approaches that target multiple lifestyle factors.



Review: Dietary Patterns and Brain Aging: Enthusiasm Before Evidence? Image Credit: Elena Eryomenko  / Shutterstock

Measuring brain aging is surprisingly tricky: Research faces challenges like inconsistent cognitive tests across studies, unknown reliability of these tests for detecting meaningful change, and relying on dietary intake measured only once, often late in life.

In a recent study published in the Annual Review of Nutrition, researchers examined the role of dietary patterns in brain aging and questioned whether current enthusiasm is supported by strong evidence.

The global population is aging at an unprecedented rate. As the population ages, chronic disease prevalence has increased, which mounts a substantial burden on healthcare systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines healthy aging as the process of developing and maintaining functional ability that allows well-being in older age. Functional ability includes physical and mental capacities, highlighting the importance of healthy brain aging.

Non-pathological or healthy brain aging leads to non-disabling declines in function, which is distinct from neurodegenerative disorders that occur due to pathological brain aging. Diet quality is one of the determinants of healthy aging, with the public already believing that dietary strategies will delay the onset and decrease the risk of dementia and brain aging.

Consumer surveys in the US suggest that more than half of adults view diet as key to maintaining brain health, although scientific evidence remains mixed. As such, the present study analyzed available evidence on the role of dietary patterns in brain aging, while cautioning that enthusiasm often outpaces the strength of evidence.

Early-life education builds cognitive foundations: The level of education achieved during brain development strongly influences synaptic pruning, shaping the baseline cognitive function from which age-related changes are measured.

Diet quality is deemed a crucial modifiable risk factor for the risk of chronic diseases and promotion of healthy aging. An overall healthy diet is critical in brain development and aging.

Various studies in worms, rodents, and yeasts indicate a role of calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting in health and lifespan. Studies in rodents report that long-term CR could affect the trajectory of brain aging.

While unhealthy dietary patterns can lead to gut dysbiosis, CR and fasting are believed to create favorable effects on the gut microbiota composition. The resultant favorable effects lead to an increased autophagy, ketosis, DNA repair, mitochondrial function, and insulin sensitivity, which reduce microglial inflammation. However, the review stresses that there is little current evidence in humans to support or refute these effects, and most studies are too short or small to draw firm conclusions.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are considered modifiable risk factors for dementia. Data suggest that human obesity, especially in the middle ages, increases dementia risk, although the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

Evidence from animal studies indicates that elevated neuronal senescence and neuroinflammation occur after the consumption of a hypercaloric diet. A central feature of T2D is insulin resistance (IR), with reports suggesting that the brain can also develop IR.

The brain's 'pruning' process matters: Synaptic pruning, where unnecessary neural connections are eliminated, is significantly influenced by external factors like education during youth, impacting lifelong cognitive capacity.

Brain IR can occur in people with dementia, even without concurrent T2D. It presents as an impaired ability to regulate metabolism in peripheral tissues or the brain and could lead to impaired cognition, neurodegeneration, and neuropathology. However, it remains unclear whether T2D and dementia are mechanistically related. Individual food components and nutrients have long been identified with decreased risk of cognitive decline and delay in dementia progression.

Growing evidence suggests that a low vitamin D or K status may have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Vitamin D is abundant in fatty fish and fortified foods, while vitamin K is mainly found in green leafy vegetables.

The review emphasizes, however, that evidence for individual nutrients is inconsistent and insufficient for public health recommendations. In line with this, the WHO advises against supplementation with B vitamins, vitamin E, or omega-3 fatty acids for dementia prevention.

Polyphenols are a group of phytochemicals in plant foods, with observational studies linking flavonoid-rich diets to a lower ADRD risk. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of polyphenols include the ability to reduce inflammation, scavenge radicals, and modulate autophagy, cellular signaling, gene expression, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity. The authors caution that these mechanisms remain largely speculative.

Dementia risk isn't set in stone: Up to 40% of dementia risk globally may stem from modifiable factors identified by the Lancet Commission, ranging from early-life education to mid-life hypertension and later-life social isolation.

The review highlights the concept of cognitive resilience, the ability to resist, adapt to, or cope with brain pathology, as an important lens through which diet may influence brain aging. A healthy diet may help enhance both resistance to pathology and resilience in its presence.

Evidence from the three most comprehensive global systematic reviews highlights a lower risk of age-related neurodegenerative disease associated with a healthy dietary pattern intake during adulthood. The healthy dietary pattern reflects increased intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, unsaturated vegetable oils or fats, fish, and seafood, and lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meat.

A secondary analysis of the 5-year PREDIMED trial of older adults at high cardiovascular risk found that those following the Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts or extra virgin olive oil had better cognitive function than controls (who received advice on following a low-fat diet). Moreover, the incidence of mild cognitive impairment was not different between intervention groups, with no cases of dementia observed during the follow-up.

However, a recent randomized controlled trial did not find beneficial effects of the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for the neurodegenerative delay (MIND) diet, with respect to brain volumes or cognitive performance in adults aged ≥65 years with overweight/obesity, a family history of dementia, and no baseline cognitive impairment. This has led to substantial speculation, given the popularity of the MIND diet. It is plausible that this diet might not directly affect brain aging within the three years in the studied population.

Some researchers also noted that dietary improvements in the control group, aimed at weight loss, may have obscured potential effects of the intervention.

The review also highlights broader research limitations, including heterogeneous cognitive tests across studies, reliance on dietary intake measured at a single time point, and difficulties in detecting dietary effects in cognitively healthy populations.

Taken together, evidence suggests that any dietary pattern comprising higher intake of vegetables, fish/seafood, nuts, fruits, and unsaturated vegetable oils or fats, and lower intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and processed and red meat is associated with a lower risk of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the biological mechanisms of these protective cognitive effects remain unknown.

The authors emphasize that diet alone is unlikely to achieve clinically meaningful reductions in dementia risk and that multidomain interventions, combining diet with exercise, cognitive training, and cardiovascular risk management, may be more effective.

Emerging metabolomics research may help identify diet-related biomarkers linked to dementia risk, but this field remains in its infancy.

New research reveals how probiotic supplementation helps fragile preterm babies build healthier gut microbiomes and lowers the spread of dangerous, drug-resistant bacteria in neonatal intensive care units.

Study: Impact of early life antibiotic and probiotic treatment on gut microbiome and resistome of very-low-birth-weight preterm infants. Image credit: Iryna Inshyna/Shutterstock.com

A new study published in Nature Communications highlights the significance of probiotic supplementation in shaping early-life gut microbiota and restricting multidrug-resistant pathogen load in preterm infants with very-low birth weight.  

Preterm birth is defined as gestation of less than 37 weeks. More than 10% of infants are born prematurely worldwide each year. Over 1% are born with very low birth weight (below 1500 grams). These infants are at higher risk of developing severe, often life-threatening, infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to underdeveloped immune systems.   

Preterm infants are routinely administered broad-spectrum antibiotics, typically benzylpenicillin and gentamicin or derivatives, in their early life to avoid adverse outcomes associated with severe infection. However, this early-life exposure to antibiotics potentially impairs gut microbiota development and triggers the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes.

Antibiotic resistance genes in the neonatal gut bacterial communities can rapidly spread to other bacteria or other microbial species through horizontal gene transfer. Multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Escherichia, are frequently detected in the preterm infant gut, and their presence is associated with prolonged hospitalization, late-onset blood infections, and secondary infections acquired from hospitals.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended probiotic supplementation specifically for very preterm (<32 weeks), human-milk-fed infants to counteract the consequences of broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Probiotics are live microorganisms in food intended to provide beneficial bacteria and restore microbial balance in the gut.

In the current study, researchers investigated the effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes in two groups of breastmilk-fed preterm infants with very-low birth weight.

The study included 34 preterm infants who were divided into two groups. One group received probiotic supplementation (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus); the other did not. Within each group, some infants received empirical antibiotic treatment with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, and the other served as controls with no antibiotic exposure.

Fecal samples collected from the infants during the first three weeks of life were analyzed to characterize gut microbiota. The researchers also reconstructed over 300 bacterial genomes and conducted an ex vivo neonatal gut model experiment to directly test plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes in Enterococcus.

The study found significant differences in gut microbiota diversity and composition between probiotic-supplemented and non-supplemented infants. Specifically, the comparative analysis revealed a high abundance of Bifidobacterium and a lower abundance of microorganisms with pathogenic potential in the guts of probiotic-supplemented infants.

Bifidobacterium is the major component of the probiotic formulation provided to infants. It was found to restore early-life infant gut microbiota by breaking down complex carbohydrates, including breastmilk oligosaccharides. Other Bifidobacterium species, such as B. breve and B. longum, which are typically associated with healthy term infants, appeared earlier and were more abundant in supplemented infants.

On the other hand, the gut microbiota of non-supplemented infants showed higher abundance of microorganisms with pathogenic potential, including Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus.

Notably, the study found the persistent presence of frequently multidrug-resistant pathogens with high horizontal gene transfer potential, like Enterococcus, in both groups of infants, highlighting the need for continued surveillance. Strain-level analysis further showed the circulation of identical Enterococcus and Escherichia coli strains among unrelated infants in the same hospitals, highlighting the role of nosocomial transmission.

The analysis of gut microbiota of infants treated with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin revealed a significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in non-supplemented infants during the first three weeks of life, indicating a potential role of probiotics in suppressing antimicrobial resistance in the preterm gut.

The study found that a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium is associated with lower antibiotic resistance genes, justifying the observed benefits of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants. In contrast, a higher abundance of Enterococcus and Staphylococcus was associated with higher antibiotic resistance genes.

The study identified ten antibiotic resistance gene classes, with Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Staphylococcus identified as the most resistant pathogens. Although differences at the strain level were often trends rather than statistically significant, a reduction in multidrug-resistant strains of Escherichia and Klebsiella was observed in the probiotic group.

The researchers also detected the colistin-resistance gene mcr-9.1 in a preterm infant sample predating its discovery in 2019, highlighting hidden reservoirs of last-resort antibiotic resistance genes in the neonatal gut.

The study demonstrates that probiotic supplementation with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus in preterm infants is beneficial in terms of increasing the abundance of commensal bacteria in the gut, reducing the abundance of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and reducing overall antibiotic resistance gene carriage.

The study reveals that short-term antibiotic therapy in early life did not show major effects on gut microbiota diversity within the three-week sampling window. Longer-term impacts were not assessed. However, such treatment can significantly increase the abundance of multidrug-resistant microorganisms with horizontal gene transfer potential, including Enterococcus. The ex vivo plasmid transfer experiment confirmed that Enterococcus can pass resistance plasmids between strains within a simulated infant gut environment.  

The observed abundance of Bifidobacterium in probiotic-supplemented preterm infants seems to have a protective effect by reducing the abundance of Enterococcus. This protective effect may be associated with Bifidobacterium-mediated depletion of carbon sources, which prevents the colonization and growth of microorganisms with pathogenic potential.

However, the persistence of bacterial species like Enterococcus in probiotic-supplemented and non-supplemented infants highlights the need for continued surveillance and targeted intervention strategies in neonatal intensive care units to reduce the risk of multidrug-resistant bacterial infection. The study also showed distinct functional pathways in supplemented infants, such as sucrose degradation and enhanced use of breastmilk oligosaccharides, supporting restoration of a more typical infant gut ecosystem.

ATLANTA & ST. LOUIS (August 26, 2025) – The U.S. Soccer Federation and Purina are teaming up to honor the furry teammates who bring joy, energy, and unconditional support to fans and players alike. Announced today, Purina becomes U.S. Soccer's first-ever Official Pet Care Partner, marking a signature national sports partnership for the pet care leader and a bold celebration of the powerful bond between pets and the beautiful game.

The partnership, which runs through 2030, comes at a pivotal moment for the sport, as the U.S. prepares to host some of the world's most iconic soccer events, including the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. With global attention turning to soccer in the U.S., Purina and U.S. Soccer are celebrating the shared values at the heart of both fandom and pet ownership – support, joy, and community. Together, they'll spotlight the many ways pets enrich the lives of players, fans, and families during this defining era for the sport.

“Soccer is more than just a game, it's a shared experience that connects players, fans, families, and, for me personally, the two dogs who are part of my own family,” said David Wright, Chief Commercial Officer of U.S. Soccer. “As a huge pet lover, I know firsthand the joy and connection pets bring to our lives. This partnership reflects U.S. Soccer's commitment to building community, inspiring connection, and growing the game in unexpected and inclusive ways. Purina shares our values and brings a fresh, joyful perspective to how we engage fans and their pets, especially the four-legged ones, across the country.”

The partnership includes exclusive rights for Purina across a wide range of categories, including pet food, treats, supplements, litter, connected pet products, and pet adoption initiatives. Fans can expect a national creative campaign that celebrates the human-pet bond, custom player-and-pet content, on-site adoption events, co-branded merchandise, retail promotions and pet-forward experiences from brands across the Purina pet care portfolio. Additionally, Purina and U.S. Soccer will work together to concept and create a permanent pet presence as part of the Federation's new Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center in metro Atlanta.

“Together with U.S. Soccer, we will celebrate the amazing role pets play as our teammates and in supporting the mental and physical wellbeing of fans and players alike,” said Andrea Faccio, President and Chief Growth Officer of Purina. “This partnership is the newest way that Purina is combining our shared love of pets and sports with soccer fans across the country and around the world.”

Purina's presence as the Official Pet Care Partner of U.S. Soccer will quickly come to life as the U.S. Men's National Team resumes its preparations for international competition. During an international friendly against Korea on September 6, Purina will bring its Purina Club concept, an in-stadium, pet-friendly experience for soccer fans and their dogs, to Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey. The following Tuesday, Purina's Incredible Dog Team will perform during halftime of the Men's Team's international friendly versus Japan in Columbus, Ohio.

As U.S. Soccer stands on the threshold of one of the most exciting periods in its history, this partnership with Purina adds a unique and joyful dimension to the journey ahead. Together, they'll celebrate the role pets play in uniting soccer families, from pre-game traditions to post-match celebrations, and elevate the moments that connect fans, players, and their four-legged companions during this transformative era for the sport.

World Sevens Football announces United States edition

Will play tournament in Florida from December 5-7

Seven-a-side format includes $5 million prize

 

Women's Sevens football has lined up its second edition, and will come to the United States in December, the competition organizers announced Tuesday.

The next edition will take place Dec. 5-7, 2025, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at Beyond Bancard Field - home of USL Super League side Fort Lauderdale United FC.

The first iteration of the seven a side tournament was held in Portugal in May, and drew a series of high-profile clubs from across the world. Bayern Munich were crowned champions. The competition offers a $5M total prize pot, with $2M going to the winners, and the rest shared among the participating clubs based on performance.

This edition will be ""bigger and better"" than the original tournament, organizers promised. The inaugural competition featured eight European clubs, all of which sent some of their best talents to participate in the two day event.

There is no confirmation yet on which teams will play, and clubs from outside of Europe have been considered as potential participants. Former USWNT stars Tobin Heath and Kelley O'Hara are among those involved in the planning of the competition after a successful first iteration.

Adrian Jacob, head of W7s and former executive for Chelsea FC women, promised that the second version of the tournament will only improve on the first.

""We thought it was really successful,"" he said. This one is going to be bigger and better. We're going to take what we did from the last one, we're going to bring it to the Americas. And we are really, really excited.""

Jacob also pointed out that the United States was the logical next step for the tournament, saying ""We want to reach all different corners of the world with World Sevens. Once we had one in Europe, it was always going to be in North America, or Central America, or in the Americas, with all the different clubs there.

""You know, football isn't concentrated on Europe. The fan base is everywhere, and the way we can elevate the game is globally. There's so much we can do. And obviously, with everything that's going on in the States, in the Americas, women's football is growing hugely, absolutely everywhere.""

O'Hara, who registered 160 caps for the USWNT, pointed out that the differentiation of the tournament could be key in its success.

""We want a place where players can enjoy themselves, have fun, but we want it to be good football. We want it to be competitive,"" she said. ""So that went into the thinking of the clubs that we brought in and how we set it up. Obviously there's a very big prize purse on the line, and that contributes to players taking it seriously and wanting to win.

""And the reality is, you have top link teams and clubs from around the world like that's bragging rights. People are going in and they're having a good time. They're enjoying themselves. They're, you know, a little bit looser ahead of the games.""

The tournament will take place in December, with participating teams expected to be announced in the coming months.","{'href': 'https://au.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'au.sports.yahoo.com'}","soccer"

Friendlies By USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino","https://www.rsl.com/news/real-salt-lake-star-diego-luna-amongst-23-players-selected-for-u-s-a-friendlies-by-usmnt-head-coach-mauricio-pochettino","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:22:35 GMT","



East Coast Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualified Nations Korea Republic on Sept. 6 in New Jersey and Sept. 9 in Ohio; CONCACAF Gold Cup Best XI Man Luna Returns to RSL Ahead of Next MLS Match

ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Tuesday, August 26, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 23 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sat., Sept. 6 and Tues., Sept. 9 against World Cup-bound opponents Korea Republic and Japan. A total of 22 players have been rostered, with one addition to be confirmed. Players will begin reporting to New Jersey on Aug. 31.

“We continue to strengthen the squad and narrow in on the pool of players who can help us achieve our goals at the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said Pochettino. “We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall.”

Real Salt Lake (9-14-4, 31 points, 10th West / 20th Shield) will host a “mini-preseason” the next few weeks, with four of its next five matches to be played at home beginning with a Sporting Kansas City visit to America First Field in Sandy on Sat., Sept. 13. This weekend's originally scheduled road trip to Seattle has been moved to Sat., Oct. 11, due to the Sounders' advancement in Leagues Cup.

The USA will first host Korea Republic, presented by Haleon, on Sept. 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J. Kickoff from the home of the New York Red Bulls is set for 3:00 p.m. MT, with the match broadcast live on TNT and Telemundo, and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock.

USA-Japan, presented by Allstate, comes nearly 25 years after the USMNT's first visit to Columbus, Ohio and what has become a special place in U.S. Soccer history. Lower.com Field and the USMNT welcome the 15th-ranked Japanese side on Sept. 9, with the match kicking off at 5:30 p.m. MT and available on TNT, Max, Universo, and Peacock.

Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary from on-site for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. Fans can follow the USMNT on X (@USMNT, Instagram (@USMNT, Facebook and the official U.S. Soccer App.

Luna – RSL's leading 2025 scorer with eight goals and five assists this season, equaling his goal output from last year in half as many MLS matches – is one of 12 players on the friendly roster returning from the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup runner-up U.S. roster. Luna is one of two players –joining defender Chris Richards – who were named to that tournament's Best XI. Richards started all six matches and scored two goals, while Luna tallied three goals and two assists and earned Man of the Match honors after scoring twice in the semifinal win against Guatemala.

Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica. During the CONCACAF Nations League consolation match, Luna was bright and assertive against Canada, as the 2024 MLS All-Star selection and reigning MLS Young Player of the Year continues to press for 2026 FIFA World Cup inclusion.

DETAILED ROSTER BY POSITION (Club/Country; Caps/Goals)

GOALKEEPERS (3): Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati; 0/0), Matt Freese (New York City FC; 7/0), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena/ITA; 0/0)

OTHER NOTES:

CP THE CAPWINNER

Christian Pulisic leads all players on the roster with a total of 78 appearances. Tim Ream (74) and Tyler Adams (50) round out the 50 and over club with Tim Weah having 44 under his belt. SergiñoDest will be looking to add to his 33-cap total – more below - while Luca de la Torre and Chris Richards each reached 31 caps during this summer's second-place finish at the Gold Cup.

MOVING ON UP

After two years at Juventus in Italy's Serie A, forward Tim Weah is back to France and Champions League football. The 25-year-old transferred to Olympique de Marseille in Ligue 1, completing his tenure at Juventus with seven goals in 78 appearances. Marseille finished second in Ligue 1 last year behind Champions League winners PSG.

Weah follows in the footsteps of his father, George, who also played for Marseille during his career.

DOWNS AND UP

Damion Downs' Southampton will be looking to make a quick return to the English Premier League after being relegated at the end of last season. For now, they will compete in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football.

After contributing 15 goals + assists to lead the second-tier German side FC Köln to a division title and promotion to the Bundesliga, Downs will look to do the same for Southampton. He was part of the Gold Cup roster for the United States and delivered the game-sealing penalty kick against Costa Rica in Minneapolis that sent the U.S. through to the semifinals.

SERG-ING

Sergiño Dest is poised to make his first appearances for the USMNT since helping the USA claim the Concacaf Nations League title in March 2024. After recovering from a ruptured ACL, Dest joined the camp this past summer, but the timing proved a bit too early for his return to game action during the Gold Cup. The PSV defender has started the Eredivisie campaign strongly, posting two goals and an assist in four matches including the game-winner in the Dutch Super Cup.

HOME BOYS

The stadiums in Harrison and Columbus will feel like home to a host of the U.S. players on this roster. Tim Ream was drafted 18th overall by the New York Red Bulls in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft and was a finalist for Rookie of the Year that season. Tyler Adams had a well-documented rise through the Red Bull Academy all the way to the First Team. Tim Weah spent a year in the same academy before beginning his European adventure at PSG.

Meantime, Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki currently lace them up for the Columbus Crew. The pair were members of the 2023 MLS Cup winning side hosted at Lower.com Field, the site of the tilt on Sept. 9 against Japan. In addition to making his USMNT debut in 2025, Arfsten was selected to this year's MLS All-Star Team.

FIRST TIME IN ‘25

Several players will join the USMNT fold for the first time in 2025. Alex Zendejas appeared in each of the first four matches during Mauricio Pochettino's tenure last fall. The 27-year-old had 12 goals in 48 matches across all competitions for Club América last season.

The MLS duo of Roman Celentano and Sean Zawadzki took part in the 2024 January Camp with Zawadzki earning his first appearance on Jan. 20 against Slovenia. Tristan Blackmon gets his first crack since January of 2022.

Meantime, goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann gets another look for the senior MNT for the first time since 2018. Now with Cesena in Serie B in Italy, he won the Golden Glove during the 2017 U-20 Concacaf Gold Cup winning run and appeared in all five matches in the FIFA U-20 World Cup that same year.

CARPE DIEM

Four players are looking to seize the opportunity to earn their first cap for the senior National Team. While Blackmon, Celentano and Klinsmann are getting a return gig, 18-year-old defender NoahkaiBanks makes his debut in a USMNT camp. A dual national of the United States and Germany, the FC Augsburg defender has appeared at the Youth National Team level for the U-17, U-19 and U-20 Men's National Teams.

ROSTER NOTES

• The roster will have an average age of 25 years, 175 days, as of the first day of training on Sept. 1. The squad also averages 20 caps.

• Twelve players return from the squad that earned a runner-up finish at the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup.

• Twelve players represent 10 different MLS clubs. Columbus Crew and Vancouver Whitecaps contribute a pair of players to the cause, followed by Charlotte FC, FC Cincinnati, Houston Dynamo, New York City FC, Orlando City, Philadelphia Union, Real Salt Lake and San Diego FC.

• Ten players are based outside of MLS: England (4), Italy (2), France (1) Germany (1), Mexico (1) and Netherlands (1).

• Forward Alejandro Zendejas earns his first camp call-up of 2025. The Club America attacker was last summoned in November 2024 and came off the bench in both Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal legs against Jamaica.

• Having begun their professional careers as members of the New York Red Bulls in midfielder Tyler Adams (2015-2019) and defender Tim Ream (2010 will return to Sports Illustrated Stadium on Sept. 6 against Korea Republic. Tim Weah also spent a year in the Red Bull Academy before beginning his European adventure at PSG.

• The Columbus Crew duo of Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki will have the chance to represent the USMNT in their home club stadium on Sept. 9 against Japan.

• Striker Josh Sargent has bagged four goals in as many matches across all competitions to start the new season for EFL Championship side Norwich City.

• Eighteen-year-old defender Noahkai Banks earns his first USMNT call-up

• Banks is one of four uncapped players on the roster with the other three having previously earned call-ups: defender Tristan Blackmon (last call-up in January 2022), and goalkeepers Roman Celentano (January 2024) and Jonathan Klinsmann (November 2018).

• With nine shutouts so far this year, goalkeeper Roman Celentano is tied for second in MLS. Matt Freese follows close behind with seven clean sheets for New York City FC.

• Seventeen players on this roster took part in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, with 12 coming through the MLS Academy ranks: Tyler Adams (New York Red Bulls), Max Arfsten (Cal Odyssey), Sebastian Berhalter (Columbus Crew), Roman Celentano (Chicago Sockers), Luca de la Torre (Nomads, San Diego Surf), Alex Freeman (Weston FC, Orlando City), Matt Freese (Philadelphia Union), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union, Clearwater Chargers), Jonathan Klinsmann (Pateadores, Strikers FC), Diego Luna (San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona Residency), Jack McGlynn (BW Gottschee, Philadelphia Union), Christian Pulisic (PA Classics), Chris Richards (FC Dallas), Josh Sargent (St. Louis Scott Gallagher), Tim Weah (BW Gottschee, New York Red Bulls), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew), Alejandro Zendejas (FC Dallas).","{'href': 'https://www.rsl.com', 'title': 'Real Salt Lake'}","soccer"

Pulisic will be back with the US after asking out of summer games

22 players named to roster, with a 23rd expected

Christian Pulisic will return to the US men's national team for the first time since his self-imposed absence from the team's summer slate, having been named to the team's roster for two friendlies against South Korea and Japan in the upcoming international window. However, in a surprise move, Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was not named among head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad.

Pochettino named 22 players for the friendlies, with US Soccer adding that a 23rd player is expected to be rostered at a later time. The federation did not elaborate as to whether this player could be McKennie, a US regular who came on as a sub for Juventus over the weekend, or some other player.

The roster is also notable for a few other absences. Goalkeeper Matt Turner, who made an offseason loan move back to MLS in search of regular playing time, misses out, as will strikers Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, and Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman, and defender Antonee Robinson, all of whom are either injured or returning to action after time on the sideline.

Some players, though, will be celebrating a return. That includes Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who has been on fire to start the season, scoring in all four matches he's played in all competitions for the Canaries. Sergiño Dest also makes his return to the US team after recovering fully from last season's ACL tear. Tim Weah is back in the fold as well after Club World Cup duties kept him from participating in the Gold Cup.

The squad is also notable for the holdovers from that Gold Cup squad: 12 in total, including goalkeeper Matt Freese, defenders Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten, and Nathan Harriel, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Damion Downs.

There are also a couple of surprise inclusions: 18-year-old center back Noahkai Banks, the Hawaii-born German-American who made his Bundesliga debut earlier this year with Augsburg, and goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, the son of former US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann.

The US play South Korea at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, New Jersey on 6 September at 5pm ET. They then travel to Columbus to take on Japan at Lower.com Field on 9 September at 7.30pm ET.

Here's the full squad, with breakdowns for each position:

Roman Celentano (FC Cincinnati), Matt Freese (New York City FC), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena)

Klinsmann's inclusion, and Turner's exclusion, is one of the bigger surprises on the roster. Klinsmann may still be most notable to many US fans for his jab at Landon Donovan on social media after his exclusion from the 2014 World Cup squad – an incident that occurred when he was 17. He has struggled for regular playing time for most of his professional career but has found it in Serie B, where he's been a starter for Cesena since midway through last season.

All in all, this competition is fairly open, though Freese should have the upper hand after starting for the US through the Gold Cup. Celentano will be looking for his first cap with the US, having only appeared in training camps before.

Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Noahkai Banks (FC Augsburg), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace)

There are some regulars in this group one would think could easily start at the 2026 World Cup (Richards, Ream and Dest), but the rest are all players looking to secure a spot on next year's roster. Tristan Blackmon, 29, has been rewarded after years of solid center-back play for the Vancouver Whitecaps. Banks is an intriguing prospect who has made appearances for the US youth teams. Arfsten will have the inside track to start at left back with Dest, Freeman and Harriel all being more natural on the right.

Tyler Adams (Bournemouth), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew)

Tyler Adams will lead this young group after doing the same at the Gold Cup over the summer, but the bigger news may be about who is not here. McKennie misses out, as does Milan's Yunus Musah, Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson, and Atlético Madrid's Johnny Cardoso, with the latter two having been on the 2025 Gold Cup roster. Sean Zawadzki returns to the team after being part of the team's pre-Gold Cup camp.

Damion Downs (Southampton), Christian Pulisic (Milan) Josh Sargent (Norwich), Tim Weah (Marseille), Alex Zendejas (Club América)

Pulisic's return is notable if only because of how his past absence kicked off a war of words through the media between him and USMNT pundits and past stars of the team. He'll have a point to prove in this camp, where he'll be joined by the red-hot Sargent and Weah, who moved from Juventus to Olympique Marseille over the summer. Southampton's Damion Downs was a surprise inclusion on the 2025 Gold Cup roster and he returns here, with injuries impacting the availability of numerous other options as detailed above. Winger Alex Zendejas returns to the team for the first time in 2025 after impressing with Mexican giants Club América.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Christian Pulisic is back with the U.S. men's national team after skipping this summer's Gold Cup. But there was no place for Pulisic's fellow 2022 World Cup starters Weston McKennie and Matt Turner as USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino named his 23-player roster for the Americans' September friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan.

Pulisic is among a number of regulars who missed the continental championship in June and July, when the Americans lost the final to chief rival Mexico. Also returning are 2022 veterans Tim Weah, Sergino Dest and Josh Sargent, who will get another chance to compete for the No. 1 striker job with Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang still recovering from hernia surgery and Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi having just returned from serious injuries of their own.

Sargent has started the new campaign in fine form, scoring in each of English second tier club Norwich City's first four games.

Like Balogun and Pepi, Fulham left-back Antonee ""Jedi"" Robinson will also remain with his club during the international break, having just seen his first Premier League action of the season on Sunday. So will Malik Tillman, who has yet to debut for new team Bayer Leverkusen because of a calf problem.

McKennie played only the final minutes of Italian titans Juventus's Serie A opener last weekend. He was unavailable for international duty earlier in the summer because of Juve's participation at the FIFA Club World Cup.

Turner recently returned to the New England Revolution after three seasons in the Premier League with Arsenal, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace. 

McKennie and Turner aren't the only  interesting omissions. Central midfielders Aidan Morris and Tanner Tessmann were also left out despite starting the 2025-26 European campaign strong for Middlesbrough and Lyon, respectively. 

So was Johnny Cardoso, who joined Spanish power Atlético Madrid for $35 million last month. Cardoso has started each of Atléti's first two La Liga matches. 

Gold Cup depth center backs Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman were passed over in favor of Hawaii-born Noahkai Banks, an 18-year-old who made eight Bundesliga appearances last season for Augsburg, and Vancouver Whitecaps journeyman Tristan Blackmon, 29.

""We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall,"" Pochettino said in a statement. ""We continue to strengthen the squad and narrow in on the pool of players who can help us achieve our goals at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.""

With just four more international windows remaining before Pochettino names the USMNT's 26-player squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil, the September camp represents one of the former Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain manager's last chances to look at players he hasn't seen yet. Banks and Blackmon are among four uncapped players on the roster. The others are keepers Roman Celentano and Jonathan Klinsmann, son of former U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann.

The full September roster is as follows:

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano, FC Cincinnati (MLS); Matt Freese, NYCFC (MLS); Jonathan Klinsmann, Cesena (Italy) 

Defenders: Max Arfsten. Columbus Crew (MLS); Noahkai Banks, Augsburg (Germany); Tristan Blackmon, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands); Alex Freeman, Orlando City (MLS); Nathan Harriel, Philadelphia Union (MLS), Tim Ream, Charlotte FC (MLS); Chris Richards, Crystal Palace

Midfiedlers:  Tyler Adams, Bournemouth (England); Sebastian Berhalter, Vancouver Whitecaps (MLS); Luca de la Torre, San Diego (MLS); Diego Luna, Real Salt Lake (MLS); Jack McGlynn, Houston Dynamo (MLS); Sean Zawadzki, Columbus Crew (MLS) 

Forwards: Damion Downs, Southampton (England); Christian Pulisic, AC Milan; Josh Sargent, Norwich City (England); Timothy Weah, Marseille (France); Alex Zendejas, Club América (Mexico)

Yunus Musah joins ""The Football Reporters"" podcast to explain why he chose not to be a part of the USMNT's 2025 Gold Cup squad. (1:38)

United States and AC Milan midfielder Yunus Musah's target for the next year is as clear as it is ambitious.

""The nearest goals and achievement for me are winning trophies here at Milan,"" he tells ESPN. ""This season we have the possibility to win three trophies [Serie A, Coppa Italia, Italian Supercoppa]. I'd love to win all three of them. And also then go to the national team and win more trophies as well.""

So, a club treble in Italy followed by the FIFA World Cup? ""That's it!""

- U.S. World Cup countdown: Does McKennie have Juve future?
- Is Gladbach the place to revive Reyna's beleaguered career?

The likelihood of that scenario becoming reality has been tested at both club and international level this summer. As Musah sits down in his Milan home for an interview on ESPN's ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, there are two pressing issues to address. Firstly, the reason for his omission from the USMNT squad which reached last month's Concacaf Gold Cup final, losing narrowly 2-1 to Mexico. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino said Musah had ""communicated to us a personal reason, so he needed to withdraw from involvement."" What was it?

""Honestly, I was gutted that I couldn't go to the Gold Cup,"" says Musah. ""The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. I needed that time off. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team.""

It was a decision criticised by some but in an era where concerns over player welfare are often voiced but rarely acted upon, the 22-year-old took charge of his situation.

""It was a very tough decision because people could easily say 'everyone else is playing, why aren't you?' But no one else is in my body, no one else is in my head,"" Musah adds. ""Everyone that knows me knows I am honest and a hardworking guy but when times are like how they were and I couldn't carry on playing for that summer, I had to take that decision for myself.

""No one else knows how I feel and I hope that people understood my decision and it was about taking care of myself and being able to come back ultimately and be able to give my best for the rest of the season.""

Musah now looks likely to begin that task at Milan despite encountering difficulties since Massimiliano Allegri replaced Sérgio Conceição as head coach in May. The following month, Milan sporting director Igli Tare claimed Musah ""doesn't have the characteristics"" to play in Allegri's preferred three-man midfield, hinting strongly at his departure.

Napoli, Nottingham Forest and, most recently, Atlanta have all been tracking Musah but, amid reports that Allegri is more inclined to utilize him this season, remaining in Italy is clearly the player's focus.

""I am happy at Milan,"" he says. ""It is a great club. I'd love to win some great things here. It felt really nice winning the Super Cup last season so I'd love to win more things. This is what we're expected to do here. I am just happy here and I am looking to work hard and be a main player in the team.""

Musah joined Milan from Valencia in 2023, finishing second in his first season with the club. The Rossoneri beat Paris Saint-Germain at home and Newcastle United away in the UEFA Champions League, but missed out on qualification for the knockout phase on goal difference, dropping down to the Europa League where they exited at the quarterfinal stage to AS Roma. Last season was tougher, finishing eighth in Serie A but winning the Italian Supercoppa and reaching the final of the Coppa Italia, losing 1-0 to Bologna in Rome.

He has had Christian Pulisic, who arrived in the same summer two years ago, for company and the USMNT pair have become closer over time.

""We've actually bonded very well since both joining AC Milan,"" Musah says. ""Before that, we weren't so close but now I'd say we are quite close. I get to learn a lot from him every day and in the matches. He has had a great seasons here. I am just learning off him. He's a great guy so I am enjoying playing with Christian.""

Musah's positive and measured response to recent challenges is indicative of a player who has long demonstrated bravery beyond his years, right back to when he turned down a new contract at Arsenal to join Valencia in 2019 aged just 16.

""My parents weren't so keen because it wasn't like Arsenal were releasing me or anything,"" says Musah, who was born in New York City to Ghanaian parents before moving to Italy and then to London aged nine. ""I was making a bold decision to leave a club that still wanted me, to go to another country to gamble if I was going to make it out there or not. It was a big decision but I felt really good about it because I felt confident that I was at the level and I was capable of getting into the first team like I hoped.

""There were a few hard things in that process, like convincing my parents and then settling in at Valencia, settling in with the language, the style of play, new people, new surroundings. But ultimately, with hard work, patience and lots of prayer and everything, things turned out well.""

His Muslim faith is extremely important to him.

""When you go through good moments, you thank God and when you go through bad moments you thank God as well because I think everything happens for a reason,"" he says. ""When tough things happen to me, I might dwell on them for a minutes but afterwards I understand there is a bigger purpose. I don't take anything to heart, I don't take anything too deeply.""

And yet, talking his parents around was not easy. ""[There were] a lot of months of just not giving up on it,"" he continues. ""There were a lot of months that I just kept on pushing it, convincing them and going on and on and on about it. Ultimately, we managed to convince them somehow. My brother [Abdul] was with me, he was on my side and we managed to convince them.""

Yunus Musah names a list of Premier League and Serie A greats who helped inspire him to become the player he is today.

Musah cites Mesut Özil and Yaya Touré as inspirations growing up watching the Premier League and remains fond of Arsenal -- friends, even, with several current players including Bukayo Saka. He reached out to in support after the England winger was racially abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy in which Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho all missed in the penalty shootout.

""I'm always rooting for them since I left until now,"" he says. ""Arsenal is really embedded in me. I always support them. I have friends that play in that team. It is nice to see my old friends doing well, doing really well actually. I am just supportive of the team that helped me get to where I am today.""

Musah simply saw a quicker route to first-team football in Spain. ""When I left Arsenal for Valencia, I told myself that if things turned out to be not great or anything, I wouldn't think 'what if I went back to Arsenal?' I would stick to the plan until it worked,"" he said.

And work it did. So much so that international teams began circling by the time he was 17 with his nomadic life to that point creating eligibility for four nations: Ghana, the U.S., England and Italy. Musah played for four England age groups up to the under-18s but first contact by the USMNT came in 2020 through assistant Nico Estévez, who had connections at Valencia after eight years working at the LaLiga club. Then Gregg Berhalter, head coach of the USMNT for five years across two spells, began his charm offensive.

""Gregg called me and that was really huge for a 17-year-old to get a call from the men's national team coach,"" Musah says. ""It was amazing. He was very nice. He was very keen to have me amongst the group and he made it feel really easy. He said there were no strings attached, I could just come to the camp, see what it's like, enjoy it and that's what I did. I never looked back.

""It was a tough decision. I had a lot of options, which is a good thing. And also I had an amazing time with the England setup. I went to so many camps, played with great players, great coaches and ultimately I started my career playing in Valencia's first team and then Gregg called me to play for the [U.S.] men's first team as a 17-year-old. It was a huge opportunity I couldn't turn down and I've been loving every minute since.""

Musah went on to play at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and would win that year's U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award. Berhalter has since been replaced -- via interim stints for B.J Callaghan and Mikey Varas -- by Pochettino, who led a run to the final of the Gold Cup earlier this summer in Musah's absence.

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

""I have a lot of love for Gregg,"" Musah says. ""So, so grateful for all the opportunities. I had most of my caps under Gregg. We have a great manager again now so I am lucky to be able to play under two great managers. Now I'm just learning under Mauricio.

""First of all, we train very hard. We work very hard in training so that we are prepared in matches to be able to play at that intensity. He is very keen on the energy we bring out on the field and how much we want it. That's something that we have to bring back in our team, the fire we bring into matches that helped us in a lot of games against the big teams.

""Sometimes it is about who wants it more. Mauricio is trying to get that fire in us and make sure when teams come to play us they have a really tough time.""

And Pochettino, formerly head coach Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, is not shying away from the expectation of the biggest tournament of all on the horizon: next year's home men's World Cup, hosted along with Mexico and Canada.

""Us as players, we go into every tournament believing we can win it,"" Musah says. ""That's the beauty of football. We are a very talented group in a tournament where there are huge players, huge teams who are probably way more expected to win the tournament.

""But we've seen it time and time again where you can say the underdog goes on and does it. We go into the tournament with that belief. I think if you go into the tournament thinking you are not going to win it is quite pointless, so we will go into the tournament thinking we can do it and give our fans, ourselves, our families, the best satisfaction we can.

""I know that non-football fans, celebrities, you name it, are going to be behind the team just because we are the U.S.. They are very proud to support anyone that's from the U.S.. We are going to have so much support, we are going to feel it and it is going to drive us to do great things, I'm sure.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Reporter

Donald Trump on Monday proudly displayed the FIFA World Cup trophy on his desk, just days after he asked if he could keep it. 

The trophy, now in a protective casing beside the Resolute Desk, was brought into the Oval Office last Friday by FIFA President Gianni Infantino for the announcement that the group stage draw for next year's event will be held in December at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 

When Trump asked if he could keep it, Infantino responded, “Well...” before Trump joked about the gold item: “We're not giving it back.”

Infantino, standing in the new-look Oval Office with all its gold trim, said: “It fits well here, I think—until we have to give it to the next winner.”

“That's fine,” Trump replied. “That's a beautiful piece of gold, I will say.”

The president pointed out the trophy on Monday while signing an executive order, but said it wasn't his favorite piece of decor in the room.

“There's your trophy for the World Cup. In fact, it's solid gold. That's actually solid gold—so heavy that some of the people in this room wouldn't be able to lift it up,” he claimed. 

“I think what I‘m going to do is place it right above the angel, right over there. That's solid gold, too,” he said. “Look at that. That's a solid gold trophy. They know how to get to me, you know? I like the angel better, to be honest with you.”

The Daily Beast has asked the White House about the arrangement and whether the president would be presenting the trophy to the winning team next July, but has not heard back.

Infantino last week also gifted to Trump the “first ticket” to the World Cup final at MetLife Stadium just outside New York City, so it seems he'll be there in some capacity.

FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Beast asking how the trophy arrangement came to be. It is also unclear how long the item will remain with the president.

The trophy has been awarded to each World Cup winner since 1974, the most recent being Argentina. The U.S. has not hosted a men's World Cup since 1994, and has never won.

Of the 16 venues for next year's contest, 11 are in the U.S., and auxiliary hosts Mexico and Canada have three and two stadiums, respectively, for games.

DALLAS — Some might call it a hot spot. 

“We own the Lucky 7 Convenience Store which is the only convenience store inside the State Fair of Texas, on the fairgrounds,” said Jonathan Maples, Maples Foundation, business partner and Lucky 7 Convenience Store owner.

With the FIFA World Cup coming to North Texas next year, Maples is betting on change. 

“We're a minority business, and we just don't want to be left out,” Maples said.

In years past, Maples and others in South Dallas said being left out is what happens. 

“It's unfortunate that, especially here in South Dallas, that the Fair doesn't feed the community enough,” Maples said.

The Pointe South Revitalization Committee met with the City of Dallas Convention and Event Services and FIFA's North Texas Organizing Committee. They said they're expecting more than 3.8 million visitors bringing in more than $1.5 billion.

“The great thing about something as large as the World Cup is that we see it as an opportunity for the entire region,” said Noelle LeVeaux, North Texas FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee Chief Marketing Officer.

How much will South Dallas businesses see?

FIFA's organizing committee said sponsors for events such as the Fan Festival at Fair Park are corporate sponsors. McDonald's is one of the main sponsors which puts restriction on other vendors. 

“It makes me very disappointed to the borderline of angry because our convenience store can't be open except during the times of the fair. That's not fair,” Maples said.

The Dallas Black Chamber of Commerce is working to help local businesses.

“It's our job as a chamber and other organizations that we partner with is to ensure that the people who look like us and are from our community get access to some of these huge opportunities that the city has,” said Harrison Blair DBCC President and CEO. “One match is like a Super Bowl. We've got nine of them. I want to make sure that we participate. We're also helping businesses on the other side to get ready to work with FIFA.”

“My message is always what other opportunities are there,"" LeVeaux said.

She encouraged business owners to apply to FIFA's private database, which will serve as a bridge connecting businesses to FIFA and its committees. 

“There will be some businesses that are doing business with some of the larger contractors and therefore, aren't able to do other business,” said LeVeaux.

She also said there will be opportunities to advertise through their app and newsletter.

“Get in the game. Make sure you have something that is soccer-related. There will be opportunities,” said LeVeaux.

Maples said he still wants to know all the sponsors and wants a chance to submit a request for proposal to operate. 

“Nobody's asking for any handout, just a level playing field,” said Maples. “I want to see FIFA be a good partner to the city of Dallas, but even a better partner to the community of South Dallas.”","{'href': 'https://www.wfaa.com', 'title': 'WFAA'}","soccer"

KANSAS CITY, Mo — We are less than a year out from the FIFA World Cup taking center stage in the Heart of America. We know, Kansas City will host six matches including two knockout games, but what can we really expect a year from now? 

Chris Donahoo lives in Kansas City and to say he's a die-hard soccer fan is understatement. 20 years ago, he and a group of 9 friends grabbed their passports and traveled to Cologne, Germany for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. 

""We traveled there, there wasn't a lot going on as far as fandom around the World Cup for Team USA, and when we were there, we were thinking the whole time, how cool would it be if there was a meeting place, or some kind of event set up for the U.S. for fans that are going, because we'd see U.S. jerseys, we'd run into U.S. fans everywhere, but there was no organization,"" recalled Donahoo. 

Donahoo says the desire to rally behind Team USA  inspired the creation of the American Outlaws — a nonprofit dedicated to organizing support for the U.S. men's, women's, and youth soccer teams. He's part of the KC chapter, and his passion for all things World Cup has even taken him as far as Brazil in 2014.

""I knew from the second I walked in the stadium that this was gonna be something that I participated in for the rest of my life,"" said Donahoo, ""I can't imagine that there's any other sporting event that rivals this. People talk about the Super Bowl, but it's just, it's nothing in comparison to that."" 

Sharing that same passion is Kurt Austin, who is the current Senior Director of Communications at Sporting KC. Austin grew up in Kansas City and also attended his first World Cup tournament in Germany while in college with friends and family. He says it was a life-changing experience that led him to attend men and women's World Cup tournaments across South Africa, Brazil, Germany, Quatar and more. 

""So many fans look forward to this every four years, and they save up for it for years to be able to go to a World Cup. They really make the most of the experience,"" explained Austin. 

Roger Espinoza, Sporting KC legend who proudly wore an Honduras jersey during the 2010 and 2014 World Cup tournaments and represented La H in the 2012 Olympics tells KSHB41, playing in the World Cup was a moment he has been working for all his life. 

""The World Cup, I think, is the pinnacle of where every soccer player wants to reach,"" said Espinoza. ""As a little kid, you just dreamed of that, and being able to get to that level in 2010 and then 2014, it just brought back all the memories, when you were young, dreaming and working hard. So it is an emotional moment, but it is also, you know, a proud moment for you, just because you work so hard and you think of your family and all the hard work your parents did for you, for you to make it to that level.""

KC 2026 estimates 650,000 fans will come to KC for the biggest sporting event in the world, which is why Donahoo's biggest piece of advice is securing a babysitter and planning to be at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, if you're lucky enough to score a ticket. 

""I'm going to take my oldest son, so I'm going to be working with a babysitter for my youngest son, so my wife and I will probably be heading out to Arrowhead very early,"" said Donahoo."" It's going be the summer, there's going be some heat, but I promise you will not regret getting out there early and taking in all the things, all the activities, talk to as many people as possible, welcome people to our city. It doesn't matter where you're from, what religion you are. None of that matters, because soccer transcends people.""

Austin says if you don't have tickets, the FIFA Fan Fest at the World War I Memorial will be a fiesta you don't want to miss. 

""You can watch all the games, you can be around all the fans, it's a free experience to participate in, so I think that's certainly one way that locals can enjoy the World Cup,"" said Austin. ""But I also think already you're seeing cities and the business community plan events to be able to embrace the visitors that are here. I think you're gonna see a huge amount of interest, and you're gonna see a lot of different activities and events available for the community to participate."" 

The final match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held on Sunday, July 19, 2026, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. But once the tournament is over both players and fans believe KC will be triumphant in winning the hearts of all that came to visit. 

""I have no doubt that it will be a very loud stadium, fans traveling, but you know, every country has its unique way, and I think that any country that Kansas City hosts is going to be  a special moment and the United States being a country of immigrants, I don't think any team will have a problem having fans,"" said Espinoza.

Musah's positive and measured response to recent challenges is indicative of a player who has long demonstrated bravery beyond his years, right back to when he turned down a new contract at Arsenal to join Valencia in 2019 aged just 16.

""My parents weren't so keen because it wasn't like Arsenal were releasing me or anything,"" says Musah, who was born in New York City to Ghanaian parents before moving to Italy and then to London aged nine. ""I was making a bold decision to leave a club that still wanted me, to go to another country to gamble if I was going to make it out there or not. It was a big decision but I felt really good about it because I felt confident that I was at the level and I was capable of getting into the first team like I hoped.

""There were a few hard things in that process, like convincing my parents and then settling in at Valencia, settling in with the language, the style of play, new people, new surroundings. But ultimately, with hard work, patience and lots of prayer and everything, things turned out well.""

His Muslim faith is extremely important to him.

""When you go through good moments, you thank God and when you go through bad moments you thank God as well because I think everything happens for a reason,"" he says. ""When tough things happen to me, I might dwell on them for a minutes but afterwards I understand there is a bigger purpose. I don't take anything to heart, I don't take anything too deeply.""

And yet, talking his parents around was not easy. ""[There were] a lot of months of just not giving up on it,"" he continues. ""There were a lot of months that I just kept on pushing it, convincing them and going on and on and on about it. Ultimately, we managed to convince them somehow. My brother [Abdul] was with me, he was on my side and we managed to convince them.""

Yunus Musah names a list of Premier League and Serie A greats who helped inspire him to become the player he is today.

Musah cites Mesut Özil and Yaya Touré as inspirations growing up watching the Premier League and remains fond of Arsenal -- friends, even, with several current players including Bukayo Saka. He reached out to in support after the England winger was racially abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy in which Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho all missed in the penalty shootout.

""I'm always rooting for them since I left until now,"" he says. ""Arsenal is really embedded in me. I always support them. I have friends that play in that team. It is nice to see my old friends doing well, doing really well actually. I am just supportive of the team that helped me get to where I am today.""

Musah simply saw a quicker route to first-team football in Spain. ""When I left Arsenal for Valencia, I told myself that if things turned out to be not great or anything, I wouldn't think 'what if I went back to Arsenal?' I would stick to the plan until it worked,"" he said.

And work it did. So much so that international teams began circling by the time he was 17 with his nomadic life to that point creating eligibility for four nations: Ghana, the U.S., England and Italy. Musah played for four England age groups up to the under-18s but first contact by the USMNT came in 2020 through assistant Nico Estévez, who had connections at Valencia after eight years working at the LaLiga club. Then Gregg Berhalter, head coach of the USMNT for five years across two spells, began his charm offensive.

""Gregg called me and that was really huge for a 17-year-old to get a call from the men's national team coach,"" Musah says. ""It was amazing. He was very nice. He was very keen to have me amongst the group and he made it feel really easy. He said there were no strings attached, I could just come to the camp, see what it's like, enjoy it and that's what I did. I never looked back.

""It was a tough decision. I had a lot of options, which is a good thing. And also I had an amazing time with the England setup. I went to so many camps, played with great players, great coaches and ultimately I started my career playing in Valencia's first team and then Gregg called me to play for the [U.S.] men's first team as a 17-year-old. It was a huge opportunity I couldn't turn down and I've been loving every minute since.""

Musah went on to play at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and would win that year's U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award. Berhalter has since been replaced -- via interim stints for B.J Callaghan and Mikey Varas -- by Pochettino, who led a run to the final of the Gold Cup earlier this summer in Musah's absence.

Yunus Musah explains what Mauricio Pochettino has brought to the USMNT since taking the head coach job.

""I have a lot of love for Gregg,"" Musah says. ""So, so grateful for all the opportunities. I had most of my caps under Gregg. We have a great manager again now so I am lucky to be able to play under two great managers. Now I'm just learning under Mauricio.

""First of all, we train very hard. We work very hard in training so that we are prepared in matches to be able to play at that intensity. He is very keen on the energy we bring out on the field and how much we want it. That's something that we have to bring back in our team, the fire we bring into matches that helped us in a lot of games against the big teams.

""Sometimes it is about who wants it more. Mauricio is trying to get that fire in us and make sure when teams come to play us they have a really tough time.""

And Pochettino, formerly head coach Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, is not shying away from the expectation of the biggest tournament of all on the horizon: next year's home men's World Cup, hosted along with Mexico and Canada.

""Us as players, we go into every tournament believing we can win it,"" Musah says. ""That's the beauty of football. We are a very talented group in a tournament where there are huge players, huge teams who are probably way more expected to win the tournament.

""But we've seen it time and time again where you can say the underdog goes on and does it. We go into the tournament with that belief. I think if you go into the tournament thinking you are not going to win it is quite pointless, so we will go into the tournament thinking we can do it and give our fans, ourselves, our families, the best satisfaction we can.

""I know that non-football fans, celebrities, you name it, are going to be behind the team just because we are the U.S.. They are very proud to support anyone that's from the U.S.. We are going to have so much support, we are going to feel it and it is going to drive us to do great things, I'm sure.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Neymar's chances of appearing at the 2026 FIFA World Cup are looking slimmer by the moment. 

Once a stalwart for Brazil's squad, the 33-year-old was left off manager Carlo Ancelotti's 23-man roster for the Seleção's final two World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Bolivia next week.

It now extends Neymar's absence from international duty to nearly two years.

Ancelotti cited a leg muscle injury sustained last week as the reason for Neymar's latest omission. Brazil have already secured their place at the 2026 World Cup.

The former Barcelona and PSG superstar, who now plays at boyhood club Santos in Brazil, last donned the iconic yellow jersey in October 2023. Numerous knee injuries have seen plagued his comeback attempts.

""Neymar sustained a minor injury last week. This will be the final two matches of the qualifiers and it will be very demanding, so we need players in their prime conditions so we can perform at the highest level,"" Ancelotti said Monday.

The Italian coach, who has previously expressed his commitment to getting Neymar match-ready for the 2026 World Cup, opted for caution over the 33-year-old's fitness. 

""We don't need to evaluate Neymar, we all know who he is and what he is capable of. We need him in peak condition so he can help the national team the way we all know he can,"" the former Real Madrid and AC Milan coach said.

The squad features a blend of established stars like Alisson, Marquinhos and Casemiro alongside emerging talents including Chelsea teenager Estevao and the comeback of West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta, as Brazil look to end their qualifying campaign on a high note. 

Ancelotti's list:

GOALKEEPERS: Alisson (Liverpool), Bento (Al-Nassr), Hugo Souza (Corinthians).

DEFENDERS: Alexsandro Ribeiro (Lille), Alex Sandro (Flamengo), Caio Henrique (Monaco), Douglas Santos (Zenit), Fabricio Bruno (Cruzeiro), Gabriel Magalhaes (Arsenal), Marquinhos (PSG), Vanderson (Monaco), Wesley (Roma).

MIDFIELDERS: Andrey Santos (Chelsea), Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle), Casemiro (Manchester United), Joelinton (Newcastle), Lucas Paqueta (West Ham).

FORWARDS: Estevao (Chelsea), Gabriel Martinelli (Arsenal), Joao Pedro (Chelsea), Kaio Jorge (Cruzeiro), Luiz Henrique (Zenit), Matheus Cunha (Manchester United), Raphinha (Barcelona), Richarlison (Tottenham).

Carlo Ancelotti is aiming to continue a strong World Cup qualification campaign after naming his Brazil squad for the next round of matches in September.

Former Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, 65, was appointed as the head coach of Brazil in May.

The appointment was great news for Manchester United midfielder Casemiro, who had appeared to be losing his place in the national team. Ancelotti changed that and recalled Casemiro, along with Antony, to his first squad as Brazil boss earlier this year.

Before Ancelotti's arrival, Antony and Casemiro missed out on a place in Brazil's 2024 Copa America squad and had not represented their country since 2023.

Ancelotti recalled Casemiro after the midfield veteran, who starred under the Italian at Real Madrid, forced his way back into the United first team under Ruben Amorim during the second half of the season. He played a key role in United's run to the Europa League final, after scoring three goals and two assists in the knockout stages of the competition.

Meanwhile, Antony was rejuvenating his career on loan at Real Betis, earning a recall by scoring goals and assists in La Liga before returning to Old Trafford at the end of the season.

United currently have three Brazilian internationals in Amorim's squad.

Matheus Cunha completed a transfer to United from Wolves this summer to become the latest Brazilian to wear the red shirt.

The 26-year-old has shown encouraging signs in his first two competitive appearances for United, although he is still waiting for his first win since joining the club.

Cunha has done enough to warrant a place in Brazil's squad for Brazil's final round of South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup against Chile and Bolivia. He is joined by Casemiro who is likely to be a mainstay under Ancelotti in the national team.

The biggest headlines from Ancelotti's latest squad focus on Neymar missing out due to injury, while Real Madrid duo Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo were overlooked because the Italian wants to get to know his other players better.

Brazil have already booked a place at the World Cup next year, which allows Ancelotti to experiment with his squad over the next two matches.

The latest Brazil squad will come as a blow for United outcast Antony.

The 25-year-old has been left out of the United squad all summer, and it is clear he is not part of Amorim's plans for the future.

As a result, Ancelotti has had no other choice but to overlook the winger, as he's missed pre-season and is not playing regular football for his club. That is why it was important for Antony to secure a move away from United earlier this summer.

Real Betis want to re-sign Antony, which has been the case since his previous loan deal at the Spanish club expired at the end of last season. It remains to be seen if the La Liga outfit will be able to reach an agreement with United before Monday's deadline.

Antony's chances of representing Brazil in the near future are slim if the tricky winger fails to secure a move to a new club.","{'href': 'https://www.unitedinfocus.com', 'title': 'United In Focus'}","soccer"

The France international played his part in last season's success but his start to the current campaign is too poor to ignore

Plenty of people wanted to talk about Alexander Isak before, during and after Liverpool's chaotic clash with Newcastle on Monday night. Arne Slot wasn't one of them, though.

When asked about his club's interest in the Swedish striker after the dramatic 3-2 win at St. James' Park, Slot told Sky Sports: ""I think the story should be about Hugo Ekitike. He has been with us for three games now and scored three goals. So, this is not the place to talk about anything other than that, although I can understand why you would ask the question.""

Slot knows full well how big a talking point Isak's strike has become. It has become the saga of the summer and the media frenzy won't die down until the dispute is resolved one way or another. However, the game on Tyneside really wasn't about Isak - at least not from Liverpool's perspective. Slot doesn't necessarily need the Swedish striker to arrive at Anfield before the summer transfer window closes, as Ekitike delivered more evidence of how capable he is of leading the line.

What is painfully imperative, though, is that the Reds stop procrastinating and sign Marc Guehi - because continuing to count on Ibrahima Konate could cost them their Premier League title.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Red Devils are pushing to sign the Royal Antwerp shot-stopper amid continued concerns over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir's competency

""There is a glaring issue for Manchester United that cannot be ignored and that is they need to find a new goalkeeper. They have to, I am absolutely unequivocal on that,"" Red Devils legend Gary Neville told Sky Sports after seeing an awful error from Altay Bayindir gift Arsenal a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the new Premier League season.

""It is really unsettling when you don't have a dominant No.1 who owns his six-yard box, who comes and punches everything and makes saves to save you points when your defenders make mistakes. They need to sort the goalkeeper out as they will continue to concede goals and points and it undermines what they are doing.""

Despite that mistake, Bayindir also got the nod in goal for United in their 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday, with Andre Onana left on the bench. Head coach Ruben Amorim stuck with Onana as the club's first-choice goalkeeper initially after arriving at Old Trafford last November, but the calamitous Cameroonian is no longer a guaranteed starter, having been just as unreliable as he was under Erik ten Hag throughout 2023-24.

For the time being, Amorim has decided that Bayindir is the lesser of two evils, with 39-year-old Tom Heaton still seen as nothing more than a back-up option, but Neville is absolutely right: United cannot progress until they sign a new No.1. Fortunately, work is being done behind the scenes to address the most glaring issue in the squad.

The Old Trafford recruitment team has honed in on 23-year-old Royal Antwerp 'keeper Senne Lammens, who was left out of his team's latest Belgian top-flight game against Mechelen after reportedly agreeing personal terms with United. According to The Guardian, Lammens is set to complete a £17 million ($23m) move to Manchester before the summer window slams shut on September 1.

That will be a very small price to pay if he solves the club's long-standing crisis between the sticks. Below, GOAL assesses whether the undeniably talented Lammens is truly up to that daunting task...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Carlos Alcaraz made an impression at the US Open Monday before even stepping on court for his first-round match against Reilly Opelka.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings debuted a buzzcut, quickly drawing reaction from fans and players alike. The Spaniard even discussed it on site with golf star Rory McIlroy.

“Just got a haircut that I struggled with,” Alcaraz told McIlroy in a video captured by the US Open. “I had to start fresh.”

When Frances Tiafoe completed his first-round victory against Yoshihito Nishioka, the haircut aficionado met Alcaraz in the cooldown gym and marveled at Alcaraz's new hairdo.

“It's definitely terrible. He's my guy though. It's funny. I looked at him and I was like, ‘I guess you're aerodynamic'. Juan Carlos ‘Mosquito' was laughing. He was like, ‘Yeah, he's faster than he already was'. I was like, ‘Well, that's a problem',” Tiafoe said. “From a guy who gets haircuts week in, week out, and prides myself on good haircuts, it's horrendous.

“At the end of the day, it's Carlos, and that's my guy. But yeah, he needs to get with me. He needs to get with me for sure.”

Following his first round victory against Reilly Opelka on Monday night, Alcaraz explained the origins of his new style.

​​“I felt like my hair was really long before the tournament and I wanted to cut it,” said Alcaraz. “My brother made a mistake with the clippers and... the only way of fixing it was to shave it all off. This haircut is the result. Honestly, it's not too bad.”



Alcaraz usually has his hair cut by his friend and trusted barber Victor, as he did at Roland Garros, but this time he opted to hand the responsibility to his family, claiming New York was “too far” for Victor.

“From the moment people saw my haircut, it's all I've heard about,” he acknowledged with a  laugh. “Some people like it, others don't. The reactions make me laugh. It is what it is, I can't change it now. So I just laugh it off.”

Despite having all focus on his first Lexus ATP Head2Head match against Opelka, Alcaraz couldn't help but find it amusing when seeing himself on the big screens inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.

“It was funny when I saw myself on the screen, with my hair so short and looking so white. It was weird to see myself like that,” said the five-time major champion. “I think I was faster with this haircut!

“I do wear a cap more now because I often find I have a cold head. It's a different style, completely different from what people are used to seeing me with.”

Carlos Alcaraz debuted a striking new buzzcut Monday that made its rounds on social media, but on court, the second seed kept things business as usual to win his first-round match at the US Open.



Sporting a bordeaux-coloured sleeveless top, the Spaniard downed big-serving American Reilly Opelka 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 to begin his campaign at Flushing Meadows, where this fortnight Alcaraz is aiming for his second US Open crown and sixth major trophy overall.

“Today was a really difficult one against a really great player,” Alcaraz said in his on-court interview. “With [Reilly's] serve, I couldn't get that rhythm I wanted to get in the match, but just really happy with everything I've done today. I think the return was one of the best things I did today and then I just tried to pay my best tennis, be focused on the serve. I think overall, I did a great performance today.”

With the win, Alcaraz stays on course in the battle for World No. 1. If the Spaniard matches or betters Jannik Sinner's result, Alcaraz will leave New York atop the PIF ATP Rankings.

 

Alcaraz and rival Sinner could meet in a double-prize championship match, with the US Open trophy and World No. 1 honours on the line. But with plenty of tennis remaining in the season's final major, Alcaraz's attention will first be on a different Italian, his second-round opponent Mattia Bellucci. Alcaraz will look to avoid a repeat of his stunning second-round exit last year, when he fell to Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets.



Former No. 17 Opelka went for a bold approach with fearless serving and heavy hitting early in rallies to dictate play and give Alcaraz little to no rhythm. But Alcaraz's consistency from the baseline allowed the 2022 champion to absorb the pressure and ultimately outlast the 6'11” American. Alcaraz created 11 break chances, converting three. He closed out the two-hour, five-minute match just before the clock struck midnight in New York.



“You feel like nothing depends on you, it always depends on him and the way he serves, the way he plays from the baseline,” Alcaraz said of the challenge of facing Opelka. “You just have to be focused, put as many returns in as you can, try to be in the rally and try to win the points that he lets you play from the baseline. It's really difficult when you play someone who doesn't let you play your game.”

Alcaraz boasts a season-leading 55 wins and six titles, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Last Monday, the 22-year-old lifted his first Cincinnati Open title.

In earlier action, Norwegian Casper Ruud, who Alcaraz beat in the 2022 final, advanced with a 6-1, 6-2, 7-6(5) victory against Austrian Sebastian Ofner.

 

Home favourite Frances Tiafoe began his campaign by ousting Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3, 7-6(6), 6-3. Ninth seed Karen Khachanov fought off #NextGenATP wild card Nishesh Basavareddy 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-5, 6-1 and 15th seed Andrey Rublev downed Dino Prizmic 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.

 Daniil Medvedev is unlikely to look back fondly on the 2025 Grand Slam season. 

 The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings has ended his year at the majors with just one match win after he fell to a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7(5), 0-6, 6-4 defeat against Benjamin Bonzi on Sunday night at the US Open. After stealing the third set amid chaotic scenes, Medvedev twice surrendered a break in the fifth set. After shaking hands with Bonzi, he tossed six racquets from his bag to fans in the stands.

Despite a courageous comeback and some excellent shotmaking, Medvedev produced an error-strewn performance on Louis Armstrong Stadium, offering up 64 unforced errors overall. For Bonzi, it was a second consecutive Grand Slam victory against Medvedev following his four-set triumph in the pair's clash at Wimbledon in late June. 

 The 20-time tour-level champion Medvedev began his Grand Slam year by rallying from two-sets-to-one down to defeat then-World No. 418 Kasidit Samrej at the Australian Open. He then fell to Learner Tien in five sets in the second round in Melbourne, before falling to Cameron Norrie in five at Roland Garros, and Bonzi at both Wimbledon and now the US Open. 

“I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” Medvedev said of his 2025 Grand Slam season. “Everything: serve, return, volley, whatever… I just need to play better, and I'm going to try to do it next year.”

 Sunday night's encounter between Medvedev and Bonzi in New York did not lack drama. Bonzi appeared set to wrap a comfortable upset when he stepped up to serve on match point at 5-4, 40/30 in the third set, but an unexpected interruption acted as a catalyst for wild scenes on Louis Armstrong Stadium. 

The bedlam began when a photographer ran from the court entrance onto the court surface inside the side court signage to take his position in the photographers' pit after Bonzi missed his first serve on the match point. Umpire Greg Allensworth awarded the Frenchman another first serve due to the disturbance. Medvedev ran towards the umpire's chair to remonstrate and soon after encouraged the crowd to raise as much noise as they could muster. 

 Sustained crowd noise delayed play for about five minutes. As Bonzi paced near the back of the court, even Medvedev was concerned things had spiralled out of control and he signalled for an end to the chaos. Upon resumption, a Bonzi fault drew an enormous roar from fans. When Medvedev won a baseline exchange to get back to deuce, fans erupted. 

 Massive roars rang out when Medvedev then earned – and converted – a break point to level at 5-5. The former US Open champion, who once fancied himself a villain to the New York crowd – made a heart symbol with his hands to thank them for their support. After clinching the set in a tie-break, he repeated the gesture.

Medvedev raced away with the fourth set and broke in the first game of the fifth. But he handed back the break immediately. He also handed back a break at 3-3. Despite serving below full strength due to a leg injury, Bonzi fought off five break points to hold for 4-3 and soon after broke Medvedev in the final game of the match to secure a dramatic win for new coach Nicolas Mahut.

“It's a very important win, it's my first Grand Slam with Nico, our first week together,” Bonzi said on court after the victory. “I gave all my heart on the court and I have the win today.

“I'm very proud of myself, the scenario of the match, the match point in the third. Then Daniil playing great and taking full advantage in the fourth. It's kind of crazy, this match. For me it's like my best victory ever. It's very special to do it here.”

Medvedev has enjoyed some success away from the majors in 2025, reaching an ATP Masters 1000 semi-final in Indian Wells and an ATP 500 championship match in Halle. But the 29-year-old's horror show at the Slams represents a dramatic dropoff for a player who has been of the most consistent performers at that level in recent years: Medvedev reached at least one Grand Slam final per year from 2021 to 2024.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Marin's memories: Former champ Cilic on how US Open ‘brings the goosebumps'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cilic-us-open-2025-feature","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 02:34:14 GMT","

 It would be hard for Marin Cilic's past at the US Open not to somehow inform his latest campaign at the hard-court major. 

 The 2014 titlist is back to compete in New York for the first time in three years and walking around the grounds of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center has perhaps inevitably brought back memories of his past successes there. Cilic's intention is to put them to good use as he prepares for his 15th main-draw appearance at Flushing Meadows. 

 “There are flashes. Obviously, I am not thinking only about my victory here, more into details,” Cilic, who takes on 23rd seed Alexander Bublik in the first round, told ATPTour.com. “What things did I do well in those years when I played well, especially the one that I won? What helped me to find my game? What helped me to just find my inner peace and compete at that level? 

 “I'm just trying to pick a couple of things and if I can incorporate those into my game, great. The feeling that you know you played well here is maybe an extra boost to lift your game.” 



 The US Open naturally stands out as a special tournament for Cilic, but not just for his 2014 title run in which he dropped just three sets and included a straight-sets victory against Roger Federer in the semi-finals. 

 “It means an achievement of a lifetime [to me], absolutely,” said the 36-year-old Croatian. “Obviously, everything came to life over here. I had some great success prior to my victory here, playing in the era of not only the Big Four but also other guys from Andy Roddick to [James] Blake to [Fernando] Gonzalez to [Tomas] Berdych to [Jo-Wilfried] Tsonga to [Juan Martin] del Potro to [David] Nalbandian to many incredible champions we had on the Tour. 

 “Here, all my dreams came true, so coming here again always brings the goosebumps and always brings a little bit of a sensation of, ‘Can I do it again?' You never know what's coming, so you've always got to keep your mind open and work as hard as you can to achieve those things.”

 There were no guarantees that Cilic was going to get the chance to compete again at an event where he holds a 41-13 record. He missed almost all of the 2023 season and half of 2024 due to a right knee injury, a tough absence for any player to bounce back from in their mid-30s. 

 “It was a huge struggle to come back,” reflected Cilic. “It's an extremely difficult position, unknown territory, when you need to do a surgery. Who to trust? What to do? What if it went wrong? Obviously, you are feeling, ‘I'm 35, 36, do I need these things?' For me it came down to just a feeling, an idea of wanting to come back and needing to do it for my past self. I was so diligent and professional for so many years, and I want to come back to give myself another chance. 

 “Coming back here is just a plus. To play here, to enjoy myself. My family is here, my boys. They walked here through the corridors, and they were like, ‘Oh dad, that's you! That's you on the photo, I can't believe it!' It's fun to have new memories.” 

 When Cilic steps on court to face Bublik on Tuesday afternoon in New York, it will be the 36-year-old's first US Open outing since 2022, when he reached the fourth round. A 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz ended Cilic's run in a five-set thriller before going on to lift his maiden major title and simultaneously become the youngest No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history. 

 “I played him that year also in Miami, where he won his first Masters 1000 and I was like, ‘This guys is unbelievable',” recalls Cilic of the 2022 incarnation of Alcaraz. “Not many guys just blew me off the court like that. Playing here, I was ready to go full on, and it was a tough match, five sets, and he went on to win the trophy and be No. 1. To even have that kind of a run in 2022 when he was 19, with so many tough matches and five setters, it was just incredible.”

 With Cilic having played most of his career in the ‘Big Four' era, the way Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have dominated the majors across 2024 and 2025 could give Cilic a sense of déjà vu. Yet the Croatian is happy to focus on his two younger rivals' own unique paths to the top of the sport. 

 “Carlos and Jannik deserve [their success],” said Cilic. “They are so diligent, so professional. They worked on their game and have incredible ability. For me, it is also great to be a part of this generation as well.” 

 As a player who notched plenty of successes in the Big Four era, does Cilic have any advice for other top ATP Tour stars currently trying to reel in the red-hot Alcaraz and Sinner? 

 “It comes down to every individual. What do you want to achieve, what is your goal?” said the 21-time tour-level champion. “Everybody has different goals, but if you want to be better than those guys, you have to be prepared to work better than them and be smart with training, smart with decisions. Many things, because these guys are just on a run for the past couple of years and are not meaning to stop.”

Madison Keys had the first-round jitters in her surprising loss to Renata Zarazua, a 3 hour and 10 minute marathon in which she committed 89 unforced errors.

NEW YORK -- Even in a breakthrough season capped by her first Grand Slam title, Madison Keys faltered on Monday, falling to unseeded Renata Zarazua in the first round on Arthur Ashe Stadium.

The sixth-seeded American, who won her first Grand Slam title earlier this year in Melbourne, fought off the Mexican World No. 82 for three painstaking sets before finally succumbing, 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5, in a 3-hour and 10-minute marathon.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Keys, 30, said she felt fine in warm-ups, but it was evident early in the first set that she wasn't at her strongest.

""I was just, for the first time in a while, my nerves really got the better of me,"" the former US Open finalist admitted. ""And it kind of became a little bit paralyzing. I felt like I was just slow. I wasn't seeing things the way that I wanted to, which I feel like resulted in a lot of bad decisions and lazy footwork.""

A post shared by espnW (@espnw)

The sloppiness was evident, as Keys made 89 unforced errors against 46 winners.

""I think it was probably building a little bit,"" Keys said when asked about the pressure of playing her first US Open as a major champion. ""The reality is it usually builds a little bit. You always kind of feel first-round jitters, and as the day is getting closer, you feel a little bit more and more nervous.

""But I feel like, for whatever reason, today I just couldn't separate myself from the ... and it's more than just saying, 'I want to win.' Just feeling like winning matters just way too much, and I just couldn't quite separate myself from that. Then once you start playing badly, it just kind of all snowballs.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

It was a particularly stunning upset, and not just because of Zarazua's far lower ranking. Prior to Monday's win, she had never beaten a Top 10 player in six tries in her nine-year career. It was also only her ninth appearance in the main draw of a Slam, and she's never advanced past the second round.

It's equally surprising because of Keys' success in tight matches this year. She currently leads the Hologic WTA Tour with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins.

As for Zarazua, she too felt the nerves -- who wouldn't on Ashe, in the first round of a Slam? -- but her recent experience at majors has helped her feel like she belongs, and made the moment feel more manageable. (Until 2024, she had never played in the singles main draw at all four majors in a season.)

""I was really nervous coming in,"" Zarazua told reporters. ""I think the few minutes right before you go on court, it's probably the worst moments. But in a way, I feel like the experiences of playing in the other stadiums at the other Slams kind of helped me a lot today.

""Obviously I didn't want the nerves to be what let me down in the match. I thought I was playing really well the past few days and practicing well, so I was like, I've just got to find a way to use that [to] my advantage. The fear, the nerves, all of that, [I] just tried to leave them on the side and just focus on my game and what I had to do.""

Next up for the feisty 5-foot-3 player is Diane Parry, who dropped just one game in a dominant effort over now-retired Petra Kvitova.

At an Open celebrating Althea Gibson, fans had a chance to see another trailblazer in person.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 26, 2025 copy_link

NEW YORK—The central theme of this year's US Open is barrier-breaking. Specifically, the barrier that Althea Gibson broke 75 years ago when she became the first African-American to play the U.S. Nationals at Forest Hills.So it made sense that fans had a chance to see one of the inheritors of Gibson's legacy, and a trailblazer of equal importance, Venus Williams, play in person on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium. In 1997, the year that Ashe made its debut, a teenage Williams also made her Open debut, and went all the way to the final. Twenty-eight years later, we can see the product of that breakthrough in the many Black women tennis players who have come after her, and who populate the draw at Flushing Meadows today.👉 Watch on the Tennis Channel app: TenniStory, Althea Gibson

Williams' presence would have been enough, no matter how her first-round match with Karolina Muchova went. And for the first three games, it looked like we might not get much more than that from Venus. She started the way you would expect a 45-year-old who hasn't played a Grand Slam match in two years, and who has played very few matches anywhere since 2021, to start: slowly. Williams had trouble catching up to Muchova's pace, and trouble getting her service motion in gear. She was down 0-2 before most fans had entered the building. Many of them may have wondered: Was she going to get a game?Venus put those fears to rest by saving three break points and holding for 2-1. From there, she began to get comfortable in the rallies. Which is never going to be good for her opponents, no matter what her age is, because Venus has never lost her power. She can't cover the court the way she once did. Her service toss gets away from her—she committed 10 double faults in this match. She starts breathing hard much more quickly than she once did. But for all of that, she can still put a flat wallop on the ball. When she does, even a highly-ranked 20-something pro like Muchova isn't going to catch up with it.

For the next set and a half, Williams played Muchova evenly. She drilled winning returns off her second serves. She found the corners with her ground strokes. She even jumped up to knock off a smash. When she broke to take the lead in the second set, she celebrated with a fist-pump—a rarity for her. The Open fans cheered every point she won, and stayed dead silent for every point she lost. I'm not sure Muchova received any applause at all over three sets.“I was stressed,” Muchova told the crowd later. “You guys had me stressed.”Even then, the fans stayed silent.

But Muchova overcame it when she needed to. After losing the second set, she walked off court, “collected myself,” and came back out and played much cleaner tennis. Just as in the first set, she started with an early break, and quickly led 3-0. The winners stopped exploding off Venus' racquet, and the end came quietly, 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 for Muchova.Still, even in the third set, there was a vintage Venus moment. Serving at 0-3, she took a solid return from Muchova and obliterated a forehand. The ball went through the middle of the court, but way too fast for Muchova to respond. By the time she started her swing, it was through the hole in the back tarp.The cameras caught Venus' scream as she swung. If it turns out to be this barrier-breaker's last blast on Ashe, she made it a good one.

While George Russell might not be in championship contention just yet, the Mercedes driver is determined to be ready for a title fight even if the opportunity presents itself many years into his career.

George Russell has given an insight into how a conversation with tennis star Novak Djokovic inspired him, as he looks to continue racing into his 30s and 40s and be ready to fight for a World Championship whenever the time comes.

Djokovic remains one of tennis' most successful and decorated players at 38 years old, with the Serbian having taken 100 singles titles as well as holding the record for the most weeks (428) spent as world No. 1 in the Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) rankings.

While Russell is still in the relatively early days of his own career at the age of 27, the Briton spoke during an appearance on the UNTAPPED podcast about the importance of looking after himself now in order to preserve his performance level in the years ahead.

“I had a really good conversation with Novak Djokovic about human performance and what he's doing currently, but [also] what he was doing in his 20s,” Russell explained.

“He said to me, when he was in his 20s, he felt that he could comfortably miss a day in the gym or a day here or a day there, and it wouldn't affect him. But he didn't, and he's so grateful for that now because he thinks the work he put in during those years is allowing him to continue to play at such a high level into his late 30s.

“Formula 1 isn't as brutal on the body as let's say tennis – it's different, because you don't have that constant impact on your legs – but I want to be here well into my 40s and when I see what [Fernando] Alonso's doing, that gives me inspiration that I can do that.”

Russell admitted that he felt even more inspired to focus on this goal when he learned that Michael Schumacher was 31 years old when he won his first World Championship as a Ferrari driver in 2000, a feat that led to a run of consecutive titles through to the end of 2004.

“You think of Schumacher and Ferrari as just domination, but his first championship with Ferrari was in his 30s, so it's quite interesting,” the Mercedes driver said. “That's what I've got to tell myself to stay motivated! And telling myself it will come at some point.

“We don't have the fastest car today, but it might be next year, it might be in five years' time, it might be in four years' time, it might be in 10 years' time.

“But my dream is to be a World Champion, and I'm working every day to make sure I'm ready, because I just don't know when that time will come.”

Russell currently sits in fourth place of the Drivers' Standings ahead of the second half of the season getting underway, while Mercedes are holding P3 in the Teams' Championship.

McLaren have won 11 out of 14 Grands Prix so far this year, but they expect to be pushed harder after the summer break.

Andrea Stella reckons McLaren will face more of a test from their rivals across the final 10 rounds of the 2025 Formula 1 campaign, and Ferrari in particular, following his team's imperious run in the opening half of the year.

McLaren have been the class of the field so far this season, with Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris racking up 11 Grand Prix wins between them – the other victories going to Red Bull's Max Verstappen (two) and Mercedes racer George Russell (one).

However, McLaren boss Stella is expecting a stiffer challenge after the summer break, with Ferrari's recent upgrades appearing to pay off and Mercedes finding some form after scrapping a problematic rear suspension development.

In an unusual end to Qualifying in Hungary last time out, under dark clouds and with temperatures dropping, Charles Leclerc scored his and Ferrari's first Grand Prix pole position of 2025 – and he went on to lead the first stint of the race before car problems took over.

“I'm not surprised, because Ferrari have been competitive over the last few races,” Stella said of Leclerc and Ferrari's pace at the Hungaroring. “They were competitive in the dry in Silverstone, they were competitive in Belgium. Somehow, this wasn't expressed fully.

“I think we saw [in Qualifying] that they were in condition to score the pole position, and [in the race], it's not like in the first stint we were holding back. We were trying to go as fast as possible, and Leclerc was managing the lead of the race with some degree of control.”

He continued: “I think Ferrari [are] going to be a contender for victories for the remainder of the season. Definitely, anytime we [are] racing for the second part of the season, we would have to take into account that in Qualifying and in the race, we would have to deal with Ferrari.

“We would [also] have to deal with Mercedes, and [at the Hungarian Grand Prix] Max was a bit out of contention, but Max, I'm sure, will find a way to fight for victories.

“So, there's nothing obvious in this business. This is exactly what we said in our briefing after Qualifying [in Hungary], and this is what we will keep repeating [to] ourselves in the second part of the season.”

Nonetheless, McLaren are very much in control of the Teams' Championship after 14 of 24 scheduled rounds – the Woking-based squad boasting more than double the points of second-placed Ferrari.

In the Drivers' battle, just nine points separate McLaren pair Piastri and Norris at the top of the standings, with third-placed Verstappen now almost 100 points off the championship lead.

A suit challenges Prime Video telling people they can ""buy"" a movie when they're purchasing a license to watch it for a period of time. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



	A little known fact about movie and TV show “purchases” online: What's being bought isn't actually ownership of the title but rather a limited-time license for viewing access. Consider the $4.99 director's cut of Alien on Amazon Prime Video. Cheap, right? But if the tech giant loses the rights to that version, the movie can be replaced with a different cut, like the one for theaters. And if Amazon loses the rights to the film altogether, it'll completely disappear from the viewer's library.


	So should Amazon be able to say a consumer is “buying” that movie? Some people don't think so, and they've turned to court.

	On Friday, a proposed class action was filed in Washington federal court against Amazon over a “bait and switch” in which the company allegedly misleads consumers into believing they've purchased content when they're only getting a license to watch, which can be revoked at any time.


	The issue came to the forefront at the California legislature in 2023 when gamers discovered that their access to The Crew would be cut off once Ubisoft shut down servers for the game. After, the “Stop Killing Games” movement was born to stop publishers from destroying titles consumers had already bought.


	Lisa Reingold, who filed the lawsuit, says she bought Bella and the Bulldogs — Volume 4 on Amazon in May for $20.79 but soon lost access to the title. It's not an uncommon occurrence, similarly affecting consumers across digital stores, like those hosted by Apple and Google. If you bought Downton Abbey through Amazon as the five seasons came out from 2010 to 2015, you'd no longer have them by 2024.

	











	The way in which digital transactions are structured, the lack of transparency around them and the streaming landscape is partly why physical media is kind-of-sort-of cool again. DVDs offer the ability, now and forever, to bypass the complicated web of licenses that leave fans unable to access their favorite titles. 


	The lawsuit accuses Amazon, which didn't respond to a request for comment, of misrepresenting the nature of movie and TV transactions during the purchase process. On its website and platform, the company tells consumers they can “buy” a movie. But hidden in a footnote on the confirmation page is fine print that says, “You receive a license to the video and you agree to our terms,” the complaint says.


	The issue is already before a court. In a 2020 lawsuit alleging unfair competition and false advertising over the practice, Amazon maintained that its use of the word “buy” for digital content isn't deceptive because consumers understand their purchases are subject to licenses. Quoting Webster's Dictionary, it said that the term means “rights to the use or services of payment” rather than perpetual ownership and that its disclosures properly warn people that they may lose access. The court ultimately rebuffed Amazon's bid to dismiss the lawsuit outside of a claim alleging a violation of Washington's unjust enrichment law.


	Recent legislative changes may make the lawsuit even more viable. Earlier this year, a California law went into effect barring the advertisement of a transaction as a “purchase” unless it offers unrestricted ownership of the product. Under the statute, sellers must obtain acknowledgement that buyers are aware they're actually buying a limited license, in this case movies or TV shows, that can be revoked.

	











	Amazon “does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good,” writes Wright Noel, a lawyer for consumers looking to sue the company, in the complaint. “The warning is buried at the very bottom of the screen, in font that is considerably smaller than the other text on the screen


	The lawsuit claims violations of California unfair competition, false advertising and consumer legal remedies laws. It seeks unspecified damages, including disgorgement of profits and punitive damages for allegedly intentionally malicious conduct.

The doc, 'Searching For Stars Hollow,' is in celebration of the beloved dramedy's 25th anniversary this October.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Gilmore Girls this October, a new documentary, Searching For Stars Hollow, is in the works with stars Kelly Bishop, Jared Padalecki and Chad Michael Murray, among others.


Searching For Stars Hollow, from Ink On Paper Studios, is set to examine “the beloved show's role in American cultural history,” per a press release, as well as include never-before-seen interviews with castmembers and behind-the-scenes stories from crewmembers, writers and directors.




	In addition to Bishop (Emily Gilmore), Padalecki (Dean Forester) and Murray (Tristin Dugray), the doc will also feature interviews with Keiko Agena (Lane Kim), Sally Struthers (Babette Dell), Liz Torres (Miss Patty), Emily Kuroda (Mrs. Kim), Rose Abdoo (Gypsy), Kathleen Wilhoite (Liz Danes), Matt Jones (Morgan), Grant Lee Phillips (the town troubadour), director Jamie Babbit, writer and producer Stan Zimmerman, casting directors Jami Rudofsky and Mara Casey, and Kevin T Porter, host of the Gilmore Guys podcast.

Gilmore Girls, which ran for seven seasons, from 2000-07, centered around the relationship between a thirtysomething single mother, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), and her teen daughter, Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. Melissa McCarthy, Scott Patterson, Sean Gunn and the late Edward Herrmann also starred in the Amy Sherman-Palladino-created dramedy.

	











	Meghna Balakumar and Kevin Konrad Hanna are directing the documentary, with Adam F. Goldberg executive producing and Jim Demonakos producing.


	“The interviews that we've already conducted with the cast have been a delight,” Balakumar said in a statement. “We've shot more than 100 hours of footage and have already unearthed stories, commentary, critiques, and more. And we're continuing to shoot more interviews in the coming months to present the most complete, full and truly new story of the show's impact and legacy that is only possible at this historical moment.”


	Demonakos added, “Searching For Stars Hollow will reveal how Gilmore Girls came to life, why it continues to resonate across generations, and how its unique blend of humor, heart and pop culture shaped a devoted worldwide fan community with an in-depth look at its creation and the connections it continues to foster. This documentary is for fans of the show but also for anyone with an interest in cultural history and how it affects individual lives.”


	A release date for Searching For Stars Hollow has yet to be announced, but fans can follow the doc's pre-launch page for the Kickstarter here.

The Oscar winner also executive produces the limited series that is based on a 'Cosmopolitan' story.

Managing Editor, East Coast


Jessica Chastain is better known as “the Savant” in her new Apple TV+ series, which released a trailer on Tuesday.


The Savant follows Chastain as an undercover investigator who infiltrates online hate groups in an effort to stop domestic extremists before they act. The gripping first look (below) shows Chastain as mom by day, terrorist-chaser by night. “Snipers, bombings, ambushes… we're on the verge of serious violence,” she says when confiding to a colleague about the man she's hunting, played by Pablo Schreiber. 




	“Do you think if you engage with terrible things, you're daring even worse things to happen?” she asks.

	The limited eight-episode series is also executive produced by Chastain. The series launches with the first two episodes on Friday, Sept. 26, followed by a weekly release.


	The cast also includes Nnamdi Asomugha, Cole Doman, Jordana Spiro, Trinity Lee Shirley, Toussaint Francois Battiste and guest star Schreiber. 


The Savant has been in the works for more than two years. Andrea Stanley, who wrote the Cosmopolitan feature on which the series is based, is a consultant on the series. Her August 2019 piece, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” detailed a woman known as “The Savant,” an investigator whose job is to take down the country's most violent men before they can carry out large-scale attacks.

	











	Hailing from Fifth Season, The Savant is also executive produced by Kelly Carmichael for Chastain's Freckle Films, Alan Poul, showrunner Melissa James Gibson and Matthew Heineman, along with David Levine and Garrett Kemble for Anonymous Content.

""The film continues to grow in scope as the story evolves,"" say HBO Films and Bleecker Street about the expansive documentary project. (Musk, meanwhile, has decried it as ""a hit piece."")


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Oscar-winning documentarian Alex Gibney‘s long-awaited Elon Musk documentary has locked down a deal for a run in U.S. cinemas ahead of its streaming launch on HBO Max.  


	HBO Documentary Films and Universal Pictures have teamed up with indie distributor Bleecker Street to bring the film — which is titled, simply, Musk — to theaters. The partners describe the film as “an incisive look behind the legend of Elon Musk, the world's most heralded ‘inventor-entrepreneur' who has enormous influence on the world in which we all live.”

	The deal was unveiled on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday's kick-off of the Venice Film Festival in Italy.

	Word leaked that Gibney was working on a Musk documentary as far back as March 2023, but the film has yet to receive a release date. HBO and its partners hint that Musk's ongoing prominence in the global news cycle has made it challenging for the documentary team to determine when and how to conclude their biographical saga.


	“The film continues to grow in scope as the story evolves,” the companies said in a joint statement, adding that they “will work to unveil a rich portrait, even as history unfolds in real-time.”


	Back in March 2023, when one of Musk's fans tweeted about the news of the planned doc, Musk posted a response saying, “It's a hit piece.” 


	Gibney then posted a direct reply, saying, “How would you know?” 

	











	Famed for his thorough dissection of hot-button figures and scandals, Gibney made his breakthrough in 2005 with Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and went on to win the best documentary Oscar in 2007 for Taxi to the Dark Side, his documentary about the U.S. military's use of extrajudicial detention and torture in the Middle East. Other standouts include Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief (winner of three Emmys), We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks, and Citizen K, about Vladimir Putin and Russian billionaire exile Mikhail Khodorkovsky.


	Says Kent Sanderson, CEO of Bleecker Street: “No biographical portrait, outside of obvious political figures, has centered on an individual so at the crossroads of our society as Elon Musk. But there is also no filmmaker that I could possibly imagine bringing that story to audiences with unmatched clarity, audacity, and urgency more than Alex Gibney.”


	The new theatrical distribution deal was negotiated by Bleecker Street's Miranda King and Avy Eschenasy, with Nick Shumaker of Anonymous Content on behalf of the filmmakers. HBO Documentary Films previously pre-bought North American streaming and TV rights and Black Bear is handling international sales for the film, and did the deal with Universal Pictures Content Group.


Musk is produced by Gibney, Jessie Deeter, and Erin Edeiken from Jigsaw Productions; Zhang Xin and Joey Marra from Closer Media; Nick Shumaker and Jessica Grimshaw from Anonymous Content; and Dana O'Keefe from Double Agent. Executive producers include New Regency's Yariv Milchan, and Natalie Lehmann; Richard Perello from Jigsaw; William Horberg from Closer Media; David Levine from Anonymous Content; as well as Kent Sanderson and Miranda King for Bleecker Street. Bleecker's CEO, Kent Sanderson, and key creative, Bleecker executives Tyler DiNapoli and Myles Bender, previously worked with Gibney on We Steal Secrets, the acclaimed 2013 documentary about Julian Assange released by Focus Features and Universal Pictures International.

Thanks to homegrown talent, A-list investors, and new owner Willow Bay, the women's soccer team has won the industry's hearts. Now, they just need to win a few more games.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	Willow Bay admits that the pink isn't quite the right shade on her custom Angel City Football Club Nikes as she walks through the team's Thousand Oaks training facility.


	The massive athletic center opened earlier this year with a 5,400-square-foot gym, three locker rooms and a studio for filming social media content with star players of Los Angeles' women's soccer team like Ali Riley, Christen Press and Alyssa Thompson. The space is a testament to the level of investment the team has earned. Bay, the dean of USC's Annenberg School of Journalism and Communication, and her husband, Disney CEO Bob Iger, took over controlling ownership of the club last summer with the promise of an additional $50 million in cash to fuel the club's growth, so she likely will be forgiven for the minor footwear infraction.

	“We want to build the most passionate fan base of any team in Los Angeles,” Bay says of further ambitions. “Not any women's team, any team in Los Angeles.”


	Since kicking off in 2022, Angel City quickly built a following in the entertainment industry, especially among Hollywood's rank and file. The club's black and pink now pierce through the seas of Dodger blue and Lakers purple and yellow. Angel City is the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon of Los Angeles sports teams. Once attuned, you'll see the gear everywhere, from the Universal lot to the smoothie line at Erewhon. When interviewing director Josh Greenbaum about his Emmy-nominated doc Will & Harper, I offhandedly mention this article and he tells me his family has had season tickets for several years and then excitedly talks about forward Thompson's recent four-goal game in a friendly against Ireland's national team.

	











	Announced in 2020 and launched two years later, Angel City swiftly attained a following in a notoriously hard-to-impress city thanks to a deep bench of celebrity co-owners like Jennifer Garner and Eva Longoria. Four seasons in, Angel City has become Hollywood's true home team, ingratiating itself due in part to a potent combination of entertainment-inflected branding and an in-stadium experience that is both affordable and inclusive.


	Says film editor Brad McLaughlin, a day-one season-ticket holder, “When you see Jack Nicholson courtside at the Lakers, that will be me — but for Angel City.”


	When Angel City's co-founders — entrepreneur Julie Uhrman, actress Natalie Portman and investor Kara Nortman — tried to launch a women's soccer team in L.A, they went to the usual sources of investment: private equity, venture capital and billionaires. They got nowhere. “Part of it was because it was three women who had no experience in sports, and, as amazing as Natalie Portman is, it's not like she's run a football club before,” says Uhrman. Another part of the problem was that the club, outside of the gameplay, would focus on fighting for pay equity in women's sports. Additionally, a percentage of all sponsorship revenue would be reallocated to local initiatives. Investors seemed unsure if they would be pumping money into a sports team or a charity.


	Their first yes came from Longoria. “That was the aha moment of: We are talking to the wrong people — we need to talk to people who understand that you can be more than one thing,” says Uhrman. “Celebrities and athletes, at least in the women's space, recognize that to be truly successful, they also have to be a brand. They have to leverage themselves to generate the revenue that they believe they deserve.” And after all, women in Hollywood are no strangers to the fight for equal pay.

	











	More industry investors followed, including actresses like America Ferrera, Gabrielle Union and Uzo Aduba and executives like Paramount's Cindy Holland. “I know there's trapped value in women's endeavors,” says Sarah Harden, an early Angel City investor and CEO of Reese Witherspoon's well-funded production outfit Hello Sunshine. (In 2025, the global revenue for women's sports will reach $2.35 billion, according to a study from Deloitte, up from $692 million just three years ago.)


	When you are trying to fill the 20,000-plus seats of BMO Stadium in Exposition Park, where the team plays, it helps if some of those seats are occupied with an Oscar nominee or two. But keeping people coming back is another challenge altogether. Says Harden, “We're in the show-not-tell business. You've got to show with the product on the field, getting good media coverage, and then also being able to get people emotionally connected. When you start a team, you don't have 20 years of history. You've got to build that.”


	After the team's inaugural season came an eponymous HBO docuseries that amounted to a gorgeously produced for-your-consideration ad, a promotional vehicle to potential fans. Hollywood is filled with expats who remain loyal to their hometown teams. Angel City offers the chance to root for a new Los Angeles squad without switching allegiances. And the team is thankful for and devoted to its entertainment industry fans: Uhrman and other front office staff walked the picket lines in solidarity with actors and writers during the 2023 strikes.

	











	Angel City further solidified its Hollywood bona fides in July 2024, when Bay and Iger acquired a controlling stake. The move left the team with a $250 million valuation, the highest of any franchise in the history of U.S. women's sports.


	Before considering ownership, Bay was in the stands at BMO with her granddaughters. She noticed that her offices at USC would clear out on game day, with university staffers making the short trek across the street to the stadium. As a part of a sports immersion class taught at Annenberg, Bay and her students would make an annual pilgrimage to BMO, where she “would get a snapshot of the business, year-by-year.”


	The team, Bay says, is “a precious young thing in our community.” This is the kind of statement you'd expect from an owner and one that is easy to dismiss unless you've been to an Angel City game.


	The fandom skews heavily female and queer. Says actress and comedian Lilly Singh, an early investor in the team: “It's the gay Met Gala, every game. My friends come and ask, ‘Oh, is this a Pride game?' I'm like, ‘No this is all the time.' ” The game-day crowd is also remarkably young. You can easily find yourself sitting behind an entire recreational soccer team of 10-year-olds, all mainlining cotton candy. Says McLaughlin, the editor, “You get to see the people of Los Angeles that you don't normally get to see going to a movie or a Dodger game. You actually see families.”

	











	Then there is cost. A seat in the last row of the nosebleed section for an upcoming Monday night Dodger game against Cincinnati is running over $50 as of press time. The same price will get a spot in the fifth row behind the goal at Angel City's match. A seat in Angel City's Supporter section will set you back less than a price of an Imax movie ticket. “Everyone goes through seasons, especially in entertainment. Sometimes you're working constantly, you're making a ton of money, and other times you're not working at all,” says Emma Ward, a casting associate and season ticket holder. Adds Bay, “Affordability is directly linked to building a new audience, and particularly a young audience.”


	Earlier this summer, as ICE raids were just beginning to wreak havoc in Los Angeles, Angel City became the first of the city's major sports clubs to make a statement in support of L.A.'s immigrant community. Two months on, it is one of only three of the city's 12 major sports teams to do so.


	Says Uhrman of the choice to speak out, “We recognize that support is more than just 90 minutes once a week. And ultimately, to build that connection, it's about showing up.”


	When asked what they would like to see from Angel City in the future, fans, players and ownership unanimously answer: wins. In its three seasons of play, Angel City has made it to the playoffs only once. Currently, they are 4-7, and the team's new head coach, Alexander Straus, just started midseason, all of which makes another trip to the playoffs a long shot.

	











	Luckily, this town loves a comeback story.

The Adelaide-based politician branded Snoop a ""slur merchant"" and questioned why the AFL would pay millions to acquire international talent ""rather than backing Aussie talent"".

Snoop Dogg should be sent to the doghouse, and nowhere near the 2025 AFL Grand Final.


	That's the substance of a message from Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who used a Senate address to call for Snoop's removal from Australian rules football's showpiece event, where he has been booked for the pre-game entertainment. 


	The “Drop It Like It's Hot” rapper was confirmed last month as the headline act for the pre-game entertainment at the AFL final, to be staged Sept. 27 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

	Snoop, whose booking follows in the footsteps of Ed Sheeran, Sting, The Killers, Lionel Richie, Tom Jones, Meat Loaf and homegrown rockers Powderfinger, was presented by the AFL as a coup, with CEO Andrew Dillon describing the hip-hop veteran as “a pioneer, a performer, and a true entertainer” who would help deliver “an unforgettable celebration of footy.”

A post shared by Sarah Hanson-Young (@sarah_hansonyoung)


	Hanson-Young, however, isn't hot on the idea. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Adelaide-based politician used the platform of her speech — and a post from her Instagram account — to brand Snoop a “slur merchant” and questioned why the Australian Football League would pay millions to acquire international talent “rather than backing Aussie talent”.


	“The AFL has decided, rather than putting on an Australian artist, they're gonna pay $2 million to play at the Grand Final,” remarked Hanson-Young, a vocal supporter of the nation's music community.


	“The AFL is a cultural institution,” she remarked. And cultural institutions should back Australia's musicians and creative arts community, she continued.

	











	Speaking in the Senate, Hanson-Young called out the “irony” of Snoop getting the red carpet treatment, while Adelaide Crows forward Izak Rankine received a four-week suspension for making a homophobic slur on the pitch.


	“The irony is not lost on many of us that while Izak Rankine gets dumped, Snoop Dogg gets $2 million to play his misogynistic, homophobic music on our turf,” Hanson-Young continued. While not focusing on any specific lyrics from Snoop's hundreds of songs, her comments closely follow Snoop's remarks in a podcast, in which he expressed discomfort at explaining a same-sex relationship depicted in an animated movie to his grandson.


	At a time when Australian artists are struggling to be seen and heard, proof of which can be seen on the weekly ARIA Charts, the Senator called out the AFL for missing an opportunity to support locals. “We need investment in Australian and Aussie talent. We need investment in our music industry, and we need to say that if it's an Aussie game, it's an Aussie artist playing,” she declared.


	And to the AFL, “have the guts to rethink this decision.”


	It's not the first time Snoop has caught the ire of foreign decision-makers. In 2006, the rapper was involved in a fracas at London's Heathrow Airport, during which seven police officers received minor injuries. On that occasion, Snoop and five other men were arrested on charges of violent disorder and starting a brawl, and spent the night in jail. The artist was subsequently banned from the country for four years.


	As his U.K. ban was lifted in 2010, Snoop found himself on the outside in the Netherlands, where authorities had him removed from the lineup of a free concert, Parkpop festival, when the mayor and law enforcement officials asked its organizers could secure a performer of more “open and friendly character.” Earlier, in 2001, Snoop raised eyebrows when he presented “Doggystyle,” a feature-length adult video featuring his own music.

	











	AFL CEO Andrew Dillon has defended the decision to book Snoop Dogg, noting the league hadn't scrutinized all his lyrics and reiterated that the entertainment spot at the final would be a family-friendly spectacle.


	“It is also important to remember that we engaged Snoop Dogg in 2025 as the person he is today,” Dillon said. “He has spoken publicly about his past, he has changed, and today he is a grandfather, philanthropist, he helps rehabilitate youth and is a global entertainer who has performed at both the Super Bowl and the Olympic Closing Ceremony.”


	Snoop has an Australian connection. In 2021, he struck an exclusive, five-year touring deal with TEG MJR, the U.K.-based promotion arm of Australian live entertainment, ticketing and tech giant TEG.

The singer/songwriter directly thanked the pop superstar in her announcement.

	Hannah Dailey



	Welcome to the Music Industry (Taylor's Version). On Monday (Aug. 25), Rachel Platten announced that she's taking a page out of Taylor Swift‘s book by re-recording some of her biggest hits — including 2015's Billboard Hot 100 smash “Fight Song” — in an effort to reclaim her voice, just like the pop superstar did.


	Sharing her new project's black-and-white cover art with the title Fight Song (Rachel's Version), the New York native revealed in her caption that she will release a collection of new takes on a handful of her older songs on Sept. 26. The LP will also feature some live recordings, plus a “surprise from the vault” — much like Swift's Taylor's Version releases, each of which included previously unreleased “Vault” songs that had been scrapped from their respective albums' original tracklists.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“As we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Fight Song, I had no idea when I wrote these songs in moments of vulnerability that they would go on to change my life,” Platten wrote in her caption. “For a decade, they've lived out in the world, carrying their own weight. They've been parts of your moments of strength, doubt, and connection.”




	“I've gone back to some of my originals, not to change them, but to reclaim them,” she continued. “This is about more than just new versions of old songs; the new Rachel's Versions are infused with the voice I have now, the wisdom I've gained, and the undeniable pride of owning my own masters. I'm grateful to @TaylorSwift for bringing this conversation to light and empowering artists to take back control over their work, their stories, and their futures.”


	Released in 2015 via Columbia Records, “Fight Song” spent months climbing the charts before peaking at No. 6 on the Hot 100 that August. One person who was definitely a fan of the track just so happened to be Swift, who brought Platten out onstage with her to sing it for thousands of fans at a 1989 World Tour show in Philadelphia more than a decade ago.


	“Fight Song” has since become one of the world's best-known anthems for perseverance in the face of hardship, serving as Hillary Clinton's campaign song the year after it was released. It would find a home in 2016 on Platten's album Wildfire, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200.   


	And while Platten is just starting out on her journey to take back ownership of her life's work, Swift recently reached the culmination of hers. In a move that wrapped up six-plus years of oftentimes tense negotiations between the 14-time Grammy winner, Scooter Braun and Shamrock Capital — during which time she re-recorded four of her first six albums, bringing discussions about artist rights and fair recording contracts into the general public's consciousness — Swift was finally able to purchase the rights to her back catalog earlier this year.


	“To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,” Swift wrote in a letter on her website announcing the deal in May. “I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans. Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen.”

The rapper also spoke about getting Jay-Z's approval to sample ""Imaginary Players.""

	Hannah Dailey



	Is Cardi B the drama? Even she isn't sure — including when it comes to her tensions with other female rappers in the music industry.


	While speaking to Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1 in an interview posted Monday (Aug. 25), the Bronx native opened up about why she thinks people are always pulling her into feuds online and in person, a phenomenon that inspired the title of her upcoming sophomore album, Am I the Drama? After years of reflection, Cardi has concluded that she simply has a natural quality that elicits strong reactions from other people. 


	“It's like, ‘Damn, does drama chase me? Or am I the drama?'” she told Lowe. “I just really think I was born with an anointed light. Sometimes the light is great, but it also disturbs people's peace. It draws people to me, and it's not always going to be good. That light might bother people … maybe it's too bright, it's too loud. It's always been like this to me.”

	











	That gravitational relationship between herself and drama has carried over from her high-school days into her professional life, the Grammy winner says. “Even in the industry, there is a lot of different female rappers, but for some reason, it's something about me that these b—hes can't stand,” she explained on Apple Music 1. “They can't f–k with me. Some b—hes, I feel like they're on this class right now, they're sophomores, and I'm a senior. And it's like, you want to f–k with the senior so bad. You think you're here with the senior. You're not even a junior. You need to worry about them other sophomores before you start worrying about the f–king senior.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“It's something about [me] that it's like, they can't even focus on them,” Cardi added. “They got to focus on me. And they always got to focus on throwing me shots and throwing me slings … and I'm sick of it. It's like, f–k you, f–k everybody.”


	Though the hip-hop titan didn't name names, it's no secret that she's found herself in the middle of numerous public spats over the years. In addition to her widely publicized conflict with fellow rap queen Nicki Minaj, Cardi has also traded barbs on social media with artists such as JT of City Girls, Akbar V and Bia.


	But while fans will have to wait a few more weeks to hear whether Cardi addresses any of her feuds on Am I the Drama?, which drops Sept. 19, she did recently release a single from the LP titled “Imaginary Playerz.” The track samples Jay-Z's 1997 song “Imaginary Players,” and on Apple Music 1, Cardi spoke about having the mogul approve her use of his work on her album.


	“When it was time to submit it to get approved, I was a little scared,” she revealed. “I was a little shaky. ‘Wait a minute, Jay-Z got to approve it.' I mean, I always knew that he got to approve it, but it was like, how about if he don't approve it? How about if he f–king likes it? And he did like it. And it's so crazy, the text message of him approving it, it was at 4:44 p.m.”

The fellow country stars divorced in 2020 after less than a year of marriage.


													By
												

	Jessica Nicholson



	Since her divorce from fellow country music artist Michael Ray in 2020, Carly Pearce has been outspoken about the split and the fallout from it — most prominently on her 2021 EP 29 and its follow-up album 29: Written in Stone.


	Songs like “What He Didn't Do” and “Diamondback” delved into the emotional tatters of the split. In a new interview on Bunnie Xo's Dumb Blonde podcast, Pearce notes that the things she wrote about on the 29 projects were pulled from real life.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The former couple initially met in 2018 and married in 2019, which Pearce described as all happening too fast. “I thought he was so cute. I'd heard he's the nicest guy in the world,” Pearce recalls. “I invited him to my [Billboard Country Airplay] No. 1 party for ‘Every Little Thing.' Looking back on it, it was a hot and heavy lust. It wasn't love. It was just passionate.”


	She added, “I got married to go the distance. When I married him it was for the right reasons. I think when you travel like this, I thought I was doing the right thing to get married till I was 29. But we didn't have real conversations and we didn't really know about each other. We were kind of living this life that wasn't really reality. I think we didn't really know each other. I knew the night I got married that I shouldn't have. I think the best thing that ever happened to me was COVID, because it allowed me to deal with that in private. I think that I probably would have stayed in it longer if I could have avoided it, and not had to… I was embarrassed when it happened…and was heartbroken.”

	











	Pearce filed for divorce less than a year after their wedding. “It wasn't what I signed up for,” she said, reflecting on the brief marriage. “It just wasn't the marriage that I know I deserved. I knew that very quickly. We were only married for eight months. Plenty happened to where it was very clear to me this was not, this just wasn't a marriage.”


	Asked if there was infidelity within the marriage, Pearce responded that her 2022 Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hit “What He Didn't Do” “wasn't just written out of thin air. … It wasn't good.”


	But Pearce also stressed that she's ultimately thankful for the lessons learned from the marriage. “Thank you, because you taught me how strong I am. You put me through things that have made me better now. And I don't wish him evil. I don't wish anything on him. I'm so glad that I'm not in that anymore,” she said.


	When Bunnie Xo asked about a possible “Jolene” in the situation — referencing the title mistress from  Dolly Parton's 1973 country classic — without naming any names, Pearce simply said, “Let's just say I'm not a fan of her. I'm not a fan of him. I could've done so much more than I did.”


	Pearce also noted how she had hoped for direct answers in the marriage.


	“It's tough to think that… just leave me instead. I shut my mouth for so long, because I felt like I had to. And I'm not here to blow anybody up. I don't care anymore. When you are faced with somebody that was a really dark season for you, and then they go and blow it up on the Internet, like…also, you go, ‘I don't know if he told her we were divorced.' I don't know. All I know is … that was not a fun situation for me. i think what's harder is at the end of it, you want somebody … who is gonna look you in the eye and say, ‘Yeah, I did this.' … But I never got any of that. I had to piece together a lot of things after the fact. But they were facts.”

	











	A few months after the news of the divorce was made public, fans began speculating that Ray was dating Tyler Reese Tritt (daughter of country singer Travis Tritt), after photos surfaced of the two together.


	During the Opry 100 celebration earlier this year, which was televised from the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Pearce and Tritt made headlines when Pearce performed “Jolene” during the television special. When some online commenters noticed that the cameras didn't pan to show Tyler Reese Tritt until after Pearce's performance, Pearce herself commented, saying, “Aw don't you worry, I looked right at her.”


	Last year, Pearce followed up her 29 projects with Hummingbird, featuring the Chris Stapleton collaboration “We Don't Fight Anymore” and “Truck on Fire.” “We Don't Fight Anymore” was nominated for a Grammy Award (Pearce, along with Ashley McBryde, previously won a Grammy for best country duo/group performance for “Never Wanted to Be That Girl”). “We Don't Fight Anymore” was also nominated for musical event of the year at the CMA Awards.


	In 2023, Ray released the single “Spirits and Demons,” featuring Meghan Patrick, and released the EP Dive Bars & Broken Hearts.

Netflix has released a trailer for its upcoming adaptation of Ruth Ware's The Woman in Cabin 10, which arrives on the streamer Oct. 10.


Keira Knightley stars as Lo Blacklock, a travel journalist on assignment writing about a luxury yacht where something sinister happens.


	“I know this is an unusual approach to charity,” Guy Pearce's Richard tells Blacklock at the beginning of the clip. “Three days on a luxury yacht.


	After hearing muffled cries in the middle of the night, she witnesses a passenger thrown overboard, but the next day, the yacht's captain that there was never a guest staying next door and that all passengers and crew are accounted for. Author Ruth Ware describes Blacklock's experience as “a woman who experiences something wrong, reports it truthfully, and isn't taken seriously because of who she is.”

	











	Suspects include the boat's other guests — Hannah Waddingham, Art Malik, Kaya Schodelario and more. The film's ensemble cast also includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw, David Morrissey, David Ajala Daniel Ings, Gitte Witt, Christopher Rygh, Pippa-Bennett-Warner, John MacMillan, Paul Kaye, Amanda Collin and Lisa Loven Kongsli.

	“These people run the world,” Ajala tells Knightley's character. “Don't piss them off.”


	While looking for answers, Lo herself gets pushed over a railing and into the yacht's pool by a set of gloved hands.

	Simon Stone directs from a screenplay he wrote with Joe Scrapnel and Anna Waterhouse, in turn based on an adaptation of Ware's novel by Emma Frost. Producers include Debra Hayward and Ilda Diffley. Executive producers include Cindy Holland and Richard Hewitt.


	Ware published a sequel to her original psychological thriller, The Woman in Suite 11, July 3, 2025. Protagonist Blacklock returns as the main character.

Jennifer Lawrence will be feted at this year's ​​San Sebastián Film Festival with an honorary Donostia Award for career achievement. 


	Lawrence will attend the Spanish festival to accept the award. The actor's latest flick, Die My Love, directed by Lynne Ramsay and co-starring Robert Pattinson, will screen at the festival following the ceremony. 


	Set in rural America, Die My Love is a portrait of a woman engulfed by love and madness. Grace, a writer and young mother, is slowly slipping into madness. Locked away in an old house in and around Montana, we see her acting increasingly agitated and erratic, leaving her companion, Jackson, increasingly worried and helpless.  LaKeith Stanfield, Nick Nolte, and Sissy Spacek also star.

In Deadline's review out of Cannes, Damon Wise was impressed by Ramsay's “mesmerizing film,” describing it as a “brutal but beautiful story.” As for many critics, Lawrence proved to be the star of the show. “America knows very well how good Jennifer Lawrence can be,” Wise wrote, “and this could well mean a fifth Oscar nomination if it lands in savvy hands.” Ramsay also came in for particular praise: “It could also be the film that takes Ramsay into the next stage of her career,” he said.

	











	San Sebastian will run from 19-27 September.

	Charlie Ergen's EchoStar saw its stock head skyward after unveiling plans to sell spectrum licenses to AT&T for $23 billion, a move that will shore up its finances and, it hopes, resolve an inquiry by the FCC.


	Shares surged 80% to $54, an all-time high.


	The agency led by Brendar Carr, which needs to approve the deal, is currently pursuing an inquiry around EchoStar's spectrum use.


	The operations of EchoStar's other businesses, including DISH TV, Sling and Hughes, will not be impacted by the transaction, the company said.

	Specifically, the deal calls for a sale of EchoStar's 3.45 GHz and 600 MHz spectrum licenses — a total of 50 MHz of nationwide spectrum —  to the telecom giant. In addition, the two companies amended their network services agreement to create a hybrid mobile network operator relationship.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“EchoStar and Boost Mobile have met all of the FCC's network buildout milestones. However, this spectrum sale to AT&T and hybrid MNO agreement are critical steps toward resolving the FCC's spectrum utilization concerns,” Ergen said. 


	Ergen's Dish Network acquired Boost Mobile in 2020 as a government-imposed remedy — as Boost parent T-Mobile merged with Sprint — to create a fourth national wireless carrier. 


	EchoStar has struggled financially and has been challenged in growing the service, prompting FCC concerns around the company's build-out obligations. Elon Musk has weighed in, saying the FCC should let his SpaceX use the spectrum if EchoStar wasn't.

	











	The license sale to AT&T will enable rapid deployment of the purchased spectrum to U.S. consumers across the country, as AT&T has the option to lease the spectrum pending the close, EchoStar said.


	“This transaction puts our business on a solid financial path, further facilitating EchoStar's long-term success, and enhancing our ability to innovate and compete as a hybrid network operator. The proceeds of this transaction will be used for, among other things, retiring certain debt obligations and funding EchoStar's continued operations and growth initiatives,” added Hamid Akhavan, CEO and president, EchoStar. “We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities for our remaining spectrum portfolio in partnership with the U.S. government and wireless industry participants.”

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Sony Pictures Classics has taken North American rights to Pedro Almodóvar‘s Bitter Christmas, continuing their long run with the Oscar winner. 


	The movie follows Elsa, an advertising director whose mother dies during a long December holiday. She works non-stop and, without realizing, doesn't give herself time to mourn her mother's absence. After a moment of crisis, Elsa decides to travel to the island of Lanzarote accompanied by her friend Patricia. The story of these characters run parallel to that of a screenwriter and film director, exploring how life and fiction are inseparably linked, sometimes painfully so.

	Sony Pictures Classics released Almodóvar's first English-language feature film last year, The Room Next Door, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival; the short film Strange Way of Life; and Oscar-nominated features Parallel Mothers and Pain and Glory.


Bitter Christmas stars Bárbara Lennie (Petra), Leonardo Sbaraglia (Pain and Glory), Aitana Sánchez-Gijón (Parallel Mothers), Victoria Luengo (The Room Next Door), Patrick Criado (Riot Police), Milena Smit (Parallel Mothers), Quim Gutiérrez (Darkblueamostblack) and Rossy de Palma (Parallel Mothers). Several of these actors have appeared in previous Almodóvar/Sony Pictures Classics collaborations, including Luengo in The Room Next Door; Sánchez-Gijón, Smit and de Palma in Parallel Mothers; Sbaraglia in Pain and Glory and Wild Tales; and Lennie in The Skin I Live In. 


	The deal was negotiated between Sony Pictures Classics and Almodóvar's production company, El Deseo, on behalf of the filmmaker.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Soon after Deadline reported that The Waterfront has been canceled Monday evening, the series' creator Kevin Williamson reflected on Netflix's decision not to renew the family crime drama for a second season. 


	In an Instagram message over a photo from the show featuring star Holt McCallany and guest star Topher Grace, WiIliamson chose to focus on the positive.


	“While I'm say the Buckleys won't be back for Season 2, I'm celebrating the joy that was Season 1,” he wrote, referring to North Carolina's powerful Buckley family at the center of the series starring McCallany,  Jake Weary, Melissa Benoist and Maria Bello.

	Williamson thanked fans who had watched The Waterfront as well as his “dream cast and crew” who worked on the show in North Carolina and Los Angeles and the studio behind it, Universal Television, where he is under an overall deal.

	“And thank you to Netflix for taking a chance on a very personal story,” Williamson added. He has spoken about The Waterfront having been inspired by his childhood and family, especially his dad's involvement in drug smuggling and other illegal activities. 


	“It was one of best experiences of my life!,” Williamson said about his time on The Waterfront at the end of his note to fans.


	In the show, the Buckley family has ruled Havenport, North Carolina, dominating everything from the local fishing industry to the town's restaurant scene. But their fishing empire has started to crumble as patriarch Harlan Buckley (McCallany) recovers from two heart attacks, and his wife (Bello) and son Cane (Weary) venture into the deep end to keep the family businesses afloat.

Too bad that Netflix didn't renew The Waterfront.  It was a highly entertaining and well produced series.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","True Detective's Matthew McConaughey and Nic Pizzolatto are bringing their flat circles to Netflix","https://www.avclub.com/matthew-mcconaughey-nic-pizzolatto-cole-hauser-netflix-true-detective","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 02:19:00 GMT","

True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto and season one star Matthew McConaughey have set a place for their latest attempt at a creative reunion: Netflix. In a new series made by Skydance Sports, Pizzolatto's words will return to McConaughey's mouth in a series known cryptically as “The Brothers Project.” That's not to be confused with McConaughey's other “Brothers Project,” which, as Hollywood Reporter notes, is an Apple TV+ comedy starring True Detective all-stars McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Instead, this “Brothers Project” refers to a presumed sports show in which McConaughey is the brother of Yellowstone star Cole Hauser.

“The Brothers Project,” which desperately needs a real name, is the farthest one of these Pizzolatto X McConaughey reunions has gotten. In 2020, as McConaughey's monologues were driving the Lincoln brand to new heights, he and Pizzolatto were announced as working on a show called Redeemer. About a year later, Pizzolatto negotiated an “early exit” from the show, and like Dora Lange, Redeemer was never heard from again.

Earlier this year, while taking a break from cyberbullying True Detective: Night Country, Pizzolatto and McCounaghey were announced to be working on a Mike Hammer movie, written by the former and starring the latter. Is that still happening? It's hard to say, but “The Brothers Project” has a secret weapon that other PizzoConaughey collaborations lacked: another reunion. Yellowstone favorite Cole Hauser is also attached, making “The Brothers Project” a Dazed And Confused reunion for McConaughey and Hauser. With Hauser in place, we'll probably be seeing “The Brothers Project” before Mike drops the hammer. In the meantime, Pizzolatto's first feature, Easy's Waltz, is expected out later this fall.

Saturday Night Live returns in a few weeks, but before it can bring audiences their weekly serving of Trump impressions, disgusting joke swaps, and Digital Shorts from those rascally Please Don't Destroy boys, the show needs to shed some weight and then add some weight. Earlier today, Lorne Michaels began his yearly ritual of tossing departing SNL writers and cast members into a volcano with writers Rosebud Baker and Celeste Yimm. This afternoon, he found a third unfortunate soul: featured player Devon Walker. Walker joined the show in 2022 and went on to do impressions of Frank Ocean, Draymond Green, and Eric Adams. But only so often. Deadline notes that Walker had the least amount of screen time last season.

Walker broke the news that “me and baby broke up” on Instagram. “To me, jobs in this industry feel like a bunch of little marriages,” a screenshot of a TextEdit statement reads. “Some of 'em last a long time if we're lucky, but most of them are fleeting. Permanent until they're not. That's the deal. You know what it is when you sign up.” Walker notes that in his three years on the show, “sometimes it was really cool,” and others it was “toxic as hell.” Noting that “we made the most of what it was” even amid “dysfunction,” making a “fucked up lil family.” But he mentions how satisfying it was to do this with writers Gary Richardson and Alex English, who “really went from running a bar show to working together at 30 Rock. It's a beautiful thing.” Anyway, Walker is “bout to go to Japan.” When he returns, he'll be looking for prestige dramas starring Julianne Moore. (Hello, is the President of Sirens season two available?) In the meantime, the comedian launched a podcast in April called My Favorite Lyrics and is continuing his summer tour, “Smiling Thru It All.”

Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman gave a rare look into his family life when he celebrated his daughter Jordan Ashley Aikman's birthday. He is also a father to her younger sister, Alexa Marie Aikman.

A post shared by troy (@troyaikman)

On August 24, Aikman shared a beautiful photo on Instagram of himself and Jordan wearing white. He has his arm around her, and they are smiling for the camera. In the caption, he got emotional as he reflected on all the brilliant qualities his daughter has.

“A golden birthday for my golden girl,” he wrote. “From the day you were born, you've embraced every challenge and adventure as an opportunity to grow. You've done it all with independence, courage, and strength. You're smart and beautiful, but it's your kind and caring heart that inspires and uplifts everyone who knows you.“

Aikman ended his message with an emotional comment on what fatherhood means to him. “Being your dad is one of life's greatest blessings. Happy 24th birthday Jordan,” he concluded.

Friends and fans have reacted to the post with sweet messages. “Awww Happy Birthday @jordanaikmann You are such a light inside and out. Stay Golden!” a comment reads. “Happy birthday to your baby girl and God bless your family,” another person shared.

“Looks so much like her Dad. Happy B-Day!” a third comment reads. It is true, there is a definite resemblance between father and daughter.

Jordan also responded, writing, “Aweee thank you Dad – I love you!!!”

A post shared by troy (@troyaikman)

Although Aikman does not always post on social media about his kids, he has reflected on fatherhood in an Instagram post in honor of Father's Day on June 16, 2024. 

He shared two throwback photos, one of himself and his girls, and another of Jordan and Alexa embracing. They are happy photos and give a glimpse into the special bond that this former NFL star shares with his kids. “Happy Father's Day to the daddy's and their little girls (& boys),” he wrote in the caption.

Fans praised Aikman in the comments and complimented him on being a great dad. “Great pic for the perfect father. Loved watching you play, Troy. One of the best to ever do it,” a comment reads. “Turned into beautiful young ladies! Good job @troyaikman,” another fan shared.

Aikman's daughters are close in age, and just four weeks earlier, on July 30, he celebrated Alexa's birthday with an Instagram post. This time, Aikman also posted a photo of himself and his beautiful daughter wearing white. They are posing in the same way, with his arm around her. In the caption, he shared his thoughts. 

A post shared by troy (@troyaikman)

“Happy 23rd birthday to my baby girl. An amazing young woman — kind, smart, funny, strong and beautiful,” he wrote. “Love being your dad and watching you chase down life with so much heart. Proud is an understatement. I love you Ally.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Pierce Brosnan Proudly Walks Red Carpet With Son & Granddaughter: PHOTOS","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/pierce-brosnan-son-dylan-granddaughter-isabella/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 02:25:00 GMT","

Pierce Brosnan is showing once again that true elegance never fades. At 72, the former James Bond star turned heads at the London premiere of “The Thursday Murder Club”, looking effortlessly sophisticated with his silver hair and timeless charm.

Brosnan's striking appearance once again reminded fans why he remains a Hollywood icon. 

At the premiere, his gentlemanly charm and timeless fashion sense stole the spotlight.

While the film was a highlight, it was Brosnan's family appearance that stole the spotlight. The actor proudly posed with his son Dylan, 28, and his granddaughter Isabella, 26. 

London fans witnessed a rare glimpse of the Brosnan family, radiating elegance together on the red carpet (as shared by enews).

A post shared by E! News (@enews)

Isabella is the daughter of Brosnan's late daughter Charlotte, who died in 2013 from ovarian cancer. Charlotte was the biological daughter of Cassandra Harris, Brosnan's first wife, whom he married in 1977. Brosnan adopted Charlotte after her biological father's death.

Beyond his career, Brosnan is proud of his large family. He has five children in total, three from his first marriage and two with his wife, journalist Keely Shaye Smith, whom he wed in 2001.

Their sons Dylan and Paris completed the family, and today the actor is also a grandfather of four: Isabella and Lucas, children of Charlotte, and Sean's children Jaxxon and Marley May.

From the red carpet to family milestones, Brosnan continues to shine not only as an actor but as a devoted father and grandfather, proving that elegance truly runs in the family.

The highly anticipated Netflix film, directed by Chris Columbus, is based on Richard Osman's best-selling book. It tells the story of four retirement home residents who solve murder cases for fun until a death hits close to home. Brosnan stars alongside an impressive cast, including Helen Mirren, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie.

Speaking at the film's New York premiere earlier this month, Brosnan praised his co-star Mirren. “I love working with Helen… She is captivating in every sense of the word, as a woman and as an actress. Having seen her work from afar for so many years, and then to be in the brilliance of her creativity as an actor is spellbinding,” he said, talking to People magazine.

Other stars of the film, including Tom Ellis and Richard E. Grant, joined director Chris Columbus and author Richard Osman at the press event in Leicester Square. The movie is adapted from Osman's best-selling murder mystery novel of the same name.

If you've seen the trailer for Season 6 of the “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” then you already know that it's going to be a pretty wild ride. The ladies of this Bravo franchise never disappoint, and if the teaser is any indication of what is to come, then fans better buckle up.

OG cast member, Meredith Marks, chatted with The Daily Dish at DIRECTV's Plot Twist, and promised a “crazy” season ahead.

Over the last few years, Meredith's friendship with co-star Lisa Barlow has often taken center stage on RHOSLC. Either the women are butting heads with each other, or one of them is being targeted by the rest of the group, and according to Marks, this season will be no different.

“It's crazy. It was a little rocky for me. I mean, when you look back, it's kind of like everybody goes and gangs up on Lisa, or they gang up on me. It's pretty much one or the other, most seasons, or both of us.”

She also admitted that it is frustrating when “you hear people spreading a lot of lies about you. I don't do it to other people; I don't spread lies. I don't get it, but I don't control anyone but myself.”

According to the official Bravo statement about Season 6, Meredith's career and marriage will be heavily focused on this time around.  It says that “Resident queen of diamonds and pearls, Meredith Marks wants to transform her Park City store into a caviar lounge. She enlists the help of her husband, Seth, as an official advisor, but his assistance turns out to be more of a headache than she bargained for.”

Bravo also teases that “her standing within the circle grows increasingly uncertain, culminating in a final dinner that plays like a Greek tragedy.” In the new trailer itself, we see Meredith vacillating through a variety of emotions.

She also tells fellow RHOSLC cast member Heather Gay, “When somebody shows you who they are, you deal with them accordingly.”

The “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” premieres on Tuesday, September 16 at 8/7c on Bravo. You can then watch the episodes the next day on Peacock.

In case you missed it, or would just like a refresher, you can check out the trailer for the “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” Season 6, below!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Teresa Giudice Thinks This One Thing Is Missing From RHONJ","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhonj-teresa-giudice-pause-cast-update/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:06:03 GMT","

Teresa Giudice is dishing on that “pause” of the “Real Housewives of New Jersey,” and her hopes for the future of the series. Rumors have abounded for months, with the latest one claiming that Teresa, Margaret Josephs, Melissa Gorga, and Dolores Catania are the only cast members to have been invited back. 

The reality star recently shared her thoughts on the status of the show and what it is missing during her latest “Turning the Tables” podcast.

One of the continuing stories of RHONJ is the decade-long feud between Teresa and her sister-in-law, Melissa Gorga. During Season 15, every other cast member picked a side, leading to significant production issues. Even the normal reunion was scrapped in favor of two separate viewing parties with the cast.

On her most recent podcast episode, Teresa speculated on why things became so vicious.

“I guess they want my spot. And it's like, let's try to tear Teresa down. So if we tear her down, then we can take her spot or hurt someone that I love. That's why I'm always trying to defend myself, which is not always a fun thing to do.”

“Look, that's why now obviously we're on pause,” she said. “So hopefully, you know, something changes in the future. Because … you should be lifting each other up, not tearing … people down.”

Teresa also has been objective about what she believes has been missing from the “Real Housewives of New Jersey.”

“What we lacked on our show [is what Real Housewives of Salt Lake City has] … comedy. You want to have fun and laugh. You don't want it to be so toxic and so stressful, and for what? And I feel like that's what happened with our show.”

She further explains, “It got so dark. I mean, you saw it. I feel like everyone who really knows me, they're like, ‘That's not you, the Teresa that we see on TV.' Cause I'm so fun to hang out with. And everyone always tells me how funny I am… Where's that Teresa?” 

That darkness that she mentioned is precisely why the show was ultimately put on pause. Not only was it not fun for the cast, but it became equally difficult for the fans to watch. How do you feel about the latest rumors? Are you hoping to see Teresa, Melissa, Margaret, and Dolores return together? Can there be not just peace, but humor if they do?

The new season of RHONJ will supposedly begin filming soon.

The current season of the “Real Housewives of Orange County” has been loaded with drama. Gretchen Rossi returned after 12 years to once again go toe-to-toe with Tamra Judge. Katie Ginella has been at odds with the entire cast, and Tamra did actually quit for a hot second. 

Just when the conflict on the Bravo series might be at an all-time high, a curveball might be coming. According to a new post from Bravo and Cocktails, Alexis Bellino is being considered as a full-time housewife for Season 20 of RHOC.



Alexis was part of the Season 18 cast, and she spent most of her time either fighting with Shannon Beador or pushing her buttons. She had just gotten engaged to John Janssen, Shannon's ex. That, in itself, created a real problem between the women that lasted all season long. At the time, Janssen was also suing Shannon for $75,000, so he was a constant topic of conversation. When the season finally ended, Alexis was not asked to return for Season 19.

According to Bravo and Cocktails, “Producers have begun eyeing a full-time return for Alexis Bellino to spotlight her pre- and post-marital journey with John Janssen.” It seems that the production team may now regret choosing to keep Shannon instead of Alexis. 

Reportedly, Shannon “has been increasingly difficult to film with (refusing to reconcile with certain castmates and experiencing frequent emotional meltdowns).”

Bravo and Cocktails also have some other predictions for Season 20 of “Real Housewives of Orange County.” They believe that  Alexis, Tamra, Heather Dubrow, Emily Simpson, Gina Kirschenheiter, and Jennifer Pedranti will be full-time cast members. Gretchen may remain as a “friend” of the cast, and Katie is expected to exit the series.

Shannon has previously said that she will not film with Alexis again, so there is a pretty decent chance that she would then be offered a reduced role as a “friend” of the cast. Nothing has been confirmed yet, as Bravo likes to keep its casting under wraps until the last minute.

What do you think about the possibility of Alexis returning? If it is an either/or situation, would you rather see Alexis return and Shannon then placed in a limited role? Or would you prefer that Shannon stay on full-time and Alexis not even be part of the equation?

HBO's untitled Rachel Sennott series now has a release date — and a title. The “Bottoms” and “Shiva Baby” star and co-writer will executive produce and lead the series “I Love LA,” which will air weekly on HBO and stream on HBO Max, kicking off this fall. 

The series will center around a group of friends navigating life and love in the city of angels, like so many before them. Sennott stars as Maia, with Jordan Firstman as Charlie, Josh Hutcherson as Dylan, Odessa A'zion as Tallulah, and True Whitaker as Alani. Guest stars include Leighton Meester, Moses Ingram, Lauren Holt, Elijah Wood, Quenlin Blackwell, Josh Brener, Tim Baltz, Froy Gutierrez, and Colin Woodell. Emma Barrie, Aida Rodgers, Max Silvestri, and Lorene Scafaria also executive produce, with the eight-episode season directed by Sennott, Lorene Scafaria, Bill Benz, and Kevin Bray.

“I Love LA” was announced in fall 2024 without a title, with Sennott, Barrie, Rodgers, and Scafaria already attached. Barrie and Rodgers worked with HBO for “Barry,” while “Hustlers” filmmaker Scafaria recently contributed to “Succession.”

The show's premise and studio connection drew immediate comparisons to Lena Dunham's “Girls,” which became a blueprint for millennial ennui during its 2012-2017 run. It could also find connective tissue with Issa Rae's “Insecure,” a more recent entry in the genre of navigating one's twenties on HBO, which found vibrant storytelling opportunities in the Los Angeles setting.

Sennott spoke with IndieWire in 2023 around the release of “Bottoms,” sharing her excitement for telling off-kilter and fiercely comedic stories from the female perspective. She noted an aversion to female characters who viewers can “tell were written by a man. ‘Oh, they love each and they're silly,' that type of thing,” she said. She cited “Scott Pilgrim,” “Friday Night Lights,” “Heathers,” and more as inspirations for the tonal mashup of “Bottoms,” but also as authentic stories which resonate with audiences to this day.

“I Love LA” debuts Sunday, November 2 at 10:30 p.m. ET/PT on HBO and will be available to stream on HBO Max. New episodes will debut weekly until the finale on Sunday, December 21. Check out more images from the show below.

Netflix plans a robust Oscar push for its Cannes pick-up “Nouvelle Vague” (in theaters October 31, streaming November 14), Richard Linklater‘s love letter to Jean-Luc Godard's first film, “Breathless.” The 1960 movie, which cinematographer Raoul Coutard shot in single, silent takes on the streets of Paris, was a trailblazer in its use of natural light and disjunctive jump cuts.

Linklater's black-and-white 35mm movie is neither prequel, sequel, nor remake of Godard's film. It's not a documentary. The filmmaker simply recreates with a French cast and crew what it was like to make the film. “There's not a shot in this movie that wouldn't fit in '59 to '62 or '63,” he told IndieWire.

Netflix plans to push the film for Best Picture, Director (Linklater has been nominated once, for “Boyhood”), Actor (Aubry Dullin as Belmondo), Supporting Actor (Guillaume Marbeck as Godard), Supporting Actress (Zoey Deutch as Jean Seberg) and Screenplay (Holly Gent, Laetitia Masson, and Vincent Palmo Jr.'s script could be adapted or original). There's plenty of precedent for foreign-language movies gaining enough support for nominations in those categories, from Neon‘s “Parasite,” “Anatomy of a Fall,” and “The Worst Person in the World” to Netflix's own “Emilia Pérez,” which scored 13 nominations.

 










But the best chance for “Nouvelle Vague” to win a category is Best International Feature and Netflix fervently hopes that “Nouvelle Vague” will be on France's mid-September shortlist. North American distributors represented on that list make presentations to the 11-person Oscar selection committee as to why its film is the strongest contender. Then, they wait.

France sometimes picks well (Ladj Ly's 2020 “Les Misérables” marks its last nomination); often, it does not (the committee failed to nominate Best Original Screenplay Oscar-winner “Anatomy of a Fall”). The country has not enjoyed a Best International Feature win since “Indochine” in 1993.

Because “Nouvelle Vague” is produced by leading French distributors Laurent Pétin and Michèle Pétin with a French cast and crew, the fact that Texan Linklater directed the film starring American Zoey Deutch is not a dealbreaker. France has previously submitted non-French filmmakers, including Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven's French film “Elle,” starring Isabelle Huppert and Italian Filippo Neneghetti's “Two of Us.” Japan submitted German auteur Wim Wenders' “Perfect Days,” which was nominated in 2024.

But “Nouvelle Vague” has one serious competitor. Neon acquired French resident Jafar Panahi's Iranian drama “It Was Just an Accident” two days before it won the 2025 Palme d'Or; its French producers are Philippe Martin and David Thion, whose “Anatomy of a Fall” won the 2024 Palme d'Or (and five Oscar nominations). 

 










Neon is a veteran of the Oscar submission fray, arguing unsuccessfully for “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” (no shortlist) and “Titane” (no nomination) but landing a selection for Palme d'Or winner “Parasite,” which won the International Feature category along with Best Picture and Director.

“Nouvelle Vague” is an enjoyable romp that celebrates an icon of French cinema but did not win any Cannes prizes. “It Was Just an Accident” is serious agit-prop that continues to court controversy with its criticism of Iran's corruption. Which way will France go?

Campaigning on behalf of Neon is not only indefatigable CEO Tom Quinn but also new distribution chief and veteran Oscar whisperer Ryan Werner. And Netflix executive Lisa Taback and her awards team would like to grab a victory in this category after last year's “Emilia Pérez” imbroglio.

As for France, its film community is just rooting for an Oscar win after 32 years without.

Every year, the agents tell us the sales market at festivals takes longer to materialize, and every year they turn out to be (mostly) right. Still, before each film festival kicks off, we take the time to round up the handful of movies that could still fetch those illusory bidding wars and fantastic 8-figure deals. 

The truth is tough: only a few ever have a chance of that. But, there are plenty of smaller movies that will not only find a home, but truly deserve to, even if those final sales takes a month or more to be ironed out.

This year, we're not going to try to predict which movies will resonate and get the big dollars. Instead, we're going to tell you which potential pairings makes sense, the vibes we're getting from each of these “buzzy” films, and where we “could see” such a movie landing.

Sources have characterized this year's Toronto lineup of available sales titles as rich with compelling debuts and sophomore efforts — and largely very indie. More of the commercial-leaning indies and prestige pictures have already arrived with distributors in tow, which one executive described to IndieWire as a reflection of the industry today. The bigger-budgeted indies are still struggling to get made without the backing of a distributor in advance, and plenty of packages are simply not finding the right timing or home.

 










A handful of films, like David Mackenzie's “Fuze,” the Alan Ritchson action film “Motor City,” and “Sacrifice” with Chris Evans and Anya Taylor-Joy, are larger in scope and could fetch an aggressive deal, but the others may be ripe for the picking from some of the emerging North American distributors needing to make a splash.

“After what felt like a pretty slow Cannes for a lot of people, I'm hoping that we'll see some good activity at the market,” Christopher Casanova, head of content at Princess Pictures (“Together”) told IndieWire. “I think the emergence of new North American distributors will probably be putting a little bit of blood in the water and create a little bit more competition and activity. People will lose out in competitive scenarios and then be hell bent on trying to find something else.”

Director: Alex WinterSection: TIFF Gala PresentationFeels Like: “Raising Arizona,” “Burn After Reading”We Could See It At: Paramount, Searchlight/Hulu

After making a string of documentaries, “Bill & Ted” star Alex Winter turns to comedy with “Adulthood,” in which Josh Gad and Kaya Scodelario play siblings who return to their childhood home to care for their dying mother, only to discover their parents have kept a dead body in the basement. It's been described to us as an examination of the American Dream and the lengths people will go to keep it. The wacky yet commercial tones make it attractive for a number of buyers, but maybe even Paramount under its new leadership, as its specialized division Republic Pictures is repping it. 

 










Director: Jonatan EtzlerSection: TIFF Special PresentationFeels Like: “Sick of Myself,” “Twinless”We Could See It At: A24, Neon

Saoirse Ronan walks a fine tight rope in this dark satire about a school teacher who inadvertently locks her worst student — one bad apple poisoning the bunch — in her basement. It's a new look for the inherently likeable Ronan, who frequently makes you uncomfortable in a good way, as the film's blend of Scandinavian humor and wry British wit will force audiences to grapple with right and wrong.

Director: James McAvoySection: TIFF Special PresentationFeels Like: “Kneecap”We Could See It At: Sony Pictures Classics, Focus Features

James McAvoy's directorial debut is this true story of essentially the Scottish Milli Vanilli, two rappers who struck it big as the 2000s rap duo Silibil N' Brains by posing as Americans from California rather than blokes with accents from across the pond. 

Director: Adam Carter RehmeierSection: TIFF CentrepieceFeels Like: “Bonnie and Clyde”We Could See It At: Bleecker Street, Magnolia

Described to us as a character-driven crime thriller from the director of “Dinner for America,” “Carolina Caroline” reunites director Rehmeier with Kyle Gallner and pairs him with Samara Weaving and Kyra Sedgwick in what could be a genre film with some theatrical potential.

 










Director: Tom Dean and Mac EldridgeSection: TIFF Special PresentationFeels Like: “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” “(500) Days of Summer”We Could See It At: Amazon, Searchlight/Hulu

Tom Dean's weepy romance has the gloss and nostalgia that could easily appeal to the YA crowd, but it also has some depth with a story that jumps back and forth across time periods and stretches across at least a decade to also reach a more elevated audience. Emilia Jones and Nick Robinson are talented young actors with great chemistry that could also give the movie some theatrical legs before it winds up a streaming play. 

Director: Steven SoderberghSection: TIFF Special PresentationsFeels Like: “Ocean's Eleven,” “Logan Lucky”We Could See It At: HBO Max, Apple

Steven Soderbergh is back in his commercial and satirical mode after a few more serious genre experiments. “The Christophers” stars Ian McKellen and Michaela Coel and is described as a fun, black comedy set in the art world. Ed Solomon, who wrote “Men in Black” and Soderbergh's “No Sudden Move,” wrote the script for what could be a big one.

Director: David MichôdSection: TIFF Special PresentationFeels Like: “Southpaw,” “The Smashing Machine”We Could See It At: Neon, Black Bear

 










We know Sydney Sweeney is going through a rough publicity period at the moment, but there's been plenty of hype to see how the “Euphoria” actress would undergo the physical transformation to portray boxer Christy Martin. Sweeney is producing the film as well, and we could see her reconnecting with her “Immaculate” partners at Neon for this one, but financiers Black Bear may want to keep it for themselves for their newly-launched distribution division.

Director: Gus Van SantSection: Venice Out of CompetitionFeels Like: “Dog Day Afternoon”We Could See It At: Apple, Lionsgate

If Gus Van Sant's first film since 2018 reminds you of “Dog Day Afternoon,” it won't just be because Al Pacino is in it. Producer Sam Pressman told us the Sidney Lumet heist film was a big touchstone for screenwriter Austin Kolodney, who adapted the true story of Tony Kiritsis, a man who takes hostage a manager at a loan company with a sawed-off shotgun, feeling exploited and disenfranchised by the system. Pressman has worked with Lionsgate on “The Crow” and the new “American Psycho” and just sold a Jack Thorne project to Apple.

Director: Bobby FarrellySection: TIFF Gala PresentationFeels Like: Gen-Z “Ferris Bueller's Day Off” or “The Breakfast Club”We Could See It At: Netflix, Focus Features

 










Word is that Bobby Farrelly's comedy about a high schooler who steals his school's driver's education car to win back his college girlfriend is a sweet and delightful crowdpleaser and could be a no-brainer for a streamer. Though we hear “Driver's Ed” has already tested strongly in theaters, especially with the under-30 crowd, and that the combination of Farrelly's comedic chops with the “Outer Banks” producers courting the YA crowd, it could be a winner. The film stars “White Lotus” actor Sam Nivola, who could be poised for a breakout, as well as Molly Shannon and Kumail Nanjiani.

Director: Nic PizzolattoSection: TIFF Special PresentationFeels Like: “The Last Showgirl”We Could See It At: Netflix, Amazon

Just as Pamela Anderson found a new phase of her career with “The Last Showgirl” about a Vegas performer whose show is closing, Vince Vaughn now plays a Vegas crooner in a similar situation looking for his last shot. Between this and “Nonnas” on Netflix, the “Wedding Crashers” star is having his own moment and gravitating toward more serious material. The starry cast assembled by the “True Detective” creator, including Al Pacino, Simon Rex, Cobie Smulders, Kate Mara, and Shania Twain, should easily get the attention of a deep-pocketed streamer. 

 










Director: Pete OhsSection: TIFF CentrepieceFeels Like: Great question!We Could See It At: MUBI, Janus Films

There's a lot of hype around what feels like a true indie with no good comps in “Erupjca,” a movie filmed guerilla-style, on the run, and in secret throughout Warsaw, and that's because it's one of the many titles pop star Charli XCX has on the docket. “Erupjca” means “eruption” in Polish, typically of a volcano, but in this case the release of emotional tension on display between a British tourist and Polish florist.

Director: John EarlySection: TIFF DiscoveryFeels Like: “Friendship,” “Stress Positions”We Could See It At: A24

The directorial debut for alt-comic John Early, in which he plays a female foodie and content creator with an eating disorder, screams a movie that will be a cult hit and make Early a household name if it finds the right audience and gets solid reviews. The film satirizes influencer culture and has a great cast of other comedians, including Vanessa Bayer, Kate Berlant, and Conner O'Malley.

Director: Ben WheatleySection: TIFF Midnight MadnessFeels Like: “Nobody”We Could See It At: IFC Films, Amazon

Bob Odenkirk is really settling into this “John Wick” with a sense of humor action hero role, and “Normal” brings Ben Wheatley back to more indie roots while pairing him with “John Wick” screenwriter Derek Kolstad. Depending on how it's received, we can see a genre player like IFC nab it, but Amazon already has a number of international territories should it wish to add the U.S. to the mix. 

 










Director: Curry BarkerSection: TIFF Midnight MadnessFeels Like: “Barbarian,” “Skinamarink”We Could See It At: Shudder

Curry Barker broke out last year with a horror short called “Milk & Serial” released to YouTube that he made for essentially pocket change of $800, and he's now getting the chance to make a feature on a much, much larger scale. “Obsession” is about a man who wishes on a trinket to make his crush fall in love with him, leading to sinister, supernatural results. 

Director: Romain GavrasSection: TIFF Special PresentationsFeels Like: “Athena,” “Triangle of Sadness”We Could See It At: Netflix, Focus Features

Gavras broke out with his French thriller “Athena” back in 2022, and “Sacrifice” now gives him an English-speaking cast of stars including Chris Evans, Vincent Cassel, Anya Taylor-Joy, Salma Hayek Pinault, John Malkovich, and Charli XCX. “Sacrifice” is described as a thriller, but also a satire of billionaires and A-listers and so-called do-gooders. The film's scope and heftier budget make it most likely a play for potentially a Netflix reunion or a deeper-pocketed studio arm able to give it a wide theatrical release. 

We're also keeping an eye on: “New Year's Rev,” “Hamlet,” “Motor City,” “You Had to Be There,” “Marc By Sofia,” “Barrio Triste,” “Tuner,” “Poetic License,” “Fuze,” “In the Hand of Dante,” and “Couture.”

Chloé Zhao was the toast of the 2020-2021 very long, deep-COVID-era Oscar season with the sweeping dominance of “Nomadland” at every ceremony up through the Oscars. The “Songs My Brother Taught Me” and “The Rider” director — known for her vérité-like, immersive portraits of marginalized groups, told in their own environments — then pivoted to tentpole franchise filmmaker with the release of Marvel's “Eternals.” The film received mixed reviews, and was still up against a depressed COVID box-office rebound anyway, but still carried her signature naturalistic stamp where possible.

 










Enter her next feature film “Hamnet,” a period historical drama starring Jessie Buckley as Agnes Shakespeare and Paul Mescal as William Shakespeare himself. Based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel, the film puts a fictional, what-might-have-been spin on their devastating romance and the grief they faced over the death of their 11-year-old son. Working with cinematographer Łukasz Żal (“The Zone of Interest”) and composer Max Richter (“The Leftovers”), Zhao also has the sort of powerful producers on board that come with a venerated record of their own: Sam Mendes and Steven Spielberg.

But after the project was initially brought to Zhao, development continued (even without mentioning “Hamnet” itself) at the 2022 Telluride Film Festival, where both Buckley, for Sarah Polley's “Women Talking,” and Mescal, for “Aftersun,” were roaming the Colorado mountain town. Zhao found actors she wanted to work with, and then took a crack at opening O'Farrell's book. (Vanity Fair has the first scoop on the film's production.)

“Hamnet,” which shot in Wales last year with period favorites Joe Alwyn and Emily Watson also in the cast, is said to be a major tearjerker by audiences who've seen it. Since the Toronto Film Festival has billed the film as a Canadian premiere, and it's not playing Venice, so we can assume it'll be at Telluride this weekend. Buckley meanwhile features in another fall festival premiere: Charlie Kaufman's short “How to Shoot a Ghost” at Venice, her second film with the Oscar winner after “I'm Thinking of Ending Things.”

After its festival run, “Hamnet” opens in select theaters November 27 before debuting nationwide December 12 from Focus Features, timed for awards season. More on the film in IndieWire's fall festival preview here.

Over the course of the past decade, novelist Ruth Ware has churned out a new thriller just about every year, twisty little gems that smack of Agatha Christie and give plenty of space for complicated, interesting female characters at their heart. Of course, Ware's bestselling novels also feel ready-made for the big and small screen, so it's only surprising that we're just now getting the first adaptation of a Ware hit.

First out of the gate: “The Woman in Cabin 10,” starring Keira Knightley and based on Ware's 2016 novel of the same name. While the Netflix movie will arrive later this fall, other Ware adaptations are in the offing: New Line Cinema has the rights to “In a Dark, Dark Wood,” while Entertainment One has TV rights to “The Lying Game” and Universal International Studios is developing “Zero Days” for TV as well.

But “The Woman in Cabin 10” is a fine pick for Ware's first adaptation, and one that gets to the heart of what makes her stories so compulsively readable (and, as surely Netflix brass are betting and hoping, compulsively watchable too). Plus: rich crazy people actin' badly on a yacht, always a bankable sub-genre.

 










Per Netflix, the film‘s official synopsis is as such: “While on board a luxury yacht for a travel assignment, a journalist — Lo (played by Knightley) — witnesses a passenger thrown overboard late at night, only to be told that it didn't happen, as all passengers and crew are accounted for. Despite no one believing her, she continues to look for answers, putting her own life in danger.”

Added Ware in her own statement, “At its heart, the film is about a woman who experiences something wrong, reports it truthfully, and isn't taken seriously because of who she is. Too many people know what that feels like and I think we want vindication for ourselves as much as Lo.”

The first trailer provides plenty of evidence of Lo's terror: she sees a body go overboard, and oops, is promptly told by just about everyone around her that she's nuts. Don't say that to a woman. Don't say that to a woman journalist.

Guy Pearce, David Ajala, Hannah Waddingham, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw also star, along with Art Malik, Kaya Scodelario, David Morrissey, Daniel Ings, Gitte Witt, Christopher Rygh, Pippa Bennett-Warner, John MacMillan, Paul Kaye, Amanda Collin, and Lisa Loven Kongsli. Simon Stone directs from a script he cowrote with Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse.

The film will start streaming on Netflix on Friday, October 10. Watch the first trailer for “The Woman in Cabin 10” below.

The buzz is already out: Searchlight Pictures is really high on Bradley Cooper‘s “Is This Thing On?,” the New York Film Festival closing night title that seems likely to be a prime awards season contender. After just a few assorted first look images, the film‘s first full-length trailer gives a better look at the spirit and tone of the film, Cooper's third directorial outing. 

The movie stars Will Arnett, who also co-wrote the film, as a New York City stand-up comedian having a midlife crisis after a split from his wife, played by Laura Dern. The film is loosely based on the experience of British comedian John Bishop and is framed as a love letter to the Big Apple, and was shot all around the city by Cooper's cinematographer on “A Star Is Born” and “Maestro,” Matthew Libatique, who's returning as DP. As he said on “The Pat McAfee Show,” Cooper will also be making his debut as camera operator on the film, however.

“I'll operate the camera, which I'm very excited about because we did some stuff. We went down to Chinatown and it's been amazing,” Cooper said. He also acknowledged he “joined the union” in order to be able to be camera operator, likely the International Cinematographer's Guild IATSE Local 600 for camera operators.

According to the New York Film Festival's official description: “In a pair of galvanizing, deeply honest performances, Will Arnett and Laura Dern play Alex and Tess Novak, whose marriage has reached an impasse. With amicable sorrow, the couple — parents of two young boys — mutually agree to split up. Yet in director Bradley Cooper's keenly observed comic drama, their separation leads to unpredictable midlife self-reckonings, most dramatically in Alex's wild career pivot to become a confessional stand-up comedian in New York City's West Village, where he finds new direction and camaraderie.

“This seemingly outlandish scenario — in a script by Cooper, Arnett, and Mark Chappell inspired by the true story of British comedian John Bishop — is never played for easy laughs, while Cooper uses his penchant for naturalism to give the actors space to find their complicated centers. In his beautifully lived-in third feature following ‘A Star Is Born' and ‘Maestro' (NYFF61), Cooper confirms his dexterity for representing the complexities of human relationships, constructing a film that is both lacerating and sweet-souled, funny and tender.”

After its NYFF premiere, Searchlight will release the film in select theaters on Friday, December 19. Watch the trailer below.

August 26, 2025

Like a lot of people who live deep in their own brains, Water From Your Eyes' Nate Amos and Rachel Brown use humor as a smokescreen. “There's nothing about that song that isn't funny to me,” Amos once said of “Barley,” a mathematical-philosophical puzzle masquerading as a dance-punk rave-up, and a highlight of their 2023 Matador debut, Everyone's Crushed. “‘Remember Not My Name' is the funniest song on the album to me,” Brown said of another Everyone's Crushed standout, a pathos-soaked slow jam about the vulnerability of infatuation. And here's that word again: “I was very anti-guitar for a long time, and then I realised that guitar is actually really funny,” Amos recently said of the stylistic turn the band takes on its thrilling new album, It's a Beautiful Place. “Like, nothing's funnier than a guitar solo.”

A two-person mind meld fueled by inside jokes and existential awe, Water From Your Eyes are unreliable narrators who can be counted on to perplex, enthrall, and occasionally shred. Their music is antic and turbulent in equal measure, marked by strange time signatures, stylistic pileups, and conflicted emotions hidden behind dazed grins. They are sufficiently schooled in the pop canon to confidently reshape it, balancing easy listening and serialism, industrial dance and microtonal composition, while invoking acts like Cake, Sting, and Red Hot Chili Peppers as reference points for their idiosyncratic, omnivorous brand of art pop—theoretically defensible comparisons, but also patently absurd.

To call It's a Beautiful Place merely “funny” would be like calling Fargo a workplace comedy about a used-car salesman, or Being John Malkovich a mistaken-identity rom com. And while the guitar forms the backbone of Water From Your Eyes' new album, to call it their “guitar record” would miss the astonishing range they wring from the instrument: pummeling post-hardcore, shoegaze, '90s alt-rock, '80s jangle, indie dance, prog, and even some ramshackle country rock that sounds not unlike, well, the Chili Peppers cosplaying as a podunk bar band—all held together with calming atmospheric sketches, eye-wateringly complex drum programming, and some of the most serenely searching vocals that Brown has brought to the project yet. Not to mention some blistering guitar solos.

After the relative darkness of 2023's Everyone's Crushed, an album steeped in pandemic angst, political turmoil, and Amos' rocky efforts to get sober, the band suggested that the follow-up would be more “hopeful.” On the surface, It's a Beautiful Place frequently is more upbeat and certainly more energized: Following a brief ambient teaser, the album lurches into action with “Life Signs,” the duo's most intense song to date. Jagged power chords trade off with spidery riffs, all in a destabilizing 5/4 time signature that recalls hardcore deconstructionists Shudder to Think or math rockers Don Caballero. “Go to hell/Take the train/Generations/Learned impatience,” intones Brown, channeling rap-rock's drawn-out cadences into a sleepwalker's murmur before summoning Stereolab's coolly angelic tones in the luminous, enigmatic chorus: “What's on the record/Life in a small town/Fifth and a first sound.” Your guess is as good as mine, but the feel of their singing, combined with Amos' buoyant jazz harmonies, is life-affirming, soul-cleansing.

As they did on 2021's concise yet intricate Structure, Water From Your Eyes once again prove that three perfect songs is all that one side of an LP really needs. “Nights in Armor”—written for Amos' This Is Lorelei and then reworked—shuttles between glinting, Sarah Records-caliber indie pop, metal-adjacent chugging, and atonal skronk; part grunge and part shoegaze, “Born 2” traverses an Escherian staircase of changing keys that summits repeatedly on a note of fist-pumping triumph. Lyrically, it might be the most straightforwardly political thing that they've written, but the meaning is as cryptic as ever. For all the song's promise of limitless possibility (“Born to become/Something else/Something melts”), Brown repeatedly drives home a single word—“psychopath”—like a silvery nail in a varnished coffin.

The second half repeats the format: three proper songs rounded out with two ambient sketches, but this time, one track hogs the spotlight: “Playing Classics,” a madcap dance-punk romp partially inspired by Charli XCX's “Club Classics.” Its ebullience is almost awkward; its mismatching parts—disco hi-hats, Eurodance bass, too-bright keys, overdriven guitar solo, snatches of vocoder teased and just as quickly abandoned—summed up in the record's most utopian sentiment: “Practice shake it you're free.” I suspect it will be the album's big hit, certainly in a live context. I don't like it as much as anything on the A-side, but it is, truly, the album's funniest song.

B-side opener “Spaceship,” though, is another roller coaster of backmasked guitars and shifting time signatures, closer in feel to the A-side's contorted alt-rock. It's hard to overstate how effortless Water From Your Eyes make even the most complicated grooves feel, and Brown's hopeful singing (“So you dream, you build, you change/The cage looks like a window pane”) only adds to the suggestion of weightlessness. The country-fried “Blood on the Dollar,” on the other hand, feels almost like a demo, a bare-bones sketch for fuzzed-out guitar and muted drums. Slipping across slant rhymes and a sidelong Pixies reference, Brown might be singing about the end of empire, or the ennui of life online. The album's lyrics never reveal anything as clear-cut as the thematic talking points—space, dinosaurs, measuring human existence on a cosmic scale—the duo routinely trots out in interviews, but that's a point in favor of Brown's suggestively mysterious writing. The duo's banter may often resemble low-stakes brainrot, but Brown's writing reaches beyond stoned dorm-room riffing into places where the punchlines dissolve.

“It's either nothing is important or everything is important,” Brown recently told Fader; in context, they were talking about the cosmic existentialism that informs It's a Beautiful Place, but it also feels like a fair assessment of Water From Your Eyes' almost obsessive attention to detail. One detail in particular sticks out on this captivating, ambitious album: “For Mankind,” the ambient sketch that closes the record, is made of exactly the same sounds as the intro, “One Small Step”—a queasy wash of what might be a whirly tube run through digital processing, or perhaps a family of chipper sea lions. If you listen to the album on a loop, “For Mankind” will blur seamlessly back into “One Small Step,” effectively enclosing you within Water From Your Eyes' invented universe. A front-row seat for the Amos-Brown mind meld—sprawling, amorphous, hermetic, overwhelming, heartbreaking, funny as hell. It's a privileged vantage point.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced that they are engaged to be married. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨,” the superstar musician and professional football player wrote in their joint Instagram post.

Swift and Kelce began dating in 2023 after the Kansas City Chiefs tight end publicly expressed his interest in the singer. Kelce attended the Eras Tour stop at his team's home venue, GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, and later told his brother, on their podcast, New Heights, that he made a bracelet that he wanted to give Swift after the show. Eventually, in September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs game, and she later said that she and Kelce were a couple by that time. In the ensuing months, Swift attended more football games, Kelce went to more Eras Tour shows, and they generally did a lot of things together. Recently, Swift went on New Heights to discuss her new album, The Life of a Showgirl.

Before dating Kelce, Swift's longest relationship was with the actor Joe Alwyn, whom she dated for about six years. She briefly dated numerous notable figures—including Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Jake Gyllenhaal, Harry Styles, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and Matthew Healy—but had never been engaged.

Kelce was the star of a 2016 reality show called Catching Kelce that was designed for him to find a partner. (Maya Benberry won the show, but her relationship with Kelce did not last long.) He also dated the social media influencer Kayla Nicole for a number of years, before breaking up in 2022. Like Swift, Kelce has not previously been engaged to be married.

							By 

	Jon Dolan



	Indie-rock heroes Spoon are back with two new songs. The Austin, Texas, band just surprise-released “Chateau Blues” and “Guess I'm Fallin' In Love,” quintessential examples of the kind of sharp guitar bangers the band has been doing well for decades. It's the first new music they've put out since their excellent 2022 album, Lucifer on the Sofa. That album was a potent return to straight-ahead, band-in-a-room rock after a couple records that leaned more into studio craft, and everything about their new music suggests their next album will continue in that vein. “The songs that we've done so far for the first half of the record are very rock-forward,” says frontman Britt Daniel. “They've been very extroverted-feeling.”


	Daniel says “Chateau Blues” began as a “as a country bar-band sort of swing,” and then evolved into a driving rocker. “I had this vision one morning as I was waking up of ‘Chateau Blues' as a rock song. So I rewrote it as a song led by a riff — same key, same lyrics, almost the same melody — but the riff gave it life, and we added that Topper Headon-esque machine-gun beat, and it was suddenly like, ‘OK, yeah, this is definitely the way the song is meant to be.' It's a song about a man in his self-imposed exile, written from the point of view of his Uber driver.”

	











	“Guess I'm Fallin' In Love,” which shares a title with an old Velvet Underground tune, is moodier and droney but no less catchy. “Musically, it's sort of like a modal spaghetti-western-type thing,” Daniel says. “It has this sort of low, slightly evil vibe to it. It's about being wary of falling in love, feeling a bit unsold on the idea even as you feel like it might be happening. It started with the framing story of One Thousand and One Nights for the starting point and I ran from that.”

	The band has been dividing time between their longtime home base of Austin and drummer Jim Eno's new home of Providence, Rhode Island, working with producer Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Nine Inch Nails, St. Vincent). Daniel says the album is about halfway done, and doesn't have a release date or title yet. “If you went by what I've been listening to the most recently, it's a cross between CCR and Jessica Pratt, but I don't know if you hear that in those songs,” he says.

	While almost everything they've done so far is upbeat, it's not all tough guitar rock, particularly a slow song Daniel really likes called “Midnight Radio Stars.” “My mom told me we should write some ballads. So i got to it,” says Daniel. He notes that Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, who produced a pair of Spoon records in the 2010s, gave him the same advice: “He suggested I write a song like ‘Are You Lonely Tonight.' I don't think it's like that, but it's cool. It's a lovely song. We worked on it for two or three days and I got into that mood. I felt sultry by the end of it.”


Lucifer on the Sofa felt like a career capstone for Spoon, attaining nearly universal critical acclaim, making it into the Top Ten of the rock album charts, and notching a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album. Daniel says he found attending the Grammy ceremony itself “a bit stale,” adding, “It doesn't feel like it's made for anything other than the TV. They don't sell drinks in the arena that night. It's not a vibe.”


	Still, the night did involve one memory he'll be able to treasure for life. “We got to meet Paul McCartney,” he says. “We'd never never met him before. He came out and talked to us. I think someone told him there were some guys over there who want to meet you. But, you know, what can I say? The guy is 80-plus years old, and when we left the party, he was dancing. He'd been dancing all night and he was still dancing. It was really pretty magical to see.”


	Along with releasing the new songs, Spoon are also kicking off a month-long tour with the Pixies, one of the all-time great indie-rock bands and a huge influence on Daniel growing up. “This is something I'm not jaded about at all,” he says of the chance to hi the road with his heroes. “When I was in the later years of high school and into college, the Pixies and the Velvet Underground were it. That was how I wanted to write songs. That was the peak of cool for me.”

	Both the Pixies and Spoon have enjoyed long, successful careers — the Pixies' first record came out in 1987, Spoon made their debut in 1996. But it wasn't always easy sledding for Spoon. In the Nineties, they were signed and quickly dropped by major label Elektra Records, and summed up the experience with a song called “The Agony of Lafitte” (famously named after their former A&R guy). In 2000, they were the subject of a classic Village Voice article about the perils of indie rock in its post-1990s-boom phase that made Spoon beloved underdogs to many music fans. The band bounced back and went on a run of great albums beginning with 2002's Kill the Moonlight (Number 123 on Rolling Stone‘s 250 Best Albums of the 21st Century), and they're still going stronger than ever today. Now, they're one year away from celebrating their 30th anniversary.


	“We hadn't really hit our stride when that [Village Voice] article came out, but nobody really knew that at the time. We didn't either,” Daniel says. “It's always seemed like the right thing to do to make another record. Whenever we needed to take a break, we do. Maybe that's it. And the break doesn't need to be very long… Maybe we're just fuckin' well-adjusted.”

Lil Nas X has returned to social media for the first time since he was arrested and charged with four felonies earlier this week. On Monday, the rapper pleaded not guilty after he was accused of charging at Los Angeles police officers while roaming the streets of Studio City in his underwear and a pair of cowboy boots in a disconcerted state over the weekend.


	“Your girl is gonna be okay, y'all,” the artist born Montero Lamar Hill said in an Instagram Story post. “Okay? She's gonna be alright. Shit.” Letting out a tired laugh, he continued: “That was fucking terrifying. That was terrifying. That was a terrifying last four days. But your girl is gonna be alright.”


	Hill was arrested after being found early last Friday morning, around 6 a.m. local time. In videos captured by spectators and shared with TMZ, he spoke incoherently to the person behind the camera. The footage showed him in a visibly disheveled state, and, in one clip, he was seen wearing an orange traffic cone on his head.

	











	Prior to his arrest, Hill shared a series of bizarre posts on Instagram, which sparked concern, though some predicted he could be amping up controversy ahead of a new music era. Last week, he shared unreleased music and mirror selfies, plus artwork and piles of miscellaneous objects in what appeared to be his home. The arrest quelled rumors that he was engaging in a marketing stunt.

	Police initially transported Hill to a nearby hospital for a possible overdose. He spent several hours there before being taken to jail, where he spent the weekend. According to the police, Hill “charged” at officers when they tried to confront him when they arrived on the scene. 

	











	A judge set Hill's bail for $75,000 and ordered him to attend four Narcotics Anonymous meetings a week or attend outpatient treatment. He was charged with three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting an executive officer, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office confirmed to Rolling Stone.

Donald Trump is waging a fascist takeover of the United States, siccing the Justice Department on his political enemies while deploying federal troops to “liberate” Washington, D.C., where crime has been steadily declining. Democratic politicians are responding the only way they know how: by heeding the advice of the wonks who helped get them into this situation in the first place — and whose advice is to avoid discussing what Trump is doing.


Blue Rose Research, the firm led by Democratic establishment darling David Shor, produced a memo earlier this month digging into the effectiveness of various messages related to Trump's takeover of Washington, D.C. The firm advised that messaging around Trump's “rising authoritarianism” was “highly unconvincing,” while messages that say Trump wants to “distract” from his damaging tariffs or horrifying Medicaid cuts were more effective. Meanwhile, Republican messaging about how Trump is clamping down on gang violence tested through the roof.

	











	The Aug. 15 memo, a copy of which was reviewed by Rolling Stone, could explain, at least partially, why Democrats haven't exactly been going to the mat over Trump sending the military into the nation's capital and him threatening to do the same in other liberal strongholds. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) was asked Sunday on CNN what the party's plan is to fight the president sending troops into Chicago. He only offered that Trump has no authority to do this, and that he supports the men and women working in law enforcement. He also, as the Blue Rose memo suggested is effective, cast the federal takeover as a “distraction” from Trump's unpopular policies. Jeffries didn't seem too worked up about any of this, delivering his talking points with a complacency that certainly did not bely that the United States is currently experiencing a militarized dismantling of representative democracy.

	











	Republicans appear convinced — despite the polling data and public backlash to the contrary — that Trump's military deployments and hostile takeovers on American soil can be a win-win situation for them politically. Various operatives and administration officials tell Rolling Stone that the “tough on crime” politics typically redound to their favor, so they welcome Democrats picking that fight. However, two Trump advisers note, if Democratic figures try to avoid the subject, or tread too gingerly, they risk looking weak to the public in the face of Trump's displays of armed military force.

	“Any Democrat who has to take a poll to find out that voters want to be safe from violent criminals has a more fundamental problem,” says John McLaughlin, one of Trump's top pollsters.


	While Blue Rose Research isn't a household name, the firm has enormous sway in the Democratic Party and with the liberal pundit class. Vox has described Blue Rose's leader, Shor, as perhaps “the most influential data scientist in the Democratic Party.” After the election, New York Times liberal columnist and podcaster Ezra Klein invited Shor to explain why Trump won, characterizing him as “a very skilled interpreter of data” who “has gotten a lot of things right before other people did.” 


	Klein helpfully noted that Shor “works with campaigns and progressive groups, so he has a perspective from the inside,” without explaining the full significance of Shor and Blue Rose's work to try to elect Kamala Harris, which failed spectacularly. 


	As the Times explained elsewhere, Blue Rose handled much of the ad testing for the Super PAC Future Forward as it worked to support Harris' campaign. Blue Rose's team was effectively embedded within Future Forward, which served as Harris' primary outside spender and spent $560 million to boost the Democratic ticket in 2024. It's worth noting that many of the ads run by Future Forward were completely unwatchable — overstuffed with tidbits about various policies, provided too quickly for a casual viewer to process and often presented by random narrators.

	Blue Rose has worked with much of the Democratic Party apparatus — the Democratic National Committee; the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and its outside spending arm, Senate Majority PAC; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and its independent arm, House Majority PAC.


	The firm is prone to bold proclamations. Among its contributions to the 2024 campaign was the idea that running negative ads against Trump was ineffective, and contrast was more important, according to people familiar with the Blue Rose operation. (Democratic National Committee officials are still incensed that Future Forward eschewed attacks on Trump.) Another was that the Super PAC should deploy its ads late in the campaign, when the cake was already nearly baked.

	











	These proclamations are typically based on experiments, randomized-controlled trials, that are supposed to determine the efficacy of ads and messages. Critics question whether this is a viable way to test the impact of political messages, as well as the methodology — which Blue Rose doesn't share — based, in part, on who exactly is participating in its web panels. 


	Jake Grumbach, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, made an apparent dig at the methodology on Sunday, joking on X that the Democratic Party is being run by “people who sign up to take online surveys about the persuasiveness of various digital campaign messaging vignettes via consumer reward programs.”


	One progressive research expert says the people participating in Blue Rose's randomized-controlled trials are “terminally online people who take a lot of surveys for some kind of compensation.” (Another source put it more bluntly, describing the participants as “weirdos.”)


	Blue Rose did not respond to a request for comment from Rolling Stone.


	A common criticism of the Blue Rose model is that virtually no one consumes political ads or messages the way these participants are viewing them. Most people watching TV or scrolling through their social media tune out such messages or skip right past them; an ad needs to grab their attention in a way that won't be replicated in the tests.


	“A message nobody hears cannot persuade them,” says the progressive research expert. “They're testing with a captive audience when their task is to actually get heard — meaning get people to stop scrolling in the first place. What they've tested is so bland no one is going to notice.”


	There's also the issue of what the firm is measuring. The questions about Trump's takeover, for instance, were designed to measure how certain messages affect whether people do or don't approve of Trump. 


	A Democratic Party operative says that's “not how people's brains work, it's not how the media environment works.” The progressive research expert says that “Trump disapproval is a meaningless metric,” adding, rhetorically, “What do you get if more people disapprove of Trump?” 


	Talking about Blue Rose's advice to Democrats to sidestep the topic of Trump's military takeover, the Democratic Party operative notes: “Trump taking over D.C. by police force is salient right now. If you open up Instagram, it's all you're looking at — it's out there, and people are seeing it. You can't choose what's salient.”

	











	The operative notes that Blue Rose is, of course, selecting what messages to test. The messages are often written by its team — and those messages aren't necessarily good. 


	Indeed, by its own metrics, the firm's messages calling Trump's military takeover a distraction from tariffs and Medicaid cuts only tested in the 52nd and 51st percentiles among the messages it's tested so far this year — or “barely above average,” as the firm noted. Why not try writing more messages?


	“If you try a message and it doesn't work, the conclusion shouldn't be that there's no way to talk about this,” the operative says, adding that Blue Rose puts out its advice “with a lot of authority, and people listen to it.”


	Beyond the basic premise, the methodology, and the messages the firm is choosing to test, there is something fundamentally unsettling about Blue Rose's approach — and that of the Democratic Party — to Trump 2.0 overall.


	In the military takeover messaging memo, the firm advised Democrats that people basically don't want to hear about it — as Trump prepared to expand the military crackdown to other blue cities. Messages about Trump being a “wannabe dictator” tested poorly, yet Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday, “A lot of people are saying maybe we'd like a dictator.” Messages about Trump putting “democracy at risk” tested badly, but just three days after the memo was released, Trump was promising to sign an unconstitutional executive order asserting that states follow his own rules for elections.


	Trump is attempting a fascist power grab, out in the open, for all the world to see — and Democratic leaders and their wonks don't feel like it's worth their time to even warn the public about what Trump is doing, or what he's likely to do next, let alone try to stop him. But what else, exactly, should America's opposition party be doing right now?


	As the progressive research expert puts it, “It's absolutely mind-boggling to be discussing message testing in response to abductions, concentration camp construction, and unleashing [the] military on Americans.”


	One Democrat who hasn't been afraid to call out Trump's regime is Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor and Harris' vice presidential candidate. 


	“I am willing to say each and every one of us are unified around the idea that this cruelty must end, this slow-rolling attempt at undermining democracy,” Walz said on Monday during a Democratic National Committee meeting. “I always get in trouble for it and I'll continue to say it, and I don't think we do ourselves any favors when we don't name it: These are fascist policies.”

	Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, meanwhile, on Monday posted a photo of himself standing alongside other Democratic officials in Chicago. “I am sounding the alarm on the real crisis we face today,” he wrote. “Donald Trump's overreach is what our founders warned against — it is unprecedented, unwarranted, and un-American.  There's no emergency here that calls for military intervention.


	Pritzker and Walz might have just failed the Blue Rose message test. On the other hand, they're actually doing their jobs.

Jon Hamm is tapping into a little luck and a lot of fun as the new brand ambassador for BetMGM, the popular sports betting and iGaming operator. 


	Hamm appears in BetMGM's new “Make It Legendary” commercial, which features the Emmy-winning actor narrating the tale of a group of friends who are stranded at a dive bar during a freak storm. They're met by a cast of questionable characters and unfriendly glances, but when the friends pull out the BetMGM app for a live parlay, predictably the place goes wild. 


	At once cheeky and charming, the first of the new Hamm-starring spots can be previewed below. It is also scheduled to premiere this weekend during Saturday's college football games. BetMGM says five additional spots starring Hamm will roll out later this year across TV, social, digital and BetMGM properties nationwide. 


	The “Make It Legendary” campaign aims to highlight BetMGM's entertainment offerings, which range from casino play and online gaming, to sports betting and poker tournaments. BetMGM's online gaming businesses also include Borgata Casino, Party Casino and Party Poker. The brand says the new ads showcase “BetMGM's dynamic entertainment ecosystem — one that unlocks a world of possibilities, elevated experiences and exceptional hospitality.” 




	Hamm was an obvious choice for the campaign, according to Chief Marketing Officer, Casey Hurbis. “Our new positioning celebrates the thrill, spectacle and storytelling potential in every spin, play and reward,” he says. “With Jon Hamm's talent and universal appeal, he's a natural fit to represent the refined essence of our brand.”




	“BetMGM is all about style, and the ‘Make it Legendary' campaign captures that energy,” Hamm shares in a statement. “It's witty, cinematic, and shows that betting with BetMGM is an unmatched experience.”


	While BetMGM is commonly associated with Vegas, the company is actually based in New Jersey, and the new spot was filmed in the Garden State at a hot dog joint in Clifton called Rutt's Hut. The clever clip also hits a lighter beat for the company, which hopes to win over players of all ages and skill levels by promoting its accessible and beginner-friendly offerings. 


	“This isn't just a campaign — it's a reimagining of what BetMGM stands for,” Hurbis says. “We're at the forefront of entertainment and gaming, with the spirit of Las Vegas woven into our DNA.”

	BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt has confirmed that Hamm signed on to be the face of the company as part of a multiyear deal, calling it “the largest rebrand” in company history.


	Hamm, meantime, is coming off the first season of his Apple TV+ show, Your Friends & Neighbors, which recently got renewed for season two.

	In the spring of 1997, Deadheads tuning in to The Grateful Dead Hour, the nationally syndicated radio show, heard a rare if disconcerting treat. Over two installments, host and Dead historian David Gans played the complete tape of Jerry Garcia's last show with the band from two years before, at Chicago's Soldier Field stadium. “I found it difficult to listen to,” Gans admits of that tape, “but there's historical value in the final performance.”


	However, in terms of any official unveiling, it's never been heard since.


	This year, the 60th anniversary of the launch of the Dead has been commemorated with a new box set of unreleased concerts, three celebratory Dead & Company shows at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, more releases in the vital Dave's Picks series overseen by dedicated archivist David Lemieux, and bongs, e-bikes, paddle boards, and beach towels blanketed with the band's logo.


	Yet when it comes to authorized, band-approved products, the recording of Garcia's last show with the Dead remains tucked into the vaults. Audience tapes and video of the July 9, 1995, concert have long been available online and continue to circulate, particularly on the Internet Archive. As one commentator on the site wrote, “While it may not be as enjoyable as older concerts from the Seventies, it's a must listen if you're a fan of the Grateful Dead.”

	











	But 30 years later, the recording has still not been given an actual, cleaned-up release by the Dead organization or Rhino Records, which handles the Dead's catalog, and there appears to be no immediate plans to do so. In an indication of how the show's recording remains a sensitive topic, those closely connected to the Dead's legacy — including band members and Garcia's family — declined to comment to Rolling Stone.

	











	Rock history is strewn with valuable artifacts that the artists themselves have decided to keep locked away. Led Zeppelin were so disappointed with their reunion at 1985's Live Aid, even with Phil Collins filling in on drums, that the performance has never been rebroadcast. This summer's four-part doc on the benefit concerts doesn't include even a snippet of it. The Rolling Stones' 1969 set at Altamont was recorded by the Grateful Dead's pro sound crew but has remained in their vaults, as has Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's 1974 show at Wembley Arena in London (filmed for a planned TV special), where, even by their own admission, they were pretty wasted on the way to another breakup.

	What would be Garcia's last show with the Dead (he died a month later) is an equally important historic document — and is equally fraught. As Deadheads and pretty much everyone in the world of the Dead agrees, 1995 wasn't a banner year for the band. Even before the two nights at Soldier Field that wrapped up their summer tour, the trek had been dogged with problems, from gatecrashers and a death threat in Indiana to a lightning strike at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., that injured several fans.


	At Soldier Field on July 9, the Dead played well enough, if not as sharply as many feel they did in 1992 and 1993, widely considered the band's last noteworthy tours. The band still managed to sound spry on “Cumberland Blues” and “Touch of Grey,” Garcia's guitar solos had a hint of a twinkle in their eye, and a rare version of Phil Lesh's “Unbroken Chain” was a nice surprise (as was a second encore, of “Box of Rain”). But Garcia looked and sounded decades older than his 52 years, he fumbled a few lyrics, and his voice sounded shaky and barely audible on moments like “Shakedown Street.”


	To date, only one song from that gig has been deigned worthy of issue. That night, Garcia offered up a revealingly weary version of “So Many Roads,” a burdened but beautiful Garcia-Robert Hunter collaboration the band had started playing live in 1992. Garcia said that Hunter had written it with Garcia in mind, which was never more evident that night. Even in his weakened state, Garcia invested a lifetime of pain and sorrow into that performance, and both his delivery and the band's playing built to a suitably emotional and driving finale.

	The recording was considered so special that it was included in So Many Roads, the 1999 box of live Dead rarities. “Jerry was receding before our very eyes,” says Gans, who worked on that box. “But we felt that ‘So Many Roads' was a worthwhile performance and had some poignancy to it.” Even then, the tape had to be edited before release, from a tweaked intro to one of Garcia's guitar solos being trimmed back due to missed notes.

	











	But whether the entire show should be formally unveiled, in line with the way roughly 400 other tapes have already been, is another story. “As a Deadhead, I mildly cringe at the idea of releasing the Soldier Field show,” says Johnny Dwork, co-author (with Michael Getz) of The Deadhead's Taping Compendium, three volumes that catalog every show (and every tape of every show) the Dead played. “As a historian of an important and enduring cultural movement, I certainly think all significant historical events such as Jerry's last show should be preserved for history. But as a diplomat for the enduring legacy of the Grateful Dead, I have concern that someone someday might hear that show and form an ill opinion of one of the greatest guitarists, songwriters, and singers of our generation.”


	Gans, who also co-hosts the SiriusXM show Tales From the Golden Road with fellow Dead scholar Gary Lambert, says he has heard little from Deadheads about a CD or otherwise version of the tape. “I can't say that I've detected in 30 years any clamor for the release or the playing of that show,” he says. “Everyone realizes it was an unintentional finale.” If the whole show were to be rolled out officially, he says, “It would have to be done with a lot of caveats.”


	Filmmaker Justin Kreutzmann, Grateful Dead drummer Bill's son, is working on a documentary about Garcia that he hopes will be finished by next summer. Like many fans and Dead family members, he has similarly mixed feelings about the tape of that performance. “My point of view is that Jerry would hate something like that coming out, more than it already has,” says Kreutzmann, who knew Garcia well. “It's not a show I would put on personally for pleasure. It is particularly painful for the family and friends of his to watch.”

	For that reason, Kreutzmann says he is currently not planning to include audio or video from the Soldier Field performance in his documentary, which has the working title Garcia. “It is so uncomfortable to look at him, because he just looks so unhappy and unhealthy and like life is just not what he wants it to be,” Kreutzmann says. “I don't pretend that stuff never happened. But it's not that smiling Jerry bopping around. If I'm going to listen to Jerry, I want to feel him smiling through the music.”


	For the time being, the fact that an unauthorized version of the tape bounces around the internet may have to be enough. “The decision not to release it is an entirely defensible musical one, and an arguable cultural decision,” says Gans. “But it's out there for those who want to find it, and maybe that's enough.”

Footage shared by country star Dierks Bentley appears to show multiple unknown objects in the sky.

Country music star Dierks Bentley shared some interesting video footage that might get UFO enthusiasts talking.

OutKick fans love UFOs, and they love country music. Two topics that you wouldn't think ever cross into each other.

Why would they? They're completely unrelated. Well, that's the beauty of the internet. You never know when topics are going to collide.

Enter Dierks Bentley going viral on Instagram.

The popular country music singer recently took to Instagram to share a video that appears to show three objects high up in the sky, and he wants help from the public identifying whatever they might be.

Bentley wrote the following on Instagram:

""See this all the time flying east to west in the NW sky. Been meaning to post about it for a few years. They light up, move around for a bit, and then go dark. Appear to be 70,000 feet, but they stay in the exact same spot when you fly across the entire country…so they are in space. Not satellites, not Starlink and not meteors… not saying they are #UFO but they are definitely unidentified flying objects! Ok….came for the post, here for the comments!""

What did the comments section think? Suggestions were all over the place:

Are aliens responsible for UFOs or is there a much more believable explanation? (Credit: Getty Images Creatives)

Now, as a bit of a UFO enthusiast myself, I'm skeptical to believe the video shows something incredibly sinister or from a different planet.

To me, they look like they could be military-grade drones, satellites or something similar. It's important to keep an open mind, but that doesn't mean believing anything that gets thrown out there.

It's certainly an interesting video, but it's way too difficult to determine what's going on with any high level of confidence.

Little green aliens? Doubtful, but again, we can't say for sure.

The one-bedroom Plank House in Marcus Hook is one of the oldest operating houses in Delaware County, and is said to be the home of the pirate Blackbeard.

“It dates back to the 1700s,” said Joshua Chjaires, founder of Phantom Detectives LLC. “At that time, Marcus Hook was a well-known shipping port. It has a lot of history of paranormal activity. People report seeing the spirit of Blackbeard's wife. They hear footsteps, crying, bangs.”

The paranormal investigative team based in Wilmington, Del. will visit the house and a graveyard out back, revealing their results at the Marcus Hook 17th Annual Pirate Festival on Saturday, Sept. 20, writes Kathleen E. Carey for the Daily Times.

Boothwyn native Melissa Ferrazzano is the medium on the team and has already sensed spirits days before the investigation.

Michael Manerchia ,of the Marcus Hook Preservation Society, won't  go into the house after dark after he and his wife experienced bedroom doors that opened and closed by themselves, in sync.

“You could walk in there in August, and it was 50 degrees. You could see your breath.”

A half a dozen paranormal groups have visited the Plank House, but nobody's lasted a full night, Manerchia said.

Despite many attempts at looking, no further signals have been found.

A new study has re-examined the famous ""Wow!"" signal, finding that it likely has an extraterrestrial origin after all, and may have been even more intense than previously believed.

On August 15, 1977, at the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University, a narrowband radio signal was received. A few days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman reviewed the data and noticed the signal sequence, which lasted for a full 72 seconds. In the margin next to the printout, he simply wrote ""Wow!"", and thus the puzzling signal had a name that would stick for the next 43 years at least.

The signal has, so far, defied explanation, and that's not for a lack of trying. Researchers argued the case for it being a comet passing through the area Big Ear was listening to, only for that to be completely refuted about two days later by the team that detected the Wow! signal in the first place, as a comet would have produced a diffuse signal given the large area they cover, rather than the abruptly cut-off signal that was received.

The signal has been a source of speculation in the ""aliens are out there"" community, and not without reason. No other signal like it has been detected before or since. It was in a range of frequencies close to the hydrogen line, which is relatively free from background noise, making it a good range to pick were we to try and communicate with other civilizations ourselves. On top of that, the team themselves believed it to be a good candidate for extraterrestrial life.

    

 ""The 'Wow!' signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin,"" Ohio State University Radio Observatory director John Kraus wrote in a letter to Carl Sagan in 1994, ""but little more can be said until it returns for further study.""

     

Since then, the signal has been the subject of many studies, but it has never returned. In a new attempt to narrow down what it might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data which had previously been unpublished, producing two not as yet peer-reviewed papers on the topic.

First up, the team found that the signal was very unlikely to have been the result of interference in the telescope itself, or of terrestrial origin. The team found strong statistical evidence that the signal was not the result of radio frequency interference (RFI).

""If this RFI is persistent, it would take approximately six millennia of uninterrupted observations to achieve a signal analogous to the Wow! Signal from random RFI occurrences,"" the team explains in paper II.

Looking at other possible sources, including satellites, the team found this to be unlikely as well. Most satellites of the time were not in the area of the sky identified by the team, orbiting on different planes. While the team suggested that satellites which have slowly come out of orbit could be a source, or a Soviet satellite occupying this orbit, they believe this is unlikely too. This is because they would spend only a few fractions of a second in front of the telescope, rather than the 72 seconds necessary to replicate the Wow! signal.

""A continuous signal from an orbiting satellite will need to be at an orbit beyond the Moon to reproduce the pattern,"" they added.

So, what is it? While the team don't yet have an answer, they have made a lot of progress, for instance finding that the signal was much more powerful than had previously been predicted at 250 Janskys, four times larger than had previously been estimated.

“Our results don't solve the mystery of the Wow! Signal,” lead author Professor Abel Méndez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, explained in a statement. “But they give us the clearest picture yet of what it was and where it came from. This new precision allows us to target future observations more effectively than ever before.”

The main clue identified by the team from the ""Aricebo Wow"" project were two similar signals in 1977 and 1978 (dubbed Wow2 and Wow3) which showed similar characteristics to the original ""Wow!"" signal, though far less intense. The team believes that the original team studying the Wow! signal were intrigued by these signals as well, looking at their own notes.

""It is clear that the Ohio SETI team were interested in these signals, as evidenced by their circling. We believe that they recognized these signals as compact cold Hi clouds, after corroborating their appearance in multiple scans,"" the team write in paper II. ""We searched for the coordinates of these signals in the HI4PI survey and confirmed their association with compact Hi clouds.""

For the team, this suggests that the Wow! signal could have a common origin in these cold clouds of hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM). In paper I from the Aricebo Wow project, they go further and suggest a possible cause of the signal.

""We postulate that the Wow! Signal was a superradiance event that produced a maser-like flare from a small cold Hi cloud,"" the team writes in their study. 

""We observed from the Arecibo Observatory narrowband signals (∆ν ≤ 10 kHz) similar to the Wow! Signal near the hydrogen line, though significantly weaker. These signals are attributed to small cold Hi cloud regions within the galactic ISM. We propose that the Wow! Signal was caused by the abrupt brightening of the hydrogen line of these clouds triggered by an intense radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater,"" they add.

Though this is an intriguing possibility – and magnetars are often suspected for producing weird signals – the team cannot rule out other potential causes in the cosmos. The team hopes that the work could help better inform the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

""Our study did not conclude that the Wow! Signal constituted evidence of a signal emanating from an extraterrestrial civilization. However, null results are instrumental in refining future technosignature searches,"" the team concludes. ""NASA and other agencies remain committed to their search for biosignatures within the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets.""

The project will continue to search archives of this and other observatories for other unexplained signals and transients, as well as digitizing and archiving data from the Big Ear project. More work will be done on attempting to analyze the Wow! signal, and hopefully explain its cause.

“This study doesn't close the case,” Méndez added. “It reopens it, but now with a much sharper map in hand.”

The studies are posted to preprint server arXiv and have not yet been peer reviewed:

“The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11,” Andrew Dabb, who served as showrunner for Supernatural‘s final seasons, admitted.

When we spoke with him for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue to find out what the original series finale looked like (before the ending had to be changed due to COVID delays and protocols), we also asked about his thoughts on a revival (here) and what Wayward Sisters could have been (here). We also had to ask about any scrapped storylines from over the years.

“It would've been really nice to see Sam [Jared Padalecki] and Dean [Jensen Ackles] age into more mentorship roles,” Dabb said before sharing, “One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'”

They never went there because, according to the showrunner, “It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.”

If they had done it, it would've been in a finale to set up the following season with, “Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show,” Dabb said. “It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

He also revealed that there had been talks about bringing back the Antichrist (Gattlin Griffith) “in a different way,” but that didn't pan out, nor did his hope to do more internationally. “This is a show about America and Americana. It doesn't really fit the show,” he explained. “We tried it with the British Men of Letters, maybe not our most successful if we're just being honest, but I would've liked to go even further.”

Would you have liked to have seen any of these ideas come to fruition onscreen? Let us know in the comments section below.

The heiress to one of Canada's wealthiest families is suing her former best friend — who “lost everything” and is now an Uber driver, representing herself in court — after a doomed crypto investment allegedly fueled by a pair of psychics' advice cost them $80 million.

Taylor Thomson, the 66-year-old middle child of the billionaire Thomson family, and Ashley Richardson, a 47-year-old once-affluent California mom, were the best of friends who enjoyed living it up in Los Angeles after first meeting at a 2009 house party in Malibu.

The rosy relationship, however, collapsed in 2022 when their psychic advisers pointed them to invest in a crypto token that crashed within a year.

Thomson accused her friend of making hundreds of thousands of risky trades behind her back and only using her for her wealth, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

Richardson denied the allegations and blamed the billionaire — who she claimed once hit on her — for destroying their friendship and leaving her struggling to make ends meet.

“Because of you I have lost everything, and you decided to sue the person who had nothing left to lose,” Richardson said in one of her last messages to Thomson. “I loved you more than anything.”

In their more than 12 years as close friends, Richardson was one of Thomson's biggest supporters, even going as far as helping the heiress relocate her beloved chickens from Bel Air to Hollywood, according to messages between the two women.

Friends claimed that Thomson, whose family ranks as the third richest clan in the world, had trouble trusting people and could be aggressive when she believed anyone was after her money, the WSJ reported.

She even hired convicted Hollywood private investigator, Anthony Pellicano, to spy on a former nanny whom she suspected of colluding with her daughter's father during a heated custody battle, according to court documents.

“I want you to do whatever you can to get information on Pamela,” Thomson told Pellicano, according to his 2008 wiretapping trial. “Just get it. I'm not going to ask questions.”

Despite Thomson's alleged vindictive nature, Richardson told the WSJ she supported her and would try to protect her from these so-called “Takers,” who were after the heiress's fortune.

Richardson, however, was given that very label following the friends' failed crypto venture in 2021 and again after the latest allegations.

“After spending years living a lavish lifestyle on Ms. Thomson's dime, Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson — which we know because Ms. Richardson has threatened multiple times she will do just that,” a spokesperson for Thomson told The Post in a statement.

Following the pandemic, Richardson found herself engrossed in the words of celebrity psychic Michelle Whitedove, who recommended that her followers invest in the upcoming Persistence crypto coin.

Richardson brought up the token to Thomson, who grew interested and sought advice from her own psychic, Robert Sabella, an astrologer she regularly consulted with, according to the women's messages.

“Taylor trusts her own instincts and would use Robert as a sounding board,” Thomson's spokesman told the WSJ now of their interactions, “but by no means would she make substantial life decisions based on his suggestions.”

After getting the confirmation from Sabella, the two women began investing heavily in Persistence. Richardson put most of her savings into the coin while Thomson poured in more than $40 million.

Richardson claimed that Thomson became overzealous in the spending and reined in the heiress when she suggested spending another $60 million on the token following early success.

Thomson also drafted a letter to her brothers, who own the largest stake in the Thomson fortune, accusing them of restricting her ability to invest the family wealth in the crypto market, the outlet reported.

During their trading spree, Richardson said she spent as much as 20 hours a day researching cryptocurrencies and executing trades for Thomson — at times holding as much as $140 million in her friend's investment, according to the WSJ.

When the 2022 crypto market crash happened, Richardson lost everything, while Thomson felt betrayed and hired lawyers and consultants to get her money back.

Thomson sued both Richardson and Persistence in 2023, seeking at least $25 million for their alleged role in roping her into the investment as a targeted “whale.”

Thomson and Persistence settled for an undisclosed amount of money, while Richardson is fighting her former friend in court.

Bradley Dizik, president of the Guidepost consulting firm's tech practice, told the WSJ that in the first half of 2022, Richardson conducted 450,000 trades with the billionaire's funds, many of which she didn't authorize and were extremely risky.

He alleges that Thomson lost more than $80 million in crypto investments associated with Richardson's involvement.

Richardson denies the allegations, claiming she never made a trade without Thomson's approval and always did her best to “minimize losses.”

She also claims Thomson hired a former FBI agent who works at Guidepost to visit her family.

Richardson said she now makes money as an Uber driver, has applied for food stamps, and is struggling to take care of her dog and the legal work brought on by Persistence's fall and Thomson's lawsuit.

Richardson has since filed a countersuit with the help of ChatGPT for $10 million, alleging that Thomson has defamed her with her accusations.

Thomson's spokesperson denied all the allegations, including one where Richardson claimed that the heiress made a pass at her during a 2019 trip to British Columbia.

One of their final interactions via text saw Richardson, who reportedly fell off the wagon after two years of sobriety, call Thomson a “rich motherf—ing sociopathic b—,” according to the WSJ.

“Send your f—ing goons to take my life. Please, you have destroyed me,” she added.

Billionaire heiress Taylor Thomson has reportedly lost more than $80 million in digital assets after following investment guidance tied to a psychic.

Key Takeaways:

According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report published Monday, Thomson, a member of the family behind media and financial giant Thomson Reuters, poured millions into cryptocurrencies with the assistance of her former best friend, Ashley Richardson.

The two women had allegedly consulted a celebrity psychic and other spiritual advisers before Richardson became heavily involved in managing Thomson's crypto holdings. 

At the height of the 2021 bull market, Richardson was said to oversee more than $140 million in Thomson's digital assets spread across multiple wallets.

But the sharp downturn in crypto markets in mid-2022 devastated the portfolio.

Consulting firm Guidepost Solutions estimated Thomson's losses at over $80 million and claimed Richardson executed more than 450,000 trades without proper authorization, exposing her to high-risk strategies.

Richardson rejected the allegations, arguing she acted under Thomson's direction and only made trades to maintain liquidity in thinly traded tokens.

She emphasized that there was no formal contract between them, only a verbal agreement, and insisted she never profited personally.

“Everything I did was based on her instructions, as part of her effort to minimize losses,” Richardson told the WSJ.

The dispute escalated into a legal battle in 2023. Thomson filed a lawsuit against Richardson and Persistence (XPRT), a proof-of-stake blockchain project launched in 2021.

She had invested $40 million in its native token, which has since collapsed in value.

XPRT peaked at $16.59 on May 15, 2021, according to CoinGecko, but currently trades at about $0.037 — a drop of 99% from its all-time high.

Thomson is seeking $25 million in damages, alleging Richardson and Persistence arranged a secret “finder's fee” for Richardson and misrepresented the investment.

A Thomson spokesperson dismissed Richardson's narrative, saying: “Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson.”

Richardson has countersued for $10 million, claiming defamation after Thomson allegedly told others she had committed fraud.

According to the WSJ, Thomson has since reached a settlement with Persistence, but the case against Richardson remains ongoing.

As reported, a cryptocurrency investor has fallen victim to a phishing scam, losing $3.05 million in Tether (USDT) after unknowingly signing a malicious blockchain transaction.

The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders.

The attacker exploited a common habit among crypto users: validating only the first and last few characters of a wallet address while ignoring the middle.

Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK's latest security report.

Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Why people embrace conspiracy theories: it's about community, not gullibility","https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/why-people-embrace-conspiracy-theories-its-about-community-not-gullibility","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:21:13 GMT","

Far from being isolated outsiders, conspiracy theorists enjoy thriving communities that recruit and organise activism.

 

Psychologists have long considered how a tendency towards irrational thinking or particular personality traits might predict peoples' interest in conspiracies. Yet these individual factors do not explain the group processes through which conspiracy theorists are extending their influence and impact.

Over five years, we sought out and got to know people on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists. And the results of our new study show that a sense of community activism is attracting people to these ideas.

Indeed, contrary to the stereotype of isolated keyboard warriors who have gone down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theorists are becoming organised, recruiting supporters, picketing vaccination centres and vandalising telecommunication and traffic infrastructures.

Our research examined the growing interest in conspiracy theories and how associated activism emerges. Immersive research with conspiracy theorists is rare. But revealing our status as researchers actually allowed us to build relationships with people, who shared insights into what motivates their involvement.

In particular, we spoke to people about conspiracy theories concerning 5G technology, COVID-19, 15-minute cities and low-traffic neighbourhoods. We also took part in online discussions and travelled the UK to sit in on public meetings and conferences. Ultimately, our insights revealed how people tend to follow a pathway from initial interest, to community engagement and potentially activism.

Belief in conspiracy theories is often initiated by traumatic life events. Job losses or the death of a loved one can trigger anger and suspicion towards public services, authority figures, and experts. This is especially so if people feel that the tragic or destructive events that affected them could have been averted. And these emotions can motivate a search for answers.

When conspiracy theories claim to explain painful personal circumstances or wider fears over COVID-19, or climate change, people can experience “awakenings”. These are moments of insight during which people come to believe that the causes of their problems lie with secretive groups which control society.

One person we spoke to described conspiracy theories as enabling him to “access the way the world really works… as if a light was switched on in my head and I could see things clearly”.

People rarely experience their awakening in isolation. In online group chats, people discover others with similar problems. In public meetings, beliefs in various theories are boosted by interactions where people discuss their suspicions over who is to blame for particular issues. In the process, these groups feed off their common emotions, building an atmosphere of energy and excitement.

The loss of traditional meeting places such as pubs and high streets, along with high levels of loneliness, may be driving people to look for new forms of connection and meaning.

The people we spoke to expressed surprise at the social connections they had found through these communities. As one participant put it, “there's a lot of support out there for people who are doing their own research… there is always someone wanting to hear more, building on the work of others, giving each other support. There's a real buzz in this community.”

Conspiracy theories don't merely offer alternative explanations for events, they are resources for communities that provide identity, purpose and belonging. These benefits may explain why it is so difficult to talk people out of their beliefs in conspiracy theories.

Indeed, when conspiracy communities generate common interpretations and shared emotions, conspiracy theories can resonate powerfully, making them seem more real than they are.

This effect is compounded by the way which conspiracy theories invite believers to build on ideas by “doing their own research”. The internet serves as a vast database where conspiracy theorists can discover articles, documents and scientific reports to support their claims.

And despite the questionable quality of many such sources, contributing to conspiracy theories can provide a boost to people's self esteem, making them feel like experts and heroic detectives. A key aspect of these communities is how they empower members to contribute.

Yet, beyond generating more theories, conspiracy communities are becoming organised networks for protest and activism. Given that conspiracy theories raise suspicion and anger over peoples' problems, and point the blame at particular targets, we found that believers can feel compelled to take part in protests.

For example, some claim that the urban planning concept of 15-minute cities is part of secretive government scheme to limit citizens' movement. Protesters against these and other efforts to improve urban environments are uniting under slogans such as “stop the tyranny”.

Activism based on conspiracy theories can come with serious risks. Many of those involved lose contact with family and friends. Increasingly, conspiracy activists are being charged with crimes. In 2024, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist was sentenced to prison for five years for encouraging violence against chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty.

Moreover, when conspiracy theorists take action without tested evidence, they may misidentify targets. This can result in harm to innocent people and can undermine the very institutions needed to solve crimes.

To be sure, instances of conspiracy and foul play by powerful figures and organisations do happen. You have to wonder how much energy then, is wasted fighting imaginary enemies while actual wrongdoing is overlooked.

Perhaps the real winners here are the conspiracy entrepreneurs– people who capitalise on conspiracy theories by creating content that heightens peoples' suspicions about problematic events. In the process, these people build attention and fame, while peddling products and services from books, merchandise and coaching, to vitamin pills and gadgets.

            President Donald Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, DC, a move that could run into significant obstacles with city juries.
    


            “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital, capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty,” the president said during a meeting with Cabinet members Tuesday.
    


            The president did not immediately outline any specifics, but called capital punishment a “very strong preventative” measure. States, he said, “are going to have to make their own decision,” though in the nation's capital, prosecutors would seek the death penalty.
    


            “We have no choice,” he said.
    


            Traditionally, the DC Superior Court handles the bulk of murder cases in the city, and it would be bound by the city code that does not authorize capital punishment.
    


Pirro's office fails three times to win felony indictment of alleged attacker of FBI agent



            However, the US attorney's office in DC, which prosecutes crimes in both the local and federal court in the city – unlike any other jurisdiction in the country – could bring federal charges in many capital-eligible cases and seek the death penalty.
    


            “We will use all legal sanctions and sentences called for by law,” US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a press conference on Tuesday, when asked about her office seeking capital punishment in DC cases.
    


            Actually getting a death sentence, though, might not be so easy, as prosecutors would have to convince jurors to sign off. Historically, prosecutors have faced challenges in convincing special juries to impose capital punishment in DC, even if they vote unanimously to convict the defendants, multiple people in Washington's legal community have told CNN in recent weeks.
    


            “It's going to be difficult to find 12 people in DC who are going to do that,” said Jon Jeffress, a former federal public defender-turned-private defense lawyer in the city.
    


            The federal court in the District of Columbia hasn't held a death penalty trial since 2003, when Rodney L. Moore was convicted of 10 killings and Kevin L. Gray was convicted of 19 killings, according to multiple people familiar with the court and that case. In that case, the jurors said they couldn't agree unanimously on death sentences for the two men rather than life imprisonment, court records show.
    


            Asked about the unwillingness of juries in the past to approve the death penalty in DC cases, Pirro said: “We're going to follow the law, the deliberative process, present the evidence … whether DC is inclined to do it or not, it's not a political issue.”
    


            “This is an issue that's sanctioned by the law, and gives us the power to do that. If not us, then who?” she added.
    


            In recent months, the Justice Department has indicated in at least three cases in DC's federal court that it may seek the death penalty, according to court records.
    


            One of those cases is against Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of shooting two Israeli embassy staff members leaving a Jewish community event in May.
    


            The Department of Justice is also actively considering seeking the death penalty in DC District Court for two Mexican nationals who were charged in 2008 in a gang case and recently brought to the US, and for two young men who were indicted for a 2023 carjacking, according to court records.
    


            This comes at a time where the federal death row is down to three, after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of about three dozen federal inmates who had been sentenced to death. Trump has vowed since the first day of this administration to restore the use of capital punishment in the US, directing the attorney general to pursue the death penalty for crimes wherever possible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Wrestler ‘conscious and able to talk' after being beaten while motionless by son of ex-UFC champion Rampage Jackson","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/sport/mma-stuart-smith-update-rampage-jackson-son-intl","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:46:00 GMT","


            The wrestler beaten while motionless by the son of former UFC champion Rampage Jackson is conscious but has a “difficult recovery ahead,” according to a Facebook post by his brother.
    


            Footage from an event on Saturday night in Sun Valley, California, posted on social media showed Jackson's son, Raja Jackson – a professional MMA fighter – sliding into the ring during another bout and throwing Syko Stu, whose real name is Stuart Smith, to the mat.
    


            The video, which bears a watermark suggesting it was livestreamed on the video platform Kick, showed Jackson straddling Smith before repeatedly punching him in the face and the side of his head, even when Smith was lying motionless. Other wrestlers then restrained Jackson.
    


            CNN has not been able to independently verify the video, but Kick confirmed to CNN that Raja Jackson's account has been banned from the platform.
    


            Smith's brother, Andrew, said early on Monday that his brother was “conscious and does have some recollection of events from the day of the attack.”
    


            Andrew Smith later provided an update, writing that his brother was resting having sustained “severe injuries to his head.”
    


            “He is currently conscious and able to talk but will have a difficult recovery ahead,” Andrew wrote.
    


            “With all the media and social media attention it's been hard to get back to everyone.Stuart Smith appreciates all the love and support. He loves wrestling, his wrestling family, and all his fans and supporters. Wrestling has been a huge part of his life and he lives to put on a performance. He's also just a regular guy with a life and family outside the ring.”
    


            Smith's wife, Contessa Patterson, organized a fundraising page to help cover his medical costs and loss of income after the “unscripted assault.”
    


            “Stuart Smith is a U.S. Army veteran who used wrestling as an outlet to deal with his PTSD, this incident has not only caused major physical harm, but will also disrupt his career inside the ring and outside of it,” she wrote.
    


            At the time of writing, the page has raised almost $70,000.
    


            After the event on Saturday, Rampage Jackson took to Twitter to condemn his son's actions.
    


            “I don't condone my son's actions AT ALL!” he wrote in a post to X on Sunday morning. “He (Raja Jackson) suffered a concussion from sparring only days ago and had no business doing anything remotely close to physical contact.
    


            “As a father, I'm deeply concerned with his health AND the well-being of Mr. Smith. That being said I'm very upset that any of this happened, but my main concern now is that Mr. Smith will make a speedy recovery. I apologize on his (Raja Jackson's) behalf and to KICK for the situation.”
    


            A statement by organizer KnokX suggested that the incident started off as a scripted part of the show, known as a “work” in wrestling, but was not intended to go as far as it did.
    


            “What was supposed to be a planned and agreed upon wrestling spot, turned into a selfish, irresponsible act of violence against Mr. Smith,” the organizer wrote.
    


            “This egregious act is reprehensible and never should have occurred. In the 17 years of operation of KnokX Pro Wrestling Academy, there has never been anything as heinous take place such as this and we apologize to our patrons and fans.”

Canadian photojournalist Valerie Zink has resigned as a Reuters stringer after eight years, alleging the agency has been “justifying and enabling” Israel's killing of journalists in Gaza, including members of its own staff.

Her announcement came hours after an Israeli airstrike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis on Monday, the largest medical facility in southern Gaza, that killed at least 20 people, including five journalists, according to local health officials.

In a Facebook post, Zink accused Reuters and other Western media of amplifying unverified Israeli claims linking reporters to Hamas militants, arguing that this has contributed to conditions in which dozens of journalists have been killed since October 2023.

She cited the case of Anas al-Sharif, a prominent Al Jazeera reporter, who was killed with his crew in Gaza City earlier this month.

”Reuters chose to publish Israel's entirely baseless claim that al-Sharif was a Hamas operative,” she wrote. Prior to the attack, the Israeli military alleged al-Sharif was a Hamas commander but provided no evidence.

”The fact that Anas Al-Sharif's work won a Pulitzer Prize for Reuters did not compel them to come to his defence when Israeli occupation forces placed him on a hit list,” she added.

Zink also criticized Reuters' response to the killing of its own staff, noting that cameraman Hossam al-Masri was among those killed at Nasser Hospital.

Western media, she said, were “culpable” by repeating Israeli claims without verification, acting as “a conveyor belt for Israeli propaganda.”

The number of journalists killed in Gaza since 2023 has now reached 245, according to press freedom groups.

Reporters demand apology from Tom Barrack, US special envoy to Syria, after his remarks at Beirut press conference 

Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”.

As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation's meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We're going to have a different set of rules ... please be quiet for a moment.

“The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we're gone,” he said.

“Act civilised, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what's happening in the region,” added Barrack, who has recently been leading talks with Lebanese officials.

The Lebanese presidency in a statement on X expressed regret at “remarks made inadvertently from its podium by one of its guests”, affirming its appreciation for the journalists and media representatives.

The information minister, Paul Morcos, in a statement also expressed regret at the remarks “by a member of the foreign delegation towards media representatives at the presidential palace”.

The photojournalists' syndicate called Barrack's comments “a direct insult” that set “a serious and totally unacceptable precedent”.

In a statement, it demanded “an immediate and public apology”, rejecting attempts to “downplay the seriousness of what happened or let it pass without accountability”.

The press editors' syndicate also called for “a public statement of apology” and floated a boycott of the envoy's future visits and meetings.

The union of journalists in Lebanon said Barrack's remarks were “a reflection of an unacceptable arrogance in dealing with the media” and also called for an official apology.

Ibrahim Musawi, a lawmaker from the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah and head of parliament's media committee, called the remarks “a blatant insult” and urged the government to “summon the US ambassador and reprimand her”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

More than 100 organizations advocate for freedom of 16-year-old dual citizen detained for more than six months

More than 100 US human rights, faith-based and civil rights groups have demanded that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, immediately secure the release of a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen who has been in an Israeli prison for six months over allegations of rock throwing.

The coalition, which includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), the Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA, warned that Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim's deteriorating health puts “his life on the line” and demanded urgent US intervention in the most significant organized pressure campaign on the imprisoned teenager's case yet.

“Mohammed is an American child with a community in Florida who cares about him deeply,” the organizations wrote in the letter. “It is the responsibility of the US government to protect all American children, including Palestinian-Americans.”

The ADC, one of the signers, also erected a billboard in New York's Times Square earlier in August featuring Ibrahim's photograph and the message “Free Mohammed Ibrahim”, describing him as a Palestinian-American teenager “unjustly imprisoned by Israel”.

The Guardian was first to report Ibrahim's detention. The teen, who splits his time between Palm Bay, Florida, and the West Bank, was 15 when Israeli soldiers arrested him from his home in the West Bank in February. He has since developed scabies, according to state department emails to the family, and lost at least 25lbs, his lawyer says.

The Guardian learned of his detention while investigating the death of Ibrahim's cousin, Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian-American allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.

The teenager is now being held at Israel's Ofer prison, which the coalition described as notorious for abusing Palestinian children. He was previously detained at Megiddo prison, where a 17-year-old Palestinian teenager died in April from what advocates described as abusive conditions.

“Mohammed traveled to his family's home in the West Bank for a family vacation to see loved ones,” the letter reads. “The Israeli military took Mohammed when he was only 15 years old, forcing him to spend his 16th birthday in an Israeli military prison, terrified and separated from his parents.”

Military court documents seen by the Guardian show Israeli authorities accuse Mohammed of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in at least two separate incidents. At an August court hearing, his lawyer said Ibrahim needed medical care, with his next hearing scheduled for 29 October.

The groups argue Ibrahim's imprisonment violates the fourth Geneva convention's prohibition on transferring detainees from occupied territory to the occupying power's territory. He is among 323 Palestinian children aged 12-17 currently held in Israeli military detention, according to Defense for Children International-Palestine.

His father, Zaher Ibrahim, contacted Mike Haridopolos, a Republican congressman from Florida, in March after more than 45 days without contact with his son, casework filed with the lawmaker and seen by the Guardian shows. Haridopolos's office confirmed it had shared the family's information with the state department, which said the US embassy in Israel was “following standard procedures”.

US embassy officials have conducted welfare checks on Ibrahim since his detention but faced restrictions in July after informing the family that Ibrahim was suffering from scabies and was receiving medical treatment, according to state department emails reviewed by the Guardian. It is unclear whether officials have resumed the welfare checks.

In response to the letter, a spokesperson for the state department said: “Whenever a US citizen is detained abroad, the Department works to provide consular assistance in accordance with US and international law.” The spokesperson also said: “If we become aware of an arrest of any US citizen, including a minor, we will provide consular services, including prison visits.”

The organized campaign represents an escalation in efforts to secure Ibrahim's release after months of what advocates describe as inadequate government response to his detention.

“Dozens of Palestinian-American families own land in the West Bank – Palestinian cities and villages that are increasingly being targeted by Israeli settlers and the Israeli military,” the groups wrote. “Yet, Palestinian-American families are not receiving any protection from the US government against rising Israeli settler and Israeli military violence against them.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The former economy and energy minister and vice chancellor announced he will leave Germany's main legislative body, the Bundestag. 

Former Vice Chancellor and Economic Minister Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Green Party announced Monday he would be resigning from Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.

""On Monday, I informed the Bundestag Presidium that I will be resigning my seat in the Bundestag on September 1,"" Habeck told Germany's Die Tageszeitung newspaper.

The party leaders of the Greens, Franziska Brantner and Felix Banaszak, said they regretted Habeck's decision. 

Habeck — who had served as former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's deputy in the previous coalition government — became the Greens' chancellor candidate following the collapse of the so-called ""traffic light"" coalition.

The ""traffic light"" coalition from December 2021 to November 2024 had consisted of the Greens, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the business-focused Free Democrats (FDP). The coalition fell apart when the FDP withdrew in November, prompting a snap election in February of this year.

Habeck's Greens secured just 11.6% of the vote in the February snap election, leaving the party consigned to the opposition benches.

Habeck had wanted to continue fighting for climate protection, economic reforms and for large state subsidies, but he found himself at odds with the left wing of his party, which battled to accept his support for stricter asylum and immigration rules.

During his time in the coalition, Habeck had guided Germany through the energy crisis in 2022 and massively accelerated the energy transition. Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced Germany to wean itself off Russian gas, with Habeck tasked with finding other sources of energy, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.

Habeck had championed Germany's Building Energy Act, which requires new heating systems to use at least 65% renewable energy.

The law, however, proved contentious domestically and faced resistance from parts of industry and opposition politicians concerned about costs and implementation.

""I will be researching, teaching and learning at various foreign research and educational institutions over the next year,"" Habeck said of his next step.

""One is the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. Another is Berkeley. But there will be others with whom I will be collaborating as well,"" Habeck explained.

Habeck framed his departure from German politics as ""a broadening of horizons, a change of perspective.""

Live Updates


• Trump's crime crackdown: President Donald Trump said his administration will seek the death penalty in murder cases in Washington, DC. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has warned the president to stay out of Chicago — which is likely the next city in the president's sights — as Trump issued an executive order establishing “specialized units” in the National Guard that will be “equipped to deal with public order issues.”
    


• Fed in the crosshairs: Meanwhile, Trump said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing on Monday, was not “100% above board.” Cook has refused to resign, setting up a potential showdown. Her attorney announced he is filing a lawsuit challenging the president's action.
    


            President Donald Trump said he is considering a longer term for White House economist Stephen Miran on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors and that he soon expected to have “a majority” at the Fed.
    


            Trump earlier this month nominated Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill a vacancy left by former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler after she resigned.
    


            Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, would finish a term slated to end January 31, 2026.
    


                    “We just put a very good man in one position. We might switch him to the other, it's a longer term, and pick somebody else,” Trump said today during a presidential Cabinet meeting, but he did not specify what he meant by “the other.“We'll have a majority very shortly. So that'll be great. Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great,” he said.
                





            However, Trump currently is attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whose term expires in 2038. Cook's attorney said today she plans to fight the dismissal in court.
    


            The Fed Board of Governors includes seven positions. Two current governors have said they would like to cut interest rates, and Miran has signaled he also thinks rates are too high.Trump has complained for months that the Fed has kept interest rates too high
    


            President Donald Trump floated the idea today of sending Americans tariff rebate checks, an idea that his own treasury secretary has suggested the White House is unlikely to do.
    


                    There was a concept of “making a dividend to the people in this country who have had to suffer through stupid leadership, and they paid a lot of taxes and they got nothing for it,” the president said.“Primarily we want to pay down debt, but there's a possibility that we take a piece of it and pay some, make a dividend,” he  said.
                





            Some lawmakers have proposed using tariff revenue to send rebate checks of at least $600 per adult and dependent child. A family of four could end up with around $2,400 from the federal government.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has thrown cold water on the idea, including earlier this month during an interview on CNBC, saying in part that the revenue generated from new tariffs will go toward paying the national debt.
    


            “I think, at a point, we're going to be able to do it,” he said, noting how S&P Global on Monday affirmed its AA+ credit rating on the United States. “But President [Donald] Trump and I are laser-focused on paying down the debt.”
    


            CNN's Alicia Wallace contributed to this report.
    


            President Donald Trump today said that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he said he was firing yesterday, was not “100% above board.”
    


                    “She seems to have had an infraction, and she can't have an infraction, especially that infraction, because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting. “And we need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn't seem like she was.”
                





            Trump and his allies have accused Cook of mortgage fraud over two properties she owns, both of which she appears to have designated her principal residence in the same year. Cook has not been formally charged with any wrongdoing.
    


            In a letter posted on social media late yesterday, Trump said he has determined there is enough cause to fire Cook, citing the mortgage fraud allegations.
    


            But the legality of Trump's attempt to remove Cook remains unsettled.
    


            Earlier today, Cook's personal attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced he is filing a lawsuit challenging Trump's firing of Cook.
    


            President Donald Trump renewed his threat to impose heavy economic penalties on Russia if it refuses to halt its war against Ukraine — but did not set any fresh timetable for following through.
    


            “It will not be a world war but it will be an economic war,” Trump said on Tuesday of the actions that he may eventually take. “It's going to be bad for Russia.”
    


            But he quickly added that he didn't want to impose new sanctions or tariffs aimed at hurting the Russian economy, expressing hope that there was still a path toward brokering a deal to end the war.
    


            Trump also again suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky bore some blame for the conflict, calling him “not exactly innocent either,” and brushed off Russia's recent signals that it wouldn't sign a peace deal with Zelensky.
    


            “Doesn't matter what they say,” he said. “Everybody's posturing. It's all bullshit.”
    


            Trump has repeatedly threatened to ramp up economic pressure on Russia over the prolonged war, but has yet to take significant action, repeatedly extending his two-week deadlines for Putin.
    


            “The one that I thought would be the easiest is turning out to be the hardest,” Trump said Tuesday of the war in Ukraine. “But I think I'll get it done.”
    


            President Donald Trump said he would like to send National Guard troops to New York if Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants it.
    


            “I get along with Kathy. If she'd like to do that, I would do it,” he said during a White House Cabinet meeting when a reporter asked him about the prospect.
    


            “New York has difficulty,” he said. “I want to make this like, friendly. But the places we're talking about happen to be virtually all Democrat-run.”
    


            President Donald Trump appeared to back off his administration's plans to “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,” a move that, he says, comes as US relations with China have improved.
    


            In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of visas for Chinese students, an escalation of tensions with Beijing and a blow to American higher education institutions. The plan was met with strong opposition from China at the time.
    


            But today, the president appeared to reverse course: “We're getting along very well with China, and I'm getting along very well with President Xi. I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here.”
    


                    He continued: “I like that their students come here. I like that other countries' students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.”
                





            Trump said he told China's President Xi Jinping that he is “honored” to have Chinese students in the US.
    


            China is the country of origin for almost of a quarter of international students in US higher education, and Chinese and other international students account for a significant source of revenue for colleges and universities.
    


            “We check and we're careful and we see who's there, and Marco wants that — we spoke, we're in the same position,” he said, referring to Rubio.
    


            Trump appeared to explain that the apparent reversal was the result of improving US-China relations: “We're just getting along very well with China. It's a different relationship than we had. … They respect us again. I respect them. The relationship is very good.”
    


            President Donald Trump backed off his assertion that there would be a “conclusive” end to the war in Gaza in the next few weeks, clarifying remarks he had made just a day earlier.
    


            “There's no conclusive. It's been going on for a long time,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with his cabinet today.
    


            Yesterday, Trump said he thought that “within the next two to three weeks, you're going to have pretty good, conclusive — a conclusive ending.”
    


            Walking back that specific wording, Trump today added that conflict in the region goes back “thousands of years.”
    


            “There's nothing conclusive, but hopefully we're going to have things solved very quickly with regard to Gaza and also with regard to Ukraine and Russia,” the president added.
    


The landscape of the war: The American president's claims that the war will end soon comes as Israel is facing global condemnation after an attack on a Gaza hospital killed 20 people, including five journalists and medical workers.
    


            Meanwhile, Hamas said it has agreed to a new Gaza ceasefire proposal as mediators push to renew talks ahead of a major Israeli assault on Gaza City.
    


            President Donald Trump told reporters Tuesday upon hearing the news of pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce's engagement that “I wish them a lot of luck.”
    


            “I think he's a great player. I think he's a great guy, and I think that she's a terrific person. So I wish them a lot of luck,” the president said during a lengthy Cabinet meeting.
    


            The president, as recently as August 4, has criticized Swift on social media, including claiming she was “NO LONGER HOT” and was “Woke” while praising actress Sydney Sweeney's American Eagle jeans ad.
    


            Swift endorsed Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, following the only debate between Trump and Harris last year. Swift signed off on the post by calling herself a “childless cat lady,” alluding to a phrase previously used by JD Vance, Trump's running mate, to criticize Democrats.
    


            Asked about the endorsement on Fox News in the days following, Trump cast Swift as a “very liberal person” and said she will “probably pay a price for it in the marketplace.”
    


            Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in an Instagram post Tuesday afternoon, with a caption reading, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.”
    


            Indiana Republican Sen. Todd Young told reporters today that he doesn't know if President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is legal.
    


            “It's breaking new ground, but I don't know whether the law allows it or not. I haven't studied that law,” he said.
    


            Cook's lawyer announced today that he is filing a lawsuit to challenge her removal, and said Trump “has no authority” to fire her.
    


            Meanwhile, North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson, who chairs the House Republican campaign arm, said, “I'm not a lawyer. But the president is the chief of the executive branch.”
    


            Top Democrats have condemned Trump's attempt to fire Cook, with some saying the move is illegal.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent deemed the independence of the Federal Reserve a “political arrangement” a day after President Donald Trump moved to fire a member of the Fed's board, suggesting Trump was working to restore trust in the central bank.
    


            “You have the overwhelming mandate from the American people. You're restoring confidence in government,” Bessent said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House.
    


            Noting the Fed was “on the front of everyone's mind,” Bessent argued the institution relied on trust from the US populace.
    


                    “The Federal Reserve's independence comes from a political arrangement between itself and the American public,” he said. “Having the public's trust is the only thing that gives it credibility, and you sir, are restoring trust to government.”
                





            He didn't mention Lisa Cook, the Fed board member who Trump said he was dismissing yesterday evening, citing allegations of mortgage fraud.
    


            Many legal experts and economists have questioned the move, saying it could undermine faith in the bank's independence from political interference.
    


            President Donald Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in murder cases in Washington, DC.
    


            “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital, capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty,” the president said during a meeting with Cabinet members today.
    


            He said it's a “very strong preventative” measure. “I don't know if we're ready for it in this country … we have no choice,” Trump said.
    


            He said the measure will be implemented in Washington, DC, while “states are going to have to make their own decision.”
    


            It was not immediately clear how Trump's edict would work. Washington, DC, does not have the death penalty, but the federal government does. Unlike in other places, prosecutors — even those who handle local murder cases in DC Superior Court — work for the federally appointed US Attorney.
    


            President Donald Trump called for Harvard University to pay a sweeping $500 million settlement to restore its federal funding, saying the elite university has been “very bad.”
    


            “We want nothing less than $500 million from Harvard. Don't negotiate, Linda,” Trump said to Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
    


            He continued, “They've been very bad. Don't negotiate.”
    


            Harvard is one of the Trump administration's biggest targets, and an agreement between the two parties has so far proven elusive.
    


            The administration has argued it's cracking down on antisemitism on campus amid the Israel-Hamas war. But Harvard, the only school to take on the White House directly in court, has become the epicenter of a broader clash over academic freedom, federal funding and campus oversight — and a belief inside the White House that targeting the country's most elite academic institutions is a winning political issue for the president.
    


            Trump's comments come as a federal judge is expected to soon rule in the school's funding case against the Trump administration. Harvard had asked for an expedited final decision from US District Judge Allison Burroughs before September 3, which the school said was the first date it would be required to submit paperwork to close out grant funding.
    


            The administration has previously reached agreements with fellow Ivy League institutions Columbia University and Brown University.
    


            President Donald Trump ratcheted up his feud with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore Tuesday as he publicly declined the Democratic governor's offer to walk the streets of Baltimore and called the Charm City a “hellhole.”
    


            In remarks last week, Moore, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, encouraged Trump to walk around Baltimore with him and see the city's efforts to curb crime, saying he would see “one of the greatest cities in the United States of America.”
    


            Trump has named Baltimore among the cities where federal forces could be used to crack down on crime, similar to his efforts to deploy the National Guard in Washington, DC.
    


            Trump told reporters in the Cabinet Room on Tuesday that Moore “refuses to admit his problems.”
    


                    “Wes Moore was telling me he wants — ‘I want to walk with the president.' Well, I said, ‘I want to walk with you too someday, but first you got to clean up your crime, because I'm not walking. I'm not walking in Baltimore right now — Baltimore is a hellhole,'” Trump said.
                





            Moore has tweaked Trump on social media since initially extending the offer, saying in a post Sunday that “President Bone Spurs will do anything to get out of walking” and offering to “get you a golf cart if that makes things easier.” In turn, Trump has threatened to “rethink” federal funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge that collapsed last year.
    


            According to the Baltimore Police Department, the homicide rate has decreased 22% compared to this time last year.
    


            President Donald Trump praised Secretary of State Marco Rubio during today's Cabinet meeting — but not without making a playful jab at the Florida Republican's political future.
    


                    “Marco has been really, I think you're born for this job,” Trump said. “I don't think you should ever run for another office,” he added.
                





            “You're so good at this. He is so good. And everybody likes him. Everybody likes him but everybody — much more importantly than like, I think you would say, is respect — they respect Marco,” the president continued.
    


            His comments come weeks after he suggested Vice President JD Vance is the “most likely” heir apparent to the Make America Great Again movement, while proposing that Vance and Rubio join for a future GOP ticket.
    


            “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” Trump said at the time, while appearing with some other members of his Cabinet. “I also think we have incredible people, some of the people on the stage right here.”
    


            President Donald Trump said Tuesday he's no longer going to refer to his domestic policy law as the “big, beautiful” bill, acknowledging the need to better message it to voters who remain deeply skeptical of the signature legislation.
    


            “I'm not going to use the term great, big beautiful,” Trump said. “That was good for getting it approved, but it's not good for explaining to people what it's all about.”
    


            The president added that he instead wants to focus on the tax cuts in the law, in line with broader administration efforts to rebrand the wide-ranging legislation as primarily delivering a middle-class tax cut.
    


            White House officials, seeking to bolster support for the law, have recently sought to emphasize the slice of tax provisions that poll the best with voters, including an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime and deeper tax cuts for some individuals.
    


            But until now, Trump had resisted shifting away from his focus on the law's size and scope, boasting about passing a multitrillion-dollar package so large that there's “something for everything” in it.
    


            President Donald Trump is currently hosting a meeting with his Cabinet.
    


            It comes after the president fired Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and as he has been looking to take his crackdown on crime to a national level.
    


            We'll bring you the latest updates as it happens.
    


            Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's attorney, Abbe Lowell, announced he is filing a lawsuit to challenge President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her yesterday evening.
    


                    “President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action,” he said in a statement sent to CNN.
                





            The announcement comes hours after Trump posted on social media a letter addressed to Cook informing her that he had sufficient “cause” to fire her.

            Trump administration officials are planning to meet with a senior Chinese trade negotiator this week — but there's little expectation it will yield a breakthrough in ending the nations' trade standoff.
    


            The negotiator, Li Chenggang, is expected to meet with deputy-level administration officials during his visit to Washington, a US government spokesperson told CNN. The Wall Street Journal first reported the meeting.
    


            But the sit-down is not a formal negotiating session, and administration officials are skeptical that it will accomplish much. Chenggang was not invited by US officials and instead sought out the meeting on his own, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


Criticism of Trump's trade policies: His arrival comes just days after China's ambassador to the US, Xie Feng, criticized Trump's trade policies in a speech at a soybean industry event for “casting a shadow over China-U.S. agricultural cooperation,” according to a transcript published by the Chinese Embassy.
    


            The remarks have ratcheted up tensions over agricultural issues at the center of the trade dispute, further complicating efforts by the two sides to find a permanent resolution.
    


            Trump earlier this year launched a trade war against China, threatening to slap tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese imports before agreeing to hold off on most of the levies while the two sides negotiated.
    


            The US and China have since held three formal negotiating sessions, with Trump agreeing earlier this month to extend the trade truce until November to give them more time to strike a deal. Still, major points of contention remain: Trump has demanded that China purchase significantly more US soybeans, and yesterday threatened to sharply escalate tariffs if the nation decides to once again curb exports of rare-earth magnets.
    


            The Department of Transportation is threatening to pull federal funding to California, New Mexico and Washington if the states don't comply with a requirement of English language proficiency of all commercial motor vehicle drivers.
    


            The three states must comply within 30 days, or the DOT will hold “up to 100%” of the state's funding from the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. According to a fiscal 2024 funding estimate, California receives approximately over $30 million in federal funding, New Mexico receives over $6 million and Washington receives over $9 million.
    


            “This is a safety issue — making sure drivers of very heavy 80,000-pound rigs can speak the language is truly a critical safety issue,” Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news conference today.
    


            CNN has reached out to each state's respective DOT for comment.
    


Florida incident: The DOT's double down on an order Duffy signed with the requirements in May comes after a truck driver in Florida was accused of making an illegal U-turn that killed three people.
    


            The fatal incident sparked a clash between US Department of Homeland Security and California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over Harjinder Singh, a native of India, obtaining a work permit and driver's license in the state. The Trump administration says Singh was in the US illegally.
    


            Singh had an association with all three states that Duffy threatened. He had a CDL from Washington and California, and had been previously pulled over in New Mexico, according to the secretary.
    


            Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that embattled Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook — who has vowed not to leave her post after President Donald Trump sought to fire her yesterday — doesn't deserve to be at the central bank and should just “go away.”
    


            Trump announced yesterday that he removed Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud. The action, which marked a significant escalation of its attacks on the Fed, was highly unprecedented.
    


            Cook, who has not been charged with any wrongdoing, said yesterday that Trump “has no authority” to fire her and that she will not resign.
    


            A CNN review of mortgage documents shows that Cook took out mortgages for two properties, both of which were listed as her principal residence. However, it's not known why she did so or if she did so intentionally.
    


            Lutnick, during an interview on CNBC's “Squawk Box,” said that Cook should leave her role.
    


                    “A governor of the Federal Reserve literally signs her name and commits mortgage fraud, and she says I'm not going anywhere,” Lutnick said, alleging fraud. “Well, the crook always says I'm not going anywhere. Why would anyone defend that?”
                





            Cook has not been charged with any crimes or wrongdoing and has vowed to stay in her post.
    


            Lutnick said if Cook did commit mortgage fraud, she should no longer serve as a Fed governor.
    


            He added: “This woman should go away if she's committed mortgage fraud, and those signatures sure as hell look like hers.”

            The Trump administration's cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for state and local health departments had vastly uneven effects depending on the political leanings of a state, according to a KFF Health News analysis. Democratic-led states and select blue-leaning cities fought back in court and saw money for public health efforts restored — while GOP-led states sustained big losses.
    


            The Department of Health and Human Services in late March canceled nearly 700 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants nationwide — together worth about $11 billion. Awarded during the covid-19 pandemic, they supported efforts to vaccinate people, reduce health disparities among demographic groups, upgrade antiquated systems for detecting infectious disease outbreaks, and hire community health workers.
    


            Initially, grant cancellations hit blue and red states roughly evenly. Four of the five jurisdictions with the largest number of terminated grants were led by Democrats: California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, and Massachusetts.
    


            But after attorneys general and governors from about two dozen blue states sued in federal court and won an injunction, the balance flipped. Of the five states with the most canceled grants, four are led by Republicans: Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Ohio.
    


            In blue states, nearly 80% of the CDC grant cuts have been restored, compared with fewer than 5% in red states, according to the KFF Health News analysis. Grant amounts reported in an HHS database known as the Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System, or TAGGS, often don't match what states confirmed. Instead, this analysis focused on the number of grants.
    


            The divide is an example of the polarization that permeates health care issues, in which access to safety-net health programs, abortion rights, and the ability of public health officials to respond to disease threats diverge significantly depending on the political party in power.
    


            In an emailed statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said the agency “is committed to protecting the health of every American, regardless of politics or geography. These funds were provided in response to the COVID pandemic, which is long over. We will continue working with states to strengthen public health infrastructure and ensure communities have the tools they need to respond to outbreaks and keep people safe.”
    


            The money in question wasn't spent solely on covid-related activities, public health experts say; it was also used to bolster public health infrastructure and help contain many types of viruses and diseases, including the flu, measles, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus.
    


            “It really supported infrastructure across the board, particularly in how states respond to public health threats,” said Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    


            The Trump cutbacks came as the U.S. recorded its largest measles outbreak in over three decades and 266 pediatric deaths during the most recent flu season — the highest reported outside of a pandemic since 2004. Public health departments canceled vaccine clinics, laid off staff, and put contracts on hold, health officials said in interviews.
    


            After its funding cuts were blocked in court, California retained every grant the Trump administration attempted to claw back, while Texas remains the state with the most grants terminated, with at least 30. As the CDC slashed grants in Texas, its measles outbreak spread across the U.S. and Mexico, sickening at least 4,500 people and killing at least 16.
    


            Colorado, which joined the lawsuit, had 11 grant terminations at first, but then 10 were retained. Meanwhile, its neighboring states that didn't sue — Wyoming, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma — collectively lost 55 grants, with none retained.
    


            In Jackson, Ohio, a half-dozen community health workers came to work one day in March to find the Trump administration had canceled their grant five months early, leaving the Jackson County Health Department half a million dollars short — and them without jobs.
    


            “I had to lay off three employees in a single day, and I haven't had to do that before. We don't have those people doing outreach in Jackson County anymore,” Health Commissioner Kevin Aston said.
    


            At one point, he said, the funding helped 11 Appalachian Ohio counties. Now it supports one.
    


            Marsha Radabaugh, one employee who was reassigned, has scaled back her community health efforts: She'd been helping serve hot meals to homeless people and realized that many clients couldn't read or write, so she brought forms for services such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to their encampment in a local park and helped fill them out.
    


            “We would find them rehab places. We'd get out hygiene kits, blankets, tents, zero-degree sleeping bags, things like that,” she said. As a counselor, she'd also remind people “that they're cared for, that they're worthy of being a human — because, a lot of the time, they're not treated that way.”
    


            Sasha Johnson, who led the community health worker program, said people like Radabaugh “were basically a walking human 411,” offering aid to those in need.
    


            Radabaugh also partnered with a food bank to deliver meals to homebound residents.
    


            Ashton said the abrupt way they lost the funds — which meant the county unexpectedly had to pay unemployment for more people — could have ruined the health district financially. Canceling funding midcycle, he said, “was really scary.”
    


            HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and promoter of vaccine misinformation, has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption.” At HHS, he has taken steps to undermine vaccination in the U.S. and abroad.
    


Trump administration pulls back billions in Covid-era funding for state, local health departments



            Federal CDC funding accounts for more than half of state and local health department budgets, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. States that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election received a higher share of the $15 billion CDC allocated in fiscal 2023 than those that Democrat Kamala Harris won, according to KFF.
    


            The Trump administration's nationwide CDC grant terminations reflect this. More than half were in states that Trump won in 2024, totaling at least 370 terminations before the court action, according to KFF Health News' analysis.
    


            The Columbus, Ohio, health department had received $6.2 million in CDC grants, but roughly half of it — $3 million — disappeared with the Trump cuts. The city laid off 11 people who worked on investigating infectious disease outbreaks in such places as schools and nursing homes, Columbus Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said.
    


            She also said the city had planned to buy a new electronic health record system for easier access to patients' hospital records — which could improve disease detection and provide better treatment for those infected — but that was put on ice.
    


            “We've never had a grant midcycle just get pulled from us for no reason,” Roberts said. “This sense of uncertainty is stressful.”
    


            Columbus did not receive its money directly from the CDC. Rather, the state gave the city some funds it received from the federal government. Ohio, led by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and a Republican attorney general, did not sue to block the funding cuts.
    


            Columbus sued the federal government in April to keep its money, along with other Democratic-led municipalities in Republican-governed states: Harris County, Texas, home to Houston; the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri. A federal judge in June blocked those cuts.
    


            As of mid-August, Columbus was awaiting the funds. Roberts said the city won't rehire staff because the federal funding was expected to end in December.
    


            Joe Grogan, a senior scholar at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Institute and former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council in Trump's first term, said state and local agencies “are not entitled” to the federal money, which was awarded “to deal with an emergency” that has ended.
    


            “We were throwing money out the door the last five years,” Grogan said of the federal government. “I don't understand why there would ever be a controversy in unspent covid money coming back.”
    


CDC facing major funding cuts, with direct impact on state and local health departments



            Ken Gordon, Ohio Department of Health spokesperson, wrote in an email that the $250 million in grants lost had helped with, among other things, upgrading the disease reporting system and boosting public health laboratory testing.
    


            Some of the canceled HHS funding wasn't slated to end for years, including four grants to strengthen public health in Indian Country, a grant to a Minnesota nonprofit focused on reducing substance use disorders, and a few to universities about occupational safety, HIV, tuberculosis, and more.
    


            Brent Ewig, chief policy and government relations officer for the Association of Immunization Managers, said the cuts were “the predictable result of ‘boom, bust, panic, neglect' funding” for public health.
    


            The association represents 64 state, local, and territorial immunization programs, which Ewig said will be less prepared to respond to disease outbreaks, including measles.
    


            “The system is blinking red,” Ewig said.
    


            KFF Health News' analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants sought to answer four questions: 1) How many grants have been terminated in the U.S. under the Trump administration since March? 2) Which states saw the most grants cut? 3) What were the grants for? and 4) Did the grant terminations affect blue, red, and purple states differently? This follows a similar analysis by KFF Health News for an article on nationwide NIH grant terminations.
    


            Our primary data source was a Department of Health and Human Services website showing grant terminations. We compared an initial list of grant terminations from April 3 to one from July 11 to determine how many grants had been restored. The USAspending.gov database helped us track grants by state.
    


            To classify states politically, we followed the same steps from our April coverage on National Institutes of Health grant terminations. States were “blue” if Democrats had complete control of the state government or if the majority of voters favored Democratic presidential candidates in the last three elections (2016, 2020, 2024). “Red” states were classified similarly with respect to the Republican Party. “Purple” states had politically split state governments and/or were generally considered to be presidential election battleground states. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was classified as blue using similar methods.
    


            This analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements in local jurisdictions where the funds were awarded indirectly rather than directly from the CDC; it accounts only for the recipients' location, and excludes grants terminated from Compacts of Free Association states and other foreign entities that received grants directly from the CDC. At least 40 CDC grants were terminated that were meant for global health efforts or assisting public health activities in other nations following the Trump administration's order for the CDC to withdraw support for the World Health Organization.

BANDON, Oregon (AP) — The owner of an Oregon zoo has been indicted on more than 300 counts of animal neglect and other charges after police said they found drugs and guns at the facility.

Brian Tenney, the owner of West Coast Game Park Safari in Bandon, was arraigned on Monday. Tenney's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a phone number associated with the zoo did not have voicemail set up. Tenney has not yet had the opportunity to enter a plea.

Oregon State Police announced earlier this year that authorities served several search warrants at the zoo near the southern Oregon coast in May, following an investigation that included inquiries into the animals' welfare. Police said they found methamphetamine, dozens of firearms, cocaine and large amounts of cash. 

More than 300 animals were relocated to animal sanctuaries or rescue facilities, and a camel, chicken and kinkajou were euthanized after being evaluated by veterinarians. 

A grand jury indicted Tenney on 371 charges — including 327 felonies — on Aug. 19, according to state court records.

Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook late Wednesday said she would not leave her post after Trump on social media called on her to resign over an accusation from one his officials that she committed mortgage fraud.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday night that he's firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented move that would constitute a sharp escalation in his battle to exert greater control over what has long been considered an institution independent from day-to-day politics.

Trump said in a letter posted on his Truth Social platform that he is removing Cook effective immediately because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. 

Cook said Monday night that she would not step down. “President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” she said in an emailed statement. “I will not resign.”

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations last week. Pulte alleged that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.

Trump's move is likely to touch off an extensive legal battle that will probably go to the Supreme Court and could disrupt financial markets. Stock futures declined slightly late Monday, as did the dollar against other major currencies.

If Trump succeeds in removing Cook from the board, it could erode the Fed's political independence, which is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables it to take unpopular steps like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds, pushing up borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business loans. 




Cook has retained Abbe Lowell, a prominent Washington attorney. Lowell said Trump's “reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,” adding, “We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.” 

Cook was appointed to the Fed's board by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve as a governor. She was a Marshall Scholar and received degrees from Oxford University and Spelman College, and she has taught at Michigan State University and Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor “for cause,” which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. The president cannot fire a governor simply because of differences over interest rate policy.

Establishing a for-cause removal typically requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, legal experts say, which hasn't happened in this case.

“This is a procedurally invalid removal under the statute,” said Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia law school and author of “The Fed Unbound,” a book about the Fed's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Menand also said for-cause firings are typically related to misconduct while in office, rather than based on private misconduct from before an official's appointment.

“This is not someone convicted of a crime,” Menand said. “This is not someone who is not carrying out their duties.”

Fed governors vote on the central bank's interest rate decisions and on issues of financial regulation. While they are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, they are not like cabinet secretaries, who serve at the pleasure of the president. They serve 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence. 

While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has sought to fire a Fed governor. In recent decades, presidents of both parties have largely respected Fed independence, though Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson put heavy pressure on the Fed during their presidencies — mostly behind closed doors. Still, that behind-the-scenes pressure to keep interest rates low, the same goal sought by Trump, has widely been blamed for touching off rampant inflation in the late 1960s and ‘70s.

President Harry Truman pushed Thomas McCabe to step down from his position as Fed chair in 1951, though that occurred behind the scenes.

The Supreme Court signaled in a recent decision that Fed officials have greater legal protections from firing than other independent agencies, but it's not clear if that extends to this case. 

Menand noted that the Court's conservative majority has taken a very expansive view of presidential power, saying, “We're in uncharted waters in a sense that it's very difficult to predict that if Lisa Cook goes to court what will happen.” 

Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the president's use of the “for cause” provision is likely an effort to mask his true intent. “It seems like a fig leaf to get what we wants, which is muscling someone on the board to lower rates,” she said.

Trump has said he would only appoint Fed officials who would support lower borrowing costs. He recently named Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, to replace another governor, Adriana Kugler, who stepped down about five months before her term officially ended Aug. 1.

Trump appointed two governors in his first term, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, so replacing Cook would give Trump appointees a 4-3 majority on the Fed's board.

“The American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve,” Trump wrote in a letter addressed to Cook, a copy of which he posted online. “In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, they cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity.”

Trump argued that firing Cook was constitutional. “I have determined that faithfully enacting the law requires your immediate removal from office,” the president wrote.

Cook will have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.

Trump's announcement drew swift rebuke from advocates and former Fed officials.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called Trump's attempt to fire Cook illegal, “the latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans. It's an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.”

Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.

Forcing Cook off the Fed's governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.

Powell signaled last week that the Fed may cut rates soon even as inflation risks remain moderate. Meanwhile, Trump will be able to replace Powell in May 2026, when Powell's term expires. However, 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the chair might not guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.

A Ukrainian woman who came to the U.S. to escape war in her native country was stabbed to death in Charlotte on Friday, police said.

The victim was identified by authorities as 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska.

As news of her tragic death spread, a GoFundMe campaign was also launched to help Zarutska's relatives cope and has so far raised over $12,000.

""Dear friends, our Valeria has suffered a terrible tragedy,"" the fundraiser reads.

""Yesterday, her niece Ira, who was 22 years old, was killed. Ira had recently arrived in the United States, seeking safety from the war and hoping for a new beginning. Tragically, her life was cut short far too soon. This is an irreparable loss for her family.""

The fundraiser, reportedly created on behalf of Zarutska's Ukrainian aunt Valeria, has also drawn support from the local community. 

Organizers said any donations or shares of the campaign ""will mean so much.""

The killing happened at the busy East/West Boulevard light rail station near Camden Road in South End. 

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police said Zarutska was stabbed around 10:30 p.m. When officers arrived and found her, she died at the scene.

Decarlos Brown, 34, was arrested shortly after the incident and hospitalized before being charged with first-degree murder. Police have not released details about what led to the stabbing.

Court records, obtained by The New York Post, show Brown has a history of arrests dating back to 2011, including charges of felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats. Most charges were later dropped.

Zarutska's death has renewed calls for action on public safety in Charlotte. Members of the Charlotte City Council expressed concern Monday about violence on the city's transit system.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker delivered a fiery rebuke of President Trump's reported plan to deploy thousands of National Guard troops to Chicago

The White House fired back at the barrage of criticism from Illinois Democrats over President Donald Trump's threat to send U.S. troops to Chicago. 

""If these Democrats spent half as much time addressing crime in their cities as they did going on cable news to complain about President Trump, their residents would be a lot safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital. 

During a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump himself confirmed that he's ""willing to go to Chicago, which is in big trouble,"" adding that Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., considered a likely 2028 presidential hopeful, ""refuses to admit that he has problems – huge problems.""

Pritzker and his fellow Illinois Democrats – Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Attorney General Kwame Raoul – railed against Trump as a ""wannabe dictator"" on Monday as the White House weighs deploying the U.S. National Guard to Chicago.

""Donald Trump wants to use the military to occupy a U.S. city, punish its dissidents and score political points. If this were happening in any other country, we would have no trouble calling it what it is – a dangerous power grab,"" Pritzker said. 

TRUMP'S WEEK SHAPED BY CRIME AGENDA, POTENTIAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO CHICAGO

Pritzker called the potential move ""exactly the type of overreach that our country's founders warned against.""

""What President Trump is doing is unprecedented and unwarranted. It is illegal. It is unconstitutional. It is un-American,"" he added. 

When reached for comment regarding Pritzker's criticism, the White House shared a fact sheet on Chicago crime, which includes local reporting that indicates, for the past 13 years, Chicago has had the most murders of any U.S. city.

It also includes FOX 32's report that more illegal guns are recovered in Chicago than in Los Angeles or New York City combined. 

The City of Chicago is pushing back with its own fact sheet, arguing Johnson's primary focus has been ""driving down violent crime in Chicago"" during his first two years as mayor. 

""In the first six months of this year, Chicago has seen a 33% reduction in homicides and a 38% reduction in shootings,"" the mayor's office said, citing year-to-date crime statistics. 

Johnson also highlighted a ""citywide homicide clearance rate of 77.4%,"" which his office said is ""the highest in more than a decade,"" as the mayor emphasizes mental health and a ""holistic approach to community safety.""

""It's very safe right now,"" Trump said of Washington, D.C., during his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 

For nearly two weeks, Trump has carried out a crackdown on crime in Washington, mobilizing more than 2,200 National Guard troops to patrol the streets of the nation's capital.

""It's going to get so good that this will be the safest capital there is. It'll be one of the safest places in our nation anywhere,"" Trump told his Cabinet, adding that ""12 days ago, it was the most unsafe place in our nation.""

Trump has floated deploying troops to other U.S. cities as well, including Baltimore, Md., where he was met with criticism by another potential 2028 presidential contender, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.

President Donald Trump speaks from the White House about the potential for his crime crackdown to extend to Chicago, while taking aim at Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.

A weekend fire that destroyed a Baltimore school playground has reignited a broader fight over how Maryland should respond to youth crime.

Two suspects, ages 12 and 13, were arrested in connection to the fire, which reportedly caused more than $100,000 in damage, WBFF reported. Images posted on Facebook by the Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 57 show flames towering over a charred play structure.

While the arson case alarmed parents and neighbors, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore defended the state's strategy and pointed to falling violence statewide.

President Donald Trump, by contrast, said Sunday that he would send the National Guard to Baltimore to ""quickly clean up the crime"" if Moore asked for help. Moore has rejected calls to consider deploying the National Guard to assist local police, though.

Moore had earlier invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in the crime-ridden city in September, saying in an Aug. 21 letter that the event would provide an opportunity to ""discuss strategies for effective public safety policy.""

Appearing on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, Moore claimed that under his leadership, Maryland has seen one of the fastest drops in violent crime in the nation.

""The results have been incredibly encouraging,"" Moore said. ""Maryland has had among the fastest drops of violent crime than anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate is down over 20% since I have been the governor. The last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.""

On city streets, some have said the numbers don't capture daily reality.

""Juvenile crime is out of whack,"" he told WBFF, arguing that repeat offenders are too often returned to the streets. ""They need to put them kids, especially repeat offenders, they need to lock them up,"" he said, adding that parents should face charges in some cases.

A young mother pushing a stroller shared similar fears. Crime in Baltimore ""is very hectic,"" she told the outlet. ""It's very scary, especially for the new generation and a new mom… It's very alarming to raise your kids here.""

Even as official numbers show a dip in crime, Republican lawmakers have said the stats don't tell the full story. Maryland Senate Minority Leader Justin Ready, a Republican, told the outlet that complaints about youth crime are still pouring into his office.

""Just over the weekend, in Baltimore, there was a terrible incident with a playground where (juveniles) set fire to it,"" Ready said. ""Local law enforcement is continuing to tell us, ‘We're still not getting young people who are picked up repeatedly getting the help and treatment of DJS.'""

Moore's newly appointed Department of Juvenile Services secretary, Betsy Fox Tolentino, acknowledged the public's frustration but insisted progress is being made.

""I think everyone's concerns are valid concerns,"" Tolentino told the outlet. ""We have made a lot of progress, especially in Baltimore, in driving down violent crime, and that includes juvenile crime. But until every person feels safe, and the community has trust and confidence in the department, we certainly have work to do.""

Moore's communications director, David Turner, doubled down late Monday, saying that ""public safety remains the governor's top priority,"" and that the administration continues to work with state and local partners to increase accountability.

""As Maryland's chief executive, there is no higher priority than public safety. Though juvenile crime numbers across Maryland continue to drop, we will continue to work in partnership with the general assembly, state's attorneys, local leaders, and advocates to promote accountability for criminal acts and take swift action to keep our communities safe,"" Moore's office shared in a statement with Fox News Digital.

Moore's office told Fox News Digital that the state's programs are working and there have been ""encouraging results."" 

""But the work is not done,"" his office said. ""One person who doesn't feel safe in their community is too many and Governor Moore will continue his all-of-the-above approach to public safety to make our communities safer and hold violent offenders accountable.

Community leaders have begun organizing to rebuild the school playground.

""Today was a tough day. My heart is heavy, and I'm feeling so many emotions right now,"" Kendra Summers commented on a Facebook post of the damage shared by Baltimore City Fire Department's Engine 57. ""Our school playground, a space that has meant so much to our students, families, and staff, was destroyed by arson. It's hard to process, especially with the first day of school just around the corner on Monday.""

Summers said despite the fire, she was ""choosing to focus on the good"" and reminisce on the journey of the playground's construction, which took place in May 2019. 

""This community is resilient, and while today's events are heartbreaking, I know we will rise above them. We will rebuild, and we will continue to grow,"" she added. 

The fire department also encouraged the community to come together to help rebuild the playground.

The FBI on Monday launched a two-day search through dense and rugged terrain in Washington state in the hopes of finding clues to the whereabouts of Travis Decker nearly three months after he allegedly killed his three young daughters.

Investigators still have no evidence about whether Decker is alive or dead, Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison and Peter Orth, the FBI's supervisory senior resident agent in Yakima, said during a news conference Monday.

""You can't be too thorough in a search like this,"" Orth said. ""It is such incredibly dense vegetation that anybody who walks down one of these trails could walk 10 meters off the trail and no one would ever know they're there.""

Decker, a former and trained military survivalist, has been wanted since June 2, when the bodies of his three daughters – Paityn, 9, Evelyn, 8, and Olivia, 5 – were discovered at the Rock Island Campground in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest.

""We will not relent. We will not give up,"" Morrison said Monday, adding that ""the girls would not want us to give up.""

Authorities closed popular campgrounds and trailheads in the forest near Leavenworth to allow about 100 FBI agents and other law enforcement officers to bushwhack through the rugged terrain. 

Divers planned to search Icicle Creek to reach areas where logjams had previously barred dive teams, while other investigators conducted a grid search in a quarter-mile radius around the campground, officials said.

TRAIL GROWS COLD IN MANHUNT FOR SURVIVALIST FATHER AS AUTHORITIES REACH BREAKING POINT: 'I'M STILL ANGRY'

Morrison said that if Decker is still alive in the wilderness, he believes he must be ""pretty tired by now.""

""He's got to be perfect every single day; we just have to be perfect once,"" Morrison said.

Authorities confirmed last week that Decker is the sole suspect in the alleged murders, saying that his DNA was found at the crime scene. No additional DNA profiles were detected.  

""If it's not me wearing this uniform, it'll be another Chelan County Sheriff … We will find him, in one fashion or another,"" Morrison said.

A federal judge appointed by President Donald Trump has tossed a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice against every judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland over a blanket order slowing deportations.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen on Tuesday dismissed a June lawsuit filed against the judges over a standing order from the judicial district's chief judge, George Russell, which automatically granted a two-day pause on deporting illegal immigrants if they file a habeas corpus petition challenging their detention.

Cullen sided with the judges in tossing the case, arguing in the ruling that allowing the lawsuit to proceed “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution's framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign. That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another's authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary's constitutional role,” Cullen wrote, calling the lawsuit “not ordinary.”

The Justice Department, in the lawsuit it filed in June against all of the judges in the judicial district, which only includes one Trump appointee, claimed the standing order was unlawfully interfering in the executive branch's business.

“Every unlawful order entered by the district courts robs the Executive Branch of its most scarce resource: time to put its policies into effect. In the process, such orders diminish the votes of the citizens who elected the head of the Executive Branch,” the DOJ said in its lawsuit.

Lawyers for the federal judges in Maryland argued the lawsuit was “unprecedented” and “fundamentally incompatible with the separation of powers.”

Cullen said in his ruling that the DOJ “must find a proper way to raise” its concerns, and suggested appealing the standing order in a habeas proceeding to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, among other options to challenge the standing order.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, where the challenged order remains in place, has been the venue for multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration, as the left-leaning bench has become a popular place for opponents of the administration to bring their legal challenges.

WHAT IS NEXT FOR ABREGO GARCIA AFTER BEING DETAINED BY ICE

One of the most high-profile cases the Trump administration has fought in the Maryland judicial district was filed by illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia over his deportation.

The latest volley fired in that legal battle, filed Monday, challenges the Salvadoran national's deportation to Uganda via a habeas corpus petition. Because of the standing order in the judicial district, his deportation was automatically paused until at least Wednesday, but a judge indefinitely halted his deportation pending the scheduling of an evidentiary hearing in the case.

It is unclear if Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook showed up for work on Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced he had fired her on Monday evening.

Cook, 61, released a statement late Monday night through her attorneys saying she would not step aside and would continue in the role. The Washington Examiner contacted the Fed to see if Cook was at the Fed on Tuesday, but did not receive confirmation.

The development is one investors are watching closely. Trump's move to fire Cook has drawn criticism that he is eroding the central bank's independence. If successful, Trump's push to remove Cook would be the first time a president has ever removed a Fed governor.

Trump critics have encouraged Cook to use legal means to fight removal to protect the central bank's independence. At issue, too, is the response from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and whether he recognizes Trump's order for Cook's dismissal as legitimate. Powell has for months been under pressure from Trump and his advisers, including the threat of being fired himself.

The announcement Monday night came after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte asked the Justice Department to consider prosecuting Cook for mortgage fraud.

Trump said that Cook was fired with immediate effect in a note posted to Truth Social. In the document, he accused her of “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct.” He argued that the allegations of mortgage fraud were the cause he needed to fire her.

Although the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the president generally has the power to remove independent agency members, the conservative majority stipulated in that case that Federal Reserve board members can only be fired for cause.

Cook, though, said she intends to keep doing her job, indicating that she plans to mount a legal challenge to being fired.

“President Trump purported to fire me ‘for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,” Cook said in a statement. “I will not resign. I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.”

LISA COOK SAYS SHE'S NOT LEAVING FED AND TRUMP HAS ‘NO AUTHORITY' TO FIRE HER

Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates, and if he is able to replace Cook, he will have another vote on the 12-person Fed board. Adriana Kugler, another Fed governor who voted to hold interest rates steady, recently and unexpectedly resigned, handing Trump another opening on the board.

Two members of the Federal Open Market Committee, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, voted to lower interest rates at the last meeting.

Dear James,

I'm 19, and as childish as it sounds, I've fallen deeply for someone who will never love me back.

He's my co-worker. We both belong to a small group working in theoretical math, and we see each other almost every week for meetings. He's several years older than me, and I guess when I look at him, I see a guy who's incredibly smart and seems to have his life figured out. Every time he explains a problem, I find myself getting lost, just watching his face.

I know he won't ever look at me the same way as I look at him. But I try to make myself smarter, funnier, prettier, more interesting. I laugh at his dumb jokes (even when I consciously tell myself not to). I remember the smallest details he shares. And every time I stop myself from texting him something funny, sending him a cat picture, or asking him to hang out, I hate myself just a little more for not simply telling him the truth: “I really like you.”

Somehow, I've convinced myself that if I just get thinner, or smarter, or somehow better, I'll finally have permission to feel this way—maybe even to tell him. What do I do? How am I supposed to feel?

Dear Reader,

As I say to my son when I'm trying to give him advice: “I'm not cleverer than you; I've just been around longer—which means that sometimes I know what happens next.”

What you're going through is extremely painful and not childish at all.

People have been going through it forever, of course. In Ted Hughes's retelling of Ovid's Metamorphoses, the nymph Echo has an almighty crush on Narcissus, and “like a cat in winter at a fire / She could not edge close enough / To what singed her, and would burn her.” Sound familiar?

So this is an age-old human difficulty. But no question that it's worse today, more acute, more invasive of our imaginations, because of [Sound of middle-aged columnist clambering breathlessly onto hobbyhorse.] our goddamn phones. The bastardized telepathy of texting, the endless pseudo-proximity of everybody to everybody else—any kind of preoccupation or passionate interest gets horribly magnified and distorted.

You're in a difficult spot, is what I'm saying. I can guarantee you two things.

One: This person, as good as he might be at math, and as gazeable-upon as his face no doubt is, does not have his life figured out, because nobody does. He's precisely as messed up / un–messed up as you are.

Two: You do not need to be thinner, smarter, or better. I don't mean to be glib about the effects of generations of patriarchal damage and the ongoing psychic catastrophe of consumerism, but—you've got to get that stuff out of your head. It's poison. It's also quite wrong. You yourself, right now, just as you are, are enough and more than enough.

Am I being helpful at all? Probably not. That's the worst thing about this condition: It's pretty much immune to counsel, immune to rationality, immune to quotations from Ted Hughes. You just have to hang in there until it wears off. As a practical matter, please make sure you're taking care of yourself in other areas of your life—seeing friends, getting around, having fun, playing the banjo, riding buses, talking to dogs. Don't stay up too late. Get the protein in. Avoid the company of mopers or blowhards. Eventually, eventually, all of this will guide you back to feeling all right.

Sending you profound stamina vibes,

James

Dear James,

I work for a small-business lending company, in the credit department, reviewing and moving files as quickly as possible. We get pressure from above to move faster and from below from our customers. I have been a team lead for a year, yet every day, I feel like an impostor—because I do not have a background in accounting or lending. I also get really anxious if things start to fall apart, which they do often. (We just completely changed our workflow, and the growing pains are mounting up.) I try to do my best, but mostly I watch the clock, waiting for eight hours to pass as soon as possible.

I have at least one moment each day when all I want to do is quit. I have another job bartending, so I can do that for a while, and I have savings to get through six months. But I stay because I need the health insurance. (I started therapy again because of my job, and I'm seeing an ophthalmologist tomorrow.)

I get scared to quit because of the economy, but I'm exhausted. It takes all my energy to maintain a professional demeanor. I stare at my phone, go to bed, wake up, repeat. I know everything is temporary, but I really think this is going to ruin me. Any thoughts?

Dear Reader,

Quit! Screw this job! Life is for living!

Feel better? I do.

Seriously, though: Quit. Screw this job. Life is for living. You are in a spiral here, and you need to pull out of it. “Maintaining a professional demeanor” can blow your mind more thoroughly than the most violent psychedelic.

There remains the small matter of the future. Even my dog can tell that I have zero expertise in financial planning—but it doesn't sound like you're being irresponsible; you've got money saved, and you've got your bartending gig. What happens next is what happens next, but one thing's for sure: In two weeks, you will feel so much better.

Byronically, on a mountaintop,

James

A short story

A boy in Rowena, Missouri, ate mud one day. In a ditch, he ate it with a spoon. His mother had warned him, but the boy didn't listen—he kept eating all morning, then scooted back up to sit where the ground was dry and licked the spoon. This was late May. He tucked the spoon down into his boot. Back home, his mother had a headache. She moved slowly around the house, a cool, wet cloth held to her forehead, while the boy watched. And the next day he found her dead on the floor, in the living room. The boy tried talking to her. He nudged her body with his foot, he picked up her hand and let it drop. Why hadn't she told him? Why hadn't she been clear that this was the thing that would happen? He would've spit it out, he thought, put the mud back in the puddle, or never touched it at all—the mud hadn't even tasted good. He would've stayed stacking bricks in the back field, making a wall in case the field should ever flood.

The boy's name was Dale. He was 9, almost 10. He didn't mention the mud to his father, who hadn't been home at the time—he was a truck driver. Dale had a feeling that his father already knew, or anyway that his father had a sense somehow that Dale was to blame. For two days, the boy had left her there on the rug, until his father returned. Maybe he was wrong, he'd kept thinking, maybe she's napping, maybe she was just very, very tired. Dale's grandfather had been there too, his father's father, in his bedroom, or else in the bathroom, or stalled leaning on the wall somewhere in between, but the grandfather hardly opened his eyes anymore—all he could see at this point was darkness, he'd said, like the sky at night with little specks in it, in the center a circle of white almost like the moon, but more and more the circle was smeared. Walking past the mother, he hadn't even paused. He did ask once where she was, when he realized it was Dale who was bringing the toast and jelly, the milk, taking away the dirty plates and cups, and Dale had said only that she hadn't gone anywhere, she was here, she was lying on the floor.

Two weeks went by—the funeral, people in and out through the side door, the kitchen door, his father in there at the table.

When his father told him late one morning to pack up some clothes, his boots, a few toys if he wanted, Dale wasn't sure why. They got doughnuts from a gas station. Out on the highway, his father reached over now and then and patted Dale on the knee.

Hours later, Dale understood they were on the way to his grandmother's house in Virginia. His mother's mother. She'd been there for the funeral, but she left right after—people were still eating lunch. He recognized the house now when they pulled up, though he hadn't been here in years, but his father told him that the grandmother had moved, and so he wondered if the house had moved also, or if maybe that's why she'd chosen this one—because it looked just like the old one. He kept the question to himself. That night, they watched an old movie, something slow and quiet about a girl on a train, then Dale slept in the spare bedroom, his father on the little couch with his feet hanging over the armrest. And then, in the morning, his father was gone. The truck was gone. The quilt was folded neatly where he'd slept.

Of course, Dale thought. Of course. His father knew, after all. He'd seen the way the mother had died—why would he want that for himself?

And even before that, his mother's friend, the woman who watched Dale sometimes when the mother had work, the one with red hair, with the spots on her forehead—a year had gone by before anyone told Dale she was dead. Of course he understood now that he'd done it, but how? Sometimes at night, at the grandmother's house, he would feel a tingling somewhere in his body—his heels, his fingertips, the tops of his ears—and he'd think maybe that was it, the tingling was a gathering of his powers. The powers could move through his body, coming close to the surface, then sinking again. But that was wrong, he'd think later. It wasn't powers, it was more like a poison he carried inside himself: mix him with mud and the poison gets released. But that was wrong too—it wasn't that simple. With his mother's friend, he hadn't eaten any mud. He couldn't remember doing anything at all.

The grandmother was next, though. He could feel it. She was starving. Already the thinnest person he'd ever seen in real life, now she wouldn't even eat. All she did was cook for Dale, then sit there across the table just with cold coffee in a jar. She knows, he thought. She's not even fighting.

Or maybe she was—maybe that's why she kept telling him to go outside, get some fresh air. She'd pull back the curtain and stare out at the trees behind the house. “I don't know what you're waiting for,” she'd say. She was trying to protect herself. Her hands would shake when she reached for things.

“Go on,” she said. “It's summer. Get out there.”

So he did, he went outside, every day a little farther. After a few days, his grandmother didn't have to say anything—as soon as he finished his cereal, he'd put his boots on.

He was out there the following week, up in a tree, when the twins passed underneath. They moved silently, dressed alike in jean shorts and red shirts with the sleeves cut off.

The next day, out walking, he turned around—there they were again. Or maybe they weren't. He hadn't heard any sound—it was just a feeling that something was back there. In the woods, his mind was like that, always imagining things. A few days earlier, he'd seen a snake that disappeared when the wind blew.

The twins were real, though. They had a smell, a mix of soap and smoke and sweat. Up close he could see that they were a boy and a girl, both with short hair.

The boy said his name was Peter.

Dale stared back at him.

After a while, Peter asked, “What's wrong with you? Can you talk?”

The girl stepped closer and said her name was June. She and her brother were 11, just turned. She guessed Dale was 11 too, then when he shook his head, she tried again. “Ten?” Dale kept shaking his head.

Later Peter said, “I like that you don't talk much. Sometimes quiet people are smart.”

“That's rude,” June told him.

“What? I said maybe he's smart.”

Meeting him that first time, though, Peter seemed wary. “Just so you know,” he said, “where you are right now is our property.”

“It is?” June asked.

“But it's okay,” he said. “I guess you can use it.”

Dale still hadn't spoken a word. He had the idea now that he might not have to—he could simply stand here, and whatever this was would keep happening.

Then Peter offered a tour, and Dale and June followed him through the woods.

“Don't touch that one,” he said, pointing at a bush, Dale thought, as they passed, but quickly Peter was pointing at something else. “Over there used to be a beehive,” he said, “but not anymore. I took care of it.”

A few minutes later, they stopped at a tree that seemed dead. It was gray, top to bottom, the branches dried out, but the trunk solid. Except for an opening, a hole that Peter reached his arm into, up to his shoulder. He grunted. Then out came a fistful of small feathers: gray and brown, a few mostly white, a few blue.

“If you find any feathers, you can put them in here.”

“But you don't have to,” June said. “You can keep them if you want.”

“Not if it's a turkey though. The turkeys are ours.”

“Don't listen to him,” June said.

“And you can't take these,” Peter went on, patting the tree. “These in the tree are ours.”

His grandmother would die, Dale thought, but he would stay, the house would be his—he never doubted that it would happen this way. He had a strange experience in the bathroom one night. In the mirror, he saw his face, and the face looked sad, of course, but the sadness was just a part of it, like the eyes, the nose—he couldn't do anything about it, the same way he couldn't just peel off his nose. Of course he missed his mother. Of course he didn't want his grandmother to die, but he couldn't do anything about that either—it didn't matter what he wanted. This was a revelation: What he wanted didn't matter at all. The sadness didn't go away after that, he could still feel it, but he could feel it shifting a little bit. If you don't look at the mirror, you can't see your eyes, but the eyes are still there, they don't go anywhere—it was like that, maybe. Just don't look at the eyes. And maybe after his grandmother was dead, he thought, maybe then he could just lock the door and be alone in the house and no one else would have to die.

In the meantime, in the evenings, he watched his grandmother move quietly from one piece of furniture to another. They never spoke about his mother. They watched game shows, detective shows, movies the grandmother had seen before.

Every once in a while, the father would call. “How's it going?” he'd ask. “How's your grandma?”

“Fine,” Dale would say.

Usually the grandmother fell asleep upright in the recliner, still dressed in her daytime clothes, her house shoes, arms wrapped around herself under a light blanket.

By mid-morning, the twins would find him. Not that he was hiding—most days all he did was walk slowly in a wide loop through the woods, waiting, peering this way and that, never sure which direction they might come from. They had this game that Dale couldn't quite follow. Peter would draw a circle in the dirt, a triangle beside it. Then he and June would take turns moving acorns and feathers from one shape to the other. They arranged piles. At June's turn, Peter would lean in and mouth sounds like a beating heart. Occasionally June would caw like a crow, and Peter would chirp or hiss.

The twins packed lunches—crackers, bananas, peanut-butter sandwiches—in their pockets. Peter ate leaves too. He knew which plants were safe.

“Actually this one here is fine,” he said one day. “It's not poison, but it tastes like an armpit.”

“You would know,” June said.

“See, now, that's rude.”

Then to Dale he said, “But this one over here? This one tastes like lemon. Try it.”

Some days Peter was a minister. “Please,” he'd say. “Please be seated.” And June would sit first—she'd be the example—on the fallen tree they used as a bench. “What a lovely congregation we have today. What a beautiful bunch of sinners.” Peter would shake his fist at June and Dale, then at the sky. His eyes would roll around. He'd tear a bread slice and flatten the pieces between his palms.

“Don't grab it,” June said the first time they played. “Let him put it in your mouth.”

So Dale closed his eyes and felt Peter's fingers on his tongue. He tasted dirt. Then, when he was finished, Peter softly flicked Dale's forehead. “Bless you, my son.”

“It's a lot more fun this way,” June said afterward. “When it was just us, I had to eat all the bread myself.”

It was Peter's idea that they go visit the Miles brothers. They lived nearby, apparently, beyond the woods somewhere, though in all his wandering, Dale hadn't yet found a place where the woods had an edge. It was early July now, the air was hot but dry.

“Watch out,” Peter said. “Don't step on that flower.”

Dale was staring at the ground already, but he didn't see any flower.

“Hey,” Peter said. “You stepped on it.”

Eventually they crossed a dry creek bed and climbed—June on all fours—up a mossy, rocky slope. The woods ended abruptly at a barbed-wire fence.

“Over here,” Peter said, and led the way to a stump that had grown right beside the fence. He climbed up onto the stump and jumped over the wire.

The Miles brothers were crouched in the tall grass, dressed in desert camouflage and red bandannas. When Dale and the twins got close, the brothers stood, one tall, the other short.

“Is this him?” asked the tall one.

“What do you think?” said Peter.

The short one said, “Get an attitude and the deal's off.”

“What deal?” June asked.

Dale wondered the same thing, but no one answered. The tall one took off, and they followed him through scratching weeds, waist-high at times, then down a hill to an old barn. The barn was small, crooked, with two rotting trees beside it. Fallen branches were crumbling into the ground. Dale tried counting the antlers mounted over and alongside the door, as the tall brother unwound a chain from the handle.

The barn was dim inside, mostly empty, with a few stacked tires and barrels in a line near a back corner. A black rubber hose hung snaking from the rafters. Slowly they all stepped farther in, and Dale thought he could hear breathing. He was right—behind the barrels was a beagle lying awake in a cage.

Peter knelt and whispered to the dog, who was slow to react. Peter turned back around. “She seems hungry.”

“We've been feeding her,” the short brother said.

They talked for a while in whispers, Peter and the two brothers. Dale shifted his weight back and forth, foot to foot, eyes aimed sideways at June. She was staring at Peter, at the back of his head.

Then the whispering was over—the short brother unlocked the cage, and Peter pulled a leash from one of his side pockets.

Dale wasn't sure what had happened, but now Peter had the dog. June was patting it on the head as they turned to leave. The dog's tail was wagging. Dale was following the twins and the dog out into the sunlight when the tall brother caught him by the shoulder. The grip wasn't tight, but somehow Dale couldn't move. June stopped too, but Peter pulled her along by the wrist, and the hand on Dale's shoulder gently guided him backwards. It was a trade, he began to understand: him for the dog. He watched June trying to pull away from Peter as he jerked her forward, into the weeds, up the hill. They were gone.

The short brother was still standing beside the cage.

“Is he deaf?” the tall one asked, and Dale realized they'd been talking, but he'd missed the words.

The short one got up close to Dale's face. “Are you deaf?” He asked the question loudly, slowly.

Dale felt his head moving side to side, as the brothers backed away. With the door closed, he couldn't tell the voices apart—one didn't like it, whatever they were up to, he said that more than once. He said, “I think there's something wrong with him.”

It must have been the other one, then, who started locking the door from the outside. The chain clinked, sliding link by link back through the handle. Dale could hear muttering, then maybe a slap, then another one, or maybe clapping. Whatever it was, Dale didn't care—when they let him out later, he'd see that this was partly the problem, the taller brother telling him that he wasn't any fun, he wasn't doing this right, he was supposed to fight back. But Dale didn't feel like fighting. He felt confused, stunned, but also oddly at ease. He hadn't thought of his mother in days. Outside, the brothers had gone quiet, or they'd left. Eventually his eyes adjusted. Above were pinpoints of light, holes in the roof, and a little more shone through gaps in the wall boards. Inside the cage was an old blanket, a chewed bone, a pot with a broken handle with water in it. Dale lowered himself and reached in for the blanket and spread it on the ground. Maybe this was good, he thought. If he could stay here, his grandmother could quit starving herself. He imagined her waiting, wondering where he was, then giving up and eating whatever she cooked for him that night. He lay back on the blanket—it was a thin quilt, loose threads here and there, pieces peeling off, the edges frayed. It smelled like the dog. But in the air he could still smell June. With his eyes closed, it was like she never left. They were lucky—she and Peter both. He could've killed them too.

It was still daylight when the Miles brothers let him out. They had to pull him, one brother at each arm. They looked scared, the short one more so. He was supposed to fight back earlier, the tall one said, not now—now it was over, they wanted him gone. Dale still hadn't spoken. The short one pointed up the hill, toward the fence. “Go.”

The tall one stomped at him, like Dale was a dog. “Go on,” he said. “Go home.”

“I didn't know that's what we were doing,” June said. “I swear.”

A few days, most of a week, had passed, Dale staying closer to his grandmother's house, just far enough that she wouldn't see him if she stepped out back to water the plants. For hours at a time, he'd been lying in the shade of a shrub row, in a narrow hole he'd dug by hand.

But now he was out in the woods again. The twins had followed him up into the maple tree where he'd been sitting all morning.

“Tell him I didn't know,” June said.

Peter was slumped, straddling a lower branch, his hands deep in his side pockets. “She didn't know.”

“Tell him you're sorry.”

Peter sighed. “I'm sorry.”

“Look at him,” June said. “Look up here and say it. You can't trade people for dogs. I swear I didn't know,” she said to Dale.

Dale leaned out and looked down at Peter. “Where is she?” he called down.

“Who?”

“The dog.”

“I don't know,” Peter said, shaking his head. “She ran off again.”

June reached out and laid her hand on Dale's knee. “Do you forgive us?”

Dale stared at it, the pink freckled hand, the green on the fingers from tearing blades of grass, maybe, or leaves. The fingers felt hot. “Okay.”

“You have to say it.”

“I forgive you.”

“Do you mean it?”

Dale nodded.

“Can we get down now?” Peter asked. “Can we do something else?”

“Look at me,” June said. “At my face. Do you mean it?”

Dale couldn't stay away. He tried. But his grandmother kept telling him to get outside. She stood moving her hand like a broom through the air, sweeping, sweeping, and it worked: She swept him out the door. He tried hiding for a time, but the twins always found him. One morning he even tried burying himself, but the twins were there before he could finish. He'd closed his eyes for a moment, not a nap, just a long blink, and then there they were, staring down at him. They helped brush the dirt from his legs, then played like the dirt was sand. They tried building a castle.

Dale gave up. He quit hiding. It was easier, he decided, if he just did whatever anyone asked him to. He felt less responsible that way. Some days an hour or two might go by and he would even forget to worry. But always the moment would pass, and June would say, “What is it? What's wrong?”

Dale would look away, over his shoulder, up toward a high tree branch, like he'd heard something up there. He would freeze, unblinking, like a deer.

And then one day, late morning, he got to the feather tree and found only June.

“Peter has a fever,” she said.

A day later, she told him they'd figured out why—there was a spider in the bed, Peter got bitten.

“A spider?”

June nodded. He had one bite on his leg—she pointed to her thigh, the inside of it, up high—and another behind his ear.

Dale was quiet. He picked up a stick and held it close, rotating it, staring hard at the bark.

“He says when he closes his eyes he sees fire,” June said.

“Fire?”

“Yeah, but he's said that before. I think he always sees fire.”

With Peter away, their games were more subdued. Mostly they moved from tree to tree, climbing a few branches, sitting for a while, dropping back down.

“If we were monkeys,” June said, “we could just swing. We wouldn't have to go all the way down to get around.”

“Or squirrels,” Dale said. In his mind, Peter was still there, always hovering, sweating, shivering at the edge of things, but for some reason Dale had less trouble speaking now. June noticed—she told him she was glad. She liked his voice, she said, she liked his accent.

“What accent?”

“That one,” she said. “Right there.”

One afternoon she told him she wanted to be a rancher when she grew up. She'd felt this way for years, always imagining cows, brown ones, only brown, in a field with a pond in the middle and one tree beside it, but now the dream was a fox ranch. She had no idea where it had come from—it felt like a vision. She closed her eyes now, smiling. Dale felt nervous watching her sway slightly on the branch. Then she opened her eyes and added, “It's not about the fur. I don't want the fur. I just want the foxes to live there, in the field, you know?”

Dale nodded. “Foxes are good,” he said after a moment.

“When I picture a fox,” June said, “I always smell cinnamon.”

Then Dale told her he'd seen a fox on the highway, on his way here, with his dad, and June said, “Please tell me it wasn't roadkill.”

“No, it was alive.”

June was relieved.

But this wasn't quite true—he'd only thought at first that it was a fox. Really it was a dog, a small collie in a field where the hay bales were getting rained on, but June was smiling.

Later that afternoon, she said, “I almost forgot,” and brought out a wad of rubber bands from her back pocket. Dale had never seen rubber bands so small—he could roll them up his fingers like rings, pink, blue, yellow, green. June's hair was only a few inches long, but she showed him how to twist the strands together, then pinch a small white feather in with the hair and fasten it all with a rubber band. It looked easy, but Dale kept pulling out hairs, finding them wrapped around his fingers, or caught swirled in the sweat of his palm, which June seemed not to notice. She went on handing him the rubber bands, one at a time, over her shoulder.

When they finished, she swung her head side to side. “Is it good?”

“I think so,” Dale said. The feathers were uneven, but they stayed in place. He rolled a few stray hairs into a ball, let the ball fall into his pocket.

“Thank you.” June squeezed his hand. “In 1 million years, my brother would not have done that for me.”

Walking, she said, “You know, I prayed that this would happen. Something like this.”

“You did?”

June nodded. “And now here you are.”

Another afternoon they were sitting in a shallow hole, about the size of a bathtub but not as deep. Peter had said before that it was a deer's bed, which maybe it was. Dale was leaning back at one end, propped up by his elbows, June at the other end, their legs stacked in the middle. They were quiet. A breeze rustled high up in the trees. He could hear June breathing. Then she pulled a small plastic bag out of her pocket with two cookies inside, and Dale reached forward to take one—the chocolate chips were soft, melting on his fingers—and he had the thought that this cookie wasn't meant for him, this was Peter's cookie. June hadn't mentioned her brother in several days. Dale tried to remember how many. He felt like he should ask.

But June got up before he could do it and Dale followed her to the creek bed. They sat on the bank on a flat, slanting rock. June folded back the hem of her shorts. Her name was written on the fabric there in black marker, in cursive. She traced her finger over the letters. Dale was scared. He stared at the side of her head, her hair still wavy where the rubber bands had been. He felt like his ribs were getting smaller, tighter.

Then when June looked up from her shorts, he turned away—his head came around so quickly, his neck hurt.

“I've never been in love before,” she said.

Dale stayed quiet. He could see her hand creeping toward him across the rock.

“I mean, I like it,” she went on. “It's just … It's different.” Then leaning closer to Dale, “We're in love—you know that, don't you?” She leaned a little farther, her head nearly landing in Dale's lap, so she could look up at his eyes.

“I killed your brother,” Dale said suddenly. He could hardly believe he'd said it out loud.

“Peter? Peter's not dead, he's fine. My parents said we just have to shun him for a while.”

“What?”

“It means you act like he isn't there,” June said. “It's a punishment.” She rolled up the leg of her shorts a few more inches and leaned away, showing a bruise on the back of her thigh, teeth marks. “He bit me.”

Dale was standing now, scratching his elbow.

“He only comes out to use the bathroom,” June said. “He has to knock first and get permission before he comes out.”

“What about food?”

“He eats whatever we eat. He just has to do it in his room. He's fine,” she said again. “It's just for a while longer.”

“He doesn't have a fever?”

“Not anymore.” She stepped over. She kept following Dale until he stopped turning away. “You are so cute,” she said.

The next day, back at the creek bed, June was sitting on the ground, giving directions—this rock goes here, that one over there—and Dale was moving the rocks where she pointed. There hadn't been rain, serious rain, in a month or more, but if it came, if the creek got going, the rocks they'd arranged would form a dam. Then they'd have a lake, or at least a pond, June had said, a secret, and Dale could carve them a canoe, she'd also said, he could hollow out a tree trunk.

Dale quietly kept gathering rocks.

“You're gonna hurt your back doing it like that,” June told him.

A minute later she said, “Hey—look at me.”

Then when Dale didn't look, she reached over for a stick and threw it spinning at his back. “Hey.”

He lasted one more day without saying anything. Later he would remember how he'd wished someone would take him away, load him up and drive him blindfolded somewhere he didn't know. The wishing was always vague—a locked room, himself inside it, lying there on a cot. Somehow it never occurred to him that he could run away, or that he could stay indoors, in his bed, and tell his grandmother he was sick. Or that he could just stay quiet, like he had before. Instead he found June back at the creek bed and told her everything.

When he finished, she said, “But Peter isn't dead.”

“Not yet,” Dale said.

She tried holding his hand, but Dale pulled away, so she stood clasping her own. When Dale looked over, she was smiling. He couldn't understand it. He told her she might die—she could be dying right now, he could be killing her so slowly, she wouldn't even notice.

But June kept smiling.

Soon she grabbed hold of his shirt, the bottom of it, and started pulling.

They walked fast, headed toward the feather tree, Dale was thinking, his shirt was stretching, but she wouldn't slow down. Then she changed direction.

Where they stopped was a tall oak. They'd piled acorns here once before, with Peter, but the pile had disappeared overnight. From the ground, the oak seemed like the tallest tree in the woods.

“Watch,” June said. “Stand over there.”

She jumped for a branch, out near the end where it dipped toward the ground, then tried again, then on the third try she got ahold of it with both hands. She inched her way toward the trunk. Where the branch got thick, she swung her legs up and pulled her body over the top. At the trunk she stood, pressing her palms together for a moment, then started climbing—faster than Dale had seen her climb before—no stopping, no glancing down, feet following hands. She circled behind the trunk and back around three times, the branches like a spiral staircase, until she was high enough that Dale could raise a hand and pinch her body between two fingers.

“Stay back,” she called down. Dale stayed where he was.

For a moment it seemed the air would hold her, her left foot resting there, with nothing underneath—then it all happened quickly, the back foot stepping off, the branches tossing her back and forth a little on the way down, tilting her body so that she was falling headfirst, before the space opened up and she rotated back around and landed mostly on her side, her left arm bent backwards. Dale began breathing again, then threw up between his boots.

June was moaning, rocking slightly to one side, then the other. She coughed. “See?” she said. “I'm still alive.”

All she could do, though, was lie there. Dale came a few steps closer and stared down at her. Except for the arm, you could think she was napping. Then, reaching out with her good arm, she said she was ready, and Dale helped her up.

They walked side by side, their bodies almost touching, moving at June's pace, which was slow, her feet shuffling. At the bottom of a rise, they stopped. They couldn't see her house from here, but June said it was up there, it wasn't far. This was as close as Dale had gotten. On the ground was a tire with moss growing on one side. Dale pushed at it with his boot—the tire was stiff. June turned then, quickly, wincing, and tried kissing him—she went up on her toes—but he twisted away, so she only got his shoulder.

June walked the rest of the way by herself, she hobbled. Dale stayed there at the tire, watching until she'd gotten over the hill. Then he ran.

Back at his grandmother's house, he sprayed himself off with the hose—he'd thrown up on his shirt too, it turned out, and a little on his shorts. He stayed outside in the sun, tossing driveway gravel into a bucket, until his clothes were dry.

The next morning, he went back, then again in the afternoon. For a week he kept going, two, three, four times a day, never farther than the mossy tire. He tried climbing a tree nearby, but he still couldn't see the house.

When June finally came out, she told him she was sorry.

“For what?”

“For making you worry,” she said. “Didn't you worry about me?”

Dale nodded. She had scrapes he hadn't noticed before, on her face, her legs, her hand.

“Well, you can stop,” she said. “I'm okay.”

For days after that, all they did was walk until they found a place to sit together, on the ground or on a stump, somewhere cool. Hours could pass with no talking. Sometimes they held hands. June's left arm was in a cast, lime-green armor from her hand to her shoulder. Her thumb had its own hole. It smelled like sweat and mud, and a little like honey, when Dale put his nose close to the openings.

Then came a day in early August. From a distance, Dale thought June was leading a shrunken old man. Pale. Shoulders hunched. But when they got close, he stood up straight and smiled. Peter was fine. Where the spider had bitten him, he had flat, red circles, like coins. “Feel it,” he said. “It's like a hot rock in there.”

But Dale wouldn't touch.

“So you're a fisherman now?”

“Don't start,” June said.

“What?” Peter said. “I like it.”

Dale's grandmother had bought him a vest. The first day he'd worn it, June tried counting the pockets—he held his arms out straight while June walked around—but each time she counted, the number was different: 17, 18, 20 … They still hadn't figured it out.

Peter raised his arm then and brought it down gently on Dale's shoulders. “My sister tells me you're in love.”

Peter was set to perform the ceremony. He stood waiting now on the slanted rock, with a white collared shirt turned backwards. Dale had had to button it for him—June couldn't do it one-handed.

The Miles brothers were witnesses across the creek bed. One had his hands behind his back, the other stood in salute.

June wore a long white T-shirt, stretched loose at the neck, the armpits dark—her father had thrown it out, she said, but she'd saved it, and now she knew why—and her father's belt, cinched up over her stomach, the extra length hanging behind like a brown, braided tail.

Dale zipped up his vest as Peter began.

“Dear beloved,” he said. “Thank you. Thank you. What a day this is. You're sinners, each and every one. But let us forget about that for now and rejoice in joy and happiness.” He went on like that for a while.

Dale and June exchanged bracelets. He gave her a black shoelace with a green glass bead, tied with a square knot. June gave him a squirrel tail she'd hot-glued end to end. Dale had to loop it around twice to keep it from sliding off his wrist.

“You stole that from me,” Peter said, staring at the squirrel tail. He held up a hand when it looked as though June would argue. “It's okay,” he said. “You have my permission.”

Then he spoke a few words to the sky, asking for a blessing. To the couple, he said, “A bracelet is like a ring. It's a circle. It's round. It keeps going.”

He said, “We'll bow our heads now, and you can do the kiss.”

But Peter did not bow his head, and neither did the Miles brothers. They all watched with eyes open wide as Dale leaned forward and June bent her head sideways, her ear down close to her shoulder. With his own eyes shut, Dale felt his bottom lip land somewhere in her hair. But then they got things situated—they got through it.

“That was very nice,” Peter said afterward. “Congratulations.” He yelled across the creek bed, “Thank you to our guests! If you had brought gifts, I would ask you to bring them forward now!”

Clearly Peter was excited. He couldn't stand still. “I think I was born for this.” He sounded frantic. “Next time we'll do better. We'll get more people. We'll find—”

“Peter, you did great,” June said. “Thank you.”

It seemed for a little while longer like Peter was lost in a dream. Then he drifted back. He shook Dale's hand, gripping it with both of his own, and hugged June's head to his chest.

They could hear him whistling, even in the distance, as he walked away.

And then Dale followed June, gathering sticks, nothing thinner or shorter than a broom handle. June held her good arm outstretched at the same angle as the cast, and Dale loaded the sticks. They crossed the creek bed. They had a place picked out beside the fence—branches overhead, but no roots sticking up through the dirt. Dale did the arranging, the sticks tightly side by side, a lean-to roof along the fence's top wire. They gathered more. They worked for an hour. Then he took off the vest and made a pouch with his shirtfront and filled it with pine needles for the floor, soft moss for pillows.

When June needed to pee, Dale turned away. He considered where he should go, how far.

“It's okay,” June told him. She picked her way carefully down the slope, down among the rocks, and squatted there. “You're my husband,” she said.

Afterward they crawled into the house they'd built, June first, then Dale, and lay there on the ground listening to each other breathe. Dale scooted over closer, away from the barbed wire. The breeze was warm, dry—he could feel it moving up his shorts. He had no idea how clearly he would remember this later. Years from now, back in Missouri, the children would ask about their mother, and Dale would describe the jolt he felt that day when June finally spoke. How quiet it was, and then her voice coming hushed, fast, saying she'd never been so happy in her life, but at the same time she couldn't wait to be older because then they could have a real house, with a yard, actual bedrooms with closets, a basement, a dining table. Dale thought of his grandmother's house. She didn't have a basement, she had a crawl space. But there wasn't any rush, June said, because she wasn't dying.

“I'm not going anywhere,” she told him. “I promise.”

As it turned out, though, his wife would die. The children were girls, 2 and 3 when it happened. Then 3 and 4, then 4 and 5, 5 and 6. They liked hearing stories about her, this mother they could barely remember. They had no one else to ask—their mother's family was all gone, no siblings, the parents both dead.

What harm could it do, Dale wondered, if he told stories about June instead?

One day the older girl got confused. They were in the car, both girls in the back seat, on the way to a park where you could feed goats for a dollar. “Wait,” the older one said. “Mom had a brother?” Dale had mentioned Peter without thinking.

“No,” he told her. “Not a real brother. That was just a game.”

“Oh,” the daughter said.

All he had to do was change a few details. They'd been way out in the woods one day, climbing trees, as he'd told the girls, and they found him, this boy they pretended was her brother. “This is only the beginning,” June had told him. He could remember lying there, staring up at the roof he'd built. He could smell the pine needles, feel the wind on his legs. “We have the whole rest of our lives,” she had said. He remembers closing his eyes. He tried so hard to see it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trader Notes: Crypto chart analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin sentiment on social media has dropped to its lowest point since June, signaling heightened negativity across the market.



Ted Pillows marked Bitcoin's current level as a key support. A bounce here could trigger a reversal, but a breakdown risks sharper downside.

Glassnode data revealed long-term Bitcoin holders have already realized more profits this cycle than in every previous cycle except 2016–2017, indicating elevated sell pressure. Combined with other indicators, analysts suggest the market may be moving into its late-cycle phase.



Crypto trader Rager added context, noting Bitcoin's setup looks nearly identical to the September–January 4-month uptrend that ended with a swing failure pattern (SFP) and new highs before correcting and then launching another major rally in April 2025.

While the depth of the coming correction remains uncertain, it was around 30% last time, he expects September and October could see a pullback, setting up a potential massive rally into Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

Ether (ETH) set a new all-time high at $4,946 earlier this week, but the fuel from on-chain finance looks weaker than in prior cycles.

However, the total value locked (TVL) across the network's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem stalled at $91 billion, significantly below the $108 billion record set in November 2021, according to DefiLlama data.

In ETH terms, the gap is sharper: just under 21 million ETH are locked on Tuesday, compared to 29.2 million ETH in July 2021. Even earlier this year, the figure topped 26 million ETH. That means fewer tokens are actively tied up in DeFi than at any point since the protocol hit its price highs.

Charts show the disconnect. DEX volumes and perps flows remain active, but they have not returned to past peaks even with prices breaking fresh records.

Part of the shift is structural as layer 2s draw inflows. Coinbase-backed Base's DeFi TVL  is standing tall at $4.7 billion, alongside the growth of Arbitrum and Optimism. Capital efficiency has also changed the equation, with staking protocols like Lido concentrate liquidity without requiring the same bulk deposits that once inflated raw TVL.

“Despite ETH reaching record new highs, its TVL remains below past records due to a combination of more efficient protocols and infrastructure, as well as increased competition from other chains amid a lull in retail participation,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message.

“To reclaim those TVL peaks, we'd need a resurgence in retail DeFi engagement, broader adoption of Ethereum-native yield opportunities, and a slowdown in capital migration to competing chains or off-chain investments. Ethereum's scaling solutions also need to balance efficiency with incentivizing robust on-chain liquidity to drive TVL growth,” Ruck added.

Back in 2020 and 2021, TVL was the market's favorite growth metric. “DeFi Summer” turned yield farming into a speculative loop, with tokens flooding into Maker, Aave, Compound, and Curve in search of double- and triple-digit returns.

The rapid climb in TVL became a shorthand for Ethereum's dominance and eventually a signal of price momentum. But that dynamic looks weaker this cycle. Volumes on DEXs and perpetuals remain steady, but they haven't returned to levels that once defined Ethereum's breakout.

Part of the shift is structural. The rise of liquid staking protocols like Lido has made capital more efficient, concentrating liquidity without requiring the bulk deposits that once inflated TVL.

The divergence also reflects how this cycle is being driven. ETF inflows, institutional allocations, and macro positioning have been the dominant catalysts for ETH's record price, with net assets on such products jumping from $8 billion in January to over $28 billion as of this week.

Retail DeFi activity, the fuel of prior booms, has yet to follow. That leaves ETH looking less like the center of grassroots crypto speculation and more like a macro asset.

For ETH bulls, the hope is that record prices eventually reignite on-chain experimentation and pull capital back into DeFi.

Until then, the gap between token value and protocol usage serves as a reminder that this cycle is unfolding differently. If on-chain engagement doesn't return, ETH's record prices could end up leaning on thinner foundations than bulls would like to admit.

Trump fires Fed Governor Cook over alleged mortgage fraud

Is the U.S. economy currently 'too hot'?

The cryptocurrency market, which was stable over the weekend, faced a quick sell-off after political issues arose with President Donald Trump's move to fire Fed member Lisa Cook on Monday.

At the end of last week, statements from Fed chair Powell at the Jackson Hole meeting were seen as a clear sign of an interest rate cut in September, which was positively received by risky markets. However, events in the last 24 hours have led to increased selling, erasing the gains made from Powell's comments.

Bitcoin is trying to stabilize around $110,000 after dropping to $108,000. Ethereum, meanwhile, is looking to maintain its short-term upward trend after nearly reaching $5,000 on Friday.

BNB, a major altcoin, also hit a record high, reaching $900 by the end of the week. However, profit-taking and concerns about the Fed's independence led to a downward adjustment, bringing BNB back to its upward trend line.

Solana has been trying to break into the $200 range since July. Recently, it made a strong attempt to stay above $200 and was performing well over the weekend. However, the latest negative events, including the Trump-Fed tensions, also impacted Solana negatively. As a result, despite growing interest from institutions, SOL's price dropped sharply to around $185.



Over the weekend, Ethereum reached a new high of $4,955 but couldn't maintain that level or achieve a daily closing record. Recent price movements indicate ongoing selling pressure in the $4,670-$5,000 range, marking it as a strong resistance area.

Yesterday, the rapid selling slowed down at the 21-day EMA ($4,320), which has been a reliable support level since early August. This alignment with Ethereum's short-term trend suggests that it has been following an upward trajectory due to increasing bullish momentum since last month.

Globally, many believe that the Fed will soon start cutting interest rates, particularly after Powell's comments. This positive outlook has prompted signals that Ethereum's upward trend might continue. However, a surprise event yesterday caused market instability, causing the Stochastic RSI, which was rising, to shift back into the selling zone.

If Ethereum (ETH) can maintain daily closes above the $4,320 support level, it could continue its uptrend. This stability might encourage more buying activity, potentially allowing ETH to test the resistance levels again. Initially, the $4,670 level will serve as the first resistance point. If ETH can surpass this, the next target would be the $5,000 level. Should a breakout occur beyond these points, ETH could potentially move toward the $5,500 range in the short term.

On the downside, if selling pressure persists and ETH falls below $4,320, it could first drop to around $3,980. Falling further could result in a retreat to the main uptrend, meaning a potential decline to approximately the $3,600 range.



After reaching a record high in August and hitting $900, BNB experienced a pullback. During the recent sell-off, it found some stability at an intermediate support level between $835 and $840, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.414 level. However, the recent peak at the Fibonacci 1.618 level suggests that the bullish phase might be ending. To confirm this, short-term support levels will be monitored closely.

The first key support to watch is around $835, where the parabolic uptrend intersects with the 21-day EMA. If BNB closes below this level, the correction might become more noticeable. Additional support levels to watch out for are at $810 and $750 according to Fibonacci levels.

Conversely, if BNB experiences a strong buying wave this week and rises above $840 with significant volume, it could attempt another move towards the $900 level.



SOL has been trying to break the Fibonacci 0.618 level at $200 since last month, maintaining its uptrend that began in April. This level was tested again over the weekend but couldn't be surpassed due to market negativity about the Fed.

Currently, SOL's closest support level is around $185. If SOL stays above this level, and if the market can overcome the negative sentiment, it might make another attempt to reach $200. However, the market is currently more sensitive to negative news.

So, if global market conditions worsen further, SOL's price could drop to its second support level at $165, continuing the downward trend. On the other hand, if SOL remains above its rising trend line during this week's market fluctuations, its chances of establishing a base around the $200 mark will improve.

The US Department of Commerce plans to publish official economic statistics, including GDP data, on the blockchain, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday during a White House cabinet meeting.

“The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain because you are the crypto president,” said Lutnick in a wide-ranging address that touched on tariffs, semiconductors, patents, and trade deals.

The plan focuses on releasing GDP figures on-chain to enable people to “use the blockchain for data distribution,” Lutnick said. The department aims to expand its capability across other government agencies.

“We're going to make that available to the entire government so all of you can do it,” Lutnick said. He noted that officials are “just ironing out all the details” to implement the program.

The move would mark one of the first major implementations of blockchain technology for US government economic reporting.

Elon Musk, ex-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously explored the implementation of blockchain technology at the government entity to improve transparency, automate tracking of federal spending, secure sensitive data, and streamline payment processes.

However, the initiative remained in exploratory phases without full-scale implementation before Musk departed from DOGE.

Recent chatter on X about Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has been ignited by the company's announcement of a strategic partnership with Crypto.com, including a $105 million purchase of CRO tokens and a $1 billion digital asset treasury venture.

Hut 8 (HUT), a public bitcoin BTC$109,877.47 mining and energy infrastructure firm, surged Tuesday after revealing plans to more than double the company's power capacity.

The plans include the development of four new sites across the United States with more than 1.5 gigawatts (GW), expanding total power capacity to over $2.5 GW across 19 locations, according to a press release.

The stock rose more than 10%, hitting a seven-month high just shy of $26 per share even as bitcoin prices remain stuck in the doldrums below $110,000.

Data center firms are enjoying renewed investor interest as demand for computing power soars to fuel artificial intelligence innovation. Recently, tech giant Google took a minority stake in bitcoin miner TeraWulf as part of a $3.2 billion AI infrastructure deal.

""This expansion marks a defining step in Hut 8's evolution into one of the largest energy and digital infrastructure platforms in the world,"" Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said in the press release.

The company said it has reclassified the projects from ""exclusivity"" to ""development,"" meaning it has secured land and power deals and is working on design and commercialization.

To finance the projects, the firm plans to draw in up to $$2.4 billion in liquidity from various sources. That includes borrowing against its 10,000 BTC stash worth roughly $1.1 billion, a $200 million revolving credit line, an expanded $130 million facility from Coinbase and a recently launched $1 billion at-the-market equity offering.

Investment bank Roth Capital viewed the expansion plans as a ""notable step-up,"" with potential to ""materially re-rate the stock"" as the sites come online and get contracted for AI and high-performance computing.

Ether (ETH) set a new all-time high at $4,946 earlier this week, but the fuel from on-chain finance looks weaker than in prior cycles.

However, the total value locked (TVL) across the network's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem stalled at $91 billion, significantly below the $108 billion record set in November 2021, according to DefiLlama data.

In ETH terms, the gap is sharper: just under 21 million ETH are locked on Tuesday, compared to 29.2 million ETH in July 2021. Even earlier this year, the figure topped 26 million ETH. That means fewer tokens are actively tied up in DeFi than at any point since the protocol hit its price highs.

Charts show the disconnect. DEX volumes and perps flows remain active, but they have not returned to past peaks even with prices breaking fresh records.

Part of the shift is structural as layer 2s draw inflows. Coinbase-backed Base's DeFi TVL  is standing tall at $4.7 billion, alongside the growth of Arbitrum and Optimism. Capital efficiency has also changed the equation, with staking protocols like Lido concentrate liquidity without requiring the same bulk deposits that once inflated raw TVL.

“Despite ETH reaching record new highs, its TVL remains below past records due to a combination of more efficient protocols and infrastructure, as well as increased competition from other chains amid a lull in retail participation,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a Telegram message.

“To reclaim those TVL peaks, we'd need a resurgence in retail DeFi engagement, broader adoption of Ethereum-native yield opportunities, and a slowdown in capital migration to competing chains or off-chain investments. Ethereum's scaling solutions also need to balance efficiency with incentivizing robust on-chain liquidity to drive TVL growth,” Ruck added.

Back in 2020 and 2021, TVL was the market's favorite growth metric. “DeFi Summer” turned yield farming into a speculative loop, with tokens flooding into Maker, Aave, Compound, and Curve in search of double- and triple-digit returns.

The rapid climb in TVL became a shorthand for Ethereum's dominance and eventually a signal of price momentum. But that dynamic looks weaker this cycle. Volumes on DEXs and perpetuals remain steady, but they haven't returned to levels that once defined Ethereum's breakout.

Part of the shift is structural. The rise of liquid staking protocols like Lido has made capital more efficient, concentrating liquidity without requiring the bulk deposits that once inflated TVL.

The divergence also reflects how this cycle is being driven. ETF inflows, institutional allocations, and macro positioning have been the dominant catalysts for ETH's record price, with net assets on such products jumping from $8 billion in January to over $28 billion as of this week.

Retail DeFi activity, the fuel of prior booms, has yet to follow. That leaves ETH looking less like the center of grassroots crypto speculation and more like a macro asset.

For ETH bulls, the hope is that record prices eventually reignite on-chain experimentation and pull capital back into DeFi.

Until then, the gap between token value and protocol usage serves as a reminder that this cycle is unfolding differently. If on-chain engagement doesn't return, ETH's record prices could end up leaning on thinner foundations than bulls would like to admit.

 Ethereum price forecasts range from $7,500 by year-end and up to $20,000 in the most bullish scenarios. 

Key takeaways:

Dormant whale buys $28M in ETH as price drops 13%, signaling accumulation.

Whales, BitMine, and ETFs add billions in ETH, reinforcing bullish demand.

“V-shaped” recovery pattern emerges, with analysts eyeing $7.5K–$20K targets.

An Ethereum whale wallet has resurfaced after four years of silence, scooping up $28 million worth of Ether (ETH) in a move that has stirred bullish chatter across the market.

On Tuesday, the entity withdrew 6,334 ETH (worth around $28.08 million) from Kraken in the past hour, according to onchain data cited by analyst CryptoGoos. The same address last interacted with the exchange in 2021. 

Ether has dropped more than 13% since Sunday, slipping from above $5,000 to around $4,315, a decline the whale appears to have treated as a buying opportunity. 

The transfer is noteworthy because whale outflows from exchanges are typically seen as a bullish signal, suggesting accumulation and long-term holding, rather than imminent sell pressure.

Other whale wallets have made even larger ETH purchases. 

On Tuesday, crypto exchange Bitstamp sent 20,000 ETH to an unknown wallet, according to Whale Alert data. That indicates an exchange-to-self-custody flow typically associated with accumulation.

Moreover, according to data resource Arkham Intelligence, a single whale bought and staked around $2.55 billion in ETH via Hyperliquid on Monday. 

These moves coincide with BitMine's continued push into Ethereum. Over the past week, the firm added $252 million in Ether, which has pushed its total holdings to 797,704 ETH (valued at roughly $3.7 billion).

BitMine has an additional $200 million in reserves for further Ethereum purchases.

Spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted more than $1 billion in inflows since Aug. 21, according to Farside Investors data, thus almost erasing $925.70 million in outflows witnessed four days prior.

The steady capital adds to whale and corporate buying, reinforcing the view that ETH's dip is being treated as an entry point rather than a breakdown.

Ether's ongoing rebound from summer lows near $3,350 to above $4,000 resistance is forming a “V-shaped” recovery, echoing past cycle bottoms that preceded major bull runs, according to analyst GalaxyBTC.

In late 2020, ETH carved out a similar “V,” rising to more than $4,000 a year after plunging to roughly $100 during the March pandemic crash. A smaller version of this scenario unfolded in late 2022 when ETH recovered above $2,000 in early 2023 from under $1,200.

Ethereum's technical setups suggest ETH's price could climb toward $10,000-20,000 in the coming months. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, anticipates it to hit $7,500 by the year's end.

 Bitcoin is repeating earlier BTC price behavior, analysis suggests, as a Coinbase Premium comeback joins positive ETF flows for a crypto market rebound. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is “getting closer” to its next local bottom after a trip below the $109,000 mark.

A positive Coinbase Premium returns, raising hopes of a US demand recovery.

ETF flows end Monday positive in a surprise comeback despite the BTC price downside.

Bitcoin (BTC) consolidated around $110,000 at Tuesday's Wall Street open amid signs of a crypto market recovery.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price volatility cooling after a fresh round of losses.

These had resulted in a wave of crypto long liquidations worth over $700 million for the 24 hours to the time of writing, per data from CoinGlass.

BTC/USD bottomed at $108,717 on Bitstamp, below old all-time highs seen at the start of the year. 

Amid fears of a $100,000 support retest or worse, some market participants saw reason for optimism.

“BTC is now getting closer to the bottom,” popular trader BitBull wrote in part of his latest X analysis. 

BitBull referenced encouraging signals from the US, where the Coinbase Premium Index reentered positive territory on Tuesday.

The Index measures the difference in BTC prices between the Coinbase BTC/USD and Binance BTC/USDT pairs, and when green, it implies strengthening US market demand.

“Coinbase Bitcoin Premium turned positive during bottom and long liquidations were huge. This shows that max. pain is here and a short rally is expected,” BitBull concluded.

Others also expected a rebound, with fellow trader Mister Crypto seeing a short squeeze next thanks to a significant build-up of short positioning above $115,000 on exchange order books.

Elsewhere, Cas Abbe, a contributor at onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant, suggested that current price action is, in fact, familiar.

Bitcoin, he noted, had behaved similarly during a retracement in June, when BTC/USD reached all-time highs of $112,000 before dropping to around $98,000.

“BTC chart resemblance to Q2 2025 fractal is uncanny. Similar lower-lows and a capitulation which forced everything to think ‘it's over,'” he commented on the day.

An accompanying chart underscored the similarities.

In common with previous price drawdowns, institutional flows added to souring sentiment, with analytics resource Ecoinometrics drawing attention to the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

“The macro uncertainty of the past few weeks is showing up directly in the flows,” it concluded, adding that ETF outflows were “pulling Bitcoin lower.”

On Monday, the ETFs nonetheless achieved positive flows of just under $220 million, per data from UK-based investment firm Farside Investors.

Repeated Heat Waves Can Age You as Much as Smoking or Drinking

A new long-term study suggests that the more heat waves people are exposed to, the more their body's aging process accelerates

Long-term exposure to extreme heat events accelerates the body's ageing process and increases vulnerabilities to heath issues, finds a long-term study of 24,922 people in Taiwan.

The study, published today in Nature Climate Change, suggests that moderate increases in cumulative heatwave exposure increase a person's biological age — to an extent comparable to regular smoking or alcohol consumption. The more extreme-heat events that people were exposed to, the more their organs aged. This is the latest study to show that extreme heat can have invisible effects on the human body and accelerate the biological clock.

Exposure to extreme heat, especially over long periods of time, strains organs and can be lethal, but “the fact that heatwaves age us is surprising”, says Paul Beggs, an environmental-health scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “This study is a wake-up call that we are all vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on our health. It reinforces calls for urgent and deep reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions,” he adds.

Age isn't just a result of time. Previous studies have linked a number of factors — including environmental and social stress, genetics and medical interventions — to signs of ageing-related physiological changes. This puts people at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia.

To study the long-term impacts of heatwaves on ageing, the researchers analysed data from medical examinations between 2008 and 2022. During that time, Taiwan experienced around 30 heatwaves, which the study defined as a period of elevated temperature over several days. The researchers used results from several medical tests, including assessments of liver, lung and kidney function, blood pressure and inflammation, to calculate biological age. They then compared biological age with the total cumulative temperature that participants were probably exposed to on the basis of their address in the two years before their medical visit.

The study found that the more extreme-heat events that people experienced, the faster they aged — for every extra 1.3 °C a participant was exposed to, around 0.023–0.031 years, on average, was added to their biological clock.

“While the number itself may look small, over time and across populations, this effect can have meaningful public-health implications,” says Cui Guo, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who led the study.

Manual workers and people living in rural areas experienced the largest health impacts, probably because these groups are less likely to have access to air conditioning. But there was an unexpected upside: the impact of heatwaves on ageing decreased over the 15-year study period. The reasons behind this heat adaptation are unclear, but improved access to cooling technology could play a part, Guo says.

Still, “the message is that heat makes you age a bit faster than you normally would, and that this is something you would like to avoid”, says Alexandra Schneider, an environmental epidemiologist at Helmholtz Munich in Germany, who was not involved in the study.

In 2023, research in Germany found that higher air temperatures were associated with more epigenetic markers of ageing. And a study in more than 3,600 older people in the United States similarly concluded, through analysing DNA markers, that extreme heat prematurely aged participants.

The most recent study focused on the impact of long-term heat exposure, which is more likely to have lifelong health effects. This is important because climate change is leading to more extreme-heat events. In the United States, there are now six heatwaves each year, as of 2010 — up from two in the 1960s. Scientists estimate that climate change has made heatwaves such as the deadly 2022 ones in Pakistan and India, during which temperatures hit 50 °C, 30 times more likely to occur.

The growing frequency of heatwaves, combined with their effects on health, highlights the importance of protecting vulnerable groups, says Guo. “Heatwave is not a personal risk factor, but a global concern.”

The zone from the center of your eyebrows to the corners of your mouth is best left alone.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

You're a sophomore in high school again, begrudgingly getting out of bed after snoozing your alarm one too many times. As you look into the mirror while getting ready for school, a painful, red bump stares back at you. Every teen's worst nightmare: a pimple. You may be tempted to squeeze and prod at the lump until it pops, but a recent account suggests you should hesitate before your next skin-picking session. One woman, Lish Marie, tried to pop a pimple beneath her nose and ended up in the hospital with facial paralysis—and experts say the infection could have been deadly.

While pimples primarily occur during puberty, they can appear at any time on anyone. Puberty in particular causes hormone changes that can lead to sebaceous glands becoming overactive. Typically, healthy sebaceous glands produce oil to keep your skin from drying out, but when the glands are overactive, they can get clogged, leaving your back, face, chest, and shoulders riddled with those painful red spots. 

Not all pimples are dangerous to pop, however. Lish was unlucky and popped a pimple in a zone that dermatologists call the “triangle of death” or the “danger triangle.” The term refers to the area from between your eyebrows to the corners of your mouth, and dermatologists recommend avoiding picking at the area all together because it's practically an infection highway to your brain, thanks to your cavernous sinus (a bundle of nerves just behind your eyes). Its main job is to drain blood from the brain, so if an infection is introduced to the area (like it was in Lish's case), there's not much in its way before it reaches your body's control center.  

“There is the possibility for a facial infection to become an infection that impacts the rest of your body,” dermatologist Alok Vij said in an interview with Cleveland Clinic. “The infection may start to get bigger, spreading to cover more of an area, and you may start to feel more systemically ill—a fever, shaking, chills. If this starts to happen, see a doctor as soon as you can for diagnosis and treatment.”

Luckily, Lish unknowingly followed Vij's advice and sought medical help pretty much right away. She was treated with multiple antibiotics to fight the infection, and now claims that while the crooked smile and inflammation caused by the infection remained for a few days after treatment, she ultimately received a clean bill of health. Unfortunately, others haven't been so lucky. In one extreme instance, a woman contracted a staph infection from picking at a blemish. Severe cases of Staphylococcus bacterial infections (staph infections) can lead to inflammation of the heart, toxic shock syndrome, and even sepsis. 

Now, before you spiral over how many times you may have unintentionally put yourself at risk in the name of a satisfying pimple pop, know that cases like Lish's don't happen every day—otherwise, millions of teenagers would be at risk each year. 

“Thankfully, it's relatively unlikely,” Vij explained, “but whenever there's a violation of the skin and interaction with bacteria, there's always a possibility for infection, which can lead to greater health concerns.” 

So, next time you go to pop a pimple, wash your hands and maybe avoid the triangle of death.

If true, it could explain where dark matter comes from, and a possible twist in our understanding of neutrinos.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Scientists believe there could be an “anti-universe” somewhere out there that looks like the mirror image of our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do. If this theory holds true, it could explain the presence of dark matter.

First, some background: the “Big Bang” is a collective term that includes a variety of theories studied by cosmologists, the scientists who try to rewind the clock as close to the very beginning of the universe as possible. Most agree that matter exploded forth, but there are different opinions on, for example, whether the temperature was extremely hot or absolute-zero cold at that initial moment.

There are also disagreements about what may have happened prior to the bang itself. Could it be that what we call the Big Bang was the inflection point of an even bigger bounce in progress? Think of the point when you bounce on the trampoline and your feet almost touch the ground beneath—then imagine only seeing the subsequent bounce upward; it's meaningless without the first, downward half of the bounce!

Dark matter is, if such a thing exists, maybe even more perplexing to scientists than the Big Bang. That's because dark matter is a key piece that helps to complete an unclear puzzle— the question of what forms the universe around us today, not billions of years ago. Dark matter forms the bulk of the matter in the universe, but we've never been able to see it anywhere.  

How is dark matter hidden in plain sight, and what are its qualities? These are huge mysteries upon which a ton of other ideas must rest. For the time being, one way to describe dark matter is very literal: by “dark,” we mean that it is not luminous, which is the technical term for matter that doesn't reflect or emit any photons in a way we can identify. But we can measure the physical (not visual) effects of dark matter in things like gravitational waves.

Now we arrive back at the theory. Could it be that an “anti-universe” might run parallel to our own universe, but backward in time? If so, it would essentially spread out “backward” in time, prior to the Big Bang, in the same way our universe progressed “forward” in time. In a paper published in 2018 in the journal Annals of Physics, researchers from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, suggest that the Big Bang might have been smaller and more symmetrical than we think.

“Among other things, we shall describe in detail a remarkable consequence of this hypothesis, namely a highly economical new explanation for the cosmological dark matter,” the researchers write.

One cool thing about this model of the Big Bang is that it removes the need for what scientists call “inflation,” a period of time in which the universe massively expanded in order to account for its size soon after birth. Instead, the matter could have naturally expanded over time in a less forceful way, which could simplify our explanation for what happened.

And in order for these two before-and-after universes to be truly symmetrical, we would need to add a particle to our existing understanding of the universe around us. Today, we know about neutrinos, extra-tiny mysterious particles involved in gravity and weak interaction only. If our universe is mirrored by a similar universe running backward in time from the Big Bang, then what we call dark matter could actually be a version of a neutrino that is “right-handed,” a term that refers to the direction of motion in the neutrino. It would be the natural opposite of the left-handed neutrinos in the other universe.

If this sounds like wild and heady stuff, you're absolutely right. But iteration using this kind of new theory is a critical part of cosmology, because scientists must have existing, published theories in order to study them and decide what their next theoretical step is. It's so much easier to do that by responding publicly using your own observations and measurements, and that leaves a beautiful trail of ideas over time as we refine our understanding and develop more sophisticated ways to observe the universe.

The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) has successfully completed filling its 20,000-tons liquid scintillator detector and begun data taking on Aug. 26. After more than a decade of preparation and construction, JUNO is the first of a new generation of very large neutrino experiments to reach this stage. Initial trial operation and data taking show that key performance indicators met or exceeded design expectations, enabling JUNO to tackle one of this decade's major open questions in particle physics: the ordering of neutrino masses -- whether the third mass state (ν₃) is heavier than the second (ν2).

Prof. Yifang Wang, a researcher at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and JUNO spokesperson, said: ""Completing the filling of the JUNO detector and starting data taking marks a historic milestone. For the first time, we have in operation a detector of this scale and precision dedicated to neutrinos. JUNO will allow us to answer fundamental questions about the nature of matter and the universe.""

Located 700 meters underground near Jiangmen city in the Guangdong Province, JUNO detects antineutrinos produced 53 kilometers away by the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants and measures their energy spectrum with record precision. Unlike other approaches, JUNO's determination of the mass ordering is independent of matter effects in the Earth and largely free of parameter degeneracies. JUNO will also deliver order-of-magnitude improvements in the precision of several neutrino-oscillation parameters and enable cutting-edge studies of neutrinos from the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and the Earth. It will also open new windows to explore unknown physics, including searches for sterile neutrinos and proton decay.

Proposed in 2008 and approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Guangdong Province in 2013, JUNO began underground construction in 2015. Detector installation started in December 2021 and was completed in December 2024, followed by a phased filling campaign. Within 45 days, the team filled 60,000 tons of ultra-pure water, keeping the liquid-level difference between the inner and outer acrylic spheres within centimeters and maintaining a flow-rate uncertainty below 0.5%, safeguarding structural integrity. Over the next six months, 20,000 tons of liquid scintillator were filled into the 35.4-meter-diameter acrylic sphere while displacing the water. Throughout, stringent requirements on ultra-high purity, optical transparency, and extremely low radioactivity were achieved. In parallel, the collaboration conducted detector debugging, commissioning, and optimization, enabling a seamless transition to full operations at the completion of filling.

At the heart of JUNO is a central liquid-scintillator detector with an unprecedentedly large effective mass of 20,000 tons, housed at the center of a 44-meter-deep water pool. A 41.1-meter-diameter stainless steel truss supports the 35.4-meter acrylic sphere, the scintillator, 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 25,600 3-inch PMTs, front-end electronics, cabling, anti-magnetic compensation coils, and optical panels. All PMTs operate simultaneously to capture scintillation light from neutrino interactions and convert it to electrical signals.

Prof. MA Xiaoyan, JUNO Chief Engineer, remarked: ""Building JUNO has been a journey of extraordinary challenges. It demanded not only new ideas and technologies, but also years of careful planning, testing, and perseverance. Meeting the stringent requirements of purity, stability, and safety called for the dedication of hundreds of engineers and technicians. Their teamwork and integrity turned a bold design into a functioning detector, ready now to open a new window on the neutrino world.""

JUNO is hosted by the IHEP and involves more than 700 researchers from 74 institutions across 17 countries and regions. ""The landmark achievement that we announce today is also a result of the fruitful international cooperation ensured by many research groups outside China, bringing to JUNO their expertise from previous liquid scintillator set-ups. The worldwide liquid scintillator community has pushed the technology to its ultimate frontier, opening the path towards the ambitious physics goals of the experiment,"" commented Prof. Gioacchino Ranucci, Deputy spokesperson of JUNO and a Professor at the University of Milano and INFN-Milano.

JUNO is designed for a scientific lifetime of up to 30 years, with a credible upgrade path toward a world-leading search for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Such an upgrade would probe the absolute neutrino mass scale and test whether neutrinos are Majorana particles, addressing fundamental questions spanning particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, and profoundly shaping our understanding of the universe.

Saxitoxin (STX, 1), a potent neurotoxin from shellfish, first isolated in 19571, offers immense pharmaceutical potential due to its interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels2, that are ubiquitously present in all excitable cells of the central and periphperal nervous system3. Hundreds of synthetic studies towards this end have been disclosed thus far, yet, a fully modular and scalable approach to the family remains elusive4-12. Thus, here we show how a tactical combination of radical retrosynthesis, biocatalysis, and C–H functionalization logic can be combined to solve this problem resulting in a scalable approach to the STX family in less than 10 steps including the first total synthesis of neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 4), a hydroxylated naturally occurring STX analog previously under clinical investigation13. The modular nature of the synthesis enables access to diverse analogs, that were previously inaccessible, and now have been evaluated through electrophysiological assays for biological activity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Researchers Are Already Leaving Meta's New Superintelligence Lab","https://www.wired.com/story/researchers-leave-meta-superintelligence-labs-openai/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:00:37 GMT","

At least three artificial intelligence researchers have resigned from Meta's new superintelligence lab, just two months after CEO Mark Zuckerberg first announced the initiative. Two of the staffers have returned to OpenAI, where they both previously worked, after less than one-month stints at Meta, WIRED has confirmed.

Avi Verma was previously a researcher at OpenAI. Ethan Knight worked at the ChatGPT maker earlier in his career but joined Meta from Elon Musk's xAI. A third researcher, Rishabh Agarwal, announced publicly on Monday he was leaving Meta's lab as well. He joined the tech giant in April to work on generative AI projects before switching to a role at Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), according to his LinkedIn profile. While the reasons for Agarwal's departure are not known, he is based in Canada and Meta's AI teams are predominantly based in Menlo Park, California.

“It was a tough decision not to continue with the new Superintelligence TBD lab, especially given the talent and compute density,” Agarwal wrote on X, referring to the team at MSL that is specifically pursuing frontier AI research. “But after 7.5 years across Google Brain, DeepMind, and Meta, I felt the pull to take on a different kind of risk.” It's unclear where he may be going next. Agarwal did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

""During an intense recruiting process, some people will decide to stay in their current job rather than starting a new one,” said Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold. “That's normal,”

Meta is also losing another leader who has worked at the tech giant for nearly a decade. Chaya Nayak, the director of generative AI product management at Meta, is joining OpenAI to work on special initiatives, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the hire.

Verma and Knight did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Nayak declined to comment in time for publication.

The departures are the strongest public signal yet that Meta Superintelligence Labs could be off to a rocky start. Zuckerberg lured people to join the lab with nine-figure pay packages associated more often with professional sports stars than tech workers, hoping the influx of talent would allow the social networking giant to rapidly catch up with its competitors in the race toward so-called artificial general intelligence.

But Meta executives have reportedly struggled to combat bureaucratic and recruitment issues related to its AI initiatives. Meta has repeatedly reorganized its AI teams in recent months, most recently splitting employees into four groups, per The Wall Street Journal.

In July, Zuckerberg announced that another former OpenAI researcher, Shengjia Zhao, who played a key role in the creation of ChatGPT, would become the chief scientist of MSL. The announcement came after Zhao tried to return to OpenAI—even going so far as to sign employment paperwork—according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the events.

“Shengjia cofounded MSL and has been our scientific lead since day one,” Arnold said in a statement to WIRED. “We formalized his role once our recruiting had ramped and the team had taken shape.”

As it tried to recruit talent to the company, Meta also began inking deals with other AI startups to accelerate its research and development efforts. Meta's new chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was recruited from Scale AI, said on Friday that the company had signed a deal with Midjourney, which specializes in AI-generated images and video.

The deal will involve technical collaboration between the two companies' research teams, Wang said. The arrangement suggests that producing AI videos may be a priority for Meta as it looks to monetize its AI products on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

When Meta's poaching spree began, OpenAI executives were visibly rattled by Zuckerberg's initial success. CEO Sam Altman called Meta's actions “distasteful” in a memo to staff. “I've lost track of how many people from here they've tried to get to be their Chief Scientist,” he wrote.

But earlier this month, Meta reportedly pulled back on hiring, suggesting the recruiting frenzy was beginning to cool—at least for now.

Looking to upgrade your Sonos setup? The Sonos Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is 20 percent off from Amazon, bringing it down to just $359 and tying its lowest-ever price. That's a great deal on our editors' favorite surround sound Sonos speaker, and it would make a perfect upgrade to your existing Sonos configuration or a place to start building your audio empire.

Sonos

The big draw here is spatial audio, which our team feels performs even better than Apple's Homepod (5/10, WIRED Review) when it comes to filling a room with sound. That's largely thanks to the array of drivers, including six speakers, four tweeters, and a pair of mid/bass drivers all packed into one vaguely robot-butt-shaped device.

We also appreciate that the Era 300 has physical controls, in case you need to make quick adjustments without pulling out your phone. There's a volume slider, track controls, and a button to activate either Amazon Alexa or the Sonos Voice Control. There's also Bluetooth pairing if you want to skip the Sonos app altogether and just hook your phone up directly.

The app (now finally working again after some woes last year) provides a lot of value, though, letting you connect all of your speakers together for whole home audio, and it supports distinct speaker types, like soundbars and bookshelf speakers. Sonos speakers are easy to set up and configure, have a wide support for streaming services and smart home options, and just sound great. They even found their way onto our favorite Bluetooth speakers list, despite having their own protocol for home audio.

Our reviewer was particularly impressed with the audio quality on the Era 300, saying it sounded detailed and expressive whether they were listening to music or spoken word and calling it a “poised and eloquent listen.” Make sure to check out the full review for more details on why we like this speaker over the many other Sonos options.

If you want to double up for true multichannel surround sound, you can pick up two speakers as a bundle, but you won't save any cash, just packaging. The big downside to Sonos speakers is that they tend to be expensive, but if you're looking to get started in the ecosystem and have a great television to pair it with, these are worth a serious look.

It has been a big year for repairable-laptop maker Framework. After launching the Framework Laptop 12 and the Framework Desktop this summer, the company is now rolling out a big update to the Framework Laptop 16. The machine can be configured with (or upgraded to) an Nvidia RTX 5070 laptop graphics card. You can also upgrade to the new 2025 mainboard, which includes the next-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 series chips.

Why is this a big deal? Well, Framework is a company we've grown to appreciate a lot over the past few years. The company has been pioneering a more sustainable (and fun!) approach to designing computers, making as many parts of the device as modular as possible. That has included things like the RAM and storage, naturally, but also the CPU, battery, Wi-Fi card, and much more.

The idea is to swap out components on the laptops when new modules come out (or if something breaks down), reducing the need to buy a new laptop every few years and sending fewer parts to the landfill. But upgrading discrete graphics on laptops has always been elusive. Companies like Alienware have tried modular discrete GPUs in portable PCs before, and they never lasted. But with the new RTX 5070 graphics module upgrade, Framework proves it can be done.

The original Framework Laptop 16 arrived at the beginning of 2024, launching as an AMD-exclusive system with the Ryzen 7 7840HS (or Ryzen 9) and the discrete Radeon RX 7700S for graphics. At the time of testing, GPU performance landed somewhere around a mobile RTX 4060. On paper, that makes the jump to an RTX 5070 not only a great demonstration of the Framework ethos—but also a big deal for performance. Framework says it's a 30 to 40 percent increase in GPU performance over the RX 7700S.

More power doesn't come free, so Framework is shipping a 240-watt USB-C charger that uses the USB Power Delivery 3.1 spec. That'll make it one of the only laptops with an RTX 5070 that is powered solely by USB-C. Other 240-watt power adapters often use a proprietary power port (see almost every gaming laptop).

The Framework Laptop 16 was the follow-up to the original Framework Laptop 13 and added more than just the discrete graphics module. It also had a unique approach to customization, letting you arrange the keyboard and trackpad however, using modules and spacers to customize it. The new model also comes with a better webcam and a more rigid top cover (on the lid).

The Framework Laptop 16 will be $100 more expensive than the previous model, now starting at $1,499. From there, it's an extra $300 to upgrade to the Ryzen 9 or an extra $700 to upgrade to the RTX 5070. It's the same price to purchase the RTX 5070 graphics module on its own. Framework will continue to sell the original Framework Laptop 16, now at a reduced starting price of $1,299, $100 cheaper than the original MSRP.

Uber Eats has agreed to pay $15 million to more than 16,000 delivery workers in Seattle after reaching a settlement with the city's labor standards office over allegations that the tech giant violated laws regulating how workers are paid.

A majority of the settlement was related to the city's Independent Contractor Protections (ICP) Ordinance, which passed in 2021 and aims to ensure pay transparency. The City alleged that Uber Eats misled workers by not disclosing that its “Boost” multiplier feature only applied to a portion of a fare and that the upfront payment amount already included the “Boost” promotion's contribution. 

Uber ended the “Boost” program in Seattle in August 2023, after the City contacted the company, according to the Office of Labor Standards (OLS).

Regulators also investigated Uber Eats for allegedly failing to provide minimum pay for certain canceled orders, per the city's App-Based Worker Minimum Payment (ABWMP) Ordinance, which passed in 2022. 

The City also alleged that Uber Eats failed to provide required notice of rights, electronic receipts, and weekly statements as required by the laws.

“As the largest settlement in OLS history, this sets a new benchmark and represents a significant milestone for the protection of worker rights in Seattle in the rapidly growing industry of app-based work,” Steven Marchese, director of the Office of Labor Standards, said in a statement. 

The alleged violations covered work between September 2022 and May 2025. 

Uber denied wrongdoing but agreed to the settlement. It also paid more than $33,000 in fines to the City of Seattle and will adopt a new policy that lets workers provide more information about cancellations.

“We value the work couriers do and want them to be successful,” the company said in a statement to GeekWire. “We've worked with the City of Seattle to resolve claims about information provided to couriers on offers and pay — and we're focused on improving the experience for Seattle's couriers, consumers and restaurants.”

Payment to workers is scheduled to be distributed by Labor Day next week.

“This historic $15 million settlement is a major win for workers and a strong reminder that in Seattle, we hold large companies accountable when they sidestep their responsibilities and shortchange workers,” Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement.

Seattle has been a leader in establishing worker protections for gig workers who make deliveries and drive people around town. 

Uber previously paid $3.4 million in a settlement with Seattle in 2021. The City also reached a $1.6 million settlement with DoorDash in 2023.

Regulatory costs are part of why Uber fares in Seattle are the highest in the U.S., the Seattle Times reported.

DoorDash recently increased delivery fees in Seattle in response to what it called “extreme regulations” passed by Seattle lawmakers, including a new law that gives app-based workers more transparency when they're removed from platforms.

Yes, ChatGPT can draft a tricky email. But can a general-purpose AI assistant for the masses contribute to a big scientific breakthrough, without hallucinating or screwing up the research? The Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) isn't holding its breath.

The Seattle-based institute's new project, dubbed Asta, lets research scientists create and deploy specialized AI agents, working autonomously to help them tackle and solve some of the world's toughest problems.

Ai2 bills Asta as a “bold initiative to accelerate science by building trustworthy and capable agentic assistants for researchers.” It's also an open-source project, following the nonprofit institute's ethos of making the digital plumbing of its projects available for others to analyze, adapt, and build upon.

There are three major components to Asta:

With entry-level jobs in some industries already under pressure, Ai2 is careful to call Asta a collaborator for scientists, not a replacement. But most grad students would envy the kind of praise the institute is heaping on the project.

Ai2's chief scientist, Dan Weld, said the inspiration came from the institute's own need for AI tools that can execute complex plans, explaining how they came up with their ideas, and stay grounded in scientific evidence.

“That's what Asta delivers,” Weld said in the announcement. “It's not just another assistant but a collaborator designed to think like a scientist.”

The institute sees this open approach — where developers use Asta's resources to build agents and Asta's benchmark to test them — as a way to create “a flywheel of scientific improvement” for the broader community.

The news caps what will no doubt go down as one of the busiest months in Ai2 history, including the announcement of a new AI robotics initiative and a $152 million grant from Nvidia and the National Science Foundation to lead the creation of the future AI backbone for U.S. scientific research.

In their spare time, the team has also been settling into new offices in a mass-timber building on the north end of Seattle's Lake Union. 

Founded in 2014 by Paul Allen, and funded largely by the late Microsoft co-founder's estate, Ai2 is a non-profit research institute that builds open-source AI systems for the good of science and humanity. 

Ai2's team of 225 people includes some of the top AI researchers in the world, many of them also affiliated with the University of Washington's Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Ai2 is known for OLMo (open language models), Molmo (multimodal models), Tülu (instruction-tuned language models), and other open-source AI systems.

OpenAi, Anthropic, and other Silicon Valley startups have grabbed headlines for turning their proprietary AI models into widely used consumer and commercial products, while Ai2 has worked more quietly behind-the-scenes on foundational research and fully open-source tools for scientists and developers.

Asta is an outgrowth of Semantic Scholar, Ai2's long-running project to create a massive research database that indexes more than 200 million scientific papers. Asta's agents use this database through a dedicated “Scientific Corpus Tool,” an extension of the Semantic Scholar API.

Ai2 has been burnishing its open-source credentials under CEO Ali Farhadi, an entrepreneur and University of Washington professor who returned to Ai2 in 2023 after leading machine learning at Apple — which acquired his Ai2 spinout Xnor.ai for an estimated $200 million in 2020.

Farhadi says the goal is to hold AI to standards grounded in the scientific method: He said in a statement that Asta represents Ai2's “bet on a future where AI doesn't just keep up with science, it helps drive it forward.”

Seattle-area tech veteran Matt Fisher is joining immersive media startup Adventr as a late-stage co-founder to help the company evolve how people use AI to create and interact with games, videos, music, movies and more.

With previous stints at Amazon, Microsoft, Nordstrom, Auth0 and elsewhere, Fisher was most recently co-founder and CTO at Daydream, a startup that raised a $50 million seed round last year to shake up the way people find and buy clothing online.

Fisher left Daydream in October, and set out to find what he wanted to do next in the AI space. He'd already been serving as a technical advisor to Adventr founder and CEO Devo Harris and the two decided it was time for Fisher to come onboard and help build the next evolution of the company.

“We've gone all-in on gaming and immersive experiences,” Fisher said. “What we're building takes the jump from just watching movies, videos, and games to actually stepping inside them. Suddenly, every player or viewer isn't just along for the ride, they can shape their own version of reality.”

Fisher is especially bullish about how voice will be the dominant method of building content as well as interacting with it, especially in gamified media. Creators can talk to Adventr's system and tell it what they want, prompting and editing with a suite of tools that is driven by voice. And voice will drive “play” inside that specific piece of content.

The company has already launched Adventr.tv, a streaming platform for console-less gaming.

“We're strong believers that voice tears down the old walls and flips audiences into creators, opening the door to generative, interactive worlds that feel real,” Fisher said.

Harris is a Grammy award-winning producer and co-founder of G.O.O.D Music, the independent record label founded by his cousin, Kanye West. His early work in interactive video creation included the choose-your-own-adventure music video “Attack of the 5 foot Hipster” by the band Riot In Paris.

While Harris is based in New York, Fisher said he believes deeply in the Seattle area's talent pool and he plans to hire engineers in the region.

Current Adventr offerings include a variety of assets, games and videos, from “Lab Rat,” a multiplayer interactive movie, to a workout with Megan Thee Stallion, to a Volvo video that lets you control the owners manual, to numerous games.

For Fisher, a realistic future feels like what's depicted in the sci-fi novels he's a fan of, such as “Ready Player One.”

“As we evolve into this more AI-centric community and civilization, we want to be immersed,” Fisher said.

Anthropic has settled a class action lawsuit with a group of fiction and nonfiction authors, as announced in a filing on Tuesday with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Anthropic had won a partial victory in a lower court ruling and was in the process of appealing that ruling. No details of the settlement were made public, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Called Bartz v. Anthropic, the case deals with Anthropic's use of books as training material for its large language models. The court had ruled that Anthropic's use of the books qualified as fair use, but because many of the books were pirated, Anthropic still faced significant financial penalties for its conduct connected to the case.

Nonetheless, Anthropic had applauded the earlier ruling, framing it as a victory for generative AI models. “We believe it's clear that we acquired books for one purpose only — building large language models — and the court clearly held that use was fair,” the company told NPR after the ruling in June.

The Trump administration made an unprecedented, and confusing, move last week when it announced plans to convert money Intel was supposed to receive through Joe Biden-era government grant programs into a 10% equity stake.While it remains unclear if converting those government grants into equity is even possible — that's up for debate — it's even less obvious how this move will solve Intel's biggest problem, its waffling foundry business. Even Intel is unconvinced.

Intel Foundry, which manufactures custom semiconductors for outside customers, has not been fruitful for the company. The business division lost out on potential big contracts, like one with Sony, according to Reuters, and has cost the company significantly more than it has brought in.

Intel Foundry reported an operating income loss of $3.1 billion in the second quarter. The company has also laid off thousands of people since the beginning of the year, with the foundry business unit being hit especially hard.

Differences over how Intel would turn around its struggling foundry business was partially responsible for Lip-Bu Tan's resignation from the company board in August 2024. Tan was appointed CEO in spring 2025.

Kevin Cassidy, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told TechCrunch he doesn't see how this deal will solve Intel's problems. Intel Foundry doesn't need money to solve its issues, he said, instead it needs to change its approach to its customers.

“They didn't understand customer service,” Cassidy said of Intel Foundry's struggles to sign customers. “They have always manufactured internally, the manufacturing group was king. It's hard to be a customer service-focused group when you think you know better.”

Intel did not respond to a request for comment.

Intel recently acknowledged the potential downsides of this deal in an SEC filing posted Monday. The company highlighted the risks it carries for its investors and customers — two groups of people Intel naturally relies on.

This deal dilutes existing shareholders and reduces their governance rights. The Trump administration said it would vote alongside Intel's interests, which could help the company move its ideas forward; but business decisions that actively sour an existing investor base conflicts with efforts to drum up investor interest.

“I would be disappointed if I was a stockholder,” Cassidy said. “Intel gave up another 430 million shares, and diluted my shares, and [they] were able to buy it at a 20% discount.”

Intel also mentioned the potential impact this could have on its international business. The vast majority of the company's revenue in its last fiscal year, 76%, came from outside the U.S., the company reported.

Amid the current U.S.-led international trade turmoil, companies outside the United States will now have to grapple with whether or not to work with a company partially owned by the U.S. government.

Not everyone is doom and gloom about the recent transaction. Cody Acree, managing director and senior research analyst at Benchmark Company, told TechCrunch he doesn't see the company's international customers shying away from Intel.

Acree said the deal isn't perfect, but the government's commitment to Intel's future may give the chipmaker the boost it needs — even if it's just a small step on a long road to recovery.

“Intel has shown that it's been struggling for the last decade and may need some kind of government intervention; a bail out is probably too harsh of a term, but the government intervention is being seen as at least a stepping stone toward reinvigorating Intel,” Acree said. “I don't necessarily agree with it being a fix-all by any means. It's at least encouraging to know that the government is backing Intel instead of challenging the leadership as they were a month ago.”

Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, agreed that a deal with the U.S. government could be positive. In an interview before the deal was formally announced, Rocco said that this could give Intel a bigger role in the administration's current push for domestic AI prowess through initiatives like OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle's Stargate initiative and bringing semiconductor manufacturing stateside.

“The market is going to be so big, the data center and chip market, even if they get a small slice,” Rocco said. “There is room for them to succeed. This will be a positive. You have to have a five-to-10-year time horizon.”

Still, both analysts cautioned the deal won't be Intel's savior. For a true, long-standing rescue, Intel needs to look inward. 

While the Trump administration claims it will be a passive investor, that doesn't mean its involvement can't drum up business for the company, Acree said. While that hopefully wouldn't come from pressure or force, Cassidy said, it definitely could.

Even though the government might not have to. Unlike higher education, corporate America has proven itself more than happy to lean toward the Trump administration's goals and policies. Companies have gutted their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs — despite hurting themselves in the process. A prevalence of pro-America sentiment has become saturated in advertisements and company communication since Donald Trump took office in January.

If the Trump administration tells American companies to buy Intel's chips and hardware, they might not have to do as much convincing to get companies on board.

Acree and Cassidy said the real test for Intel won't be the deal, or even the optics of it. It will be whether Intel can drum up interest for its 14A chipmaking processor. Tan has said the company would not start production on its 14A chipmaking process until they secured substantial customer interest.

“There is still no guarantee that Intel is going to be able to come back into the market at the leading edge,” Cassidy said. “Intel has been burning cash for quite a few years, I don't know if it is just more money to buy time to find the formula to get them back on the leading edge.”

A top Social Security Administration official turned whistleblower says members of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) uploaded hundreds of millions of Social Security records to a vulnerable cloud server, putting the personal information of most Americans at risk of compromise.

Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration's chief data officer, said in a newly released whistleblower complaint published Tuesday that other top agency officials signed off on a decision in June to upload “a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,” despite Borges raising concerns.

The database, known as the Numerical Identification System, contains more than 450 million records containing all of the data submitted as part of a Social Security application, including the applicant's name, place of birth, citizenship, and the Social Security numbers of their family members, as well as other sensitive personal and financial information.

Borges said members of DOGE, the team of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server “apparently lacking in independent security controls,” such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. 

The lack of security protections violated internal agency security controls and federal privacy laws, the complaint alleges. 

Borges said by allowing DOGE to be administrators of the agency's cloud, the DOGE operatives would be able to create “publicly accessible services,” meaning that they could allow public access to the cloud system and any of the sensitive data stored inside.

Borges warned in the complaint that if this information were compromised, “it is possible that the sensitive [personally identifiable information] on every American including health diagnoses, income levels and banking information, family relationships, and personal biographic data could be exposed publicly, and shared widely.” 

The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have “catastrophic impact” on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone's Social Security numbers.

While a federal restraining order in March initially blocked DOGE staffers from accessing the country's database of Social Security records, the Supreme Court lifted the order on June 6, paving the way for DOGE's access. 

In the days that followed, DOGE allegedly worked to seek internal approvals from the agency's top brass, per Borges' complaint.

The agency's chief information officer Aram Moghaddassi approved the move to copy the database to the agency's cloud, saying he “determined the business need is higher than the security risk” and that he accepts “all risks” with the project. The complaint also says Michael Russo, a senior DOGE operative who previously served as the agency's chief information officer prior to Moghaddassi but remains at the agency, also approved moving live Social Security data to the cloud.

Borges said he first raised issues internally at the agency but later blew the whistle to urge members of Congress to “engage in immediate oversight to address these serious concerns,” according to a statement by his attorney, Andrea Meza, at the Government Accountability Project.

This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives, including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. Since January, members of DOGE have taken sweeping control of most U.S. federal departments and their datasets of citizens' data.

When reached by TechCrunch, Elizabeth Huston, a spokesperson for the White House, would not say if the administration was aware of the complaint and deferred comment to the Social Security Administration. 

In an emailed response, Social Security Administration spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency “stores personal data in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.”

“The data referenced in the complaint is stored in a long-standing environment used by SSA and walled off from the internet. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA's Information Security team,” the spokesperson added. 

The spokesperson said the agency was “not aware of any compromise to this environment.”

Data breaches involving federal government data stored in the cloud are rare but not unheard of. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that the U.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emails online due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure's separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfiguration allowed the contents of a military unit's emails to publicly spill online.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated where the DOD's exposed email was hosted. The story now accurately reflects that the exposed data was hosted on Microsoft's Azure.

Meta plans to launch a super PAC to support California candidates favoring a light-touch approach to AI regulation, Politico reports. The news comes as other Silicon Valley behemoths, like Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI's Greg Brockman, pledge $100 million for a new pro-AI super PAC. 

Meta will pour tens of millions into its new group, dubbed Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across California, according to Politico. Brian Rice, Meta's VP of public policy and head of the new PAC, has argued that Sacramento's regulatory environment “could stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California's technology leadership at risk.”

Meta's lobbying force earlier this year targeted state senator Scott Wiener's SB-53 bill that would require AI firms to publish safety and security protocols and issue reports when safety incidents occur. Last year, it helped kill the Kids Online Safety Act that was widely expected to pass. 

The social media giant has already donated to various down-ballet candidates from both parties. This new PAC signals an intent to influence statewide elections, including the next governor's race in 2026.

The U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel last week, through a deal that will convert funding from the CHIPS Act into partial ownership of the tech company. But President Donald Trump has much larger plans for his government's takeover of private industry. At least that's what Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested Tuesday during an interview on CNBC.

CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Lutnick about whether he thought it was “fair for America” that government was now taking control of Intel. Sorkin brought up other companies that benefit from U.S. government dollars, asking if they were next.

“Why shouldn't the U.S. government say, you know what, we use Palantir services, we would like a piece of Palantir. We use Boeing services, we would like a piece of Boeing. There are a lot of businesses that do business with the U.S. government—that benefit by doing business with the U.S. government. I guess the question is, where's the line?” Sorkin asked Lutnick.

But Lutnick thought that all sounded great. “Oh, there's a monstrous discussion about defense. I mean, Lockheed Martin makes 97% of their revenue from the U.S. government. They are basically an arm of the U.S. government,” Lutnick said.

The Commerce Secretary went on to praise the technology that Lockheed has developed, describing the “amazing” technologies that can “knock a missile out of the air” if it's coming toward you.

“There's a lot of talking that needs to be had about how do we finance our munitions acquisitions,” Lutnick said. “I think a lot of that is talking and now you have the right people in the jobs, and Donald Trump at the head, thinking about what is the right way to do it. I tell you the way it has been done has been a giveaway.”

Lutnick has previously insisted that the government has no governance role at Intel and isn't going to tell the company what to do. But Trump tells private companies and institutions what to do each and every day, trying to use his leverage to influence policies right down to who can be hired at universities and what they can teach.

Trump also used an interesting word when posting to Truth Social about the Intel stake: control.

“It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

There is clearly an understanding that U.S. government ownership comes with strings attached. Trump was never going to get a stake in a private business without some form of control.

Another CNBC host asked Lutnick about a U.S. sovereign wealth fund and whether there would be some kind of independent government board to oversee these investments. But Lutnick rejected the idea that what was happening resembled a sovereign wealth fund like those set up in countries like Saudi Arabia.

“Well, let's be clear. There's no sovereign wealth fund now,” Lutnick said defensively. “We're not spending the American taxpayers dollars on anything, right? Biden gave away $11 billion and Donald Trump took back, right? An equity stake for the money that Biden had given away. We're not starting a sovereign wealth fund.”

Lutnick insisted that it should be called an “economic security fund” and would be coming from other countries that have supposedly pledged spending money on manufacturing infrastructure in the U.S.

Many online discussions about Trump gobbling up shares in private companies have tried to make comparisons to socialism or communism, but that's not quite right. The path that America is currently going down is better called something like corporate statism.

Under communism, the theory is that the state owns the means of production and the wealth created is dispersed more evenly among the people. Under corporate statism, businesses and government are deeply integrated, but the ruling class keeps all the profits for themselves and everyone else just has to do their best selling their labor to make a living.

Lutnick was explicitly asked about China's system and what he would think if another country, like the UK, decided to start taking stakes in companies with a “China-like approach.”

“The British figured out, along with the Trump administration teaching them, that you need steel to be a real country to be able to defend yourself. And the British figured that out, they nationalized British steel,” Lutnick said.

Whatever you want to call this new system, everything about it still feels very new right now, even if the ruling class still had an outsized say in how government is run. And while some conservatives in the comments section of the Wall Street Journal might object, it seems clear the nation's wealthiest people have embraced Trump's idea for the future of the country.

Mark Cuban, a nominal “liberal,” at least by billionaire standards, may have spelled it out best on Bluesky this past weekend. Asked about what was happening at Intel, which one user described as a shakedown, Cuban made clear that he preferred paying Trump over whatever wealth tax progressives might hypothetically impose if they came to power.

“I'm the furthest from a Trump fan. But the reality is that he would have to shake very hard to equate to the shakedowns of the unrealized cap gains tax and warren's tax that were proposed,” Cuban wrote.

Cuban explains why companies like Intel are happy to give fascists a cut. The wealthiest people in the country see it as a smaller sacrifice than what progressives are proposing in higher taxes.

None of that is a surprise, obviously. We've seen that calculation since the day Trump was inaugurated, when the biggest names in tech not only showed up for the festivities but sat in church with the president.

“So I think the key is where is the United States of America adding fundamental value to your business?” Lutnick asked on CNBC. “If we are adding fundamental value to your business, I think it's fair for Donald Trump to think about the American people.”

To be clear, Trump isn't thinking about the American people. He's thinking, as always, about himself and what's best for Donald Trump. And these kinds of deals are almost certainly part of the president's larger plan to move away from a model where government revenue is generated by income taxes and instead comes from things like tariffs and government ownership of industry.

A flat tax has been the right-wing dream for decades, though it would be highly regressive, meaning that wealthy people would pay a smaller percentage of their income in such a system. But that feels like the road we're heading down with all of those deals. Trump started this with “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.” But he may be lining up a plan for no taxes period if he gets his way, completely realigning government revenues with tariffs and ownership of private industry.

It's not quite China's system. But it's not unlike China, if we're being honest.

You've already watched every available episode of Wednesday—and every installment of Trainwreck too. Keep the frights flowing with the 10 best horror movies streaming on Netflix right now.

If the recent trailer for the documentary Chain Reactions gave you a longing to revisit Tobe Hooper's 1974 classic, Netflix has you covered. Just make sure you click on the original, giving the 2022 made-for-Netflix remake the widest berth possible. Watch on Netflix.

Three years ago, actor-turned-writer-director Zack Cregger released his solo feature debut and—once fans took notice—became a bona fide member of the horror A-list. Weapons is proof of that. And even if you know the strange places Barbarian travels after setting up its tale of an Airbnb rental gone awry, it's a film that rewards the repeat viewer. Not just for all the Justin Long scenes, but they're part of it. Watch on Netflix.

Speaking of Trainwreck, did you spot one of the twin directors of Talk to Me (and this year's Bring Her Back) in the “Storm Area 51” episode? That same manic YouTube energy propels this tale of teens who take a party game involving a severed hand with possession powers a little too far—but Talk to Me is also infused with slow-burn dread that creeps under your skin as you're watching. Watch on Netflix.

Jordan Peele‘s next directorial effort isn't coming until next year, and while we have no idea what it's about, his track record of Get Out, Us, and Nope assures a unique nightmare awaits. This 2019 entry beckons you to take a little trip to the Santa Cruz beach boardwalk, where the mirrors of the fun house reveal a secret about humanity that's long overdue to be let out. Featuring a dual performance by Lupita Nyong'o that really should've gotten more awards attention. Watch on Netflix.

In 2022—between starring in It Follows and Longlegs—Maika Monroe made another horror thriller that didn't get as much attention, and that's unfortunate because it's very well-crafted. Watcher follows a woman who moves to Bucharest with her husband, who's from there, for his new job. Left alone in an unfamiliar country where she doesn't speak the language, she becomes obsessed with a neighbor who seems to spend his days staring into her window. Adding to the menace, there also happens to be a serial killer on the loose. Watch on Netflix.

Is Jaws a horror movie? It is if you consider the shark-adjacent PTSD that haunts anyone who dares swim in the ocean soon after watching it. If you haven't yet spent time on Amity Island this summer in honor of this Spielberg classic's 50th anniversary, there are still a few more days before Labor Day to dive in. Watch on Netflix.

Found footage reaches freaky new heights in this collaboration between Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass. Brice directs, they wrote the script together, and they both star in a story that follows a videographer lured to the remote home of a man who claims to want a record of his life before he dies of a brain tumor. Of course, that's absolutely not his motivation at all in this aptly titled indie. Watch on Netflix.

Thanks to Netflix, you can watch both Train to Busan (watch on Netflix) and its standalone sequel, Peninsula (watch on Netflix). That American remake may never happen, which gives zombie fans all the more reason to celebrate the original—about a father and daughter caught on a train as the outbreak takes over—and its even more bonkers follow-up, set some time after humanity has learned to coexist (sort of) with the undead.

Before he directed Bob Odenkirk as an everydude action hero in Nobody 2, Indonesian filmmaker Timo Tjahjanto was best known for his horror films—including this 2018 entry about a woman who unearths some seriously Satanic family secrets when she's summoned home (a deeply creepy haunted place) to visit her very ill father. Watch on Netflix.

Built on Intel's 18A node, the all-E-core Xeon packs 288 cores per socket and promises big efficiency gains.

Intel pulled the wraps off its first all-E-core Xeon at Hot Chips on Monday, August 25, in Cupertino, California. Dubbed Clearwater Forest, it's the first Xeon built on the company's next-gen 18A process.

Scheduled to ship in 2026, the processor packs a punch with 288 efficiency cores and a two-socket ceiling of 576 cores, as well as over 1,152 MB combined last-level cache. On paper, it's Intel's next attempt to close the performance-per-watt gap in the data center, and it's a shot across the bow at AMD's EPYC line.

Architecturally, Clearwater is a spiritual sequel to Intel's 144-core all-E-core Xeon, Sierra Forest, but with a few notable upgrades. The new Darkmont E-cores offer a wider 3x3 decode engine, deeper out-of-order windows, and enhanced execution ports, resulting in approximately 17% better IPC than the Crestmont generation.

Four cores share 4MB of L2 cache, and the chip doubles L2 bandwidth compared to the Sierra. Multiply that across 288 cores, and you've got a throughput monster designed to eat multithreaded web services and AI inference jobs alive.

The choice of process matters just as much as core count. Clearwater is one of the first real-world testbeds for Intel's 18A node, which pairs RibbonFET transistors with backside power delivery.

This is effectively Intel's answer to the density and power efficiency questions that have enabled TSMC and AMD to dominate in recent years. By separating power and signal routing, Intel claims higher cell utilization and lower IR drop, features that hyperscalers care about when power bills stretch into megawatts.

Compared to AMD's 128-core Bergamo, Clearwater plays an entirely different game. AMD cores support SMT, AVX-512-class vector units, and higher single-thread performance. In contrast, Intel's cores don't chase peak IPC; they chase scale. That means Clearwater might not top benchmarks in HPC or AI training, but in raw thread count and total throughput, Intel says it's well ahead. A two-socket Clearwater box can theoretically support over 1,000 vCPUs per rack, while Intel is claiming 3.5x better perf-per-watt versus its previous Xeons.

The bigger question is whether customers buy into Intel's efficiency-first bet. For decades, Xeon has been synonymous with P-cores, but Clearwater is different. It's a data center processor that doesn't care about prestige benchmarks, but rather how many workloads it can cram into a rack without blowing the power budget. If Intel's numbers hold, the firm expects Clearwater Forest to redefine what Xeon is supposed to be, rather than simply being a new iteration.

Low-price discount makes Samsung's 1TB drive one of the cheapest ways to add storage capacity to your laptop or desktop computer.

Samsung's hybrid 990 Evo Plus SSD has hit a wonderful new all-time low price. We're outside of any sales event, with Labor Day being the next opportunity to pick up some sort of tech bargain if retailers participate. But that doesn't stop Amazon from offering this drive at the best price we've ever seen for this particular SSD.

1TB SSDs are very reasonably priced these days, with 1TB being the minimum size you'd want in a modern computer, as just the operating system can take up a hefty portion of the available storage, and only a couple of AAA games sucking up the rest, thanks to their ever-increasing installation sizes.

Checking the Camelizer extension, we can confirm that $64.99 is the lowest-ever price offered for the 1TB 990 Evo Plus SSD. With an original MSRP list price of $104.99, you're saving around 38% or $40, but the 990 Evo Plus has been selling regularly for around $74 - $79, so a more realistic saving discount is $10 - $15.

The Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality.

Samsung's discount makes the 990 EVO Plus 1TB one of the best low-budget options in the M.2 space. Similar 1TB options in the same price range can have less performance, feature slower QLC flash memory, and don't have PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 compatibility.

The 990 Evo Plus 1TB sports sequential read performance of up to 7,450 MB/s and sequential write performance of up to 6,300 MB/s. This 1TB variant shares the same 236-layer (V8) V-NAND TLC as its bigger brother, the 990 Pro, which also boasts 600 TB of write endurance and a five-year warranty. (The main differentiating factor is that the 990 Pro has LPDDR4 memory, while the 990 Evo Plus is a DRAM-less drive.)

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus is one of our favorite SSD drives thanks to its price and capacity ratios. The drive rectifies all the earlier mistakes that Samsung made with the vanilla 990 EVO, and provides excellent hardware for the price, with performance that can approach the 990 Pro in some cases. Chuck into the mix that you can install this SSD in either an older Gen 4 system or a newer Gen 5 build. This is a great low-budget option for an easy storage upgrade.

In this interview, Jonathan Ferguson discusses how knowledge of an emerging public health concern identified at Pittcon 2024 has evolved a year on.

I'm Jonathan Ferguson, the Scientific Business Leader in the New Strategy Department at Shimadzu Scientific Instruments. I'm based in Columbia, Maryland.

I grew up in a small town in Illinois with just 250 to 300 people. I've always loved learning how things work. I find it extremely exciting to discover something new that contributes to the wider body of knowledge on a subject, whether a novel protein modification or an unexplored biochemical mechanism.

I was in Professor Neil Kelleher's lab when he was at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. I remember walking to his lab and seeing the Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) with its massive 8.5 Tesla magnet.

The instrument was hand-built and not commercialized, which meant it was possible to tinker with everything. I had the opportunity to hands-on troubleshoot and learn how it functioned and repair it. The amount you learn from that hands-on approach is just incredible.

In 2024, Pittcon had its first Psychedelic Symposium. My presentation was on the quality control of naturally occurring psilocybin-containing compounds intended for clinical trials and the treatment of depression. These compounds are often mushrooms, and sometimes, these are put in chocolates and gummies available online or from convenience stores, head shops, or even gas stations in places like Oregon, where psilocybin has been legalized at the state level.

I was the second speaker at that symposium. The first was Fritsch USA, who discussed good milling strategies and the need for good sample preparation. The Scottsdale Research Institute (Scottsdale, AZ and the only DEA licensed grower of psychedelic mushrooms) gave the third talk, and Rose City Laboratories (Portland, OR) wrapped up with the fourth session.

At that fourth talk, Bjorn Fritzsche, the senior R&D scientist at Rose City Laboratories, concluded his talk by sharing data on products that he acquired at gas stations and head shops that were marketed with mushroom-like labels. It is important to note that these products are NOT tested as part of the Oregon Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (ORELAP). He ran the samples on his GC-MS (gas chromatography - mass spectrometry) system and identified cannabinoids and horse tranquilizers, which was quite surprising. 

Pittcon addresses synthetic psychedelics crisis; Boston 2025 to advance collaboration

We're increasingly discovering that what's on the packaging for these types of products does not match what the product contains.

While this field can be something of a ‘wild west' with many moving targets, the advertised contents should match what's actually in the product from a consumer's point of view. This is especially important because consumers could unknowingly be purchasing dangerous ingredients.

After Bjorn Fritzsche discovered these compounds, we wanted to pursue this area of investigation further. We connected Rose City Laboratories with Richard Van Breemen at the Linus Pauling Institute (Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR) to enable a deeper analysis and hopefully confirm what was seen in these samples.

This work was interesting because this symposium was supposed to be about quality control methodologies in accredited labs, but it led to the discovery of unexpected synthetic psychedelics in consumer products.

We are currently working on a manuscript to publish in a peer-reviewed journal, and we'll present some of this interesting but somewhat alarming data at future conferences.

I think it's very important. Pittcon is more than just an exhibition hall and a space for marketing. It's a hub for collaboration and innovation that allows researchers, customers, and companies to come together to work on mutual problems and publish research together.

Without that forum, these types of relationships wouldn't occur. I want to thank Pittcon for establishing an environment where we can come together to work on science that's interesting and meaningful and has a real impact on everyone.

Historically, we'd see chemists working alone in basements, but that doesn't happen anymore. We need many researchers to work on these projects because we all have different expertise. Without these collaborations, we wouldn't be able to move science forward as quickly as we do.

In terms of public health hazards like the one I mentioned, it's also important to talk about what we are going to do about it. For example, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments can get the information out by having the data grounded in good science, presenting it, and publishing it. I think it's most important that we address these problems from a good factual foundation.

Analyzing the gummies and chocolates I mentioned presents different challenges. The matrix (the gummy or the chocolate) will feature different compounds that are supposed to be there, but can interfere with our analysis. So, we need to think about how to prepare that sample so that we can precisely target our analytes of interest.

Detecting and identifying adulterants in these products can be difficult because they're not being manufactured in a regulated way. For example, we don't know what was introduced into the sample, and there can be such a wide variety of variations and substituents in these molecules that analyzing them presents a real challenge.

This is famously called the ‘unknown unknowns,' where while we know we have to look for some things, ingredients may be added that we really don't expect and are currently trying to detect. Furthermore, what we're looking for can change from sample to sample.

I would argue that liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is still the gold standard in this research area. Bjorn Fritzsche's analysis was done by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, which is also a good technique that goes hand in hand with LC-MS.

Richard Van Breemen uses a Shimadzu quadrupole time-of-flight instrument because it has higher resolution and higher mass accuracy—an important consideration when dealing with the ‘unknown unknowns' that I've talked about.

However, using that high-end technology can sometimes be too much. When I gave the second talk of the symposium, my focus was on providing a methodology that only used liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (LC-UV).

This methodology is not as specific, but with the right approach, you can run these kinds of samples much more cost-effectively than via higher-spec instruments. UV is not as accurate in the sense that there is no mass to charge, but once we work out the relevant retention times and know what the relevant absorbance profiles look like, we can use a technique called IPDeA to clean up the chromatogram. This allows us to achieve very accurate quantitation results more cheaply.

This cost-effectiveness is important because we want to save lives. If only a handful of people in the world can analyze these samples effectively, the results will not be helpful.

Shimadzu Scientific Instruments is a leader in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, but thinking even beyond that, I was at a talk on developing a method where one of the requirements was not to use power.

Some parts of the world don't have access to reliable electricity or any electricity, and, at the moment, I don't know anybody who makes an LC-MS that doesn't require electricity. Those customers have a different set of requirements. For example, they might need to use an analytical tool that is antibody-based or that changes color in the presence of the analyte.

There is already a lot of history in this area. For example, the advent of hippie culture in the United States in the 1970s saw psychedelics listed as a Schedule One drug, which meant that it had no known medical uses. That essentially stopped all research into psychedelics for 30 years.

In the 2000s, things started up again. Companies began doing research to find out what potential medicinal uses these substances had. That work continued, and in 2019, Denver, Colorado, decriminalized psilocybin. That was quickly followed by Oregon and Colorado State decriminalizing and legalizing psilocybin, with Oregon setting up a regulatory framework. That doesn't change the fact that it's still illegal on the federal level, however.

At Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, we always do everything through legal pathways. That's why we worked with Rose City Labs, because they are licensed to run these samples. Richard Van Breemen also has a license to do the analytics.

There's a lot you can do with just standards, but having these collaborations, particularly in the psychedelics field, is so important because we are limited in our ability to study these substances in a legal way.

I'm not an expert on the regulatory side, but I do believe that people should know what they are consuming and that what is on the package should match what is in the product.

In terms of our wider work, we tend to follow what customers need. When there is a need, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments will aim to fulfill it. Some of this work will be driven by regulations that are beyond our control, but we're always trying to meet our customers' current needs while working to anticipate what may be coming next.

We're led by the science on this collaborative project. As I mentioned, we weren't going to specifically look at gummies and chocolates from head shops, but that's where the science directed us. I think the results of this work will prompt a reaction when people realize the potential risks associated with these products.

I don't see work in the field stopping anytime soon. There's always going to be something else requiring urgent investigation and analysis. To address these issues, it's important that we stick to the fundamentals, keep reviewing the literature, and keep establishing collaborations so that we can try to stay ahead of this rapidly changing field. Ultimately, this is important because these are people's lives.

Dr. Jonathan T. Ferguson received his Ph.D. in 2008 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he studied Top-Down proteomics in the laboratory of Professor Neil Kelleher. Following his doctoral work, he has developed a wide range of customer applications involving HPLC coupled with various mass spectrometry platforms. His early work focused on proteomics, monoclonal antibodies, and nano-LC techniques. Over time, his expertise has expanded to include small molecule characterization across a broad range of applications.



In 2022, Dr. Ferguson joined Shimadzu Scientific Instruments in Columbia, MD. In his current role, he leads collaborative efforts to develop innovative hardware and analytical workflows tailored to emerging market needs. His ongoing projects include application development using Shimadzu's MALDI-MS systems, the LCMS-8060RX triple quadrupole, and the LCMS-9050 Q-TOF. He is also actively engaged in the scientific community, currently serving as co-chair of the Washington–Baltimore Mass Spectrometry Discussion Group (WBMSDG).

Pittcon is the world's largest annual premier conference and exposition on laboratory science. Pittcon attracts more than 16,000 attendees from industry, academia and government from over 90 countries worldwide.

Their mission is to sponsor and sustain educational and charitable activities for the advancement and benefit of scientific endeavor.

Pittcon's target audience is not just “analytical chemists,” but all laboratory scientists — anyone who identifies, quantifies, analyzes or tests the chemical or biological properties of compounds or molecules, or who manages these laboratory scientists.

Having grown beyond its roots in analytical chemistry and spectroscopy, Pittcon has evolved into an event that now also serves a diverse constituency encompassing life sciences, pharmaceutical discovery and QA, food safety, environmental, bioterrorism and cannabis/psychedelics.

With chronic disease rates rising across the U.S., healthcare systems face ongoing challenges in reducing hospital stays and readmissions. Nearly 1 in 4 heart failure patients is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, and fewer than 20% receive all four guideline-directed medical therapy pillars post-discharge, despite strong evidence showing these therapies improve patient outcomes.

At the same time, the number of people living with chronic illness is expected to double from 2020 to 2050. Remote patient care fills a critical gap, offering a scalable way to support the most vulnerable patients, improving adherence to evidence-based care and reducing avoidable hospitalizations, no matter the geographical location.

To help close critical gaps in heart failure care, the American Heart Association, a relentless force changing the future of health for everyone everywhere, has developed American Heart Association Connected Care™, Powered by Cadence, a virtual care program that delivers ongoing heart and cardiometabolic care to patients at home after their hospital stay.

Hospitals can refer eligible patients to the Connected Care program prior to discharge. The Association is working with participating hospitals to integrate the program into discharge workflows. Cadence enrolls patients in the program, teaching them how to use their devices, monitoring vital sign readings and providing ongoing clinical support.

Our legacy is built on bringing science to life and meeting people where they are to reimagine how healthcare is delivered. By combining advanced remote patient monitoring technology with our expertise in guideline-directed care and chronic condition management, we can help extend the high-quality care hospitals provide, ensuring people with heart failure receive proactive, timely support at home when they need it most.""

John Meiners, chief of mission-aligned businesses at the American Heart Association

The Association spearheaded this collaboration with Cadence to extend the reach of its trusted science into homes and communities, utilizing Cadence's remote platform and 24/7 virtual provider group.

""Hospitals struggle to extend consistent, evidence-based care once patients leave their doors,"" said Chris Altchek, chief executive officer and founder of Cadence. ""By pairing the American Heart Association's gold-standard scientific guidelines with Cadence's AI-driven remote monitoring and always-on care team, American Heart Association Connected Care, Powered by Cadence, makes proactive, personalized heart-failure support available anytime, anywhere.""

American Heart Association Connected Care aims to:

""Too often, people with heart failure get discharged from the hospital only to find themselves back within a month,"" said Marat Fudim, M.D., MHS, associate professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and heart failure cardiologist at the Duke University Medical Center. ""With timely interventions and evidence-based support, remote patient monitoring allows us to bridge that gap by keeping a close eye on patients' health while they're at home, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and achieving better long-term outcomes.""

Rooted in a century of innovative scientific breakthroughs, trusted clinical guidelines and science-backed educational content, Connected Care offers patients timely, remote care and support to help them adhere to treatment plans, adopt heart-healthy habits and avoid preventable readmissions.

The Connected Care pilot program is currently underway at four hospitals:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Novel monoclonal antibodies show promise in preventing severe mpox disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250826/Novel-monoclonal-antibodies-show-promise-in-preventing-severe-mpox-disease.aspx","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:38:00 GMT","

A team from the Microbiology Department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has discovered three powerful monoclonal antibodies from a person who had previously been infected with mpox (formerly known as monkeypox).

These antibodies, which target the viral protein A35, blocked viral spread in laboratory in vitro tests and, most importantly, protected rodents from severe disease and fully prevented death. The findings, published August 22 in Cell, also reveal that humans previously infected with mpox carry high levels of these protective antibodies in their blood, and that their presence is associated with milder symptoms and the absence of hospitalization.

Mpox is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus (the family of viruses that causes smallpox, which killed more than 300 million people in the 20th century alone). This virus spreads mainly through close contact with an infected individual. The virus causes a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scars.

A global outbreak of mpox began in 2022 and continues to this day. In the last three years, the World Health Organization twice declared the disease a public health emergency of international concern, yet effective treatment for this virus family is lacking. Recent human clinical trials for the leading candidate therapy did not show it to have efficacy. Thus, there is currently no approved drug to treat mpox. This study from Mount Sinai might change that.

A previous study published in 2023 by our team showed that human antibodies targeting the viral protein A35 were unusually increased in sera in response to mpox infection compared with vaccination for smallpox or antibodies against other viral proteins. Based on this earlier finding, we hypothesized that antibodies targeting A35 from mpox-infected individuals would be highly protective against orthopoxviruses, since the viruses in this family share high genetic similarity. We aimed to address the urgent unmet need for effective treatments for orthopoxviruses, and with the help of our outstanding collaborators, I am very proud to say that we are close to achieving that goal.""

Camila Coelho, PhD, MBA, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the Icahn School of Medicine and senior author of the paper

The newly discovered antibodies bind to a region that is highly conserved across not only the orthopoxvirus genus, to which MPXV belongs to, but also the entire poxvirus family, which means the region is conserved among different viruses and is not prone to mutations or antibody escape. The ability of these antibodies to block viral spread, protect from severe disease, and fully prevent death suggests that they are promising drug candidates that could be tested in humans for the prevention or treatment of mpox. The antibodies have been patented by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

""Ours is the first report of the crystal structure of a human antibody bound to an mpox virus protein, providing a detailed map of a vulnerability in the virus,"" said Raianna Fantin, PhD, the postdoctoral researcher who is the first author of the study. ""It is also the first time that monoclonal antibodies against orthopoxviruses were quantified in human sera. We were surprised by how consistently people recovering from mpox infection produced antibodies targeting the same A35 epitope of the virus as the antibodies we discovered.""

While the researchers see this as a promising next-generation therapy against mpox in humans, it is important to note that this is still in the research stage. Future testing in human clinical trials is needed to evaluate how the antibodies behave in the body, how long they last, where they go after being administered to the human body, and how well they prevent orthopoxvirus infection.

The research team plans to move the newly discovered antibodies into advanced preclinical safety and efficacy testing. Simultaneously, they are using the structural and immunological insights from the study to guide future work on understanding and enhancing the human immune response to mpox.

The study was conducted by the following laboratories from Mount Sinai's Department of Microbiology: Coelho, Schotsaert, Simon, Bajic, and Krammer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","An insurer agreed to cover her surgery. A politician's nudge got the bills paid.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250826/An-insurer-agreed-to-cover-her-surgery-A-politiciane28099s-nudge-got-the-bills-paid.aspx","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 11:46:00 GMT","

For the most part, Keyanna Jones and her husband thought they knew what to expect when their daughter Chloë had eye surgery last fall.

Even Chloë, who was in kindergarten, had a good understanding of how things would go that day. Before the procedure, a hospital worker gave her a coloring book that explained the steps of the surgery — a procedure to correct a condition that could have eventually interfered with her vision.

""Chloë is very smart,"" Jones said. ""She reads at almost a third-grade level now, and she's only 6.""

Jones did her homework, too. With no pediatric ophthalmologists near their home in Wentzville, Missouri, who would take their insurance, she asked the insurer to cover Chloë's out-of-network care as if it were in-network. The insurer agreed to let her see an out-of-network specialist.

Chloë made it through surgery without a hitch. Jones said her daughter enjoyed a few popsicles at the hospital before going home.

"" I slept with her every night because she was so worried she would wake up and not be able to see,"" she said. ""But it healed beautifully, and she was absolutely ready to go back to school.""

Then the bill came. 

Chloë was born with a droopy left eyelid, a condition known as ptosis. To correct the problem, an ophthalmologist surgically lifts the eyelid, preventing it from disrupting the patient's line of sight.

Ophthalmologists, unlike optometrists and opticians, hold medical degrees and can provide advanced eye care, including surgery.

$15,188, including $10,382 for the procedure and $2,730 for anesthesia. Initially, insurance paid just $1,775.79, leaving the Jones family owing $13,412.21 — until Chloë's uncle, who had recently finished his term as a state senator, asked a colleague to look into it.

Months before Chloë inhaled bubblegum-scented anesthetic at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Jones discovered that it can be hard to find a pediatric ophthalmologist. The doctor recommended by Chloë's pediatrician wasn't contracted with their insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and the closest in-network specialist was in Wisconsin, hundreds of miles away.

So Jones requested what's called a network gap exception, under which the insurer would cover the recommended doctor's services as in-network.

Before the surgery was scheduled, she received a letter saying UnitedHealthcare had approved her request ""because currently there isn't a doctor, health care professional, or facility in your area to provide these services."" The letter listed several medical billing codes for eye services and said they would be covered ""at the network level.""

About a week later, the insurer sent a prior authorization letter approving Chloë's surgery.

But UnitedHealthcare declined to pay most of the surgery bill, covering it as out-of-network. With approval letters in hand, Jones said, she did not understand why the insurer apparently was not honoring its agreement to cover her daughter's treatment.

In fact, the similar-looking letters granted different kinds of approval.

UnitedHealthcare's gap exception approved Chloë's exams before the surgery as in-network. But in its prior authorization letter for her surgery with the same doctor, the insurer said only that it would cover it — without offering network discounts.

After receiving the bill, Jones contacted the insurer online, but she said a representative told her there was no record of its approval to cover the surgery as in-network.

""At that point, I didn't even know what to do,"" she said. ""I'm like, 'This is crazy.'""

She said she sent over a copy of one of the approval letters, which was on the company's letterhead, but a representative told her the letter hadn't come from UnitedHealthcare.

""They said, 'You saw this surgeon, they're not covered and you didn't have permission, so, no, we're not going to pay,'"" Jones said, recounting the phone call.

An insurance representative told Jones she owed more than $13,000 because of ""a balance billing issue."" That meant the Jones family would have to pay the $13,000-plus balance.

Spokespeople for UnitedHealthcare confirmed the company provided a gap exception and prior authorization for Chloë's care. Eric Hausman, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group, said in a statement to KFF Health News that ""we empathize with anyone who finds themselves in the unfortunate situation of being balance billed by an out-of-network provider for an amount significantly above market rates, and without any advance knowledge.""

Maryanne Wallace, a spokesperson for SSM Health, the health system that includes Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, provided a statement that said SSM followed ""standard patient billing procedures.""

""Occasionally, an insurance company may process a claim as an out-of-network service, which can result in a balance being billed to the patient,"" the statement said.

Jones said she was blindsided by the big bill. She tried to fix the problem on her own, she said, keeping track of every interaction with the insurer and the hospital. She filed appeals with UnitedHealthcare.

Nothing helped — until she reached out to her brother Caleb Rowden, who had been a Missouri state senator for eight years after serving four years in the state House.

"" I've never used my brother's political clout for anything,"" she said. ""I actually hate politics.""

Rowden told KFF Health News that he reached out to Travis Fitzwater, the state senator representing his niece's district. Jones contacted Fitzwater's office, too, and sent a complaint to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey.

Fitzwater said his office did no more for Chloë than it would for any constituent.

""We're not going to take a lot of credit for the result of it, because we didn't ask for anything other than a resolution, so that everybody can be at peace and move on with their lives,"" he said in an interview. ""We just did what we do every day.""

After Fitzwater's staff contacted the hospital and the insurer, representatives from both separately called Jones and notified her that UnitedHealthcare had paid the bill in full.

In the end, Chloë's family paid nothing for her procedure — not even a copay.

When it comes to insurance approvals, read the fine print carefully; ""covered"" does not mean an insurer will pay, let alone at in-network rates.

Rowden and Fitzwater said reaching out to your elected representative's office can help. Advocating for constituents is part of their job.

""They usually have an open line of communication with these insurance companies and hospitals,"" Rowden wrote in an email. ""They may not always be able to get to a positive outcome since every situation is a little different, but they can usually get you to a next step.""

Jones is grateful that her brother was able to help, though she acknowledged that she probably would not have called him without a nudge from their mother. ""I think I would still be fighting,"" she said.

Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills.

Chemicals used to replace bisphenol A (BPA) in food packaging can trigger potentially harmful effects in human ovarian cells, according to McGill University researchers.

A new study examined several chemicals commonly used in price stickers on packaged meat, fish, cheese and produce found early signs of potential toxicity.

The findings, published in the journal Toxicological Sciences, raise concerns about the safety of BPA-free packaging and whether current regulations go far enough to protect consumers.

The research began with the 2023 discovery by Stéphane Bayen, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry, that label-printing chemicals like bisphenol S (BPS), a BPA replacement, were leaching through plastic wrap into the food. He teamed up with colleagues in reproductive toxicology to investigate what these substances could be doing inside the body.

Lab-grown human ovarian cells were exposed to four commonly used BPA substitutes: TGSA, D-8, PF-201 and BPS. Several of the chemicals, particularly TGSA and D-8, caused a buildup of fat droplets in the cells and changed the activity of genes that help cells grow and repair their DNA.

These are major cellular functions. Disrupting them doesn't prove harm in humans, but it gives us a strong signal that these chemicals should be further investigated.""

Bernard Robaire, co-senior author of the study and James McGill Professor in McGill's Departments of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Obstetrics & Gynecology

BPA is a chemical that can interfere with the body's hormones, and has been linked to problems with fertility, early development and metabolism. Because of these risks, it has been banned in baby bottles and restricted in some products in Canada.

Many of the chemicals used to replace BPA are not regulated or routinely tested, the researchers explained.

""'BPA-free' is an incredibly misleading label,"" said Robaire. ""It usually means one bisphenol has been swapped for another, and there are more than 200 of them. Some may be just as harmful, or even worse. We need to test these compounds before they're widely adopted, not after.""

Health Canada has now added all four substances to a list of chemicals requiring further investigation.

For consumers looking to err on the side of caution, Robaire suggests removing labels and plastic wrap from fresh foods before storing.

People with lower interleukin-6 activity have a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, a new LMU study reveals.

Lowering the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) - a key immune signal regulating inflammatory responses in the body - could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease without making people more vulnerable to infections, according to new research from LMU's Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research and international collaborators.

The team led by Dr. Marios Georgakis, Junior Group Leader at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD) and member of the SyNergy cluster of excellence, used large-scale human genetic analyses to mimic the effects of drugs that block IL-6. Previous genetic studies had focused on variants in the IL6R gene, which encodes not IL-6 itself but the corresponding receptor. ""These studies suggested that suppressing the IL-6 receptor could be associated with cardiovascular benefits, but raised concerns about increased infection risk,"" explains Georgakis. Whether these findings would translate to under-development drugs that directly inhibit IL-6 remained unclear. And so the LMU researchers turned their attention to genes that encode IL-6.

In the new study, published in Nature Cardiovascular Research, they analyzed genetic data from over half a million people of European and East Asian ancestry. They found that individuals carrying variants in the IL6 gene linked to lower IL-6 signaling had a reduced lifetime risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Strikingly, these variants were also associated with a lower risk of pneumonia and sepsis - countering fears that blocking IL-6 might impair the body's ability to fight infections.

Our study shows that genetic variants mimicking IL-6 inhibition are associated with lower cardiovascular risk and, potentially, even a lower risk of specific infections.""

Lanyue Zhang, first author of the paper

""Our findings highlight how human genetics can be used to anticipate the benefits and risks of new therapies. The results support both the efficacy and safety potential of under-development IL-6 inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease,"" says Georgakis. The genetic evidence also pointed to potential improvements in type 2 diabetes risk and lipid profiles, hinting at broader metabolic benefits.

A new HIV antiretroviral shows promise as a long-acting, oral prophylactic agent, according to a new study by Izzat Raheem, Tracy Diamond and colleagues from Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, published August 26th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology.

HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key part of reducing the number of new HIV infections. The most common oral PrEP therapies, consisting of once-daily pills, are highly effective at protecting people from acquiring HIV, but they only work if taken properly. Currently, the only long-acting PrEP therapies require injection by a healthcare provider, which isn't always feasible for people. Long-acting, oral PrEP therapies could facilitate adherence, provide greater privacy and discretion, reduce concerns about stigma, and improve accessibility for more people to initiate and continue on PrEP, ultimately helping to stem the tide of the nearly 1.3 million new HIV infections globally per year.

Researchers from Merck engaged in a lead optimization campaign to develop a novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI). NRTTIs are a new class of anti-HIV drugs that have shown potential for long-acting prophylaxis. They inhibit viral replication by more than one mechanism, including blocking translocation of reverse transcriptase on the growing viral DNA chain.

Using a known NRTTI, islatravir, as a starting point, researchers used several medicinal chemistry strategies to modify the structure and optimize it using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The lead compound, dubbed MK-8527, showed robust antiviral activity in vitro, and pharmacokinetics in animal studies demonstrated that it may be suitable as a long-acting oral therapy. Studies in humans are underway to assess the safety and tolerability of MK-8527 as a once-monthly oral pill in volunteers at low likelihood of HIV exposure, and at least one completed clinical study shows promising results.

The last time Sergiño Dest played for the U.S. Men's National Team, he raised the Concacaf Nations League trophy.

That was in March 2024, just a month before Dest tore his ACL while playing for his club team PSV.

Dest rehabbed the injury to return to the field in March 2025. He was initially on the USMNT roster for the June friendlies this summer, but he left camp early to work on an individualized training program to recover fully.

Now, Dest joins 22 other players selected by head coach Mauricio Pochettino for the September friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan.

“All [players] are in a place to compete for the final roster for the World Cup,” Pochettino said after the roster announcement. “Of course it's my test — it's our test — to select the players, but also it's up to them to perform and to show that they are desperate to come to the National Team.”

Since the European leagues began the 2025-26 season, Dest has been on a tear for PSV. He scored in back-to-back matches, first to lift the Dutch Super Cup trophy and then again to begin the Eredivisie season. He also tallied an assist and earned Man of the Match honors early in the season.

Dest earned his first USMNT cap in 2019, and the right back has been an important piece ever since. He competed in his first FIFA World Cup in 2022 and started all four matches. After along journey back, the 24-year-old defender is hitting his stride as the U.S. gets set to host the World Cup next summer.

Lucas Vazquez has joined Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen following his exit from Real Madrid.

Primarily a right-sided player who can play in midfield and defence, Vazquez travelled to Germany on Tuesday ahead of completing the move.

The 34-year-old ended his career-long association with Madrid earlier this summer, following the team's exit from the Club World Cup at the semi-final stage.

Vazquez spent a total of 18 years at the Spanish capital club, with his only experience away from Madrid being a 2014-15 loan spell at Espanyol.

Known for his versatility, Vazquez was primarily a wide-right midfielder while also often being deployed as a right-back at Madrid when first-choice Dani Carvajal was unavailable, before Trent Alexander-Arnold joined this summer.

Upon leaving the club, Vazquez said that he has “fulfilled the dream of his life” by his time in Madrid.

He won 20 trophies, including five Champions League titles and four La Liga crowns, across his time at Madrid, where he made over 400 first-team appearances.

All nine of Vazquez's appearances for Spain came within 2016 and 2018, representing his nation at the European Championship and World Cup.

It's been an eventful start to the US Open for Carlos Alcaraz, who is making just as much noise off the court as he is on it.

Fresh from winning his sixth title of the season in Cincinnati, the 22-year-old Spaniard arrived in New York buzzing — literally — after debuting a sharp new buzzcut that caught plenty of attention. Alcaraz's week went up a gear, however, when golf star Rory McIlroy dropped in on his practice session on Monday.

“It was the first time that I met him. It was such an honor. I just admire him a lot. I'm just a huge fan of golf,” Alcaraz said of McIlroy, the reigning Masters champion. “The last day of the Masters I just won Monte Carlo, and in my celebration I was with the phone cheering on him, supporting him. It was an unbelievable experience for me meeting him and [having] a chance to talk a little bit with him.

“As a person, he seems [like] a really good guy, a really close person. As an athlete, he has shown what he is capable of doing, his swing, his golf. It's just amazing to watch his golf. So I just admire him a lot.”

After seeing off Reilly Opelka in straight sets on Monday night, Alcaraz appeared to dedicate his win to McIlroy, who was watching on inside Arthur Ashe Stadium. Alcaraz broke into a playful golf swing celebration just moments after sealing match point.

For now, the focus fully shifts back on the courts at Flushing Meadows, where Alcaraz is chasing his sixth major title. While he opened his campaign in style on Monday, there is plenty more at stake over the fortnight.

Alcaraz is locked in a thrilling race with defending champion Jannik Sinner for the No. 1 spot in the PIF ATP Rankings. If the Spaniard matches or betters his rival's result in New York, he will return to World No. 1 for the first time since September 2023.

For now, though, the Spaniard insists he and Sinner are both staying focused on the tournament, not the rankings.

“I don't think I'm putting pressure on his shoulders, to be honest. I'm pretty sure that he's thinking about the first round, trying to win the first round, as much as I did today. I'm trying not to think about the rank of the No. 1 spot.

“I'm just trying to go as far as I can in this tournament, play my best tennis, and let's see how it's going to be at the end of the tournament. Who plays better in this tournament will decide the No. 1 spot. I don't think I'm putting pressure on him.”

Alcaraz looked convincing in his 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 victory over Opelka in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, but the Spaniard admitted that he'll need to find more flow ahead of his second-round cash.

“Today was really difficult to get a good rhythm,” said Alcaraz. “Opelka is such a tough opponent, big serve. He doesn't let you go on rallies. It was difficult for me to get a good rhythm and a good feeling from the baseline. So I just tried to return well, playing as long a point as I can.

“So it was a difficult first round, but overall I just really happy with the way that I managed everything today. Good returns, good points from the baseline, good serves. So I just wanted to keep it going. Tomorrow I will try to practice a little bit to get more rhythm. The next round is going to be with more rhythm, playing more points from the baseline, but right now I'm just really happy with the way that I'm feeling.”

Alcaraz, who owns a Tour-leading 55 wins and six titles in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, continues his Flushing Meadows campaign against Mattia Bellucci on Wednesday.

Iga Swiatek dropped just three games to Emiliana Arango to open her 2025 US Open campaign.

No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek continued her 2025 resurgence by cruising through her US Open first round 6-1, 6-2 over Emiliana Arango in exactly an hour.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of play

Swiatek snapped a 13-month title drought in July by capturing her first Wimbledon title -- her sixth Grand Slam crown in total -- and backed that up by lifting the Cincinnati trophy for the first time two weeks ago. Having fallen to No. 8 in the PIF WTA Rankings in June, she's already returned to No. 2 this week. The 2022 champion at Flushing Meadows, a second title here this fortnight would make Swiatek the first player to win both Wimbledon and the US Open since Serena Williams in 2012 -- and could potentially mean she reclaims the World No. 1 ranking from Aryna Sabalenka.

Swiatek will next face No. 66-ranked Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands, who defeated 18-year-old wild card Valerie Glozman 6-4, 6-2. Lamens, who claimed her first WTA title last October in Osaka, has played the main draws of all four majors for the first time this year, making the second round of the Australian Open, Wimbledon and now the US Open.

Here are the key numbers from Swiatek's victory:

65: Swiatek has now won 65 consecutive opening matches at tour level (including the United Cup and the WTA Finals), breaking Monica Seles's Open Era record of 64 consecutive opening victories between Washington 1990 and Oakland 1996. Swiatek's last opening loss was at the 2021 WTA Finals Guadalajara to Maria Sakkari; her last opening loss in a knockout tournament was to Ons Jabeur at Cincinnati 2021.

26: Swiatek improved to 26-1 overall in Grand Slam first-round matches; her only such loss came at Wimbledon 2019 to Viktorija Golubic. She is the first player since Serena Williams to win at least 26 of her first 27 Grand Slam openers; Williams won her first 46 in a row from her 1998 Australian Open debut until her streak was snapped by Virginie Razzano at Roland Garros 2012.

24: Swiatek has won 24 consecutive Grand Slam first-round matches -- the first player to do so since fellow Pole Agnieszka Radwanska, who won 24 straight between Roland Garros 2009 and the Australian Open 2015 inclusive. Radwanska's streak was snapped by Annika Beck at Roland Garros 2015.

8: This was the first meeting between Swiatek and Arango at pro level, but eight years ago they met for the only time at junior level in the second round of Roland Garros 2017. Swiatek won 6-2, 6-3 en route to the quarterfinals, where she fell to Marta Paigina.

26: Swiatek fired 25 winners to Arango's five, and committed 14 unforced errors to the Colombian's nine.

11: Swiatek won 11 out of 13 net points, including a superb backhand stab volley at 3-2, 30-30.

0: Swiatek did not face a break point in the match, and dropped just 10 points on serve in total.

0-0: Swiatek's second-round meeting with Lamens will be the first time the two have played each other.

In her second match since Wimbledon, Mirra Andreeva cruised to a first-round victory at the US Open over Alycia Parks. Andreeva dominated, winning 6-0, 6-1 in just 55 minutes. Up next, she faces Anastasia Potapova and will be aiming to reach the third round in New York for the first time in her career. Meanwhile, 12th seed Elina Svitolina was knocked out in the opening round.

Back from injury, Mirra Andreeva made short work of Alycia Parks, easing into the US Open second round in just her second match since Wimbledon.

Andreeva admitted she was nervous facing an opponent who had just reached the Monterrey semifinals, but once play began she settled quickly and stormed through the first set 6-0.

Parks managed to hold serve to start the second set, but that would be her lone game of the day. Andreeva reeled off six straight games to complete a dominant 6-0, 6-1 victory in just 55 minutes.

It was a clinical performance from the rising star, who will now face Anastasia Potapova in the second round. Potapova needed three sets to get past China's Lin Zhu, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.

The head-to-head between the two stands at one win apiece: Potapova claimed their first meeting in Monastir in 2022, while Andreeva leveled the rivalry with a victory at Wimbledon in 2023.

The teenager has never made it past the second round in her two prior US Open main-draw appearances and will be aiming to move into the third round in New York for the first time in her career.

Svitolina crashes out in first round

Ukraine's Elina Svitolina became the second highest seed to fall on the women's side at this year's US Open following a straight-sets defeat to Hungary's Anna Bondar.

Bondar, ranked No. 97 in the world, pulled off the 6-2, 6-4 upset win in one hour and 41 minutes to reach the second round and equal her best performance at the Grand Slam level. For Svitolina, it was her first opening-round loss at a Grand Slam since the 2018 Wimbledon Championships.

NEW YORK -- Born in Jakarta, Indonesia, Janice Tjen started playing tennis when her friend Priska Madelyn Nugroho invited her on court.

“My parents just like, ‘Yeah, just go play the sport, just having exercise,'” Tjen told reporters at the US Open. “So I'm not going to be in my room just doing nothing.”

Fast forward to last Friday, when Tjen did something special, throwing down a 6-1, 6-2 win over No. 3 qualifying seed Aoi Ito to secure a spot in the main draw. She became the first Indonesian player to compete in a major since Angelique Widjaja at the 2004 US Open. And then she upset No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova in a three-set, first-round match, equaling Widjaja's effort at the 2023 Wimbledon championships.

The Unisphere, symbolizing the vast world we live in, is an iconic stainless steel sculpture dominating the entrance at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. But as we've seen, the world today is shrinking at the elite levels of tennis. Once upon a time, the United States, Australia and Great Britain dominated the game. 

Now, we're seeing some distinctly non-tennis nations creeping into the mix -- and their players are bringing a new, non-traditional flavor to the game. Beyond Tjen, consider the events of the past three days at this US Open:

“I think definitely tennis is becoming a bit more popular, more global,” Zarazua said after her shocking win over Keys. “I would say a lot of people are watching a bit more than before maybe.”

Safe to say, they'll be watching Wednesday when Tjen meets Emma Raducanu in a high-profile, second-round match. Raducanu is another nod to the game's growing diversity. She was born in Toronto, Canada, while her father Ion is from Bucharest, Romania and her mother Renee hails from Shenyang, China. Raducanu was raised in Bromley, England, the country she represents.

Tjen was playing for Pepperdine University when Raducanu won the 2021 US Open.

“I was injured at the time, so I get to watch a lot of tennis,” Tjen said. “Just seeing her doing it makes me, like, inspired me, like, to be able to do it, as well.”

The Minister of Happiness

The recent patron saint of global tennis is Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.

When she reached the Wimbledon final three years ago, Jabeur became the first Arab or African woman to contest a major final. It was a highlight in a stirring string of firsts, including rising to the World No. 2 ranking.

Jabeur has always taken her role as a role model very seriously.





 Jimmie48/WTA
                        

“Sometimes I really doubt myself and the fact that I would be letting people down, that will affect me more than anything else,” she once said. “I know part of Ons Jabeur playing is being Tunisian and that blood will help me play and make history.”

Jabeur, currently taking a break from professional tennis, played with an undeniable joy, leading to her memorable nickname. With a diverse game as eclectic as her roots, Jabeur demonstrated what was possible for so many young girls around the world.

Eala was one of them.

Still a teenager at the Miami Open, she set off on a stunning run to the semifinals, defeating Grand Slam champions Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek along the way. Her ranking soared to No. 72 -- from No. 140 -- and she was granted direct entry into the US Open main draw.

Trailing Tauson 5-1 in the third set, Eala produced a furious comeback and forced a tiebreak, ultimately converting her fifth match point.

“To be Filipino is something I take so much pride in,” Eala, now 20, said afterward. “And you know, I don't have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here at the US Open, I'm so grateful that they made me feel like I'm home.”

Playing against an American in Arthur Ashe Stadium, Zarazua didn't enjoy that advantage. Previously, she was 0-6 against Top 10 players and Keys couldn't have been a more imposing opponent.

And yet, the 5-foot-3 Mexican -- continuously scrambling on defense -- retrieved Keys' powerful groundstrokes and, ultimately, outlasted her.

Before the match, Zarazua said she was so nervous she was nearly in tears.

“I didn't want the nerves to be what let me down in the match,” she explained. “Yeah, the fear, the nerves, all of that, just tried to leave them on the side and just focus on my game and what I had to do.”

A talent for tennis

To understand Jimenez Kasintseva's extraordinary journey to New York, it helps to know a little geography.

Andorra -- officially it's the Principality of Andorra -- is a tiny, land-locked nation nestled in the Pyrenees Mountains, which straddle the border between France and Spain. It is the16th smallest country by land (181 square miles) and 11th smallest by population (87,486). For context, Billings, Montana, Edison, New Jersey and Lakeland, Florida all have similar populations.

Jimenez Kasintseva's Andorran father Joan was a former ATP Tour player and continues to oversee her training in Barcelona. The family moved from Andorra to Kentucky for three years when Victoria was four and began to develop a talent for tennis.





 Florin Petean/WTA
                        

At 14, she was the youngest player in the Australian Open girls' singles draw -- and won the title. She was the first Andorran to win a junior major crown and the youngest to win a junior championship since Coco Gauff at 2018 Roland Garros.

She's the quintessential global athlete, speaking Spanish, French, English and Russian -- all fluently -- as well as her native Catalan.

Here in New York, the 20-year-old has been a revelation. Jimenez Kasintseva won three qualifying matches against opponents from traditional tennis powers, including a pair of promising 17-year-olds. She was leading Joint -- a 19-year-old Australian already ranked among the Top 50 in the PIF WTA Rankings -- 5-1 in the second set of their first-round match, but fell 6-4, 7-6 (6).

Tjen, meanwhile, made it to Wednesday's second-round collision with Raducanu, a featured 11 a.m. match in Louis Armstrong Stadium.

After graduating from Pepperdine with a degree in sociology last May, she's gone from being unranked to No. 149 by finding success at the ITF level. She had a 27-match, 42-set winning streak earlier this year and has a total of 13 titles. Tjen has a pleasingly diverse game of slices and net play that reminds people of Ashleigh Barty.

After qualifying, to make some Indonesian history, followed by the upset of Kudermetova, the magnitude hadn't registered.

“I think I'm still not processing the emotion,” Tjen told reporters. “Yeah, I'm very happy being able to advance and got a little bit emotional there. Very happy.”

What does it mean to win for Indonesia?

“It means a lot,” Tjen said. “I feel proud to be able to do this for my country. Hopefully, by me making appearance here, will help, will inspire more tennis players, younger kids to play tennis and also believing that they can be here, too.”

Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up?

Cadillac opt for Perez and Bottas for inaugural 2026 season

After the summer break, F1 is back in action this weekend with lots to look forward to at the Dutch Grand Prix.

Three weeks on from the last race weekend in Budapest, it's race week again as the 2025 season gets set to resume. The teams have all had to commit to a two-week shutdown during August, but should be raring to go when the paddock reconvenes at Zandvoort.

The driver market is unusual this year, given the fact there are so many confirmed seats for 2026 already. That's a byproduct of the length of contracts that were already in place, but also a wider desire to have continuity in race seats from this year to next, in order to not have to integrate a new driver at the same time as a significant regulation change.

The unusual aspect is the fact there is a new team entering in 2026, and they have to put in place an entire new driver line-up.

Cadillac will be the 11th team on the grid next season, and have been linked with a long list of drivers. The majority of them include those with recent F1 experience, but there have also been rookies and IndyCar winners that have been mentioned in connection with the new entry.

Rumours that a decision is close have been gaining momentum during the summer break, and we could soon find out who the first pairing for Cadillac will be. Whoever they pick, it will be a simple case of expansion, with two new seats and therefore two extra drivers getting to race next year.

Fourteen races down, 10 to go. The summer break might often feel like the halfway point in the calendar, but in many senses it's a pause before the run-in. The final two European rounds are about to kick off, and after the double header of Zandvoort and Monza we will be heading into the final third of the season.

While no single Grand Prix pays more points than any other, the closer you get to the end of the season the more the pressure seems to ramp up, and each race feels that bit more important.

For the two McLaren drivers who are the clear favourites for the title this season, the summer break is likely to have been a welcome spell of time off before the resuming hostilities, even if the battle hasn't been particularly hostile so far.

Oscar Piastri arrives in Zandvoort with a nine-point advantage over team mate Lando Norris, but it was Norris who won last time out in Budapest and also delivered a very strong performance to dominate last year's Dutch Grand Prix, winning by over 20 seconds as Piastri ended up fourth.

But there has been another clear step forward from the Australian in his third season in F1, and there is often little to choose between the two McLaren drivers in terms of pace. Who comes out on top in the first race after the break is likely to be down to small details once again, and in such a close fight you never know how important any given weekend could end up proving.

Until that dominant win for Norris last season, Zandvoort had been the domain of Max Verstappen, who won the first three editions of the Dutch Grand Prix since it returned to the calendar in 2021.

Verstappen always enjoys huge support at his home race, with a sea of orange greeting him, along with a raucous atmosphere on the North Sea coast.

While those fans may have arrived with a sense of expectation in previous years, this time around it is likely to be more in hope, as Verstappen has not finished on the podium in the past four races this season. With just two wins to his name in 2025, he doesn't arrive as the favourite for once.

Yet there is still reason for Verstappen fans to be optimistic, with a Sprint win in Belgium breaking up that lack of a podium, and the Dutchman proving on multiple occasions that he can threaten at the front if the car is to his liking.

It will likely need something special in Qualifying to open up the possibility, but you can never rule the four-time World Champion out.

2025 has been a challenging year for Lewis Hamilton so far, with his move to Ferrari seeing him having to settle into a new environment for the first time in 12 years.

There have been obvious highs – including a Sprint victory in China – that hint at the potential of the partnership, and they appeared to be making some good progress ahead of the summer break as he was increasingly competitive compared to team mate Charles Leclerc.

But those gains didn't lead to firm results in the two races in Belgium and Hungary, and the latter saw Hamilton particularly downbeat after he dropped out in Q2 and was unable to score a point after he and the team gambled on a different strategy in an attempt to recover.

In many ways, the break could well have come at the perfect time, allowing Hamilton – who is often very hard on himself – to gain a bit of perspective on the performance potential he has shown. Still, after being so frustrated in Budapest, both he and Ferrari could do with a clean race at Zandvoort to start to build some positive momentum again before a big weekend at Monza.

Aside from the Cadillac driver line-up, the other team that have had a significant focus on their pairing this year have been Mercedes.

George Russell and Kimi Antonelli are yet to receive confirmation that their contracts will be extended – or at least that confirmation has not yet been made public – following a summer where discussions with Verstappen also made headlines.

Given the consistently high level that Russell has performed at this year, and the clear potential Antonelli has shown that he has, it would be a major surprise if there were any changes at this point, but until signatures are on contracts then there is always a slight chance of something unexpected happening.

Russell admitted in Hungary that it wasn't a particularly reassuring time having to wait for confirmation of his future, and if there is no announcement prior to the paddock arriving in Zandvoort then it could remain a significant talking point over the weekend.

Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up?

Cadillac opt for Perez and Bottas for inaugural 2026 season

Jonathan Wheatley has embarked on a new challenge with Kick Sauber this season, having previously acted as Sporting Director for Red Bull across many years.

Jonathan Wheatley has shared what he has been able to carry forward from his time with Red Bull through to his new role as Team Principal at Kick Sauber, with the Briton having “immersed” himself in the Hinwil-based outfit since joining back in April.

After starting his F1 career as a mechanic for Benetton back in 1991, Wheatley climbed the ranks within the squad over the years that followed – and through their subsequent guise as Renault in the early 2000s – before joining Red Bull in 2006.

Acting as Sporting Director, Wheatley worked for the championship-winning team until 2024, when it was confirmed that he would join Kick Sauber as their new Team Principal in April 2025 ahead of the outfit transitioning into Audi's works squad for the 2026 season.

When asked during a chat with Sky Sports F1 if he had taken anything from his extensive stint at Red Bull to his new position, Wheatley reflected on delivering a “cultural philosophy”.

“You have to absorb yourself in the team, you have to immerse yourself in it,” he explained.

“You have to listen to what everyone has got to say, you have to try and work out why decisions have been made, why processes are the way they are, and you can very rarely just move a complete procedure from one team across to another – it just doesn't work.

“But what you can bring is a philosophy, you can bring a cultural philosophy as well. There's low-hanging fruit, there's been some of that to be had.

“It's a very young team and I think people forget that. A lot of people here only started in January or February so we're knitting together the team.

“We're on a journey, we're very much in the early part of that journey and we have to understand that we're starting from a humble beginning. I'm excited about it – we're making steps, we're gaining momentum, and of course this business is all about momentum.”

Entering into the second half of the season, Kick Sauber are in seventh place of the Teams' Championship. Nico Hulkenberg is currently an impressive P9 in the Drivers' Standings on 37 points, while rookie team mate Gabriel Bortoleto sits in P17 on a tally of 14.

Why did Cadillac choose Bottas and Perez for their 2026 line-up?

Cadillac opt for Perez and Bottas for inaugural 2026 season

Cadillac have chosen the two drivers who will represent them in their debut F1 season, with experience winning over youth.

Cadillac's driver line-up has been the talk of the town for months, and while the incoming American squad have kept public chatter to a minimum, behind the scenes, they've gone through a painstakingly detailed process to select their first-ever race drivers.

Cadillac's initial shortlist for drivers was actually a very long list. There are believed to have been upwards of 15 racers on it early doors, though that did not include Daniel Ricciardo, according to sources, as the Australian wasn't looking for a return. Cadillac wanted to be thorough.

Some on that list were already on Team Principal Graeme Lowdon's mind, others were of interest to the F1 team and TWG CEO Dan Towriss and General Motors President Mark Reuss, while some were recommended by others.

It is believed that shortlist was trimmed to four pairings, some which featured two experienced drivers, some which featured a mix of youth and experience.

When Towriss and Reuss, in Towriss' words, ""pressure-tested"" those drivers, they came up with the final two – multiple race winners Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez, who have more than 100 podiums between them.

""We believe their experience, their leadership and their technical acumen are really what we need,"" Towriss told select media, including F1.com. ""It's the right combination, the right drivers at the right time.

""And we're humbled by their belief in us, in this project, and we couldn't be more excited to take this next step with them.

""There are a tonne of amazing drivers out there. There's a pool of young drivers that are exciting, very talented. So, this was a tough decision to work through this.

""Ultimately it was the experience and leadership of these two individuals that stood out among the rest as we made this decision to move forward.""

Cadillac are throwing everything at their new venture into Formula 1, creating bespoke facilities across three sites – Silverstone in the UK, Fishers in Indiana and Charlotte in North Carolina.

They are creating a new team from scratch, employing people every day – 52 people are starting with the company over the next 10 days alone. They are building everything from a design office to production facilities, simulator to a power unit facility that will yield their own engine by 2029.

It's a mammoth task, even for an automotive and motorsport giant such as General Motors – so they wanted to be pragmatic with their choice of drivers to give them the best shot of hitting the ground running.

""These two drivers are really important to us because this is sort of the experience that Dan mentioned, of podiums and wins between the two of them; it's something that we value greatly,"" said Reuss.

""I know firsthand developing new vehicles, and particularly in motorsports, the relationship of the driver to the technical team and the engineers, you can come out with all the tools in which we have invested heavily in between TWG and General Motors.

""So, we have the tools, we have the people coming on board to develop these vehicles and now we have the drivers that have had vast experience on the circuits of Formula 1.

""I think that's a really important part of this, and that feedback of the drivers that are experienced into the vehicle development itself is something that will be landmark in the history books here for Cadillac as it enters the big stage of Formula 1, which we've never done, obviously, and as a full works team.

""The commitment, the investment, the resources of people, and now the drivers is a really good, winning combination. So, we feel very good about what we're going to do here as we enter the grid in '26.""

In Bottas and Perez, they have two hugely experienced and talented drivers, who have amassed a staggering 500 Grands Prix between them.

Both have been on the sidelines this year, after losing their respective drives at the end of last season, but both were hungry to get back on the grid to prove they still have what it takes.

Though their final seasons with their respective teams were difficult – Perez finished seven places and 285 points behind Red Bull team mate and champion Max Verstappen, while Bottas failed to score at Sauber – Cadillac could see past that and did their research to understand why they struggled.

""We spent a lot of time looking at past experience and what the state of the world was at Sauber, and really how Valtteri performed with the car that's there and kind of Qualifying performance versus race performance,"" said Towriss.

""And then in particular, probably the more complicated scenario was Red Bull, right? That's been an interesting saga to watch, a team that's really built around one driver, but has two.

""Clearly none of the other drivers have fared well in that second seat from that standpoint, and so we did take a lot of time to talk to people at Red Bull and get information and feedback.

""The process was lengthy and thorough from that standpoint. I think what that means is having looked through all that, we feel very good about Checo [Perez], his desire to be in Formula 1, to make a statement, to show the performance that he has and kind of put that last season or so from Red Bull in the rear-view mirror.""

Bottas has been at every race, as Mercedes reserve, while Perez took some time out to be with his family before formulating his plan to find a way back onto the grid for the right project.

""When you look at Valtteri, he's at the track every weekend, right?"" added Towriss. ""And so it was important for us to kind of know where Sergio's at in terms of his desire to be back in Formula 1, and also his belief in our project in leading the Cadillac Formula 1 Team – and we couldn't have been more pleased with his response.

""In our meetings with him, he outperformed. If you would say we had questions, we had scepticism around some of these things and he answered all of our questions, passed our tests with flying colours.""

In going for experience, Cadillac opted against youth in the form of Zhou Guanyu, Felipe Drugovich, Mick Schumacher and Fred Vesti and the temptation to take on an American driver.

But while there won't be a home driver in one of their cockpits next year, it remains one of the team's ambitions to bring an American through in the future.

""It's important to us to make sure there's a pathway for an American driver into Formula 1 and we'll be working on that,"" said Towriss.

""But I think for this inaugural season, for what the team needs, and again, really what these drivers bring, this was the right combination for our team.""

The Forge has acquired North American rights to the drama that bowed at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


Kristen Stewart's directorial debut The Chronology of Water has been picked up for U.S. distribution with plans for an awards-qualifying December theatrical release.


	The Forge has acquired North American rights to the film based on Lidia Yuknavitch's memoir of the same name. An exact release date has yet to be announced. Still, according to today's announcement, the distributor plans to release the film theatrically in North America this December, followed by a wider release in early January.




	The film, which premiered in the Un Certain Regard section of this year's Cannes Film Festival, follows a once-hopeful Olympic swimmer as she loses her scholarship and battles addiction while discovering her own sexuality and love of literature. Stewart, The Hollywood Reporter's review reads, “appears to have found her voice, announcing the seriousness of her intentions not with auteurist self-importance but with unimpeachable commitment to honoring her subject's story.”

	WME Independent handled the deal on behalf of the filmmakers. Les Films du Losange is handling international sales and French distribution.


	Said Stewart in a statement, “After eight long years of gestation, I am overwhelmed by the privilege of having The Chronology of Water be released in theaters with the full support and ambition of like-minded artists like the partners we've found at The Forge. Films like ours should be birthed onto the screen and I am grateful we found a team as committed to supporting independent filmmakers as they are.”

The couple shared the news in an Instagram post showing off the pop star's new ring.

	Hannah Dailey



	It's a love story, baby just say yes. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged, as announced by the couple on Tuesday (Aug. 26).


	The pop superstar and Super Bowl-winning tight end revealed the news via a joint Instagram post, sharing a photo of Kelce down on one knee as Swift lovingly cradles his face. “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” they wittily wrote in the caption.


	The post also features photos of the couple embracing in a romantic garden of flowers, as well as a snap showing off Swift's gold engagement band with a massive diamond in the center. 


	The exciting update comes after about two years of dating, with Travis first professing his crush on Swift during a 2023 episode of his and brother Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast. At the time, he told fans about his disappointment that he'd been unable to slip the 14-time Grammy winner a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it at one of her Eras Tour shows in Kansas City that year.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Shortly after that episode was posted, Swift attended her first-ever Kansas City Chiefs game — and the rest is history. In the two years that followed, the musician would become a fixture at the tight end's home games at Arrowhead Stadium — where she often shares a box suite with his parents, Donna and Ed — and he would attend several of her concerts before the Eras trek wrapped in December 2024.




	These past few months have seen Swift and Travis put down even more roots as a couple, with the former attending the latter's Tight End University in June after spending time in Florida with him during the Chiefs' training camp. In July, the Happy Gilmore 2 actor shared several adorable photos of himself and his now-fiancée spending time with friends and Swift's brother, Austin.


	And in a full-circle moment earlier this month, Swift joined Travis on New Heights, where she shared her side of how she first fell in love with the football player (in addition to revealing details about her upcoming album The Life of a Showgirl).


	“It felt more like I was in an '80s John Hughes movie, and he was standing outside of my window with a boombox saying, ‘I want to date you! Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet! Do you want to date me?'” the hitmaker reflected on the podcast of Travis' bold first move. “I was like, ‘If this guy's not crazy, this is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager.'”

Justin Bieber is giving his thirstiest fans exactly what they want.


	As shared in a Monday (Aug. 25) post on Instagram, the pop star recently took a moment in the gym to snap a couple of shirtless selfies, flexing his muscles in the mirror and showing off his tattoo-covered arms and torso. Beyond a white beanie and gold chain around his neck, the only items he wears in the pictures are a pair of gym shorts and Calvin Klein boxers that show at the waistband.


	In his caption, Bieber wrote, “thirstrap fa u hoes.”

	











	The posts come amid an active social media streak for the Biebs, who's been sharing glimpses into his life surrounding the release of his new album, Swag. Featuring the hit “Daisies,” the LP debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Also on Instagram in recent days, Justin has posted praise for his wife, mogul Hailey Bieber — “Love this picture of you baby gurrllll,” he gushed on Monday (Aug. 25) of a photo from her Byrdie shoot — and shared snaps of his son, Jack Blues, who turned 1 earlier in August. (On the little boy's birthday, the Rhode founder wrote on her profile, “1 year of you my beautiful boy … you are joy personified.”)


	But for those who are specifically looking for more shirtless Bieber content, the singer also recently stripped down to his undies for a late-night swim in the music video for “First Place,” which arrived Aug. 13. “FORGIVE MY CHICKEN LEGS,” he joked of the visual when it dropped.

In this week's Legal Beat newsletter, a Purple Rain trademark battle, a last-minute deal for Missy Elliott, felony charges against Lil Nas X and much more.

	Bill Donahue



THE BIG STORY: The Prince estate is facing yet another legal battle – only this time not from his heirs, but from a co-star in his 1984 film Purple Rain.


	After the music legend died of a fentanyl overdose in 2016 without a written will, his affairs spent more than six years in probate court, as heirs, advisors and others battled over how the valuable estate would be managed in the future. Even after that case wrapped up, another battle erupted between allegedly “disgruntled” heirs and a pair of managers.

Lars Brandle 













	Now, the estate is facing a new fight over trademark law from the singer and actress Apollonia, a Prince protegee who rose to fame playing a character of the same name in Purple Rain and has since used the moniker for years in her own career.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In a lawsuit filed last week, Apollonia (Patty Kotero) said Prince himself never had an issue with her using the name, but that his estate is now trying to use legal means to “steal” the name “even though it has no legal right to do so.”


	For its part, the Prince estate said that it never meant to cause her any sorrow. In a post to social media, the estate responded that it had “never instructed her to cease using her adopted professional name” and merely wanted to “preserve Prince's assets and legacy” by cancelling Apollonia's own trademarks over a name that came from a Prince movie.


DEEP DIVE: After YNW Melly's double murder trial was postponed until January 2027 – roughly eight years from when he was first arrested – I dove deep into how we got here. Experts told me it was partly the unique factors of the case, including a mistrial and a long death penalty appeal, but that an eight-year wait for a verdict is less unusual than you might think: “Our system tolerates a great deal of punishment before trial and without trial.”


You're reading The Legal Beat, a weekly newsletter about music law from Billboard Pro, offering you a one-stop cheat sheet of big new cases, important rulings and all the fun stuff in between. To get the newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday, go subscribe here.


FELONY CHARGES – Lil Nas X was charged with four felonies over accusations that he attacked police officers and resisted arrest last week during a bizarre incident in which he was filmed wandering naked in Los Angeles. At an arraignment hearing, the “Old Town Road” rapper pleaded not guilty to three counts of battery with injury on a police officer and one count of resisting executive officer over the alleged incident – charges that could carry years in prison.


LAST-MINUTE DEAL – Missy Elliott reached a settlement to avoid a jury trial and end a long legal battle with Terry Williams, a music producer who claimed that he and Elliott collaborated on numerous songs in the 1990s but that she refused to credit him as a co-writer. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed in court docs, but Elliott's lawyer shared key details with Billboard.


SAMPLE SNAFU – Rauw Alejandro was hit with a lawsuit accusing him of sampling multiple tracks by reggaeton legend DJ Playero on his hit 2022 album Saturno without proper licenses. In a statement to Billboard, Alejandro said he “believed these songs were cleared properly by my previous label, but it seems the person who claimed the rights might not have actually controlled them.”


RADIO RATES – ASCAP and BMI both reached settlements with the Radio Music License Committee to resolve long-running lawsuits over the licensing rates paid by thousands of radio stations to songwriters and publishers. The details of BMI's deal, which it called a “historic” win for songwriters, were publicly filed in federal court; the terms of ASCAP's agreement were not revealed.


IDOL KILLINGS – Raymond Boodarian, the man accused of killing longtime American Idol music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband last month, appeared in court for his initial hearing on murder and burglary charges. But a Los Angeles judge suspended the prosecution after the accused killer was repeatedly unresponsive in court, instead ordering a mental health review to determine whether he's competent enough to face criminal charges.


DISMISSAL EXPLAINED – A federal judge issued a detailed ruling explaining why he sided with Sean “Diddy” Combs and dismissed a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by Making the Band 2 contestant Sara Rivers. The lengthy ruling said the case – claiming sexual harassment and groping during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show – was clearly filed years after the statutes of limitations had expired.


DIDDY THE DIRECTOR – Elsewhere in Diddy world, federal prosecutors urged a judge to reject the rapper's bid to overturn his criminal prostitution convictions ahead of sentencing, including his argument that “freak-offs” were just “amateur pornography” protected by free speech: “The defendant was anything but a producer of adult films entitled to First Amendment protection — rather, he was a voracious consumer of commercial sex.”


TYLER TRIAL DELAYED – A judge postponed a jury trial in a lawsuit accusing Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler of sexually assaulting a minor in the 1970s. Lawyers for plaintiff Julia Misley, who claims Tyler “groomed” and “manipulated” her as a teenager decades ago, sought the continuance over “unavoidable delays” in preparing for trial; Tyler's lawyers objected, saying he wanted his “day in court” rather than have the case “continue to drag on.”


MIAMI CLUB BULLIES? – Dance music company Insomniac Events filed a lawsuit against three Miami club operators that it claims are trying to “bully” their way into total control of two of the city's dance venues, including the city's famed Club Space and an upstart club called Factory Town.


YOUNG DOLPH ACQUITTAL – A man accused of organizing the hit that killed rapper Young Dolph in 2021 was found not guilty on first-degree murder and murder conspiracy charges over accusations that he hired two men to fatally shoot the rapper at a bakery in Memphis. One shooter was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison; the other is cooperating with prosecutors of a lenient punishment.


SUPERTRAMP DECISION – A federal appeals court ruled that former Supertramp lead singer Roger Hodgson needs to share royalties from the 1970s rock band's hit catalog with his fellow band members. “Plaintiffs ask that defendants continue to ‘Give A Little Bit,' the judge wrote. “Defendants believe that ‘From Now On,' they are no longer obligated to share royalties.”

	“I've been in love with The Wizard of Oz books since I was a child,” says Matthews. “The story reminds us of the qualities we need to get through hard times, and Dorothy is a symbol of strength who shows us that with a little kindness — and a lot of grit — we can not only achieve great things but also lift up those around us. I'm excited to bring that message to the world, now more than ever.”

	“We're really excited about all the possibilities this show brings, and I'm so grateful that Gina shared the idea with me and Lee,” said Shelton. “I knew right away it was something Gwen would connect with. Her creativity and perspective are such a natural fit for this project.”

	











	“It's a creative and modern take on a classic, and being part of something that blends music, emotion, and the character of Dorothy is inspiring to me,” said Stefani.


	Three-time Grammy winner and multiplatinum performing artist Stefani, who has also been a long-running coach on NBC's The Voice, is repped by WME, Blended Strategy Group and Hertz Lichtenstein Young & Polk, LLP. She was an EP on the animated series Kuu Kuu Harajuku.

					By Patrick Hipes 

Executive Managing Editor


Bleecker Street said Tuesday that it has acquired U.S. theatrical rights to Musk, the feature documentary about Elon Musk from Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney.


	The deal teams the distributor with HBO Documentary Films and Universal Pictures Content Group and will see Bleecker Street release the film ahead of its premiere on HBO Max.


	No release dates have been set yet for Musk, on which Gibney, who has tackled high-profile figures in his work like Julian Assange, Theranos' Elizabeth Holmes and Jack Abramoff, turns his focus to one of the world's most influential figures in a story that is evolving in real time.

	











	“No biographical portrait, outside of obvious political figures, has centered on an individual so at the crossroads of our society as Elon Musk,” Kent Sanderson, CEO of Bleecker Street, said in a statement. “But there is also no filmmaker that I could possibly imagine bringing that story to audiences with unmatched clarity, audacity, and urgency more than Alex Gibney.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Bleecker execs Tyler DiNapoli and Myles Bender previously worked with Gibney on 2013's Assange doc We Steal Secrets. Gibney's other credits include the Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room.


Musk is produced by Gibney, Jessie Deeter, and Erin Edeiken from Jigsaw Productions; Zhang Xin and Joey Marra from Closer Media; Nick Shumaker and Jessica Grimshaw from Anonymous Content; and Dana O'Keefe from Double Agent. Executive producers include New Regency's Yariv Milchan, and Natalie Lehmann; Richard Perello from Jigsaw; William Horberg from Closer Media; David Levine from Anonymous Content; as well as Sanderson and Miranda King for Bleecker Street.

	











	HBO Documentary Films previously pre-bought North American streaming and TV rights. Black Bear is handling international sales and made the overseas deal with UPCG.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Amazon faces yet another lawsuit over selling people movies they don't actually own","https://www.avclub.com/amazon-class-action-lawsuit-purchase-movies","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:26:00 GMT","

Who really “owns” a movie? Back in the days of physical media, the answer was clear. If you bought a VHS/DVD/Blu-ray, it was yours! But in the age of streaming, the rules are less clear. Amazon invites you to “buy” movies digitally on its website, but what the megacorp really sells are movie licenses, which can be revoked if Amazon loses the rights to the movie. This insidious little distinction has gotten Amazon into legal trouble before, and has once again, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which reports that a new class action lawsuit has been proposed against the company over the issue. 

Per the outlet, the proposed suit is bolstered by new California law that says a transaction can't be advertised as a “purchase” unless it offers unrestricted ownership of the product. That statute requires sellers to make it pretty clear to buyers that they're getting a limited license. The class action complaint argues that Amazon “does not meet the standards set by the statute for a clear and conspicuous notice that the thing they are purchasing is a revocable license to access the digital good.” Wright Noel, a lawyer for consumers looking to sue the company, states in the filing that “[the] warning is buried at the very bottom of the screen, in font that is considerably smaller than the other text on the screen.” 

Amazon has not yet commented on the proposed suit, which was filed in Washington federal court on Friday. However, when faced with a similar suit in 2020, the company countered that “These Terms of Use expressly state that purchasers obtain only a limited license to view video content and that purchased content may become unavailable due to provider license restriction or other reasons.” With this new Cali law in effect, we'll see if the ol' “Terms of Use” excuse flies in 2025.

Country star Jelly Roll wasted no time celebrating Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's engagement. Within an hour of the couple sharing their big news on Instagram, the first-ever artist-in-residence on “American Idol” reposted their announcement to his Stories and added a heartfelt congratulatory message.

In his Instagram post, Jelly Roll captioned the post saying, “Let's go TRAV AND TAYLOR! Congrats big dog!” He then tagged Kelce in the post before adding, “love looks good on you bubba.”

Is this a friendship between Jelly Roll and Kelce that no one knew about? Kelce and Jelly Roll's friendship has been growing for a while. Back in July, the singer made headlines when he praised Swift as “the GOAT.”

During an appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show,” Jelly Roll was talking about other music artists and mentioned Swift. He said, “Taylor! Four nights, five nights, in Indianapolis, dude. She is the GOAT!”

He added, “I will fist fight anybody who says otherwise. Travis, don't even worry, I got this one.”

Once the interview clip was shared online, Kelce could be found in the comments saying, “😂😂 my dawg is the realest!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻”

A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)

He isn't the only one excited about Kelce and Swift's engagement. The couple, who have been dating since 2023, officially announced their big news on social media on August 26, sharing a series of proposal photos that instantly captured the attention of fans worldwide.

The announcement sent waves across the internet, with social media lighting up as fans reacted with everything from squeals of excitement to heartfelt congratulations.

Swift captioned the joint post with, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨.”

While the couple decided to keep the comments off for the post, hundreds of fans have taken to other sites to share their excitement and reactions. They have also shared the big announcement, like Jelly Roll did.

While he was celebrating the big engagement news, he had his own news to celebrate. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Jelly Roll has been added to the list of performers for the upcoming VMAs.

Along with Jelly Roll, Doja Cat, Post Malone, Tate McRae, and Conan Gray were also added to the list. These music stars are joining a lineup that already includes Sabrina Carpenter, Alex Warren, and Sombr.

Now this is a funny idea for a remake of one of our bitterest, darkest satires about the pains of marriage: What if we spent some serious time in the salad days of our central relationship? Such is the somewhat bold conceit of Jay Roach's “The Roses,” a reimagining (and truly so) of Warren Adler's novel “The War of the Roses” and, to a lesser extent, Danny DeVito's incredibly funny 1989 hit film of the same name. On paper, this may sound silly and strange — isn't the joy of “The War of the Roses,” uh, the war? — but Roach and stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman find such fun in the happy days that it nearly distracts from what's inevitable.

Armed with a script from Tony McNamara (“The Favourite,” “Poor Things”), Roach's film opens far from those happy days, with Theo Rose (Cumberbatch) and Ivy Rose (Colman) going head to head at a couple's counseling session that is actually at its best when Ivy is calling her husband the c-word. Ah, British humor! But while their therapist is horrified by the tension and name-calling before her, going so far as to announce that the Roses are beyond repair, the two can't help but giggle about the whole thing.

 










Zipping us back in time, we soon see how this all began: with a meet-cute for the ages, but one that also hints at what might tear these two apart in the coming years. Theo is an architect bummed about the state of his work, forced to celebrate the completion of a soulless apartment building at a glitzy lunch with his coworkers. When he sneaks off for a break, he ends up in the kitchen, right in front of a smiley chef Ivy, busy prepping a salmon carpaccio and dealing with her own professional worries. What if, they wonder within mere seconds of meeting each other, they just ran off to America together?

If you're willing to take the plunge on that particular (and peculiar) plot movement, you'll likely vibe with what's to come. Ten years later, Theo and Ivy's American gamble has paid way off. Happily ensconced in California's Mendocino County (the film actually shot on location in Devon in the southwest of England, so while the film's locales look absolutely stunning, they sure as hell don't look like Northern California; this is no disrespect to fertile NorCal, but that place does not have cliffs like these), Theo's career is booming, their spunky twins seem happy, and Ivy has turned her attention to cooking for fun.

And yet, little cracks have begun to appear. Theo is still holding out hope to one day build the family's dream house, Ivy's life seems mostly relegated to being a wife and mother, and it sure seems as if the couple have, well, discordant ideas about parenting. McNamara weaves these bits in well, and Cumberbatch and Colman — so naturally giddy around each other — slowly start to, if not come apart, at least poke at each other. 

 










When Theo opts to spend their house money on a seafood restaurant for Ivy, it's the first step toward their undoing. And when Theo's latest project — a massive museum dedicated to sea-faring life and shaped like a ship — literally collapses during a particularly bad storm (an event that immediately goes viral), ending his own professional dreams, it's just another nail in the coffin. While Adler's book and DeVito's movie imagined Mrs. Rose as a rising catering star, Roach's film turns her into a massive culinary brand, with Ivy's success propelling her toward the very top of the food world heap. One day she's making Big Ben-shaped cookies at home, the next, she's jet-setting with David Chang.

This does not sit well with Theo. While previous incarnations of the story provided the Roses with a pair of nearly-grown children, McNamara's script ages the kiddos down (Hattie and Roy, played by Delaney Quinn and Ollie Robinson as ten-year-olds, with Hala Finley and Wells Rappaport taking over when they turn 13), providing a new dimension to Theo and Ivy's problems. As she's off setting up new restaurants — aided by longtime employees, played by Sunita Mani and Ncuti Gatwa, none of them bothered by the fact that the chain is called “We Got Crabs” — newly-minted stay-at-home dad Theo is busy remaking the kids in his image. That means lots of physical activity, fewer sugary desserts.

 










Such are the seemingly small disagreements that start to chip away at their marriage. And while much of this might sound deadly serious, Roach's film is frequently very funny. Moments in which the Roses are nitpicking at each other — a bit involving some ill-advised donuts is great — stand up to bigger comedic setpieces that bond them together, such as a trip to a local gun club with their loopy American pals (Andy Samberg, Kate McKinnon, Zoë Chao, and Jamie Demetriou). But while these sequences are smart and amusing, they also continually sand away the most bitter bits of the original story at the film's heart.

Or, again, where is the war?

Oh, it's coming, but while the genuinely horrifying and also extremely funny dinner party that arguably tips everything over the edge ranks among some of the best comedic work of Roach, Cumberbatch, and Colman's careers, what follows feels at odds with everything that's happened before. That McNamara has written a truly new spin on Adler's novel is genuinely refreshing, but the lighter tone and greater reliance on actual romance between its leads makes what's to come all the harder to swallow.

DeVito's film wasn't afraid to get dark, deep, and mean from the jump, but in the last act of Roach's film, the attacks that Theo and Ivy launch against each other surprise, and not always in entertaining ways. It may sound silly to wonder if this take on “The Wars of the Roses” is too cruel, but that's precisely how it feels. Too cruel, too pointed, and way too out-there, at least in the world that Roach and McNamara have previously knit together. It's all fun and games, until someone gets hurt.

 










Searchlight Pictures will release “The Roses” in theaters on Friday, August 29.

This year's Cannes — specifically the Un Certain Regard sidebar — was home to directorial debuts from three major actors, including Scarlett Johansson's “Eleanor the Great,” Harris Dickinson's “Urchin,” and Kristen Stewart‘s “The Chronology of Water.” And though Stewart has been a Cannes mainstay for nearly a decade, the film was well-reviewed, and Stewart's star power is as strong as ever, even movies with that pedigree manage to sit on the shelf. We've asked distributors time and again to look alive.

Today, someone did, and Stewart's “The Chronology of Water” has been acquired for North American distribution by The Forge, an upstart distributor that last year handled the release of Mexico's Oscar submission “Sujo,” as well as films like “Black Dog” and “The Balconettes.” Stewart's film is by far the distributor's highest profile release (terms of the deal were not disclosed), and it's planning to give the film a robust awards campaign with a release in theaters this December. It will open limited for a qualifying run and expand in January.

“The Chronology of Water” is Stewart's adaptation of a memoir by Lidia Yuknavitch, a competitive swimmer who dealt with an abusive childhood, sexual experimentation, toxic relationships, and addiction, all before finding her voice as a creative writer. Anchored by a powerfully honest performance by Imogen Poots, the film is framed much like a visual poem, absent identifying time stamps or title cards and told in “a constellation of scattered quotes and half-invented memories,” as IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich described it out of Cannes. He praised the film and particularly Stewart's direction for being innately comfortable and gifted behind the camera, writing that “some movies are shot. This one was directed.”  

 










“There isn't a single millisecond of this movie that doesn't bristle with the raw energy of an artist who's found the permission she needed to put her whole being into every frame, messy and shattered as that might be,” the review reads. “And it's largely for that reason why ‘The Chronology of Water' works even when it doesn't: Because, on an almost subatomic level, Stewart communes with the liquid spirit of a woman who only became whole by allowing herself to dissolve into the smallest essences of her being — over and over again until it seemed impossible she might ever regain a recognizable shape.”

Stewart had been developing “The Chronology of Water” for eight years before it finally found funding from Ridley Scott's Scott Free production banner, and Stewart announced she would be directing it way back in 2022 before it finally was ready for Cannes this summer. At the time she called it “fiercely, ragingly female,” and at Cannes this year, the process didn't deter her from going back to the well again, saying that not only will she direct again, she's got several projects in the works. 

“Oh, man, it felt so good. I'm dying,” Stewart told Anne Thompson. “It's going to be a lot easier this time. I've always said that as long as I can make another movie after my first one, that I don't need to be precious or clever about it at all. It just needs to feel pure. I've earned the right to try one more time. I never want to make the same movie twice. So whatever comes out next is going to not be anything like this. I can't fucking wait.”

 










Alongside Poots in the film are Jim Belushi, Thora Birch, Charlie Carrick, Susannah Flood, Kim Gordon, and Tom Sturridge. Producers on “The Chronology of Water” include Charles Gillibert (CG Cinema International); Yulia Zayceva, Max Poklov, and Svetlana Punte (Forma Pro Films); Michael Pruss, and Rebecca Feuer (Scott Free); Stewart, Maggie McLean, and Dylan Meyer (Nevermind Pictures); and Andy Mingo in association with Scott Aharoni, Alihan Yalcindag, and Sinan Eczacibasi for Curious Gremlin; Christian Vesper for Fremantle; Yan Vizinberg, Abigail Honor and Chris Cooper for Lorem Ipsum Entertainment; Mélanie Biessy for Scala Films.

“Kristen [Stewart] hasn't just directed a film, she's carved out a world with unmistakable vision: one that pulses with pain, desire, and defiance,” said Mark Mathias Sayre, CEO of The Forge, in an official statement. “'The Chronology of Water' is unlike anything we've ever released: visceral, expansive, and anchored by a performance from Imogen Poots that wrecks and rebuilds you. The film is a major achievement on every level, and we're honored to bring it to North American audiences.”

“After eight long years of gestation, I am overwhelmed by the privilege of having ‘The Chronology of Water' be released in theaters with the full support and ambition of like-minded artists like the partners we've found at The Forge,” Stewart added in her own statement. “Films like ours should be birthed onto the screen and I am grateful we found a team as committed to supporting independent filmmakers as they are.”

 










The North American deal was brokered by Mark Mathias Sayre (CEO), Steven Michael Swadling (Partner), and Decker Sadowski (Head of Acquisitions) on behalf of The Forge, and WME Independent on behalf of the filmmakers. Les Films du Losange is handling international sales and French distribution.

Apple Music is rolling out a new tool that allows you to import playlists from other streaming services. After beta-testing in Australia and New Zealand, the tool is now available in the United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, and Mexico. The tool, announced by Apple and spotted by MacRumors, is accessed through a new menu in Music settings called Transfer Music from Other Music Services. From there, you can sign in to another streamer and select items to import. Apple's Support page has more detailed instructions, as well as an alternative method via your web browser.

Coincidentally, Apple is implementing the tool as Spotify deals with an exodus of indie-rock artists. Hotline TNT are the latest to ditch the service, noting in a statement that the company's values do not align with the band's and that “a cooler world is possible.” They follow Godspeed You! Black Emperor, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Xiu Xiu, and Deerhoof, among others. While Spotify has long generated ill will for its unusually low royalty payouts and assorted other ethical concerns, the latest wave of departures was prompted by growing awareness of CEO Daniel Ek's venture capital fund Prima Materia. That company has heavily invested in the highly contentious defense company Helsing, which specializes in artificial intelligence–driven military technologies.

What if attraction were a practice? What if feeling drawn to somebody or something wasn't an experience that overtook you from the outside, but a skill you could develop and deepen within yourself? Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith's new album Gush throws these questions up for grabs. While the Los Angeles-based synthesist has long bent electricity into sound meant to course through and energize the body—she's made music explicitly intended for meditation and yoga practices, and several of her albums have offered sound as a tool for self-healing—she hasn't, until now, lingered long in compositions that might inspire a body to spring up and dance. Gush is her most social, libidinal, and active collection of songs to date, mixing her cerebral synthesis with beats inflected by two-step, dancehall, and ballroom. She's broken out of her head into the sweat of the throng.

A longtime yoga practitioner, contortionist, and acrobat, Smith also started taking vogueing lessons and attending balls while composing Gush. The collective narrativizing of ballroom—the way dancers can embody the social meaning of a given song—inspired her to think through the tension of feeling like a subject while being perceived as an object. “It was really helping me untangle my own identity as a queer, female bodied person, and feelings about objectification,” she said in a recent interview. “The vogue scene helped me get to a place where no matter what things get pushed or projected onto me, when people decide something about me, it no longer has the power to affect me.” She started making songs from a vivid sense of presence that flowed easily into the world around her, lighting up the valves where her interior ended and the exterior began.

Gush also, in part, attempts to transmit the specific experience of Smith's synesthesia: a neurological phenomenon where senses blend. While plenty of musicians have spoken about audiovisual synesthesia, where sound isn't just heard but also seen, Smith has a more distinctive variant of the condition. For her, sound becomes physical urge, a series of “distinct, visceral feelings,” she has said. Even speech can impart a similar sensation for her: “Someone could say a word and it'll create this whole feeling in me, like a bouncy ball just fell out of their mouth, and I have to go catch it.” Sound is not just sound: It's rubberized, kinetic, irresistible momentum, an impulse that snaps across the nerves.

If Smith's earlier albums tended to flush the sound field with twirling synthesized figures like so many kites in the sky, Gush turns up the gravity and clears out more negative space. Each sound bears more weight and locks more readily into prolonged grooves. On “Feel Heard,” a cresting treble loop sinks beneath adrenalized polyrhythms and looped vocal snippets, while tracks like “Urges” and “Both” build themselves up patiently as Smith folds her filtered voice into clattering and combusting beats. Most of her discography bends toward euphoria, but here, the bliss pours from the bones, not the brain. You don't have to think about what's happening before you melt into the flow.

Throughout the album, Smith's synthesizers model the pleasures of attraction, both to other people and to beloved objects. Sagging, detuned bass cradles her voice on “Drip” like a hammock that becomes indistinguishable from the body it holds. On the delicate “Everything Combining,” a delectably simple vocal melody shelters an increasingly complex ecosystem of percussion, while “Stare Into Me” trails synthetic horns and strings behind Smith's voice like long, scintillating ribbons. Rarely does any one element stay separate from its environment for long. Sounds emerge and shift, then dissolve back into their teeming surroundings.

You know when you're watching two skilled dancers and you start to lose track of who's who? Or of what's the dancers, what's the costumes, what's the light, what's the music, what's the set? The relationship of motion supersedes all its constituent parts. Gush chases after that emergent crash: Objects denature, blend together, and transform into a force that's somehow bigger than everything poured into it.

Bruce Willis‘ wife gave an update on the actor's health two years after he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, saying he is in “really great health overall.” 


	Emma Heming Willis sat down to speak with Diane Sawyer about Willis' condition as part of a new special, Emma & Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey, which airs tonight on ABC at 8 p.m. ET and streams tomorrow on Hulu and Disney+. In a preview for the special, Heming Willis said she and the rest of their family have had to learn new ways to communicate with the Willis “It's just his brain that is failing him.” 


	“Bruce is still very mobile. Bruce is in really great health overall, you know,” Heming Willis said. “It's just his brain that is failing him … The language is going, and you know, we've learned to adapt. And we have a way of communicating with him, which is just a different, a different way.”


	In 2022, Willis' family revealed he was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease aphasia, a language disorder that affects a person's ability to communicate. Heming Willis told Sawyer that before his diagnosis, she noticed “he was just a little more quiet” in social situations, when typically he was “talkative and very engaged.”

	











	“When the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,” she said. “He felt a little removed, very cold. Not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate. To go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.”

	











	Nearly a year after his aphasia diagnosis, he received a second diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. According to the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) organization, “The progression of symptoms — in behavior, language, and/or movement — varies by individual, but FTD brings an inevitable decline in functioning.”

	Now, two years after his diagnosis, Heming Willis said that they experience “moments” of Willis' bubblier side of his personality coming through. “I mean, we still get those days. Not days but moments,” she said. “It's his laugh, right? He has such a hearty laugh. And, you know, sometimes you'll see that twinkle in his eye or that spark, and, you know, I just get, like, transported. And it's just hard because, as quickly as those moments appear, then it goes.”


	Heming Willis' book about caregiving for Bruce, The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope, and Yourself on the Caregiving Path, arrives on Sept. 9.

	Since his exit from the White House and spectacular fallout with Donald Trump, Elon Musk has been posting a lot less about far-right politics and conspiracy theories. Instead, the world's richest man has seemingly turned at least some of his scattered attention back to his many businesses, including Tesla, SpaceX, and xAI. His newly founded “America Party,” meant to challenge both Democrats and Republicans, remains inactive. All this no doubt comes as a relief to board members at those companies who worried that Washington drama and Musk's exploits as the head of the so-called Department of Government Security put his tech empire at unnecessary risk. 


	But Musk's return to full-time brand promotion has not been without its questionable moments. He is particularly committed to pushing xAI's chatbot Grok as a superior alternative to rivals such as OpenAI‘s ChatGPT, despite the product being perhaps best known for briefly identifying itself as “MechaHitler” while it spouted Nazi views. On Monday, xAI even went so far as suing Apple and OpenAI, with a filing that accused the corporations of an anticompetitive scheme to suppress Grok in the App Store while favoring ChatGPT. (Apple and OpenAI have entered into a partnership that allows the computer and smartphone giant to integrate the bot into its products.) In the meantime, Musk has been left to make the case himself that Grok is a most advanced model available. He is prone to ambiguous, sweeping, impressive-sounding statements about the technology, claiming that the current version, Grok 4, may “discover new technologies” by the end of 2025 (there have been no reports of such) and is “the smartest AI in the world” (the data tells a different story). 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When he isn't hyping the bot in those terms, however, he mostly touts how users can leverage Grok to create moving images of attractive women, dictating elements of their appearance including skin, eye, and hair color, as well as what clothes they wear and what sort of environments they inhabit. In recent weeks, Musk has been especially eager to show off “Ani” on his X account. One of several “companions” that you can interact with through Grok, she is a scantily clad female anime character who can undress and is designed to respond to flirtatious conversation with increasingly intimate responses. Now, Musk also frequently reposts similarly sexualized cartoon characters generated with Grok's text-to-video feature, “Imagine.” It's gotten to the point where many have openly wondered if he fetishizes these virtual women.

	Over the weekend, for example, Musk reposted an animation made by one of his reply guys of an evidently topless woman whose face, neck, and shoulders are bejeweled by blinking stars and swirling galaxies. He shared an animation from another paid blue-check X user who explained he had prompted Grok to show him a “stunning Colombian woman” with a “golden tan” and “flawless smooth complexion” in a revealing tribal-style leather getup, standing next to a large robotic dinosaur. He also marveled at a sort of music video for Simple Minds' “Don't You (Forget About Me)” made with Grok, which featured a series of shots of a dark-haired, anime-like character in different skintight spacesuits (and one bathing suit). “Wow,” Musk wrote. “And this is just Grok Imagine beta v0.1! Not even Imagine version 1.”


	The billionaire's affinity for titillating cartoon characters has not gone unnoticed on X. The comments on that music video included one critic replying: “Don't post AI soft porn for at least one day challenge.” Others made jokes about Musk using Grok as a masturbation aid, expressed their disappointment in what a supposedly innovative genius was spending his time on, and predicted that such content would have a negative effect on society. “This is just more gooner slop,” complained one detractor. (“Gooning” is internet slang that describes exaggerated and excessively long sessions of self-pleasuring.)


	In other recent posts, Musk urged followers to try the sometimes-pornographic companion Ani. Last week, he announced that new skimpy outfits had been added to her wardrobe and commented “Nice” when a user modeled her in one. He evidently crossed a line, though, when he posted an animation of Ani dancing in her underwear; even his right-wing fans were disgusted, telling him it was “time to stop” and that Ani looked like a “13 year old in lingerie.” Musk, likely observing the severe backlash, deleted the offending post. Yet he continued to annoy his supporters by engaging with Ani. When he replied to a video of the character in a short skirt and a see-through top with a “good morning” message and an emoji of a smiling face encircled by hearts, a fed-up X user wrote, “BRO STOP GOONING TO AI ANIME AND TAKE US TO MARS.”

	Musk's infatuation with Ani and similar anime pin-ups has led some fans to seek his attention by catering to his tastes. A Tesla owner for instance, tagged him in a post where a cartoon woman in a bikini holds a sign inquiring about a future update to their car's automated driver assistance system. “Smart, Elon will definitely see this,” theorized a Tesla influencer who shared a different question about the Cybertruck, presented in the same bikini-babe-with-a-sign format. “Let's use this format for all questions to Elon going forward,” they suggested. Musk eventually did acknowledge one of these images with his favorite emoji — the laugh-crying face. He also directly answered a SpaceX enthusiast who last week shared a clip of Ani in lingerie carrying a sign that asked when he expected a technical update to the company's Starship rocket. “Sunday,” Musk replied. 

	











	Will his ongoing emphasis on Grok's erotic capabilities turn it into the leading chatbot of its time, or just endear it to a limited demographic of lonely, like-minded men while alienating much of the public? Maybe that's a question for AI. But in the absence of more impressive output, Musk is more or less stuck trying impress people with digital smut. Don't be surprised if it gets raunchier still from here.

Green Day are going all out for New Years Rev, the upcoming comedy film from Lee Kirk that follows three best friends who embark on a road trip to open for the band at a New Year's Eve concert, not realizing the opportunity was a prank. The movie is scheduled to premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on Sept. 12, but Green Day teased that “Toronto is just the beginning.”


New Years Rev stars Mason Thames, Kylr Coffman, and Ryan Foust as the Analog Dogs, the garage rockers who are under the impression that they've landed their dream gig. The band drew inspiration from the years Green Day spent living in a tour van, driving from show to show and sleeping in precarious places just for the thrill of playing music with their best friends. More than a dozen of the veteran band's songs appear in the movie.

A post shared by Green Day (@greenday)


	“Forcing their way to drop off a demo to their beloved idols in hopes of earning some recognition, they instead get an extremely rare opportunity — to open up for Green Day at their New Year's concert,” a synopsis for the film reads. “Or so they think. Unbeknownst to them, the opener gig is actually a prank played on them by one of their brothers. Nevertheless, naively optimistic, the young trio set off on the road from Kansas to California, with wide-eyed dreams of being on stage alongside their heroes.”

	Green Day produced the film alongside Tim Perell, Jolene, Stella Bulochnikov, Robin Rapino, Ryan Kroft, and Anna Keegan. Kirk helmed the screenplay in addition to directing. “It's packed with all of your favorite Green Day songs, loaded with mischief, and lots of familiar faces,” Green Day shared on Instagram, noting cast members McKenna Grace, Fred Armisen, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Bobby Lee, and more. “This film is our love letter to all of our favorite road trip movies, ‘90s nostalgia, and chasing it all no matter how ridiculous it gets.”

	











	In February, producers sent out a casting call for a scene that features a pop-up rock show. ​​​”Punks, emo, hardcore, alternative and rocker young adults, aged 18-30, are needed for the feature film NEW YEARS REV, featuring the band Green Day,” the call read. The opportunity promised to provide “live music, skateboarding, and a rowdy good time.”

Parkgoers Spot UFO Over Disney","https://www.wideopenspaces.com/has-the-most-magical-place-on-earth-gone-extraterrestrial-parkgoers-spot-ufo-over-disney/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 19:15:05 GMT","

It appears the most magical place on earth has gotten even more otherworldly. Recently, visitors at Disney World's Epcot saw more than just a fireworks show. Instead, parkgoers claim to have spotted a UFO hovering over the Disney theme park. However, others argue there is a much simpler explanation.

The NY Post shares details about the visitor who claims to have spotted the UFO over the Disney theme park. Morgan Huelsman, digital director of ""The Bobby Bones Show"", and her boyfriend were enjoying their time in the park. However as they were waiting for the nightly firework show Huelsman saw a ""sudden bright light overhead."" Given that they were waiting for a firework show, that may seem unsurprisingly; yet this display of light had nothing to do with Epcot's nightly entertainment. Rather than immediatley jumping to conclusions, Huelsman decided to put on her thinking hat.

She scanned the interent, thinking she may find some breaking news about drones or satellites in the nearby area. Although her intentions were well thought out, her search came up short. Therefore, she had no other choice but to believe that the bright light was non other than a UFO. She decided to share the video online, to gather the public's opnion on the mystery flying object. The video clearly depitcted a small, birght light overing over the Disney theme park. Although it appeared stationary for a short while during the video, eventaully it zoomed around and then blipped away.

Despite Huelsman being convinced she saw a UFO at the Disney theme park, the internet had other potential theories. One viewer shared that a rocket launch had taken place near Cape Canaveral earlier in the week. The NY Post shares that ""SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World."" Another individual argued that the light looke like a police helicopter more than a UFO.

This is not the first time someone has claimed to see a UFO in the Sunshine State. In fact, it comes only behind California for the most number of reported sightings. Its proximity to NASA launch sites definitley plays a role in this. So far, Disney is yet to comment on this unidentified flying object.

There are no fans on Earth quite like Supernatural fans. Their intense love and vigor for the Winchester brothers transcends normal fandoms. For 15 seasons and 327 episodes, fans loyally tuned in week after week until it officially ended in 2020. Five years later, fans still can't get enough. The actors behind the iconic characters—Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and more—still run and faithfully attend conventions, offering personal and interactive experiences with fans, answering endless questions, and posing for countless photos.

Currently, the ""SPN Family"" is making the rounds across the country on their The Road So Far...The Road Ahead tour, which kicked off in Austin. For those who don't know, the show deals with heavy religious themes, as half the plot swirled around God, the devil, angels, and more. Fittingly, during a panel, Ackles was asked what he would do if he were God for a day, and his answer was truly profound.

""This is my thought,"" he began. ""One God. One God. If that one God is the one God, okay, and I got to be him for a day, or her, I would come down and say, 'Hey, you all are on the same team. Act like it.' Because when you're on the same team, what do you do? You win. You support. You build each other up. You figure it out. You do everything that helps each other. And I feel like that is lost in this world. And I feel like if God could come down and say, 'Hey, listen, everyone here, by the way, you don't know this, but out there, you're screwed. You guys are a team. Act like it.' That's what I would do.""

Fans truly resonated with the message and were taken with the heartfelt speech Ackles shared... but that wasn't all they noticed.

While people were here for the heartfelt message, they were a little shocked to see Jensen without his post-series beard that he grew in for his role on The Boys.

Related: Jensen Ackles Makes Rare Comment About 'Supernatural' Fans

""Jensen hasn't aged a damn day underneath that beard,"" joked one fan.

The reason Ackles' beard is gone is he is currently filming for Vought Rising, which is a live-action TV series that is a 1950s prequel to The Boys on Amazon Prime. Ackles is reprising his role as a young Soldier Boy, hence why the scruffy beard is currently gone. The show is set to explore the origins of the classic ""Supes,"" the beginnings of Compound V, and the rise of the controversial company that serves as a basis for the plot.

The show just began production this August and is slated to come out in late 2026 or early 2027.

“The nice thing about running for 15 years is something that gets scrapped in Season 4 looks great in Season 11,” Andrew Dabb, who served as showrunner for Supernatural‘s final seasons, admitted.

When we spoke with him for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special issue to find out what the original series finale looked like (before the ending had to be changed due to COVID delays and protocols), we also asked about his thoughts on a revival (here) and what Wayward Sisters could have been (here). We also had to ask about any scrapped storylines from over the years.

“It would've been really nice to see Sam [Jared Padalecki] and Dean [Jensen Ackles] age into more mentorship roles,” Dabb said before sharing, “One story line we always talked about, which we never did was basically Sam and Dean go public. They're like, ‘Look, we're putting out a PSA. Monsters are real. If you see something, something shows up in your town, it's a monster. We can't be everywhere. We're just going to get the word out there.'”

They never went there because, according to the showrunner, “It would've kind of blown up the show in a very odd way. But that was always something I was like, ‘They probably should do that, you know what I mean? Just share some information, share it around.' But again, a little logistically difficult for the show.”

If they had done it, it would've been in a finale to set up the following season with, “Suddenly, Sam and Dean are known worldwide, which, again, I think sounds interesting in theory, but I actually think would've destroyed the show,” Dabb said. “It would not have been any good, which is one of the reasons we didn't do it.”

He also revealed that there had been talks about bringing back the Antichrist (Gattlin Griffith) “in a different way,” but that didn't pan out, nor did his hope to do more internationally. “This is a show about America and Americana. It doesn't really fit the show,” he explained. “We tried it with the British Men of Letters, maybe not our most successful if we're just being honest, but I would've liked to go even further.”

			What turned Dezi Freeman from a crank into a suspected murderer remains unknown. But the pandemic seems to have played a decisive role

Perhaps Desmond Filby – to use the name he was given at birth – always had a Mr Hyde lurking beneath the Jekyll-like persona he presented to the world.

If so, he hid it well, at least from most of the locals.

Those who remember him before he became Dezi Bird Freeman, the conspiracy theorist and alleged police killer, recall a reserved man who was unfailingly polite when he came into town to pick up his post.

With two children and a charming wife who taught music and worked shifts at the local supermarket, he seemed to fit neatly into small-town Australia: an unremarkable man living an unremarkable life amid the trout streams and mountains of Victoria's high country.

His alter-ego, however, was anything but. Desmond Filby the landscape photographer was the kind of man who helped his children with their prep and doted on his wife. Dezi Freeman the “sovereign citizen”, by contrast, was a paranoid conspiracy theorist who allegedly shot dead two police officers, wounded a third, and then, it is presumed, dragged his family into the bush as hostages.

When Mr Freeman became a crank, and what turned him from a crank into a suspected killer, remain unknown and perhaps always will. Yet, as in so many recent cases in Australia and beyond, the coronavirus pandemic seems to have played a decisive role in tipping him over the edge.

His conspiratorial streak predates Covid. In 2019, he tried to place a magistrate under citizen's arrest during a dispute over public access to a nearby national park, an act that suggested at least a passing flirtation with the “sovereign citizenship” ideology, which casts representatives of the state as enemies of the people.

But it was Covid that transformed him into a full-fledged adherent of a movement whose violent fringes are causing growing concern across the English-speaking world.

“He went from being just a pretty ordinary country bloke, a normal dude you'd see at the local footy club all the time, to quite a strange bloke,” the Sydney Morning Herald quoted a local as saying. “He fell down a bit of a rabbit hole and sort of disappeared and went off radar.”

It began, acquaintances say, with his refusal to wear face coverings in shops and a rejection of lockdowns and vaccinations. It culminated in 2021, when Mr Freeman took a leading role in an attempted private prosecution of Victoria's premier, Daniel Andrews, for treason.

Arrested outside the courthouse — where a magistrate later ruled that Mr Andrews' lockdown policies did not, in fact, amount to treason — Mr Freeman could be heard denouncing the police officers taking him away as “scumbags” and “criminal filth”.

Mr Freeman, who is 56, appears to have developed an abiding hatred of the police, with whom he had had repeated run-ins over a string of parking and driving offences. During a hearing last year to appeal the suspension of his driving licence, he told a court that “even the sight of a cop or a cop car [was] like an Auschwitz survivor seeing a Nazi soldier”.

Such outlandish language is common in sovereign citizen circles. Its adherents may not exactly see themselves as above the law, but they certainly believe they are exempt from it.

The movement, a particular phenomenon of developed English-speaking countries rooted in common law, rests on a misinterpretation of jurisprudence: the supposed right of individuals to declare themselves independent or “sovereign” of the state.

It is not new. It first gained traction in the United States in the Seventies and later in Canada under the “Freeman of the Land” movement, a name that may even have inspired Freeman's own.

Adherents, often drawn from far-Right or fundamentalist Christian backgrounds, have long resorted to violence. Terry Nichols, the co-conspirator in the Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people in 1995, was a self-confessed sovereign citizen.

The ideology's violent side has grown in Australia in recent years, however.

In 2022, three self-proclaimed sovereign citizens, Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train, ambushed and killed two police officers and a neighbour at their remote property near Wieambilla in Queensland before being shot dead themselves.

All three subscribed to extremist Christian beliefs that appeared to intensify over Covid, when Nathaniel and Stacey Train lost their jobs at a local school for refusing to be vaccinated.

As in Mr Freeman's case, there was little in Nathaniel Train's background to suggest he might turn killer. He was not just a teacher but the school's headmaster.

Like the Trains, Mr Freeman was expecting a visit from the police, in his case over a sexual abuse investigation for which he had already been questioned. So erratic had his behaviour become that his wife, now missing, confided her fears to a neighbour just days before the attack.

Whether it could have been prevented is a question for another day. What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that the sovereign citizen movement — as inchoate as it is — poses a growing threat to police officers and public servants in Australia and beyond, as Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, acknowledged after the shootings.

“This ideology of not seeing themselves being subject to our laws and our society… is of real concern,” he said. “This threat is very real and we need to be very vigilant about it.”

            A federal watchdog investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith's two prosecutions against President Donald Trump is based on “imaginary and unfounded” accusations, attorneys for Smith said in a letter obtained by CNN.



            The letter dated Monday from Smith's lawyers is the first time the former special counsel has responded to accusations leveled against his investigations into the president by conservative lawmakers and media outlets, including the current attorney general.
    


            Smith spearheaded the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump - one for allegedly mishandling classified documents and another for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were abandoned by Smith after Trump won reelection.
    


            “Mr. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper,” his attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski wrote.
    


The New York Times first reported the letter.
    


Trump's tortured history of legally targeting his foes



            The letter was addressed to Jamieson Greer, the head of the Office of the Special Counsel, an independent watchdog office that has no affiliation with the office Smith used to run. Trump appointed Greer to the role in an acting capacity after he fired the previous head of the office, who was appointed by President Joe Biden for a five-year term.
    


            Greer's office has launched an investigation into whether Smith improperly engaged in political activities through his prosecutions against Trump. The investigation was made public after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed that “Smith used his DOJ role to influence the election” in favor of Biden's and Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaigns.
    


            Smith's attorneys this week said that the investigation is “premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest.”
    


            “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,” it says.
    


            The Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.

‘Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,' Trump tells education secretary in cabinet meeting

Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in federal funding to the Ivy League university.

“Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in a cabinet meeting.

Trump's comments came amid reports that his administration and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end to their months-long battle over the government's allegations that Harvard has not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.

In April, Harvard became the first – and so far only – university to sue the Trump administration over the funding cuts. It sued again the following month over the government's efforts to block the school from enrolling international students.

The university has argued that the administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the university in retaliation for the school's refusal to comply with a series of demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force. Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions practices.

A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the Department of Justice last month.

The Department of Justice has argued that the federal government has the authority to cancel grants when institutions violate presidential directives, and have cited Trump's executive order purporting to combat antisemitism.

The New York Times and the Associated Press have both reported that Harvard and the White House had made substantial progress toward a deal. Under the proposed agreement, according to the Times, Harvard would pay $500m in exchange for the restoration of billions in frozen federal research funds. However, key terms reportedly remain unresolved, with negotiations still continuing.

The Harvard president, Alan Garber, has disputed the Times report, reportedly telling faculty that the article was inaccurate and alleged that the information had been leaked to the press by White House officials.

According to Harvard Crimson, the university's student newspaper, Garber said the university remains committed to resolving the matter through the courts and that academic freedom was nonnegotiable in any deal.

In July, it was also reported that Harvard agreed to comply with federal demands to turn over employment records for thousands of staff members.

Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have made unprecedented efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite universities over their handling of the pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, DEI programs and more.

Several other universities that have faced federal funding cuts – including Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have reached settlement agreements with the administration to restore research funding.

Columbia University agreed to pay more than $220m and implement a series of reforms to settle allegations that it was not doing enough to combat antisemitism. However, some education advocates decried that deal as a blow to academic freedom.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump seemingly caught his loyal conservative base off-guard and sparked backlash by saying he would allow 600,000 Chinese students into American universities.

That would be a departure for the Trump administration after it added new vetting for student visas, moved to block foreign enrollment at Harvard and expanded the grounds for terminating international students' ability to study in the United States. 

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has singled out China, the second highest source of international students in the U.S., saying in May that the State Department would revoke visas for students tied to the Chinese Communist Party and boost vetting of new applicants.

Trump's announcement Monday adds to the confusion about the administration's restrictive visa policies and its approach to China as the superpowers tussle over trade and intensifying tech competition. It also marks another divide with figures in Trump's “Make America Great Again” base, who tout an “America First” agenda and had contested the U.S. inserting itself in the recent Israel-Iran war. 

Some of Trump's most ardent supporters — from U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to former adviser Steve Bannon and far-right activist Laura Loomer — rejected the idea of welcoming more Chinese students.

It's not immediately clear why the figure Trump cited was so high — more than twice the number of Chinese students enrolled in the 2023-2024 school year. The total also has been falling in the past few years. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Here's what to know about Trump's announcement and the reaction:




During a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump was asked by reporters if he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

“President Xi would like me to come to China. It's a very important relationship. As you know, we are taking a lot of money in from China because of the tariffs and different things,” he said. “I hear so many stories about ‘We are not going to allow their students,' but we are going to allow their students to come in. We are going to allow it. It's very important — 600,000 students.”

Trump doubled down at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, sitting next to Rubio, where he said he was “honored” to have Chinese students in the U.S. and said they help colleges stay afloat.

“I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here,” Trump said. “Now, with that, we check and we're careful, we see who is there.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry also said that Trump told Xi in a June phone call that “the U.S. loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.”

It was a shift after the State Department announced in late May that it would “aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections with the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.”

After decades of growth, the number of Chinese students in the U.S. peaked at 372,532 in the 2019-2020 academic year, just as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. The number slipped to 289,526 in 2022 and further dipped to 277,398 in 2023. 

In the past year, several U.S. universities, including the University of Michigan, have ended their joint partnerships with Chinese universities after Republicans raised concerns that U.S. dollars have contributed to China's tech advancement and military modernization.

Experts say the number of students is likely to fall further because of tense U.S.-China relations and China's declining population.

There's growing bipartisan consensus that U.S. schools should not help train Beijing's top talent in critical fields such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and aerospace technology.

Kurt Campbell, deputy secretary of state in the Biden administration, has said he would like to see Chinese students coming to the U.S. to study humanities and social sciences, “not particle physics.”

During his first term, Trump banned Chinese graduate students who had attended schools with Chinese military ties.

Bannon, one of Trump's former advisers, criticized the announcement Tuesday, saying “there should be no foreign students here for the moment.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was asked Monday on Fox News' “The Ingraham Angle” how such a shift would be consistent with Trump's “America First” push. Lutnick argued that Trump was taking a “rational economic view” and asserted that 15% of American universities and colleges would go out of business without those foreign students.

“I just don't understand it for the life of me. Those are 600,000 spots that American kids won't get,” host Laura Ingraham said. 

At Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Trump said international students are helping keep some U.S. schools afloat.

“And you know what would happen if they didn't (come)? Our college system would go to hell very quickly and it wouldn't be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle on the bottom,” Trump said.

An analysis by NAFSA, an association of international educators, found that international students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 378,175 jobs during the 2023-2024 academic year.

Greene, the Republican congresswoman from Georgia, raised questions. 

“If refusing to allow these Chinese students to attend our schools causes 15% of them to fail then these schools should fail anyways because they are being propped up by the CCP,” Greene said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. 

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. The foreign ministry has called out the U.S. for what it says is “discriminatory, politically driven and selective law enforcement” against Chinese students arriving in the U.S.

Mao Ning, a ministry spokesperson, said Friday that students have been treated unfairly and subjected to extended interrogations. Mao said some students had their visas revoked and were banned from entering the country after they were told they “might endanger national security.”

“The U.S.'s moves severely violate the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese nationals, impede the flow of people between the two countries and dampen China-U.S. people-to-people exchanges,” she said.

The embassy issued an advisory Monday urging Chinese students not to enter the U.S. through Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, alleging several students were harassed and interrogated by customs officials. The embassy said at least one student was detained for more than 80 hours before being sent back to China.

WASHINGTON (AP) — JB Pritzker took a water taxi along the Chicago Riverwalk, past one of Donald Trump's famous downtown towers. The gleaming and heavily trafficked tourist district was a deliberate backdrop on the day the Illinois governor directed a defiant message toward the White House: “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here.”

The governor's protests, however, may not matter. After Trump's National Guard deployments to Los Angeles in June and Washington, D.C. this month, the Republican says his next targets for federal intervention may be two of the nation's most Democratic cities: Chicago and Baltimore.

Trump's possible move — targeting states whose governors are among potential White House contenders in 2028 — would be another escalation of presidential power, directly challenging the rights of states and cities to govern themselves. It also would intensify a partisan scramble for voters' trust on matters of public safety.

For Trump, militarizing U.S. streets is the latest tactic to support his “law and order” branding and mass deportation agenda. It's a way to cast Democratic leaders in affected locales as weak and ineffective, even as Trump exaggerates the violence he's ostensibly trying to stop. Pritzker “should be calling me, and he should be saying ‘Can you send over the troops please?'” Trump said Tuesday at the White House. “It's out of control.”

Democrats see a dangerous overreach by an aspiring authoritarian and have said they will challenge Trump in court if necessary. They also see in the political fight a way to persuade voters, especially moderates and independents, that Republicans bluster on crime while Democrats are better able to protect citizens and keep the peace. 




“This is not about fighting crime,” said Pritzker, flanked on Monday by Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and other leaders, adding that it's more about “an arrogant little man” trying to “intimidate his political rivals.”

Yet there are risks for Democrats. Though violent crime is down across the country, including Chicago, arguing over how to combat what's still happening means tussling on some of Trump's most comfortable political turf. Additionally, Trump has demonstrated a willingness to block federal money for locales where elected officials have opposed him.

Pritzker, who is seeking a third term in 2026, has been among Democrats ' most vocal Trump critics. Weeks into Trump's second administration, Pritzker compared it to the Nazi Third Reich. More recently, he welcomed Texas Democrats who fled the statehouse in Austin to delay Republicans' partisan redrawing of the state's congressional districts at Trump's request.

In Chicago on Monday, Pritzker and Johnson emphasized that Trump's administration had not reached out about its plans, first detailed in a weekend Washington Post story. The president acknowledged he hadn't talked to Illinois or Maryland officials and at one point Monday said he might not send troops unless Pritzker asked.

Pritzker's aides said his priority is to keep a federal deployment from happening. That's why Pritzker and his staff hustled to gather a cross-section of political, civic and faith leadership in a made-for-TV show of unity that Trump would surely see. Of course, it also trained cameras on Pritzker.

“I know he doesn't read ... but I know he watches television,” he said of Trump. “And so perhaps if somebody from Fox News or from Newsmax is here, they'll cover the fact that Chicago is in much better shape” because of what local officials are doing. 

In a bit of Trumpian bravado, he added, “If you hurt my people, nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.”

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, another potential Democratic contender in 2028, said Trump's characterizations of Baltimore and other cities reflect a president “living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes.”

Nonetheless, voters have been siding with Republicans on the issue.

A CNN/SSRS poll from May found that about four in ten Americans said the GOP's views on crime and policing aligned more with their own, compared to just three in ten who felt the same about Democrats. The rest said neither party reflected their views.

Trump also had an advantage on the issue over Democrat Kamala Harris in their 2024 general election matchup. According to AP VoteCast, a national survey of presidential voters, about half of respondents said Trump was better able to handle crime, while about 4 in 10 said this about Harris.

Democrats acknowledged the gap this week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times the amount of money on crime-related ads than Democrats did in recent presidential election years. 

But they said there is an opening. They urged Democrats not to mimic Republican “tough-on-crime” rhetoric but instead position themselves as being “serious about safety, not empty scare tactics.”

Pritzker aides agreed Democrats have a chance to emphasize public safety policy choices.

A litany of speakers in Chicago cited drops – some of them considerable -- in violent crime and property crimes in the city. They also highlighted the hundreds of millions of dollars in Trump administration cuts in federal support for law enforcement, housing and other programs that Johnson called “proven solutions to crime and violence reduction.”

“We cannot incarcerate our way out of violence,” the mayor said.

The debate also raises questions about where Trump has not called for federal intervention.

Trump, as a candidate, regularly assailed U.S. cities – not just Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Washington. Detroit was “decimated” and “filthy.” Atlanta was a “killing field.” Pritzker noted that Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, have notably higher murder rates than Chicago.

But Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia all have Republican governors. Michigan, meanwhile, is home to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, but one who has deviated from her colleagues like Pritzker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom by engaging more directly with Trump, including in-person visits to the White House. 

And even one leading Republican executive, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, added tacit support to Democrats' critiques. 

“Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,” he said in a statement, without mentioning Trump by name. “America's mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results. Local control is always best.”

President Donald Trump doubled down Tuesday, saying he is ""always"" ready for a legal fight after Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook signaled she would pursue legal action over her ouster.

In the wake of the unprecedented removal of a Federal Reserve governor, President Donald Trump doubled down on his decision Tuesday, saying he is ""always"" ready for a legal fight after the ousted governor, Lisa Cook, signaled she would pursue legal action.

""She seems to have had an infraction and she can't have an infraction. And especially that infraction because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages. We need people that are 100% above board, and it doesn't seem like she was,"" Trump said, referencing Cook's alleged misconduct in securing mortgage loans.

TRUMP REMOVES FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK FROM OFFICE, CITING FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

The Federal Reserve acknowledged Cook's potential legal action and said in a statement that the U.S. central bank will ""abide by any court decision.""

""Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" a Federal Reserve spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, commonly known as the Fed Board, is composed of seven members, or governors, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. 

A LOOK AT THE UNFOLDING BATTLE BETWEEN TRUMP AND POWELL OVER FED POLICY

Cook's potential removal from the Fed Board leaves a seat open on the panel that guides the nation's monetary policy. This gives Trump another opportunity to name someone closely aligned with his financial policy to the Fed.

When asked about replacing Cook on the Fed Board, Trump told reporters at the White House that he has some ""very good people for that position.""

Trump accused Cook — who was appointed by former President Joe Biden in 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors — of mortgage fraud on Monday evening. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.

The allegations stem from Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to an agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte accused Cook of claiming two primary residences, one in Ann Arbor and another in Atlanta in 2021, with the goal of getting better mortgage terms.

'SOME AUTHORITARIAN S***:' DEMS RIP TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED FIRING OF FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK

On Aug. 15, Pulte sent the Justice Department a criminal referral regarding Cook in which he accused her of falsifying bank documents and property records.

As it stands, Trump says Cook is fired, effective immediately. But Cook and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argue that he has no legal authority to remove her. Her term on the Fed Board runs until January 2038.

""President Trump has taken to social media to once again ‘fire by tweet' and once again his reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority,"" Lowell said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital.

""We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action,"" Lowell added.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explains the rationale for President Donald Trump's deal with Intel and a 'very important' part of his deal with China on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

President Donald Trump's plan to allow 600,000 Chinese student visas to be issued sparked backlash from the right on Monday and Tuesday.

""I hear so many stories that we're not going to allow their students,"" Trump told reporters as trade talks with China are ongoing.

""We're going to allow their students to come in. It's very important, 600,000 students. It's very important. But we're going to get along with China,"" he continued.

Trump expanded on his comments during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday.

""I think it's very insulting to say students can't come here because they'll go out and start building schools and they'll be able to survive it. But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries' students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn't? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. And it wouldn't be the top colleges, so it'd be colleges that struggle on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system,"" Trump said.

""I like having, and I told this to President Xi that we're honored to have their students here. Now, with that, we check in with careful and we see who's there,"" he added.

Some immigration groups and conservative voices on social media voiced their opposition to the proposal.

""We should not let in 600,000 CHINESE students to attend American colleges and universities that may be loyal to the CCP,"" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., posted on X late Monday night. ""If refusing to allow these Chinese students to attend our schools causes 15% of them to fail then these schools should fail anyways because they are being propped up by the CCP.""

""Granting 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals threatens to put foreign students ahead of U.S. graduates,"" Joe Chatham, director of government relations at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""The focus now must be on reforms to limit access to sectors crucial to our economy and national security that have repeatedly been the target of corporate espionage and intellectual property theft—not expanding access to hostile countries. Educating foreign nationals should never be put before the interests of U.S. citizens and ensuring that our nation thrives,"" he continued.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick delved further into the Trump administration's view on the matter when pressed on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""The president's point of view is that what would happen if you didn't have those 600K students is that you'd empty them from the top, all the students would go up to better schools, and the bottom 15% of universities and colleges would go out of business in America.""

""He's taking a rational economic view, which is classic Donald Trump,"" Lutnick added.

Many suggested that the free market should come into play with these colleges that could be at a potential financial risk.

""Let them go under, then! What is this madness? NO. WE DON'T WANT MORE CHINESE STUDENTS. We actually don't want any,"" conservative commentator Kira Davis wrote.

""15% going under isn't a bad thing,"" writer Ryan Girdusky posted to X.

""Trump's team is not capable of defending his Chinese student visa program,"" conservative lawyer Marina Medvin posted on X. ""That's because they don't actually want it either. It's hard to sell something you don't like.""

""So this is essentially a subsidy for academia. Got it. American universities shouldn't need an influx of foreign students in order to stay afloat. If they can't survive on American enrollment, then let them go under. Plus, Chinese students steal our research and send it home,"" Josh Peterson, a full stack developer and investigative journalist, posted.

Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler unleashed on the Trump White House, saying these Chinese students should be banned.

""Chinese 'students' are all spies for the Chinese Communist Party. They're forced to be. They steal our intellectual property. They steal our tech. They steal our intel. They cozy up to our military,"" Wheeler posted on X. ""Trump should ban all Chinese students from U.S. universities. Deport them all.""

""This is the dumbest explanation I've heard. By all means, put colleges & universities out of business!"" Wheeler said in response to Lutnick's defense of Trump's policy. ""Their business is indoctrinating students into hardened revolutionary Marxists. If you want to save America, you'll have to raze the university system. Perfect chance to start.""

Others agreed with Lutnick's perspective on the issue, saying that it could actually help the United States bring in more talent domestically. 

""This is not as horrible as people are making it out to be. Chinese students on U.S. visas aren't average kids. They represent the top tier of China's youth,"" podcast host Joshua Reid posted to X.

""On the other side, we are hosting China's future leaders, scientists, and innovators. Which also means that American culture returns home with them. When you start to think about emergent tech, this is actually a great idea. Bring the top level students over the US. This is talent that is pulled away from China and now becomes a national asset,"" Reid added.

A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a Pennsylvania requirement for mail-in ballots with missing or incorrect dates to be tossed out is unconstitutional, upholding a lower district court ruling.

A panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld a March ruling from a federal district court in Pennsylvania that found the requirement did “not pass constitutional muster” in a lawsuit filed around the 2022 election. The Republican National Committee had appealed the lower court ruling, but a panel of three judges appointed by former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush rejected the appeal.

“We must determine if the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's requirement that mail-in ballots that arrive in undated or misdated return envelopes be discarded complies with our Constitution,” the opinion written by Judge D. Brooks Smith said. 

“Weighing the burden that practice imposes on Pennsylvanians' constitutional right to vote against the State's interest in the practice, the balance of the scales leads us to hold that it does not comply with our Constitution,” added the opinion by the Bush-appointed judge.

The lawsuit, which was brought in Nov. 2022 by a group of Pennsylvania voters, now-Sen. John Fetterman's (D-PA) campaign, along with the Democratic Party's House and Senate campaign wings, argued the state's date requirement for mail-in ballots violated the Civil Rights Act along with the First and 14th Amendments.

“The date on a mail ballot envelope thus has no bearing on a voter's qualifications and serves no purpose other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote,” the Democrat-led lawsuit alleged.

The RNC could appeal the panel's decision to the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit or appeal to the Supreme Court.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'KPop Demon Hunters' has become Netflix's 'Frozen' — and its biggest movie of all time","https://www.businessinsider.com/kpop-demon-hunters-netflix-disney-franchise-frozen-star-wars-animation-2025-8","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

""KPop Demon Hunters"" just made history, and it could make Netflix money for a long time to come.

The K-pop-infused movie is off to a better start than any other film in Netflix's history, the company said Tuesday. ""KPop Demon Hunters"" has generated 236 million views since its debut, more than any other Netflix movie in its first 91 days — and it achieved that feat in 65 days.

Netflix's animated smash-hit has shown remarkable staying power on the streamer's global charts, thanks to social media buzz and a viral soundtrack that's second on Billboard's Global 200 rankings. Its songs were so popular that Netflix brought a sing-along version to big screens last weekend, where it topped the box office with an $18 million haul in the US and Canada.

Netflix has already struck gold with ""KPop Demon Hunters,"" but it may have found a gold mine.

If the streaming giant can leverage ""KPop Demon Hunters"" to build its own global franchise, Hollywood powerhouses like Disney should take notice.

""Netflix has always wanted to beat Disney — now it has the chance to try and prove it can match the Mouse House's franchise development,"" said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics.

Unlike Disney, Netflix doesn't have nearly a century of celebrated IP to lean on. Instead of using nostalgia in reboots and live-action remakes, it has to build its franchises from the ground up.

While Netflix has not created many movies or shows that will inspire generations of fandom, ""KPop Demon Hunters"" could be a notable exception.

""'KPop Demon Hunters' is Netflix's 'Frozen' — I see a lot of parallels,"" a Netflix employee who'd previously spent close to a decade at Disney told Business Insider.

Movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore chose a different Disney property as a parallel: ""Maybe for young people today, this is like their equivalent of Star Wars.""

Media companies from Netflix to Paramount are looking for their next signature franchise that leads to sequels and sparks merchandise sales or theme park visits, Dergarabedian said. A sleeper hit like ""KPop Demon Hunters"" is what film execs pray for.

""The entertainment industry loves nothing more than a surprise breakout hit,"" Dergarabedian said.

Netflix's first big challenge — creating a certified blockbuster — is complete, but its work is far from over.

Turning a hit movie like ""KPop Demon Hunters"" into a full-blown franchise ""requires carefully calculated quality IP cultivation,"" Katz said. That means giving fans much of what they want, from sing-along events in theaters to sequels to merchandise, without overloading them.

Disney learned this the hard way with Marvel. It followed several billion-dollar blockbusters with a deluge of Marvel shows on Disney+, and the ensuing superhero fatigue has proven difficult to shake.

""Quantity trumped quality,"" Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige told Variety in June regarding Marvel's old more-is-more approach.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will soon have a ""majority"" of his own nominees on the Federal Reserve board of governors who will back his desire to slash interest rates.

Trump's comment at a Cabinet meeting came hours after he took the unprecedented step of moving to fire central bank Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, from the board.

Trump has already appointed two of the Fed board's seven governors, and he is poised to pick another to replace Adriana Kugler, who announced her retirement earlier this summer.

Trump has selected Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisors, to serve out the rest of Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31, 2026.

""We'll have a majority very shortly,"" Trump said Tuesday afternoon. ""So that'll be great."" 

""Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great,"" he said. ""People are paying too high an interest rate. That's the only problem with us. We have to get the rates down a little bit.""

The president had been asked who he was considering as a replacement for Cook.

""Well, we have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we're down to,"" he said. ""I think I maybe, in my own mind, have somebody that I like.""

He also once again hurled criticism Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has repeatedly rebuffed Trump's demands that he lower benchmark rates by multiple percentage points.

""Because of him and his high interest rates, the housing is less than it could be,"" Trump said of Powell. ""We're going to get that straightened out very quickly.""

Trump said in a letter issued Monday night that he was firing Cook over an investigation launched by his Department of Justice into allegations about her mortgages.

Cook will file a lawsuit to block her ouster, her attorney said Tuesday morning.

In a statement issued while Trump's Cabinet meeting was ongoing, the Fed said that Cook has indicated that she will ask the courts to ""confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities"" as a governor.

The central bank said it will ""abide by any court decision.""

The statement also noted, ""Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people.""

When a reporter asked Trump about that statement during the meeting, he said, ""I'd abide by the court.""

Around the same time, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump ""exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause.""

The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said it would abide by any court decision on whether President Donald Trump has the legal authority to fire Board of Governors member Lisa Cook.

The Fed, in a statement from a spokesperson, noted that ""Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.""

The statement was the Fed's first response to Trump's announcement on Monday night that he was removing Cook as Fed governor because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.

The spokesperson did not explicitly criticize Trump for trying to remove Cook.

But the statement pointedly noted that ""Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' ""

""Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,"" the statement said.

Trump separately told reporters on Tuesday that he would abide by any court decision on Cook's fate at the Fed.

""I abide by the court, yeah, I abide by the court,"" he said, while also predicting that the Fed's board would soon be comprised by a majority of his appointees after he selects Cook's replacement.

If Trump gains a majority of appointees, he might have better success at getting the Fed to lower interest rates sharply, as he has repeatedly demanded.

Any federal court challenge by Cook to her termination is likely to end with the Supreme Court issuing the final word on the dispute.

In the statement Tuesday, the Fed spokesperson said, ""The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates — including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system.""

""The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law,"" the spokesperson said.

""As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision,"" they said.

""The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses.""

Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Tuesday that Trump ""has no authority to remove"" Cook.

""His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis,"" Lowell said. ""We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.""

Cook said Monday night that she would keep working at the Fed despite Trump's claim he had the power to remove her.

The Fed did not respond to CNBC's query about whether Cook was working Tuesday at the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., or remotely.

White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement, said, ""The President exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause under 12 U.S.C. 242.""

""The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,"" Desai said.

The U.S. Commerce Department will start releasing statistics and data on blockchain, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The US Government had proposed the idea earlier this year, and Lutnick says that the Commerce Department will begin this initiative soon.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 US Government to begin publishing economic data on blockchain.

“The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain,” Lutnick said to the press on Tuesday. “You wanted the crypto President, and we are going to put our GDP on the blockchain so people can use the Blockchain for data and distribution.” He added that this feature will be granted to all members of the government. “We're just ironing out all of the details so we could do it.”

This new push for government efficiency uses blockchain transparency to improve how money gets spent and where the spending could be viewed. A January 2025 executive order from the Trump administration directed federal agencies to support digital asset innovation and a more favorable regulatory framework. Additionally, the blockchain publishing US government data concept also came from Elon Musk's D.O.G.E department, where he had a group of 100 people working on publishing spending on a blockchain for the public to see, although the project was never finished. Now, the U.S. Commerce Department appears to be continuing the project.

Several US departments have already begun working on publishing data on blockchain, including the Treasury and the Fiscal Service, and the Department of Defense, to track spending and parts. Commerce Secretary Lutnick didn't provide a timeline on when the blockchain data would be published and fully available.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Anthropic Settles High-Profile AI Copyright Lawsuit Brought by Book Authors","https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-settles-copyright-lawsuit-authors/","Tue, 26 Aug 2025 19:31:59 GMT","

Anthropic has reached a preliminary settlement in a class action lawsuit brought by a group of prominent authors, marking a major turn in of the most significant ongoing AI copyright lawsuits in history. The move will allow Anthropic to avoid what could have been a financially devastating outcome in court.

The settlement agreement is expected to be finalized September 3, with more details to follow, according to a legal filing published on Tuesday. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Anthropic declined to comment.

In 2024, three book writers, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, sued Anthropic, alleging that the startup illegally used their work to train its artificial intelligence models. In June, California district court judge William Alsup issued a summary judgment in Bartz v. Anthropic that largely sided with Anthropic, finding that the company's usage of the books was “fair use” and thus legal.

But the judge ruled that the manner in which Anthropic had acquired some of the works, by downloading them through so-called shadow libraries, including a notorious site called LibGen, constituted piracy. Alsup ruled that the book authors could still take Anthropic to trial in a class action for pirating their works; the legal showdown was slated to begin in December.

Statutory damages for this kind of piracy start at $750 per infringed work, according to US copyright law. Because the library of books amassed by Anthropic was thought to contain approximately 7 million works, the AI company was potentially facing court-imposed penalties amounting to billions, possibly more than $1 trillion dollars.

“It's a stunning turn of events, given how Anthropic was fighting tooth and nail in two courts in this case. And the company recently hired a new trial team,” says Edward Lee, a law professor at Santa Clara University who closely follows AI copyright litigation. “But they had few defenses at trial, given how Judge Alsup ruled. So Anthropic was starting at the risk of statutory damages in ‘doomsday' amounts.”

Most authors who may have been part of the class action were just starting to receive notice that they qualified to participate. The Authors Guild, a trade group representing professional writers, sent out a notice alerting authors that they might be eligible earlier this month, and lawyers for the plaintiffs were scheduled to submit a “list of affected works” to the court on September 1. This means that many of these writers were not privy to the negotiations that took place.

“The big question is whether there is a significant revolt from within the author class after the settlement terms are unveiled,” says James Grimmelmann, a professor of digital and internet law at Cornell University. “That will be a very important barometer of where copyright owner sentiment stands.”

Anthropic is still facing a number of other copyright-related legal challenges. One of the most high-profile disputes involves a group of major record labels, including Universal Music Group, which allege that the company illegally trained its AI programs on copyrighted lyrics. The plaintiffs recently filed to amend their case to allege that Anthropic had used the peer-to-peer file sharing service BitTorrent to download songs illegally.

Settlements don't set legal precedent, but the details of this case will likely be watched closely as dozens of other high-profile AI copyright cases continue to wind through the courts.

Anthropic is launching a research preview of a browser-based AI agent powered by its Claude AI models, the company announced on Tuesday. The agent, Claude for Chrome, is rolling out to a group of 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month. The company is also opening a waitlist for other interested users.

By adding an extension to Chrome, select users can now chat with Claude in a sidecar window that maintains context of everything happening in their browser. Users can also give the Claude agent permission to take actions in their browser and complete some tasks on their behalf.

The browser is quickly becoming the next battleground for AI labs, which aim to use browser integrations to offer more seamless connections between AI systems and their users. Perplexity recently launched its own browser, Comet, which features an AI agent that can offload tasks for users. OpenAI is reportedly close to launching its own AI-powered browser, which is rumored to have similar features to Comet. Meanwhile, Google has launched Gemini integrations with Chrome in recent months.

The race to develop AI-powered browsers is especially pressing given Google's looming antitrust case, in which a final decision is expected any day now. The federal judge in the case has suggested he may force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for Chrome, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested his company would be willing to buy it as well.

In the Tuesday blog post, Anthropic warned that the rise of AI agents with browser access poses new safety risks. Last week, Brave's security team said it found that Comet's browser agent could be vulnerable to indirect prompt-injection attacks, where hidden code on a website could trick the agent into executing malicious instructions when it processed the page.

(Perplexity's head of communications, Jesse Dwyer, told TechCrunch in an email that the vulnerability Brave raised has been fixed.)

Anthropic says it hopes to use this research preview as a chance to catch and address novel safety risks; however, the company has already introduced several defenses against prompt injection attacks. The company says its interventions reduced the success rate of prompt injection attacks from 23.6% to 11.2%.

For example, Anthropic says users can limit Claude's browser agent from accessing certain sites in the app's settings, and the company has, by default, blocked Claude from accessing websites that offer financial services, adult content, and pirated content. The company also says that Claude's browser agent will ask for user permission before “taking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.”

This isn't Anthropic's first foray into AI models that can control your computer screen. In October 2024, the company launched an AI agent that could control your PC — however, testing at the time revealed that the model was quite slow and unreliable. 

The capabilities of agentic AI models have improved quite a bit since then. TechCrunch has found that modern browser-using AI agents, such as Comet and ChatGPT Agent, are fairly reliable at offloading simple tasks for users. However, many of these agentic systems still struggle with more complex problems.

The main reason I wanted to build this is that git log doesn't give me context from GitHub PRs/issues/milestones or CI events. When I'm diving into a new codebase, I like to see who's been working on what, and what ongoing problems/initiatives are propelling that development.I've only got GH issues up (not milestones or CI events yet), but I think this is a good start!

Melania Trump has picked her project as first lady: proliferating AI. On Tuesday, she announced the Presidential Artificial Intelligence Challenge, a “Presidential Fitness Challenge” for the less phys. ed. inclined that will task K-12 students with using AI tools to solve community-based problems, and made it clear that she will be the face of the Trump administration's AI push.

Frankly, she's perfect.

Firstly, she'd be right for just about any cause you put in front of her because she is simply an ambient human. She can serve as the face of just about anything, and it is acceptable to most audiences because she's a largely inoffensive and sometimes even sympathetic figure. She's basically always polled with higher approval ratings than her husband despite standing by him for everything, like she's lovely wallpaper placed on the wall of a torture chamber. During her modeling career, she served as the spokesmodel for Camel cigarettes and faced basically zero pushback or objection for doing so because the attitude of the general public seems to be, “Who cares what Melania Trump does or did?”

But taking on AI is ideal for a person who is constantly doing an impression of someone else's work in a way that just isn't quite right. Melania has cribbed a lot from Jacqueline Kennedy, wife of John F. Kennedy. She's done everything from fashion to taking a page out of her book and redesigning the White House Rose Garden—the Melania's take is much less serene and more concrete, a real “paved paradise and put up a parking lot”-ass interpretation of Kennedy's work. Trump has even insisted that Melania is the “Jackie O” of our time, which, much like AI chatbots, is an innovation most of us simply never asked for.

She also famously plagiarized a speech from Michelle Obama, which is a quality befitting the plagiarism machine that is AI. That whole situation also raised some interesting and previously underconsidered questions about copyright, which is something Big Tech firms (sucking up as much data and information as possible, regardless of copyright protections, to train their large language models) can certainly relate to.

She got hit with plagiarism charges again in 2018 when she launched her first cause as First Lady, tackling cyberbullying, after it was discovered that her “Be Best” campaign bore a striking resemblance to an almost identical initiative that was started during the Obama administration. But hey, it's way easier to do the work when it's already been done for you.

Melania told the New York Post that she hopes to become the “First Lady of Technology,” and she's already done a fair amount of embracing tech with very little discernment as to whether it's actually good or not. She's got some ideas, to be fair: the TAKE IT DOWN Act that she backed in an effort to stop non-consensual deepfakes of people from proliferating has its intentions in the right place, whether the approach is good policy is another question, and her anti-cyberbullying campaign had the right spirit (though she should maybe talk to her husband about his social media presence).

But she's also happy to embrace tech without any real consideration of the consequences, whether that is the mostly harmless decision to publish an audiobook in which an AI model trained on her voice serves as the narrator or lend her name and likeness to a crypto memecoin that cost people millions. Much like AI, she could be useful if applied correctly, but mostly, she does more harm than good.

COMMENTARY

Kenneth W. Lin, MD, MPH

DISCLOSURES August 26, 2025  

Hi, everyone. I'm Dr Kenny Lin. I am a family physician and associate director of the Lancaster General Hospital Family Medicine Residency, and I blog at Common Sense Family Doctor.

At no time in recorded history have our children been as well protected against serious illness and death from infectious diseases as they are today. Since I completed residency two decades ago, for example, there have been substantial declines in hospitalizations from rotavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), thanks to vaccines and long-acting monoclonal antibodies. At the same time, I don't think I have ever encountered so much confusion, suspicion, and hesitancy surrounding childhood vaccines.

Larger numbers of parents are opting their children out of routine vaccinations. Reasons for parents' reluctance to vaccinate include a backlash against COVID-19 vaccine mandates; concerns about younger children receiving too many vaccines at once; and disproven but persistent myths that certain vaccines, adjuvants, or preservatives cause autism or other childhood chronic diseases. The CDC reported that nonmedical exemptions to one or more vaccines among kindergartners increased in 36 states and the District of Columbia during the 2024-2025 school year, with 138,000 children receiving such exemptions. A steady decline in measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination coverage since the pandemic has already led to the most confirmed measles cases since 1992.

Adding fuel to the fire, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, unilaterally changed COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, and replaced all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) with a smaller panel that includes a single pediatrician, no family physicians, and several people affiliated with antivaccine groups. The CDC recently barred medical societies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), from participating in ACIP work groups that evaluate evidence and provide input to the panel, asserting that these groups are “biased” because their members take care of patients.

Having never imagined that the ACIP might one day “go rogue,” legislators have written its recommendations into “nearly 600 statutes and regulations across 49 states, three territories, and Washington, DC,” according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. These include requirements for school attendance, mandatory insurance coverage, standing vaccine orders, and information provided to patients or guardians. Although nongovernment groups are stepping up to fill the scientific void created by the ACIP's abdication, it is not clear which vaccines will continue to be covered by insurance, recommended (and by whom), or available in sufficient supplies for the upcoming respiratory virus season.

Regardless of what happens next, though, family physicians will not be completely bereft of trustworthy, evidence-based guidance. 

On August 19, the Vaccine Integrity Project held a live-streamed expert presentation on the findings from its comprehensive evidence review (comprising nearly 600 papers) on the safety and efficacy of flu, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines. They found no notable safety or effectiveness issues. 

The AAP has also published its recommendations for influenza, RSV, and COVID-19 immunization for the 2025-2026 season, reiterating the effectiveness of vaccination for infants and children. The AAP recommendations break from CDC guidance, and AAP President Susan J. Kressly, MD, stated, ""The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents.”

Further, the AAFP has historically contributed to the vaccine schedules for children and adults through representation of family physicians on ACIP and its work groups, and it will rely on the expertise of those individuals and others to provide or endorse primary care guidance that is consistent with the latest data on vaccines' benefits and harms. 

The current environment is challenging, but we cannot let the political machinations surrounding vaccines distract from reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in our practices and communities, one patient at a time.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

For older adults, the vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) appears to be most effective in the first year after administration, according to new research that shows the benefits of the immunization fall roughly 60% within about 1.5 years.

The database analysis showed that among adults aged 60 years or older, the effectiveness of the RSV vaccine at preventing infections fell from 71% at the 4-month mark to 40% 19 months after receipt.

For clinicians, “the big takeaway is that the RSV vaccine works well, especially in the first year, and remains worth recommending to older patients, especially those at higher risk,” said Kersten Bartelt, RN, a research clinician at Epic Research, an arm of the records company, who helped conduct the analysis.

Bartelt and her colleagues analyzed data from more than 1 million adults aged 60 years or older who underwent RSV lab tests at 1700 hospitals and 40,000 clinics in the US, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia during the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season. The study was completed by two research teams that worked independently and came to similar conclusions, according to the company.

The effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing RSV-related hospitalizations declined over approximately 1 year, from 73% at 4 months after immunization to 44% by 19 months. Effectiveness against RSV-related ED visits followed a similar trend, falling from 71% to 46% over the same period.

“We know that vaccine protection tends to fade over time, so the drop after 12 months matches what we expected,” Bartelt told Medscape Medical News.

Emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for RSV were also twice as high among individuals vaccinated 1 year to 19 months prior to their visit compared with those vaccinated in the year prior.

However, people who never received an RSV vaccine had three times as many ED visits as those who had received a vaccination more recently.

The vaccine is not currently recommended as an annual shot, but a single dose is generally recommended for adults aged 75 years or older and those aged 60-74 years who may be at increased risk for infection, according to the CDC.

Data from the 2023-2024 respiratory virus season, when the vaccine was first recommended, indicate only about 22% of adults aged 60 years or older were vaccinated against RSV.

Bartelt said more data are needed to determine a regular schedule for routine RSV vaccination, including how long protection lasts, whether boosters help, and how the vaccine performs in different subgroups, such as those with weaker immune systems.

Three RSV vaccines are currently available: Arexvy and Abrysvo, which were approved in 2023, and mResvia, approved in 2024. The CDC states no preference among them.

Long-term effectiveness data for mResvia are limited because of its recent approval. However, Abrysvo has shown efficacy of nearly 89% against lower respiratory tract disease in an ongoing study. Arexvy showed efficacy of 83% against RSV-associated hospitalizations and protection against lower respiratory tract disease with some waning over the first 2 years after vaccination, according to the CDC.

Some barriers to RSV vaccination include lack of awareness among older adults, lack of ready availability in some clinics, and uncertain insurance coverage, Bartelt told Medscape Medical News.

“Information regarding vaccine effectiveness and duration of protection is important as experience with the RSV vaccine grows,” said Shirin Mazumder, MD, an infectious diseases specialist and an associate professor at The University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, Tennessee, who was not involved in the study.

Given that the RSV vaccine is still relatively new, additional data from the new study give clinicians a better understanding of what to expect with the vaccine and how best to counsel patients, Mazumder said.

“Educating older patients on the existence and importance of the RSV vaccine is necessary to reduce the risk of serious illness and complications,” Mazumder said. “The burden of RSV infection among older adults is significant; upward of 180,000 adults aged 50 or older are hospitalized, and up to 10,000 older adults die each year.”

The study was conducted by Epic Research, and the authors are employed by Epic.

Mazumder had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Premier League defending champion, Liverpool, left it late as they grabbed their second win this season by beating Newcastle United 3-2. The Reds' youngster, Rio Ngumoha, was the hero for them in that match as he scored the winning goal deep in added time.

The Reds continue their positive start this season, winning their second game after picking up all three points also in their opening fixture. Starting the 2025/26 season by beating Bournemouth 4-2, Liverpool picked up another maximum result on Monday.

Arne Slot's side snatch an important away victory as they take down Newcastle 3-2, in a thrilling contest which saw the home team playing with 10 men.  Anthony Gordon saw red just before half-time break following a tackle on Virgil Van Dijk.

Before the red card tragedy for Newcastle, Liverpool already put themselves ahead thanks to a goal from Ryan Gravenberch in 35 minutes.  The visitor doubles their advantage straight from the restart, this time through their new signing, Hugo Ekitike.

However, despite having a comfortable 2-0 lead, Liverpool found themselves in trouble as Newcastle were not prepared to give up. The home team pulled one goal back with a header from Bruno Guimaraes on 57 minutes, before drawing level through William Osula on 88 minutes.

Just as the match seemed to be heading for a draw, Liverpool snatched the unlikely winner, thanks to Ngumoha. The 16-year-old talent didn't waste a wonderful opportunity in added time to give his side the lead with his fine finish inside the box.

Full Results for English Premier League week 2:

West Ham 1-5 Chelsea; Man City 0-2 Tottenham Hotspur; Bournemouth 1-0 Wolves; Burnley 2-0 Sunderland; Brentford 1-0 Aston Villa; Arsenal 5-0 Leeds United; Crystal Palace 1-1 Nottm Forest; Everton 2-0 Brighton; Fulham 1-1 Man United; Newcastle United 2-3 Liverpool.

Venus Williams put on a show for the fans in attendance at Arthur Ashe Stadium but ultimately fell to No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova in the first round. Muchova secured the win 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in exactly two hours.

Venus Williams made a spirited return to the US Open after a year away, taking a set off No. 11 seed Karolina Muchova before falling in the first round Monday night.

US Open: Draws | Scores | Order of Play

Despite the loss, the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium was treated to glimpses of “Vintage Venus.” The two-time US Open champion's crisp ball-striking and powerful serve were on full display -- especially in the second set, when it briefly looked like she might pull off the upset.

Ultimately, Muchova, last year's semifinalist, proved too strong on this occasion for the seven-time Grand Slam winner, closing out a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory in exactly two hours.

The result marked Williams' fourth consecutive first-round exit in New York.

This was Williams' 25th US Open appearance, coming just a month after she returned to competition with a surprise win over then-World No. 35 Peyton Stearns in Washington D.C., following a 16-month absence.

Her return to the Big Apple didn't start as smoothly.

She was broken in the opening game and quickly fell behind 0-2, facing three break points in her second service game at risk of going down a double break early. But she saved all three and rallied to win three straight games, taking a 3-2 lead before dropping the next four to concede the first set.

Williams committed seven double faults in the opener.

The second set told a different story. She broke Muchova in the opening game and never looked back, hitting 10 winners to just five unforced errors, and limiting herself to one double fault.

But the momentum didn't last. Williams faded in the third set, allowing Muchova to regain control and seal the win.

While it's unclear when Williams will next take the court, she showed she still has what it takes to compete with the world's best. The fans responded in kind, showing they'll continue to support her -- wherever and whenever that may be.

Muchova, meanwhile, advances to face either Sorana Cirstea or Solana Sierra in the second round. Reflecting on the match, she acknowledged the challenge and the honor of sharing the court with a legend.

“I was stressed, you guys made me stressed,” Muchova said after the match. “But no, it was an unbelievable atmosphere. I mean, she's such a legend of our sport, I understand. It's so nice to play and to share a court with her, and I'm just glad that I was lucky to win today.”

At just 5-foot-3 and ranked No. 82, Zarazua had never gone past the second round of a major. She had lost in the first or second round of all eight previous Grand Slam appearances, including a second-round finish at the 2024 US Open. Facing world No. 6 Keys was another daunting task—Keys had beaten her last year at Roland Garros, and Zarazua carried a 0-6 record against Top 10 players.The turning point came from a piece of mom's advice.“I spoke to my mom and I was almost crying,” she said. “I didn't want to go on court at all, and I told her that. She said, ‘You have to be the professional that you are. You have to go out there and give everything.' And I did, but it was very tough to go out there today.”

Taehyung also ticked an item off his bucket list when he met L.A. superstar Shohei Ohtani at Monday's (Aug. 25) game.

	ARMY will have to wait until next year to hear new music from BTS. But in the meantime, the K-pop superstar boy band's diehards can slake their thirst by watching member V smoke the ceremonial first pitch at a Los Angeles Dodgers game on Monday (Aug. 25). 


	Taking the field to screams from the Dodger faithful, V, wearing baggy, acid-washed jeans, a No. 7 Blake Snell jersey (with a custom “V” on the back) tucked into his pants and a blue Dodgers cap, leftie Taehyung took a small bow after his introduction and hurled a solid pitch down the middle to catcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto; watch a video of the pitch here.

	











	The Dodgers posted a photo album of the special moment — calling the singer their “mVp” — featuring action shots, a snap with Yamamoto, as well as photos with No. 25 Tommy Edman, who plays on the South Korean national team in international games, and pics with pitchers Clayton Kershaw and Tyler Glasnow, outfielder Kike Hernandez and a snap with the team's 2024 championship trophy.




			Trending on Billboard		







	According to the Associated Press, V also gave the traditional call of “It's time for Dodger baseball!' in English at the game against the Cincinnati Reds before individually greeting the kids who run on the field to collect player autographs before each home game. 


	Even better, he got to meet and hang out with Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and FaceTime with South Korean Dodgers rookie Kim Hye-seong, who regretted that he could not be there in person to hang with V because of a recent injury he is rehabbing. “Hello, I'm a fan,” Hey-seong told V in their chat, with the singer responding, “It's an honor.”


	“I heard you weren't able to come because you're hurt,” V said. “Yes that's right,” Hey-seong confirmed. “I wanted to be there so badly.” V said it would have been “so nice” to meet the second baseman/shortstop who is nicknamed “The Comet” due to his base-running speed. While Hey-seong couldn't make it because he's in Oklahoma getting treatment, the men said they hope to meet up in L.A. the next time they're both there.


	Seeming a bit nervous about the first pitch, V told Hey-seong, “I'll do my best to throw today,” saying he had really been hoping to “learn from you” about pitching, with the baller promising that he'd be happy to give him some lessons some day. “I'll do my best tonight,” V said. 


	Now that all seven members of BTS have completed their mandatory South Korean military service the septet — comprised of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jung Kook — are gearing up to re-emerge after a more than three-year hiatus. RM recently told ARMY that he's been “working diligently” on the plans for the band's next album and tour, both set for next year.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


	The moment has finally arrived: Kpop Demon Hunters has officially become Netflix's most popular film of all time.


	The animated musical produced by Sony Pictures Animation added another 25.4M views from August 18 to 24, bringing its total since its June 20 premiere to 236M views. It has now surpassed Red Notice to take the top spot on the Most Popular English Films list, as expected.


	What's even more impressive is that this doesn't seem to be even close to the end of the road for the title's performance. Last week marked the third consecutive week that the film has exhibited nearly 0% audience decline, after two straight intervals of 26M views.

					'KPop Demon Hunters' Sing-Along Version To Debut On Netflix		
			








	Thanks to the launch of KPop Demon Hunters The Sing-Along Event, the film is likely to see another big boost in viewing over the course of this week. Deadline understands that Netflix plans to combine the viewership for the sing-along and the original movie, even though they are separate titles on the streamer, so we expect some pretty huge numbers in the next report as audiences tune into this new version. The singalong was also released theatrically this weekend, delivering a huge win for Netflix as the film beat out Weapons for No. 1 at the box office with $19M.

KPop Demon Hunters has 24 days left in its 91-day premiere window to keep racking up views and widening the distance between it and now-No. 2 Red Notice (which had 230M views in 91 days).


	Over on the TV side of things, the first episodes of Wednesday Season 2 took the top spot with 13.4M views. Season 1 also made an appearance at No. 4 with 4M views as audiences refreshed their memories and/or caught up before diving into Season 2. 

	











Wednesday is likely to stick around the charts for quite a while, as Part 2 of the second season is poised to launch on September 3. 


	In second place was the British political thriller Hostage, which generated 10.8M views. The series stars Queen Charlotte‘s Corey Mylchreest as the activist stepson of the president of France (Julie Delpy), who costars alongside Suranne Jones as the British prime minister whose husband has been kidnapped.


	Speaking of Mylchreest, he also had a presence on the film list with My Oxford Year‘s 5.9M views putting it at No. 4.


	As always, there were also some reality titles on last week's Top 10. Fit For TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser took No. 3 with 8.5M views, while America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys came in ninth place with 1.9M views.


	Elsewhere in film, Happy Gilmore 2 enjoyed a fifth week in the Top 10 at No. 6 with 4.5M views.

K-pop is a juggernaut..
This is like the girl version of the Spiderverse movies.
Beatifully animated with a fantastic story. It's not perfect, but it was a lot of fun, and the songs were catchy as hell.

“who could have seen this coming??”

A few years ago, Mayim Bialik started talking seriously about rebooting Blossom, her breakthrough sitcom in which she starred as a plucky teen girl with a funky hat collection and a womanizing older brother with a penchant for saying “Whoa.” The original NBC show never had the prime TGIF real estate, but it ran for five seasons in the '90s. Despite never really working in syndication, Blossom became a quasi-cultural touchstone—primarily for hats, “whoas,” and Bialik's continued television presence. But the show was pretty groundbreaking for its time, often dealing with mature problems like sexual assault, gun violence, and drugs, so maybe it was a little too adult for TGIF anyway. To that end, Bialik hoped to reboot the show “not as a sitcom” but rather as a means of bringing back “these interesting, deep characters—a child of divorce, a recovering drug addict, an alcoholic—to see them in a whole new way.” Alas, she won't have the chance.

Mayim Bialik posted on her Substack that the reboot isn't moving forward. (To answer your questions: Yes, Mayiam Bialik has a Substack, with 78,000 subscribers, and, yes, this was a paid post. No, we won't be diving into it any further.) She writes that the reboot came together after reconnecting with Blossom creator Don Reo in the wake of The Big Bang Theory's final season. Reo got to work and wrote a “beautiful” script, according to Bialik. “What would Blossom be like 30 years later?” she writes. “Don wrote a draft in one sitting. He said it just flowed out of him. It wasn't writing so much as it was receiving. He found our characters exactly where many of us find ourselves – funny, lost, wandering, meandering, and torn. The script is beautiful.”

However, because Bialik was so busy co-hosting Jeopardy! and starring for three seasons on Call Me Kat, Blossom hit the back burner. Still, she and Reo pitched the show, and Disney “seemed” to love it. Unfortunately, Disney lost interest, and “for no particular reason, we were told ‘no.'” Though she and Reo asked to buy the rights to bring the show to another studio, she was “told Disney reserves the rights in case they ever want to do a reboot of Blossom.” Bialik blames the “constant changing of guards in our industry, the mergers, the insincerity and the increasingly extended periods of time it takes to get answers or contracts completed.” But maybe the market just wasn't ready for more Blossom.

“While it is possible no one wants a Blossom reboot, I'm pretty certain Disney got this one wrong,” she writes. “The sun is gonna surely shine. Maybe not the way Don and I intended, but this door closed. While we didn't want it to, we are powerless over every aspect of it except what we know to be true: we loved this possibility with all that we have and we are so so sorry we couldn't get it to happen.”

	On July 14, officers with Los Angeles Police Department were called to conduct a welfare check at a home in Encino. Inside, they found two people dead — Robin Kaye, a longtime music supervisor for American Idol, and her husband, Thomas Deluca. 


	The pair had been shot and killed several days earlier, with authorities later determining that Kaye and Deluca sustained their fatal injuries on July 10. Not long after their bodies were discovered, police quickly identified, arrested, and charged a suspect, 22-year-old Raymond Boodarian, in the shocking killing that has rattled a neighborhood and a longtime reality TV tentpole. 


	Here's everything we know about the case so far.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Kaye spent more than a decade working as a music supervisor on American Idol. She joined the show in 2009 and is credited on nearly 300 episodes. After her death, a spokesperson for the show called Kaye “a cornerstone of the Idol family,” and was “truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her.”

	











	The statement continued: “Robin will remain in our hearts forever as we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.”


	Former American Idol judge Randy Jackson called Kaye “a dear friend” and said she “consistently went the extra mile, meticulously ensuring songs were placed and cleared for the show. She was truly one of a kind. Forever loved and deeply appreciated.”


	Along with American Idol, Kaye worked as a music supervisor on several other major shows, including Miss Universe, Lip Sync Battle, The Dance Scene, and Crashed. 

	











	Deluca also worked in music, a guitarist and songwriter who spent many years plying his trade in Nashville. He co-wrote songs that were recorded by Aerosmith's Joe Perry, Jennifer Rush, Meredith Brooks, Molly Hatchett, and David Allen Coe. (The song he co-wrote for Coe, “Son of the South,” was later reworked by Kid Rock as ‘Son of Detroit.”) Deluca also played in a band called the Piggies and recorded a solo, Down to the Wire, which Epic released in 1986.

	Per People, Kaye and Deluca met at a concert in 1983, when Kaye was also in Nashville and working for Waylon Jennings. The couple later relocated to Los Angeles in the middle of the decade and married soon after. They moved into their house in Encino in 2023. 


	According to authorities, Kaye and Deluca had returned from the grocery store on July 10 when they confronted a stranger in their house. Police say the suspect, Boodarian, had entered through an unlocked door, and that the house's alarm system was off at that time; a previous LAPD statement said “there were no signs of forced entry or trouble.” During the confrontation that ensued, Boodarian allegedly shot Kaye and Deluca multiple times with a gun that belonged to the couple. 


	While Kaye and Deluca's bodies weren't discovered until the welfare check on July 14, it was later revealed that two 911 calls were made on the day of the killing — including one allegedly from Boodarian himself. The first call from a neighbor about a possible burglary came at around 4:10 p.m. and prompted LAPD officers to check the home and walk the perimeter, while a helicopter conducted a fly-over. It's believed Boodarian was inside the home at this time, though no suspicious activity was detected.


	The second call came around 4:44 p.m., with a search warrant affidavit stating that “the 911 caller identified himself as Raymond Boodarian and advised that someone broke into his office.” According to the affidavit, the caller also stated, “Please don't shoot me.”

	Despite the two 911 calls, and subsequent house checks, authorities did not immediately find Kaye and Deluca's bodies. “Officers arrived on scene and conducted a check of the surrounding area and attempted to visually check the residence through the security gate. They attempted entry at two access points but both were locked and secured,” LAPD Communications Director Jennifer Forkish previously said (via the Los Angeles Times). “The home was secured with surrounding walls. The Air Ship visually checked the location and advised there was no visible activity or evidence of break in. After taking additional steps to contact the persons reporting and residents at the location, officers cleared from the scene.”

	











	It wasn't until a neighbor called the police four days later to say they hadn't seen or heard from Kaye or Deluca that police finally entered the couple's home and found them dead in separate rooms. 


	Authorities quickly zeroed in on Boodarian as the suspect and they were able to track his location by pinging his cellphone. He was arrested and eventually charged with two counts of murder, as well as a burglary charge. 


	Boodarian was finally arraigned on Aug. 20, and showed up to court wearing a protective “suicide gown,” according to his public defender. Boodarian neither entered a plea, nor responded to questions asked by the judge. 


	“He does have severe mental health issues,” his lawyer, Nancy Kolocotronis, said. 


	The arraignment was eventually suspended. At the end of the hearing, Judge Martin L. Herscovitz ordered Boodarian back into custody without bail and set a Sept. 3 hearing in mental health court. He said any arraignment on Boodarian's murder charges would have to wait until “he's deemed mentally competent.”

	If convicted as charged, Boodarian faces a possible maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. 


	“In a matter of moments, this couple was senselessly killed in their own home as they returned from the grocery store,” L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman previously said in a statement. “This tragic shooting has shaken a valley community and the notion that home should be our safe sanctuary.”
