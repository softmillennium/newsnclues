                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It appears the most magical place on earth has gotten even more otherworldly. Recently, visitors at Disney World's Epcot saw more than just a fireworks show. Instead, parkgoers claim to have spotted a UFO hovering over the Disney theme park. However, others argue there is a much simpler explanation. Morgan Huelsman, digital director of "The Bobby Bones Show", and her boyfriend were enjoying their time in the park. However as they were waiting for the nightly firework show Huelsman saw a "sudden bright light overhead." Given that they were waiting for a firework show, that may seem unsurprisingly; yet this display of light had nothing to do with Epcot's nightly entertainment. She scanned the interent, thinking she may find some breaking news about drones or satellites in the nearby area. Although it appeared stationary for a short while during the video, eventaully it zoomed around and then blipped away. One viewer shared that a rocket launch had taken place near Cape Canaveral earlier in the week. The NY Post shares that "SpaceX did launch a batch of satellites for Starlink out of Cape Canaveral on Aug. 14 and Aug. 18 — just about 60 miles away from Walt Disney World." In fact, it comes only behind California for the most number of reported sightings. Its proximity to NASA launch sites definitley plays a role in this. So far, Disney is yet to comment on this unidentified flying object.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the pandemic seems to have played a decisive role If so, he hid it well, at least from most of the locals. Those who remember him before he became Dezi Bird Freeman, the conspiracy theorist and alleged police killer, recall a reserved man who was unfailingly polite when he came into town to pick up his post. With two children and a charming wife who taught music and worked shifts at the local supermarket, he seemed to fit neatly into small-town Australia: an unremarkable man living an unremarkable life amid the trout streams and mountains of Victoria's high country. Desmond Filby the landscape photographer was the kind of man who helped his children with their prep and doted on his wife. Dezi Freeman the “sovereign citizen”, by contrast, was a paranoid conspiracy theorist who allegedly shot dead two police officers, wounded a third, and then, it is presumed, dragged his family into the bush as hostages. In 2019, he tried to place a magistrate under citizen's arrest during a dispute over public access to a nearby national park, an act that suggested at least a passing flirtation with the “sovereign citizenship” ideology, which casts representatives of the state as enemies of the people. But it was Covid that transformed him into a full-fledged adherent of a movement whose violent fringes are causing growing concern across the English-speaking world. It began, acquaintances say, with his refusal to wear face coverings in shops and a rejection of lockdowns and vaccinations. It culminated in 2021, when Mr Freeman took a leading role in an attempted private prosecution of Victoria's premier, Daniel Andrews, for treason. Arrested outside the courthouse — where a magistrate later ruled that Mr Andrews' lockdown policies did not, in fact, amount to treason — Mr Freeman could be heard denouncing the police officers taking him away as “scumbags” and “criminal filth”. Mr Freeman, who is 56, appears to have developed an abiding hatred of the police, with whom he had had repeated run-ins over a string of parking and driving offences. Such outlandish language is common in sovereign citizen circles. Its adherents may not exactly see themselves as above the law, but they certainly believe they are exempt from it. Adherents, often drawn from far-Right or fundamentalist Christian backgrounds, have long resorted to violence. In 2022, three self-proclaimed sovereign citizens, Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train, ambushed and killed two police officers and a neighbour at their remote property near Wieambilla in Queensland before being shot dead themselves. He was not just a teacher but the school's headmaster. Like the Trains, Mr Freeman was expecting a visit from the police, in his case over a sexual abuse investigation for which he had already been questioned. So erratic had his behaviour become that his wife, now missing, confided her fears to a neighbour just days before the attack. Whether it could have been prevented is a question for another day. What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that the sovereign citizen movement — as inchoate as it is — poses a growing threat to police officers and public servants in Australia and beyond, as Anthony Albanese, the Australian prime minister, acknowledged after the shootings. “This ideology of not seeing themselves being subject to our laws and our society… is of real concern,” he said.</p>

He specializes in history, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Laura holds a Master's in Experimental Neuroscience from Imperial College London. Her areas of expertise include health, medicine, psychology, and neuroscience. Despite many attempts at looking, no further signals have been found. A new study has re-examined the famous "Wow!" signal, finding that it likely has an extraterrestrial origin after all, and may have been even more intense than previously believed. On August 15, 1977, at the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University, a narrowband radio signal was received. A few days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman reviewed the data and noticed the signal sequence, which lasted for a full 72 seconds. The signal has, so far, defied explanation, and that's not for a lack of trying. The signal has been a source of speculation in the "aliens are out there" community, and not without reason. No other signal like it has been detected before or since. It was in a range of frequencies close to the hydrogen line, which is relatively free from background noise, making it a good range to pick were we to try and communicate with other civilizations ourselves. On top of that, the team themselves believed it to be a good candidate for extraterrestrial life. signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin," Ohio State University Radio Observatory director John Kraus wrote in a letter to Carl Sagan in 1994, "but little more can be said until it returns for further study." In a new attempt to narrow down what it might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data which had previously been unpublished, producing two not as yet peer-reviewed papers on the topic. "If this RFI is persistent, it would take approximately six millennia of uninterrupted observations to achieve a signal analogous to the Wow! Signal from random RFI occurrences," the team explains in paper II. Looking at other possible sources, including satellites, the team found this to be unlikely as well. While the team suggested that satellites which have slowly come out of orbit could be a source, or a Soviet satellite occupying this orbit, they believe this is unlikely too. "A continuous signal from an orbiting satellite will need to be at an orbit beyond the Moon to reproduce the pattern," they added. While the team don't yet have an answer, they have made a lot of progress, for instance finding that the signal was much more powerful than had previously been predicted at 250 Janskys, four times larger than had previously been estimated. Signal,” lead author Professor Abel Méndez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, explained in a statement. This new precision allows us to target future observations more effectively than ever before.” signal were intrigued by these signals as well, looking at their own notes. "It is clear that the Ohio SETI team were interested in these signals, as evidenced by their circling. We believe that they recognized these signals as compact cold Hi clouds, after corroborating their appearance in multiple scans," the team write in paper II. "We searched for the coordinates of these signals in the HI4PI survey and confirmed their association with compact Hi clouds." In paper I from the Aricebo Wow project, they go further and suggest a possible cause of the signal. Signal near the hydrogen line, though significantly weaker. These signals are attributed to small cold Hi cloud regions within the galactic ISM. Signal was caused by the abrupt brightening of the hydrogen line of these clouds triggered by an intense radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater," they add. Though this is an intriguing possibility – and magnetars are often suspected for producing weird signals – the team cannot rule out other potential causes in the cosmos. "Our study did not conclude that the Wow! However, null results are instrumental in refining future technosignature searches," the team concludes. "NASA and other agencies remain committed to their search for biosignatures within the atmospheres of potentially habitable exoplanets." The project will continue to search archives of this and other observatories for other unexplained signals and transients, as well as digitizing and archiving data from the Big Ear project. More work will be done on attempting to analyze the Wow! “This study doesn't close the case,” Méndez added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The heiress to one of Canada's wealthiest families is suing her former best friend — who “lost everything” and is now an Uber driver, representing herself in court — after a doomed crypto investment allegedly fueled by a pair of psychics' advice cost them $80 million. Taylor Thomson, the 66-year-old middle child of the billionaire Thomson family, and Ashley Richardson, a 47-year-old once-affluent California mom, were the best of friends who enjoyed living it up in Los Angeles after first meeting at a 2009 house party in Malibu. The rosy relationship, however, collapsed in 2022 when their psychic advisers pointed them to invest in a crypto token that crashed within a year. Richardson denied the allegations and blamed the billionaire — who she claimed once hit on her — for destroying their friendship and leaving her struggling to make ends meet. In their more than 12 years as close friends, Richardson was one of Thomson's biggest supporters, even going as far as helping the heiress relocate her beloved chickens from Bel Air to Hollywood, according to messages between the two women. She even hired convicted Hollywood private investigator, Anthony Pellicano, to spy on a former nanny whom she suspected of colluding with her daughter's father during a heated custody battle, according to court documents. Despite Thomson's alleged vindictive nature, Richardson told the WSJ she supported her and would try to protect her from these so-called “Takers,” who were after the heiress's fortune. “After spending years living a lavish lifestyle on Ms. Thomson's dime, Ms. Richardson has taken her bogus story to the media in an attempt to extract more money from Ms. Thomson — which we know because Ms. Richardson has threatened multiple times she will do just that,” a spokesperson for Thomson told The Post in a statement. Richardson brought up the token to Thomson, who grew interested and sought advice from her own psychic, Robert Sabella, an astrologer she regularly consulted with, according to the women's messages. “Taylor trusts her own instincts and would use Robert as a sounding board,” Thomson's spokesman told the WSJ now of their interactions, “but by no means would she make substantial life decisions based on his suggestions.” Richardson put most of her savings into the coin while Thomson poured in more than $40 million. When the 2022 crypto market crash happened, Richardson lost everything, while Thomson felt betrayed and hired lawyers and consultants to get her money back. Thomson sued both Richardson and Persistence in 2023, seeking at least $25 million for their alleged role in roping her into the investment as a targeted “whale.” Thomson and Persistence settled for an undisclosed amount of money, while Richardson is fighting her former friend in court. He alleges that Thomson lost more than $80 million in crypto investments associated with Richardson's involvement. Richardson denies the allegations, claiming she never made a trade without Thomson's approval and always did her best to “minimize losses.” She also claims Thomson hired a former FBI agent who works at Guidepost to visit her family. Richardson has since filed a countersuit with the help of ChatGPT for $10 million, alleging that Thomson has defamed her with her accusations. Thomson's spokesperson denied all the allegations, including one where Richardson claimed that the heiress made a pass at her during a 2019 trip to British Columbia. One of their final interactions via text saw Richardson, who reportedly fell off the wagon after two years of sobriety, call Thomson a “rich motherf—ing sociopathic b—,” according to the WSJ.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Far from being isolated outsiders, conspiracy theorists enjoy thriving communities that recruit and organise activism. Psychologists have long considered how a tendency towards irrational thinking or particular personality traits might predict peoples' interest in conspiracies. Yet these individual factors do not explain the group processes through which conspiracy theorists are extending their influence and impact. Over five years, we sought out and got to know people on the cusp of becoming conspiracy theorists. Indeed, contrary to the stereotype of isolated keyboard warriors who have gone down the rabbit hole, conspiracy theorists are becoming organised, recruiting supporters, picketing vaccination centres and vandalising telecommunication and traffic infrastructures. Our research examined the growing interest in conspiracy theories and how associated activism emerges. But revealing our status as researchers actually allowed us to build relationships with people, who shared insights into what motivates their involvement. In particular, we spoke to people about conspiracy theories concerning 5G technology, COVID-19, 15-minute cities and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Belief in conspiracy theories is often initiated by traumatic life events. And these emotions can motivate a search for answers. These are moments of insight during which people come to believe that the causes of their problems lie with secretive groups which control society. One person we spoke to described conspiracy theories as enabling him to “access the way the world really works… as if a light was switched on in my head and I could see things clearly”. In online group chats, people discover others with similar problems. In public meetings, beliefs in various theories are boosted by interactions where people discuss their suspicions over who is to blame for particular issues. In the process, these groups feed off their common emotions, building an atmosphere of energy and excitement. As one participant put it, “there's a lot of support out there for people who are doing their own research… there is always someone wanting to hear more, building on the work of others, giving each other support. Conspiracy theories don't merely offer alternative explanations for events, they are resources for communities that provide identity, purpose and belonging. These benefits may explain why it is so difficult to talk people out of their beliefs in conspiracy theories. Indeed, when conspiracy communities generate common interpretations and shared emotions, conspiracy theories can resonate powerfully, making them seem more real than they are. This effect is compounded by the way which conspiracy theories invite believers to build on ideas by “doing their own research”. The internet serves as a vast database where conspiracy theorists can discover articles, documents and scientific reports to support their claims. And despite the questionable quality of many such sources, contributing to conspiracy theories can provide a boost to people's self esteem, making them feel like experts and heroic detectives. A key aspect of these communities is how they empower members to contribute. Yet, beyond generating more theories, conspiracy communities are becoming organised networks for protest and activism. Given that conspiracy theories raise suspicion and anger over peoples' problems, and point the blame at particular targets, we found that believers can feel compelled to take part in protests. For example, some claim that the urban planning concept of 15-minute cities is part of secretive government scheme to limit citizens' movement. Protesters against these and other efforts to improve urban environments are uniting under slogans such as “stop the tyranny”. Activism based on conspiracy theories can come with serious risks. Many of those involved lose contact with family and friends. Moreover, when conspiracy theorists take action without tested evidence, they may misidentify targets. Perhaps the real winners here are the conspiracy entrepreneurs– people who capitalise on conspiracy theories by creating content that heightens peoples' suspicions about problematic events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Footage shared by country star Dierks Bentley appears to show multiple unknown objects in the sky. Country music star Dierks Bentley shared some interesting video footage that might get UFO enthusiasts talking. Two topics that you wouldn't think ever cross into each other. You never know when topics are going to collide. Enter Dierks Bentley going viral on Instagram. Country music star Dierks Bentley has the internet buzzing after sharing some UFO footage. The popular country music singer recently took to Instagram to share a video that appears to show three objects high up in the sky, and he wants help from the public identifying whatever they might be. Been meaning to post about it for a few years. They light up, move around for a bit, and then go dark. Appear to be 70,000 feet, but they stay in the exact same spot when you fly across the entire country…so they are in space. You can watch the now-viral footage below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com. OutKick is sending one lucky winner and a friend to Athens for Georgia vs. Alabama. Travel's on us, VIP tickets in hand, and bragging rights for life. Are aliens responsible for UFOs or is there a much more believable explanation? It's important to keep an open mind, but that doesn't mean believing anything that gets thrown out there. It's certainly an interesting video, but it's way too difficult to determine what's going on with any high level of confidence. Doubtful, but again, we can't say for sure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amin Ayan is a crypto journalist with over four years of experience in the industry. He has contributed to leading publications such as Cryptonews, Investing.com, 99Bitcoins, and 24/7 Wall St. Billionaire heiress Taylor Thomson has reportedly lost more than $80 million in digital assets after following investment guidance tied to a psychic. According to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report published Monday, Thomson, a member of the family behind media and financial giant Thomson Reuters, poured millions into cryptocurrencies with the assistance of her former best friend, Ashley Richardson. The two women had allegedly consulted a celebrity psychic and other spiritual advisers before Richardson became heavily involved in managing Thomson's crypto holdings. At the height of the 2021 bull market, Richardson was said to oversee more than $140 million in Thomson's digital assets spread across multiple wallets. Consulting firm Guidepost Solutions estimated Thomson's losses at over $80 million and claimed Richardson executed more than 450,000 trades without proper authorization, exposing her to high-risk strategies. Richardson rejected the allegations, arguing she acted under Thomson's direction and only made trades to maintain liquidity in thinly traded tokens. “Everything I did was based on her instructions, as part of her effort to minimize losses,” Richardson told the WSJ. Thomson is seeking $25 million in damages, alleging Richardson and Persistence arranged a secret “finder's fee” for Richardson and misrepresented the investment. Richardson has countersued for $10 million, claiming defamation after Thomson allegedly told others she had committed fraud. The loss, flagged by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain on Wednesday, underscores the rising threat of phishing attacks targeting digital asset holders. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK's latest security report.
