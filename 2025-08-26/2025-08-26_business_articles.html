                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve on Tuesday said it would abide by any court decision on whether President Donald Trump has the legal authority to fire Board of Governors member Lisa Cook. The Fed, in a statement from a spokesperson, noted that "Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System." The statement was the Fed's first response to Trump's announcement on Monday night that he was removing Cook as Fed governor because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud. The spokesperson did not explicitly criticize Trump for trying to remove Cook. But the statement pointedly noted that "Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' "Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people," the statement said. Trump separately told reporters on Tuesday that he would abide by any court decision on Cook's fate at the Fed. "I abide by the court, yeah, I abide by the court," he said, while also predicting that the Fed's board would soon be comprised by a majority of his appointees after he selects Cook's replacement. If Trump gains a majority of appointees, he might have better success at getting the Fed to lower interest rates sharply, as he has repeatedly demanded. In the statement Tuesday, the Fed spokesperson said, "The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates — including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system." "As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision," they said. "The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses." "His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis," Lowell said. "We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action." Cook said Monday night that she would keep working at the Fed despite Trump's claim he had the power to remove her. The Fed did not respond to CNBC's query about whether Cook was working Tuesday at the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., or remotely. White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement, said, "The President exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause under 12 U.S.C. "The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions," Desai said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"KPop Demon Hunters" just made history, and it could make Netflix money for a long time to come. "KPop Demon Hunters" has generated 236 million views since its debut, more than any other Netflix movie in its first 91 days — and it achieved that feat in 65 days. Netflix's animated smash-hit has shown remarkable staying power on the streamer's global charts, thanks to social media buzz and a viral soundtrack that's second on Billboard's Global 200 rankings. Its songs were so popular that Netflix brought a sing-along version to big screens last weekend, where it topped the box office with an $18 million haul in the US and Canada. If the streaming giant can leverage "KPop Demon Hunters" to build its own global franchise, Hollywood powerhouses like Disney should take notice. "Netflix has always wanted to beat Disney — now it has the chance to try and prove it can match the Mouse House's franchise development," said Brandon Katz, the insights and content strategy director at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. Unlike Disney, Netflix doesn't have nearly a century of celebrated IP to lean on. Instead of using nostalgia in reboots and live-action remakes, it has to build its franchises from the ground up. While Netflix has not created many movies or shows that will inspire generations of fandom, "KPop Demon Hunters" could be a notable exception. Movie analyst Paul Dergarabedian of Comscore chose a different Disney property as a parallel: "Maybe for young people today, this is like their equivalent of Star Wars." Media companies from Netflix to Paramount are looking for their next signature franchise that leads to sequels and sparks merchandise sales or theme park visits, Dergarabedian said. A sleeper hit like "KPop Demon Hunters" is what film execs pray for. "The entertainment industry loves nothing more than a surprise breakout hit," Dergarabedian said. It followed several billion-dollar blockbusters with a deluge of Marvel shows on Disney+, and the ensuing superhero fatigue has proven difficult to shake.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will soon have a "majority" of his own nominees on the Federal Reserve board of governors who will back his desire to slash interest rates. Trump's comment at a Cabinet meeting came hours after he took the unprecedented step of moving to fire central bank Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, from the board. Trump has already appointed two of the Fed board's seven governors, and he is poised to pick another to replace Adriana Kugler, who announced her retirement earlier this summer. Trump has selected Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisors, to serve out the rest of Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31, 2026. "We'll have a majority very shortly," Trump said Tuesday afternoon. "Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great," he said. "People are paying too high an interest rate. We have to get the rates down a little bit." The president had been asked who he was considering as a replacement for Cook. He also once again hurled criticism Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has repeatedly rebuffed Trump's demands that he lower benchmark rates by multiple percentage points. "Because of him and his high interest rates, the housing is less than it could be," Trump said of Powell. "We're going to get that straightened out very quickly." Trump said in a letter issued Monday night that he was firing Cook over an investigation launched by his Department of Justice into allegations about her mortgages. In a statement issued while Trump's Cabinet meeting was ongoing, the Fed said that Cook has indicated that she will ask the courts to "confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities" as a governor. The central bank said it will "abide by any court decision." The statement also noted, "Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people." When a reporter asked Trump about that statement during the meeting, he said, "I'd abide by the court." Around the same time, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump "exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook will file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Donald Trump, her atto``rney said Tuesday. "President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook," the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, a day after Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud by Cook in firing her. "His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis," Lowell said. "We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action." The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Lowell's statement. The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's action, nor replied to CNBC's question about whether Cook is working at her office on Tuesday or remotely. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 says that a president can fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board only "for cause." That has long been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty while a board member. The Justice Department last week opened a criminal investigation of Cook after she was accused of making false statements on home mortgage applications by Federal Housing Finance Agency Bill Pulte. Pulte pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia claiming they were each her primary residence, which he claimed was done "in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms." Trump cited those allegations on Monday night in a letter to Cook notifying her of her removal. Cook responded Monday, saying in a statement, "President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so." "I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022." — CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration's latest escalation of the trade war with China has drawn several parallels to its origins back in 2018. However, there is a significant difference: the degree to which U.S. companies looked to avoid rising tariffs by racing to bring in more and more products from China ahead of them. When comparing the peak of frontloading that occurred in 2018 compared to 2025, U.S. shippers imported more than double the percentage of Chinese exports this year, according to data from ImportGenius. In 2025, there have been three major frontloading events as a result of the changing tariffs. A second smaller frontloading occurred between March and April. In 2018, the height of freight loading came in the Fall: between the months of September and October where there was a 12.2% increase in containers, and between the months of October and November, there was an additional 22% increase. But there are signs now that the level of exports from China is starting to drop, seen in key shipping data like ocean freight bookings and ocean container spot rates. "The difference in exports from China to the U.S. between July and August of this year is a 40% drop," said Lynn Hughes, an investigative analyst at ImportGenius. "Yes, the month isn't over yet, but realistically, we still only have a week. These orders have been entering U.S. ports in July and August. Spot rates on the Transpacific route have also steadily declined, according to maritime data company Drewry. On its website, Drewry noted, "The phase of accelerated purchasing by U.S. retailers, which induced an early peak season, has ended. In response to a decelerating U.S. economy and increased tariff costs, they are now scaling back on procurement. Hence, Drewry expects spot rates to be less volatile in the coming weeks." Hughes said there was a four-month drop in Chinese goods entering the U.S., after the first frontloading event in 2018. The pattern has also been seen in several other frontloading patterns. This includes after the February 2025 frontloading, when US shippers raced to pull forward products ahead of "Liberation Day." "We know what these patterns look like in shipping now, and this is the most imbalanced frontloading spike we've ever seen," said Hughes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Reserve was mum on Tuesday when asked whether Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook was at her office — or working remotely — a day after President Donald Trump said he had fired her. The Fed's press office and Cook's high-powered lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not reply when CNBC asked if she was working Tuesday, and if so, where. On Monday night, Cook said that she would remain in her job despite Trump having told her in a letter posted on Truth Social earlier in the evening that he was removing her "for cause." The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements on home mortgage applications, which are being investigated by the Justice Department. "I will not resign," Cook said in a statement late Monday. "I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022." Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, said that Trump did not have the authority to remove her because there was no legal cause for him to do so. Pulte as evidence has pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia, which claimed they were each her primary residence. He accused Cook of "falsifying residence statuses ... in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms." It is unclear how Pulte acquired the applications, and Cook has not been charged with any crime. Lowell, in his own statement Monday, said, "We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action." The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's announcement. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that he did not know who had the authority to halt Cook's paycheck or her access to the Federal Reserve buildings. Lutnick demurred when asked if Trump could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for cause if Powell continued to authorize Cook's paycheck and access after the president had said she was fired. "These are all 'what-if scenarios,'" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up for the new Inside Alts newsletter Uncertainty around tariffs has caused even the wealthiest buyers of Lamborghini supercars to hold off on their purchases, CEO Stephan Winkelmann told CNBC. While the White House recently announced an agreement with Europe on a 15% tariff rate, that rate hasn't yet taken effect for cars. Lamborghini and other European automakers are still paying a tariff rate of 27.5% on exports to the U.S. With the price of a Lamborghini starting at $400,000, many buyers are choosing to wait for more stable tariff rates before buying, Winkelmann said. "Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place," Winkelmann said. "Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations." The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. And he said that even the wealthy are sensitive to price increases. "For us, free trade is the right approach. But then there is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity, since we are in business. ... We are ready to face whatever comes." For now, the company is fairly insulated from any immediate drop-off in demand, since it has a large back order. Cars being delivered today were ordered a year or two ago. Lamborghini announced this summer to dealers that prices would increase by 7% for the Temerario and Urus models and 10% for the Revuelto. The company, owned by Volkswagen's Audi Group, is also riding high from a wave of new models. For an upcoming fourth model, Lamborghini had announced an all-electric grand touring car to debut sometime in 2028. But Winkelmann said with EV demand slowing, the company is considering releasing it as a hybrid instead and will decide by the end of the year. "There is a flattening in the acceptance of electric cars, not only at the high end and exclusive supercars, but also in the general market," he said. It's the fastest and most powerful Lambo yet, boasting 1,080 horsepower and 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds thanks to a 6.5-liter, V-12 engine paired with three electric motors. Also helping the company: a surge in wealth around the world that's becoming younger and more diverse. The average age of the Lamborghini buyer now is under 45, and in Asia it's under 30, he said. "There are a lot of countries where we have very young customers," he said. "We have the second generation of wealth. But we also have a very young customer base of entrepreneurs who made their money themselves." Relative to the growth in global wealth, however, Lamborghini's production has remained small. And while the U.S. is still its largest market, Lamborghini carefully manages supply in every country to make sure the brand remains exclusive and special, Winkelmann said. "We will always look to make sure we do not crowd one market, and to have always a global view where we are selling the cars," he said. Women, he said, will also be a key driver.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new analysis of publicly available data shows that unemployment is rising among younger men, and their labor force participation is stagnating. The good news is that there are some fixes. Fewer men in the workforce could lead to understaffed industries and weigh on the coffers of Social Security — and the men who aren't working might be at risk of worsening mental health and declining happiness. Funneling younger men toward secondary education and vocational school might help; so can opening up opportunities for workers with disabilities. Are you a man who's dropped out of the labor force, or never joined it? A Pew Research Center analysis found that, in 2021, 25-year-old men were less likely than their predecessors in older generations to work full-time and to have achieved financial independence. Young men are more likely to be living with a parent than their female peers. But once they reach post-education age, there's another reason men may not be participating in the workforce: disability. As the report notes, men are more likely to work in environments that lend themselves to injury; the rise in disability might also be chalked up to an aging population, long COVID, and better medical diagnostics. Estep said that's one place where policy could step in. Eliminating or beefing up measures like the subminimum wage, which allows employers to hire workers with disabilities at a rate below the federal minimum, could make an impact — although a Biden-era proposed rule to bring disabled workers up to the minimum wage was withdrawn in July. Some younger men might be catching on to a fresh path forward. The analysis found that young men's enrollment in vocational schools jumped from 2022 to 2023, the highest share of young men's enrollment since data first started being collected. It might reflect Gen Z's growing interest in the trades, especially as industries traditionally dominated by men contract and work like healthcare shows robust growth. "I think there is still a lot to do for men in education. We're seeing worse outcomes for men across the board and boys," Estep said. "And so investments in early childhood, improvements to the way that men move through the educational system and track into college or a skilled trade might be something worth pursuing." Of course, gender disparities persist across the workforce and labor market; women still contend with wage gaps and are more likely to leave the labor force over caregiving. Estep said that addressing labor market concerns — like those of men eschewing work or women getting shortchanged on pay — is not a zero-sum game.</p>
