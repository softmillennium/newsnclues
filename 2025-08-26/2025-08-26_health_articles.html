                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lowering the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6) - a key immune signal regulating inflammatory responses in the body - could reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease without making people more vulnerable to infections, according to new research from LMU's Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research and international collaborators. "These studies suggested that suppressing the IL-6 receptor could be associated with cardiovascular benefits, but raised concerns about increased infection risk," explains Georgakis. Whether these findings would translate to under-development drugs that directly inhibit IL-6 remained unclear. And so the LMU researchers turned their attention to genes that encode IL-6. In the new study, published in Nature Cardiovascular Research, they analyzed genetic data from over half a million people of European and East Asian ancestry. They found that individuals carrying variants in the IL6 gene linked to lower IL-6 signaling had a reduced lifetime risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Strikingly, these variants were also associated with a lower risk of pneumonia and sepsis - countering fears that blocking IL-6 might impair the body's ability to fight infections. Our study shows that genetic variants mimicking IL-6 inhibition are associated with lower cardiovascular risk and, potentially, even a lower risk of specific infections." "Our findings highlight how human genetics can be used to anticipate the benefits and risks of new therapies. The results support both the efficacy and safety potential of under-development IL-6 inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease," says Georgakis. The genetic evidence also pointed to potential improvements in type 2 diabetes risk and lipid profiles, hinting at broader metabolic benefits. IL6 genetic perturbation mimicking IL-6 inhibition is associated with lower cardiometabolic risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new HIV antiretroviral shows promise as a long-acting, oral prophylactic agent, according to a new study by Izzat Raheem, Tracy Diamond and colleagues from Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, published August 26th in the open-access journal PLOS Biology. The most common oral PrEP therapies, consisting of once-daily pills, are highly effective at protecting people from acquiring HIV, but they only work if taken properly. Currently, the only long-acting PrEP therapies require injection by a healthcare provider, which isn't always feasible for people. Long-acting, oral PrEP therapies could facilitate adherence, provide greater privacy and discretion, reduce concerns about stigma, and improve accessibility for more people to initiate and continue on PrEP, ultimately helping to stem the tide of the nearly 1.3 million new HIV infections globally per year. NRTTIs are a new class of anti-HIV drugs that have shown potential for long-acting prophylaxis. They inhibit viral replication by more than one mechanism, including blocking translocation of reverse transcriptase on the growing viral DNA chain. Using a known NRTTI, islatravir, as a starting point, researchers used several medicinal chemistry strategies to modify the structure and optimize it using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The lead compound, dubbed MK-8527, showed robust antiviral activity in vitro, and pharmacokinetics in animal studies demonstrated that it may be suitable as a long-acting oral therapy. Studies in humans are underway to assess the safety and tolerability of MK-8527 as a once-monthly oral pill in volunteers at low likelihood of HIV exposure, and at least one completed clinical study shows promising results. MK-8527 is a novel inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase translocation with potential for extended-duration dosing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With chronic disease rates rising across the U.S., healthcare systems face ongoing challenges in reducing hospital stays and readmissions. Nearly 1 in 4 heart failure patients is readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge, and fewer than 20% receive all four guideline-directed medical therapy pillars post-discharge, despite strong evidence showing these therapies improve patient outcomes. Remote patient care fills a critical gap, offering a scalable way to support the most vulnerable patients, improving adherence to evidence-based care and reducing avoidable hospitalizations, no matter the geographical location. Cadence enrolls patients in the program, teaching them how to use their devices, monitoring vital sign readings and providing ongoing clinical support. By combining advanced remote patient monitoring technology with our expertise in guideline-directed care and chronic condition management, we can help extend the high-quality care hospitals provide, ensuring people with heart failure receive proactive, timely support at home when they need it most." John Meiners, chief of mission-aligned businesses at the American Heart Association The Association spearheaded this collaboration with Cadence to extend the reach of its trusted science into homes and communities, utilizing Cadence's remote platform and 24/7 virtual provider group. "Hospitals struggle to extend consistent, evidence-based care once patients leave their doors," said Chris Altchek, chief executive officer and founder of Cadence. "By pairing the American Heart Association's gold-standard scientific guidelines with Cadence's AI-driven remote monitoring and always-on care team, American Heart Association Connected Care, Powered by Cadence, makes proactive, personalized heart-failure support available anytime, anywhere." "Too often, people with heart failure get discharged from the hospital only to find themselves back within a month," said Marat Fudim, M.D., MHS, associate professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine and heart failure cardiologist at the Duke University Medical Center. "With timely interventions and evidence-based support, remote patient monitoring allows us to bridge that gap by keeping a close eye on patients' health while they're at home, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations and achieving better long-term outcomes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team from the Microbiology Department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has discovered three powerful monoclonal antibodies from a person who had previously been infected with mpox (formerly known as monkeypox). These antibodies, which target the viral protein A35, blocked viral spread in laboratory in vitro tests and, most importantly, protected rodents from severe disease and fully prevented death. The findings, published August 22 in Cell, also reveal that humans previously infected with mpox carry high levels of these protective antibodies in their blood, and that their presence is associated with milder symptoms and the absence of hospitalization. Mpox is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus (the family of viruses that causes smallpox, which killed more than 300 million people in the 20th century alone). This virus spreads mainly through close contact with an infected individual. The virus causes a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes, and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scars. A global outbreak of mpox began in 2022 and continues to this day. Recent human clinical trials for the leading candidate therapy did not show it to have efficacy. Thus, there is currently no approved drug to treat mpox. A previous study published in 2023 by our team showed that human antibodies targeting the viral protein A35 were unusually increased in sera in response to mpox infection compared with vaccination for smallpox or antibodies against other viral proteins. Based on this earlier finding, we hypothesized that antibodies targeting A35 from mpox-infected individuals would be highly protective against orthopoxviruses, since the viruses in this family share high genetic similarity. We aimed to address the urgent unmet need for effective treatments for orthopoxviruses, and with the help of our outstanding collaborators, I am very proud to say that we are close to achieving that goal." The newly discovered antibodies bind to a region that is highly conserved across not only the orthopoxvirus genus, to which MPXV belongs to, but also the entire poxvirus family, which means the region is conserved among different viruses and is not prone to mutations or antibody escape. The ability of these antibodies to block viral spread, protect from severe disease, and fully prevent death suggests that they are promising drug candidates that could be tested in humans for the prevention or treatment of mpox. "It is also the first time that monoclonal antibodies against orthopoxviruses were quantified in human sera. While the researchers see this as a promising next-generation therapy against mpox in humans, it is important to note that this is still in the research stage. Future testing in human clinical trials is needed to evaluate how the antibodies behave in the body, how long they last, where they go after being administered to the human body, and how well they prevent orthopoxvirus infection. Human monoclonal antibodies targeting A35 protect from death caused by mpox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A natural compound could help fight aggressive leukemia and amplify the effect of chemotherapy drugs. The research also shows a significant and unexpected finding, as forskolin was found to substantially increase the sensitivity of KMT2A-r AML cells to daunorubicin, a standard-of-care chemotherapy drug. Our findings have highlighted an exciting dual mechanism of action for forskolin. Combining forskolin with daunorubicin could lead to a more effective treatment strategy, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing the severe side effects often associated with AML treatments." Dr. Maria Teresa Esposito, Senior Lecturer in Biochemistry, University of Surrey Dr. Simon Ridley, Director of Research and Advocacy at leukemia UK, says: AML is one of the most aggressive and deadly cancer types, and this study not only deepens our understanding of KMT2A-rearranged AML but also opens the door to kinder, more effective treatments. Work like this is essential if we are to achieve our goal of doubling the five-year survival rate for AML within the next decade."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conference MDAngle offers personal perspectives from conference attendees, showcasing their anticipation, quick takeaways, and insights into how the presented research will affect their patients. The 2025 Society of Hematologic Oncology (SOHO) Annual Meeting will be held in Houston, Texas, on September 3-6. This year's program will spotlight the latest breakthroughs in blood‐cancer care, from next-generation immunotherapies to precision-medicine strategies, and will feature dedicated sessions on myelofibrosis, including strategies for disease management, risk assessment, and solutions for managing patients with anemia. Attendees can also look forward to data on novel JAK inhibitors, emerging antifibrotic agents, and combination regimens — including those for JAK inhibitor-naive patients — designed to improve quality of life and alter disease trajectory. John Mascarenhas, MDProfessor of Medicine, Tisch Cancer Institute; Director, Center of Excellence in Blood Cancers and Myeloid Disorders, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York“A lot of clinical trial data, both in the form of trials in progress, as well as updated data and baseline data, will be presented at SOHO and subsequent meetings. And this gives an opportunity for practitioners in the community to get a glimpse of where the field is going.” SOHO 2025: Previewing Advances in Myelofibrosis Dr Mascarenhas highlights numerous ongoing and upcoming clinical trials in myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, including innovative combination therapies and non-JAK inhibitor options. Studies such as SENTRY-2, POIESIS, MANIFEST-2, IMproveMF, VERIFY, and SURPASS-ET are exploring ways to achieve deeper, more durable responses and potentially expand approved treatments. Coming soon: Dr Mascarenhas highlights new data and progress regarding myelofibrosis and related syndromes immediately following SOHO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with type 2 obesity-driven diabetes tend to have more aggressive breast cancers, but no one knows exactly why. A new study by researchers at Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine and published in Springer Nature found that tiny particles in the blood, known as exosomes, which are altered by diabetes, can reprogram immune cells inside tumors making them weaker and allowing the cancer to grow and spread more easily. This is the first study to directly link exosomes from people with type 2 diabetes to suppressed immune activity inside human breast tumors." Gerald Denis, PhD, corresponding author, the Shipley Prostate Cancer Research Professor at BU The patient-derived organoid system developed by Denis and first author Christina Ennis, PhD, is the first to preserve original immune cells from human tumors, letting scientists study tumor-immune interactions in a lab setting that closely mimics real life. "Breast cancer is already challenging to treat, and people with type 2 diabetes have worse outcomes, but clinicians don't fully understand why," said Denis. This could help explain why current treatments, like immunotherapy, don't work as well in patients with diabetes. Knowing this opens the door to better, more personalized treatments for millions of people." Over 120 million Americans are diabetic or prediabetic, yet if they develop cancer, they are not treated differently in any significant way by the standards of treatment in oncology. Thus, this work addresses a serious public health challenge. This work was supported by grants from NIH: U01CA182898, U01CA243004 and R01CA222170 to G.V. Plasma exosomes from individuals with type 2 diabetes drive breast cancer aggression in patient-derived organoids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chemicals used to replace bisphenol A (BPA) in food packaging can trigger potentially harmful effects in human ovarian cells, according to McGill University researchers. A new study examined several chemicals commonly used in price stickers on packaged meat, fish, cheese and produce found early signs of potential toxicity. The research began with the 2023 discovery by Stéphane Bayen, Associate Professor in McGill's Department of Food Science and Agricultural Chemistry, that label-printing chemicals like bisphenol S (BPS), a BPA replacement, were leaching through plastic wrap into the food. He teamed up with colleagues in reproductive toxicology to investigate what these substances could be doing inside the body. Lab-grown human ovarian cells were exposed to four commonly used BPA substitutes: TGSA, D-8, PF-201 and BPS. Several of the chemicals, particularly TGSA and D-8, caused a buildup of fat droplets in the cells and changed the activity of genes that help cells grow and repair their DNA. Disrupting them doesn't prove harm in humans, but it gives us a strong signal that these chemicals should be further investigated." Bernard Robaire, co-senior author of the study and James McGill Professor in McGill's Departments of Pharmacology & Therapeutics and Obstetrics & Gynecology BPA is a chemical that can interfere with the body's hormones, and has been linked to problems with fertility, early development and metabolism. "It usually means one bisphenol has been swapped for another, and there are more than 200 of them. Some may be just as harmful, or even worse. We need to test these compounds before they're widely adopted, not after." Health Canada has now added all four substances to a list of chemicals requiring further investigation. For consumers looking to err on the side of caution, Robaire suggests removing labels and plastic wrap from fresh foods before storing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the most part, Keyanna Jones and her husband thought they knew what to expect when their daughter Chloë had eye surgery last fall. Even Chloë, who was in kindergarten, had a good understanding of how things would go that day. With no pediatric ophthalmologists near their home in Wentzville, Missouri, who would take their insurance, she asked the insurer to cover Chloë's out-of-network care as if it were in-network. The insurer agreed to let her see an out-of-network specialist. Chloë made it through surgery without a hitch. Jones said her daughter enjoyed a few popsicles at the hospital before going home. Initially, insurance paid just $1,775.79, leaving the Jones family owing $13,412.21 — until Chloë's uncle, who had recently finished his term as a state senator, asked a colleague to look into it. Months before Chloë inhaled bubblegum-scented anesthetic at Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in St. Louis, Jones discovered that it can be hard to find a pediatric ophthalmologist. The doctor recommended by Chloë's pediatrician wasn't contracted with their insurer, UnitedHealthcare, and the closest in-network specialist was in Wisconsin, hundreds of miles away. So Jones requested what's called a network gap exception, under which the insurer would cover the recommended doctor's services as in-network. Before the surgery was scheduled, she received a letter saying UnitedHealthcare had approved her request "because currently there isn't a doctor, health care professional, or facility in your area to provide these services." The letter listed several medical billing codes for eye services and said they would be covered "at the network level." But UnitedHealthcare declined to pay most of the surgery bill, covering it as out-of-network. With approval letters in hand, Jones said, she did not understand why the insurer apparently was not honoring its agreement to cover her daughter's treatment. In fact, the similar-looking letters granted different kinds of approval. UnitedHealthcare's gap exception approved Chloë's exams before the surgery as in-network. But in its prior authorization letter for her surgery with the same doctor, the insurer said only that it would cover it — without offering network discounts. "At that point, I didn't even know what to do," she said. She said she sent over a copy of one of the approval letters, which was on the company's letterhead, but a representative told her the letter hadn't come from UnitedHealthcare. "They said, 'You saw this surgeon, they're not covered and you didn't have permission, so, no, we're not going to pay,'" Jones said, recounting the phone call. An insurance representative told Jones she owed more than $13,000 because of "a balance billing issue." Eric Hausman, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group, said in a statement to KFF Health News that "we empathize with anyone who finds themselves in the unfortunate situation of being balance billed by an out-of-network provider for an amount significantly above market rates, and without any advance knowledge." Maryanne Wallace, a spokesperson for SSM Health, the health system that includes Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, provided a statement that said SSM followed "standard patient billing procedures." "Occasionally, an insurance company may process a claim as an out-of-network service, which can result in a balance being billed to the patient," the statement said. Jones said she was blindsided by the big bill. Nothing helped — until she reached out to her brother Caleb Rowden, who had been a Missouri state senator for eight years after serving four years in the state House. " I've never used my brother's political clout for anything," she said. Rowden told KFF Health News that he reached out to Travis Fitzwater, the state senator representing his niece's district. Jones contacted Fitzwater's office, too, and sent a complaint to Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. "We're not going to take a lot of credit for the result of it, because we didn't ask for anything other than a resolution, so that everybody can be at peace and move on with their lives," he said in an interview. In the end, Chloë's family paid nothing for her procedure — not even a copay. When it comes to insurance approvals, read the fine print carefully; "covered" does not mean an insurer will pay, let alone at in-network rates. Rowden and Fitzwater said reaching out to your elected representative's office can help. Advocating for constituents is part of their job. "They usually have an open line of communication with these insurance companies and hospitals," Rowden wrote in an email. "They may not always be able to get to a positive outcome since every situation is a little different, but they can usually get you to a next step." Jones is grateful that her brother was able to help, though she acknowledged that she probably would not have called him without a nudge from their mother.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists warn that unpredictable climate swings could bring mosquito-borne disease outbreaks years earlier than expected, urging governments to act now on surveillance and preparedness. Study: Climate variability amplifies the need for vector-borne disease outbreak preparedness. It demonstrated that internal climate variability (ICV) is a significant source of uncertainty about the climate's suitability for vector-borne diseases (VBD) transmission. Climate change is altering the dynamics of VBDs. For example, the population of Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit dengue, is increasing in Europe and North America. In 2023, local dengue transmission was reported for the first time near both Los Angeles and Paris, and even in the United Kingdom, the Aedes albopictus has been detected. Scientists combine climate projections with vector and pathogen dynamics to quantify the risks of future outbreaks. Three primary sources of uncertainty affect climate projections produced by general circulation models (GCMs). It is often quantified using multimodel ensembles. The second source of uncertainty concerns scenarios, e.g., future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathways. It is analyzed by running GCMs under different scenarios. Finally, ICV could cause aleatory uncertainty due to the climate's unpredictable nature. ICV concerns the natural fluctuations that occur regardless of external factors, such as GHG emissions. The current study, in the context of future VBD risks, partitioned climate uncertainty and exhibited the potential role of ICV in producing suitable climate conditions for future outbreaks. These outbreaks could occur sooner than expected under climate change alone. Daily temperature projections for London between 2030 and 2080 were obtained, and recorded weather station temperature data for 2020 were gathered. Next, existing temperature-suitability models for dengue transmission caused by Ae. aegypti were combined with temperature data to project the annual number of days suitable for transmission. The focus was on average uncertainty due to ICV over different models and scenarios. ICV was noted to drive a significant part of the uncertainty in the number of suitable days. This was notably true even decades into the future. For example, in 2080, 38% of the annual mean temperature's prediction interval (PI) could be attributed to ICV. These cities are not currently deemed to be at high risk of dengue transmission but may be at risk in the future. The suitability of transmission using recorded 2020 weather data was also evaluated. ICV-associated year-to-year temperature fluctuations led to the acceleration of heightened suitability. For example, on considering model and scenario uncertainty alone in a model of dengue transmission by Ae. The current study demonstrated that ICV may lead to suitable climate conditions for VBD transmission and recommended its inclusion alongside model and scenario uncertainty when generating climate-sensitive VBD projections. The authors emphasized that this has direct public health implications: proactive preparedness is needed, including vector surveillance at points of entry, breeding site control, clinical testing capacity, public information campaigns, and outbreak response planning. A few assumptions were made here, which could be relaxed in future studies. More complex methods could be employed to relax assumptions regarding the fitting of cubic polynomials to estimate ensemble mean values, uniformly weighting the climate scenario-model pairs when partitioning uncertainty, and assuming that the extent of ICV is time-invariant. The study also noted that additional climate factors (e.g., precipitation and humidity) and non-climate-related factors (e.g., human population density and intervention strategies) should be incorporated in future models to give more policy-relevant projections.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by researchers at National Jewish Health has found that recent infection with the common cold - often caused by rhinoviruses - may offer temporary protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The research provides fresh insight into why children are less likely than adults to develop symptoms and could point toward new ways to reduce the severity of respiratory illnesses. Researchers found that people, particularly children who had a recent rhinovirus infection, were significantly less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the following weeks. Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold. This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases." Max Seibold, PhD, senior author of the study, researcher and Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health They also analyzed airway gene expression to see how recent viral infections influenced the body's antiviral defenses. Children were found to have higher baseline expression of interferon-related genes - proteins that act as the immune system's first line of defense against viruses - compared to adults. While this phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, has been observed with other respiratory viruses, this is the first prospective study to show it may also occur with SARS-CoV-2. "This doesn't mean people should intentionally try to catch a cold," said Camille Moore, PhD and lead author of the study at National Jewish Health. "But understanding how one virus can affect the body's response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations." The research builds on earlier findings from the HEROS study showing that children are six times less likely than adults to develop symptomatic COVID. Moore, C. M., et al.
