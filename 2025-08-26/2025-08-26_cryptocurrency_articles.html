Peter Thiel-Backed Crypto Exchange Snubs London Listing Amid Liquidity Concerns, Weighs Frankfurt Or New York: Report Bitcoin Is ‘A Hedge Against All Of Bad Governance', Tim Draper Says Peter Schiff Predicts Bitcoin Could Sink To $75,000: ‘Sell Now, Buy Back Lower' Trader Notes: Crypto chart analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin sentiment on social media has dropped to its lowest point since June, signaling heightened negativity across the market. Combined with other indicators, analysts suggest the market may be moving into its late-cycle phase. Crypto trader Rager added context, noting Bitcoin's setup looks nearly identical to the September–January 4-month uptrend that ended with a swing failure pattern (SFP) and new highs before correcting and then launching another major rally in April 2025. While the depth of the coming correction remains uncertain, it was around 30% last time, he expects September and October could see a pullback, setting up a potential massive rally into Q4 2025 and Q1 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of Commerce plans to publish official economic statistics, including GDP data, on the blockchain, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday during a White House cabinet meeting. “The Department of Commerce is going to start issuing its statistics on the blockchain because you are the crypto president,” said Lutnick in a wide-ranging address that touched on tariffs, semiconductors, patents, and trade deals. The plan focuses on releasing GDP figures on-chain to enable people to “use the blockchain for data distribution,” Lutnick said. The department aims to expand its capability across other government agencies. “We're going to make that available to the entire government so all of you can do it,” Lutnick said. He noted that officials are “just ironing out all the details” to implement the program. The move would mark one of the first major implementations of blockchain technology for US government economic reporting. Elon Musk, ex-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously explored the implementation of blockchain technology at the government entity to improve transparency, automate tracking of federal spending, secure sensitive data, and streamline payment processes. However, the initiative remained in exploratory phases without full-scale implementation before Musk departed from DOGE. Don't have an account?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins - Users struggled to recover assets via Etherscan due to technical barriers and low trading volumes, despite a six-month shutdown notice, sparking frustration over opaque recovery processes. - CEO Yubo Ruan justified fees as operational cost coverage, while critics accused the platform of exploiting users, highlighting risks of centralized control in DeFi ecosystems. - Community members like 0xQuit provided free recovery guides, underscoring broader industry challenges in custody, accessibility, and governance for decentralized asset management. Parallel Finance, an NFT lending platform that announced its closure in January 2025, has sparked controversy by reportedly demanding a $500 fee for late NFT withdrawals. The platform, which suspended its NFT lending services after a six-month notice period ending on August 1, left users with over $800,000 worth of high-value NFTs still locked in its smart contracts. Despite the shutdown notice, many users failed to act before the deadline due to low NFT trading volumes and a lack of technical understanding for manual withdrawal processes [1]. With the platform's front-end no longer operational, users are required to interact directly with the contracts via Etherscan to recover their assets. This process, however, has proven challenging for non-technical users, leading to frustration and backlash. Screenshots shared on social media platforms showed CEO Yubo Ruan stating that a $500 fee would be charged per late withdrawal, citing the need to cover operational costs and protect lenders against potential losses [3]. Many users, particularly those unfamiliar with blockchain mechanics, found themselves unable to navigate the technical hurdles of direct contract interaction, raising concerns about the practicality of "self-sovereign" digital asset management [1]. The closure of Parallel Finance also reflects a broader trend in the NFT market, where platforms struggle to maintain relevance amid declining trading volumes and shifting user interests. It also highlights the potential for opportunistic behavior by platform operators, as some users have accused Parallel Finance of leveraging the situation to impose exorbitant fees for asset recovery [2]. As the market continues to evolve, incidents like these emphasize the necessity for robust user education and standardized protocols for asset recovery in decentralized systems [1].</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum price forecasts range from $7,500 by year-end and up to $20,000 in the most bullish scenarios. Dormant whale buys $28M in ETH as price drops 13%, signaling accumulation. Whales, BitMine, and ETFs add billions in ETH, reinforcing bullish demand. An Ethereum whale wallet has resurfaced after four years of silence, scooping up $28 million worth of Ether (ETH) in a move that has stirred bullish chatter across the market. On Tuesday, the entity withdrew 6,334 ETH (worth around $28.08 million) from Kraken in the past hour, according to onchain data cited by analyst CryptoGoos. Ether has dropped more than 13% since Sunday, slipping from above $5,000 to around $4,315, a decline the whale appears to have treated as a buying opportunity. The transfer is noteworthy because whale outflows from exchanges are typically seen as a bullish signal, suggesting accumulation and long-term holding, rather than imminent sell pressure. That indicates an exchange-to-self-custody flow typically associated with accumulation. Moreover, according to data resource Arkham Intelligence, a single whale bought and staked around $2.55 billion in ETH via Hyperliquid on Monday. Related: Tom Lee calls Ether bottom ‘in next few hours' as BitMine buys 4,871 ETH BitMine has an additional $200 million in reserves for further Ethereum purchases. Spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted more than $1 billion in inflows since Aug. 21, according to Farside Investors data, thus almost erasing $925.70 million in outflows witnessed four days prior. The steady capital adds to whale and corporate buying, reinforcing the view that ETH's dip is being treated as an entry point rather than a breakdown. Ether's ongoing rebound from summer lows near $3,350 to above $4,000 resistance is forming a “V-shaped” recovery, echoing past cycle bottoms that preceded major bull runs, according to analyst GalaxyBTC. In late 2020, ETH carved out a similar “V,” rising to more than $4,000 a year after plunging to roughly $100 during the March pandemic crash. Ethereum's technical setups suggest ETH's price could climb toward $10,000-20,000 in the coming months. Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, anticipates it to hit $7,500 by the year's end.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VANCOUVER, BC, Aug. 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group News Commentary – Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $124,000 in August as institutional demand reached unprecedented levels, with digital asset treasuries raising $15 billion in 2025 alone—eclipsing traditional venture funding for the first time in crypto history. The surge reflects a seismic shift as public companies now hold 951,000 BTC worth over $100 billion, while crypto treasury firms have become the most liquid trading vehicles on U.S. exchanges. This transformation from speculative betting to strategic corporate finance has attracted Fortune 500 companies, mining giants, and technology leaders who recognize digital assets as essential hedges against inflation and currency debasement in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion. Wall Street analysts project corporate Bitcoin allocations could reach $330 billion over the next five years, up from $80 billion currently, as companies deploy sophisticated capital market strategies including convertible debt, equity offerings, and specialized treasury vehicles. The regulatory landscape has fundamentally shifted under Trump's crypto-friendly administration, with Treasury Secretary Bessent declaring America's digital asset frontier "open again" while the landmark GENIUS Act provides clear stablecoin frameworks that institutional investors have long demanded. CEA Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: BNC) isn't your typical cryptocurrency story. While other companies scrambled to catch the Bitcoin wave or jumped on the latest trend, this Colorado-based firm made a calculated bet that could reshape how institutional investors think about digital assets. In August 2025, CEA Industries completed a massive $500 million private placement specifically earmarked for one purpose: building the world's largest corporate treasury of BNB tokens. BNB (originally called Binance Coin) is the native cryptocurrency of the BNB Chain ecosystem, which processes millions of transactions daily for everything from trading and payments to smart contracts and decentralized applications. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as digital gold, BNB has real-world utility baked into its design. Users can stake it to earn rewards, pay transaction fees at discounted rates, and participate in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Perhaps most importantly, BNB features a quarterly "auto-burn" mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation, creating built-in scarcity that could benefit long-term holders. They assembled what might be the most impressive crypto-focused management team on Wall Street. Russell Read, former Chief Investment Officer at CalPERS (managing over $400 billion in assets) and Deputy CIO of Deutsche Bank Asset Management, joined as CIO. This isn't a group of crypto newcomers making speculative bets. These are seasoned financial professionals who've managed billions of dollars and understand institutional-grade risk management. In August 2025, BNC announced the purchase of 200,000 BNB tokens worth approximately $160 million, officially making it the largest corporate holder of BNB globally. This wasn't just a headline grab—it demonstrated the company's ability to execute on its strategy quickly and at scale. While BNB consistently ranks among the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, most U.S. investors still can't buy it directly through traditional brokerage accounts. CEA Industries recognized this gap and positioned itself as the solution, offering regulated, SEC-compliant access to BNB exposure without the complexity of crypto wallets or exchange accounts. The company's financial backing adds credibility to its mission. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. served as lead financial advisor, bringing Wall Street expertise to the strategy. What sets BNC apart from other crypto treasury companies is its singular focus. While competitors diversify across multiple digital assets, CEA Industries made an all-in bet on BNB Chain's ecosystem growth. The company believes this focused approach will allow it to capture maximum value as institutional adoption accelerates. Similar treasury strategies by companies like Janover (Solana) and MetaPlanet (Bitcoin) produced dramatic stock price moves following their announcements. CEA Industries has positioned itself to potentially benefit from this same dynamic, but with an asset that powers one of the most active blockchain ecosystems on Earth. With plans to deploy the remaining treasury capital and potential access to an additional $750 million through warrant exercises, BNC appears built for the long game in an ecosystem that's just getting started.

(NYSE: CRCL) has achieved record-breaking growth in its USDC stablecoin circulation, reaching $61.3 billion at quarter end—a 90% year-over-year increase that has continued expanding to $65.2 billion as of August 10, 2025. The company's total revenue and reserve income grew 53% year-over-year to $658 million while completing a successful $1.2 billion IPO that established Circle as the leading regulated stablecoin issuer. USDC now commands a 28% stablecoin market share with 5.7 million meaningful wallets holding the digital currency. "Circle's successful IPO in June marked a pivotal moment—not just for our company, but for the broader adoption of stablecoins and the growth of the new internet financial system," said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman at Circle. Circle is launching Arc, an open Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoin payments with USDC as native gas, while expanding strategic partnerships with Binance, Corpay, FIS, Fiserv, and OKX to accelerate adoption. Upexi strategically acquired approximately 57% of its Solana portfolio as locked SOL at mid-teens discounts to spot prices. "During the month, we raised over $200 million and grew our Solana holdings by over 172% to 2 million SOL," said Allan Marshall, CEO of Upexi. "And we continued to generate additional value for shareholders via an estimated 8% staking yield and additional purchases of discounted locked Solana." Upexi continues expanding its Solana treasury through strategic purchases while benefiting from network upgrades including increased block limits to 100 million compute units and the launch of REX-Osprey's Solana Staking ETF. The company trades at competitive valuations with a Basic mNAV of 0.88x while maintaining its core consumer products business alongside its cryptocurrency treasury strategy. Bitfarms Ltd. (NASDAQ: BITF) (TSX: BITF) has reported strong operational results with $78 million in revenue and earned 718 Bitcoin at an average direct cost of $48,200 per BTC while maintaining 1,402 Bitcoin holdings (as of August 11, 2025). The company generated $100 million in proceeds from selling 1,052 Bitcoin at an average price of $95,500 during Q2 2025, demonstrating effective treasury management alongside mining operations. Bitfarms operates 17.7 exahash per second of mining capacity while expanding into high-performance computing and AI development. "Our North American energy portfolio positions Bitfarms to be a leader in HPC and AI infrastructure," said Ben Gagnon, CEO of Bitfarms. "With over 1 GW in our Pennsylvania pipeline, anchored by our flagship Panther Creek campus which is in close proximity to Amazon and CoreWeave sites, we aim to capture significant market share in what is quickly emerging as a new AI infrastructure hub." Bitfarms has commenced a corporate share buyback program purchasing 4.9 million shares at an average price of $1.24 per share while establishing a second principal executive office in NYC and committing to convert to U.S. GAAP. The company is advancing its multi-year pipeline of over 1.3 GW capacity with partnerships including T5 Data Centers for HPC/AI development at its Panther Creek campus. The company won 207 blocks during July and increased energized hashrate by 3% to 58.9 exahash per second despite facing higher global network difficulty. "Our Bitcoin holdings surpassed 50,000 BTC in July, a milestone that solidifies MARA as the second-largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin globally," said Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of MARA. "More importantly, this is a treasury we built through disciplined infrastructure development, scaled operations, and focused execution. MARA is preparing to energize its Texas wind farm data center in the second half of 2025 while treating Bitcoin as a productive, risk-managed asset through disciplined treasury management strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's a sharp pullback, but it's worth remembering Circle listed at $31 during its blockbuster IPO in June and is still up roughly  4x since. The recent decline comes as investors worry about potentially lower interest rates ahead. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted last Friday that a cut could be coming in September. Most futuristic stocks tend to celebrate that kind of news, but Circle is in a slightly different spot. Circle is best known as the issuer of USDC, the dollar-pegged stablecoin that runs on blockchains like Ethereum and Tron. The token is widely used across crypto trading, payments, and decentralized finance. Over the most recent quarter, revenues rose 53% year-over-year to $658 million, although IPO-related charges pushed Circle into a net loss. The real standout metric was USDC circulation, which jumped 90% from a year ago to $61.3 billion. That could open the door to mainstream adoption, especially as large companies outside crypto explore stablecoins for remittances, B2B transactions, and e-commerce. That said, it still trails behind Tether's USDT, which dominates with about 67% of the dollar-backed stablecoin market versus USDC's 26%, per CryptoQuant. For the upside case, see Circle Stock To $300? Now Circle wants to go a step further. The company recently unveiled Arc, a new public blockchain built specifically for stablecoin payments. The move puts Circle in direct competition with payments giants like Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), as well as the crypto networks it already relies on such as Ethereum and Solana. The shift is notable, as Circle would not just issue digital currency but also run the system that facilitates transactions and potentially collects fees. USDC will continue to exist on public blockchains, but Arc represents a push to own the rails of the payments ecosystem. A network only works if enough players use it, and several others are building their own systems. Circle will need to prove that Arc is worth building on. Can Visa And Mastercard Survive The Stablecoin Revolution? Add in the interest rate factor, and the near-term growth of Circle's core revenue stream looks vulnerable if conditions shift. Moreover, stablecoin demand is also tied to broader crypto cycles. To illustrate just how volatile the crypto sector can be, let's look at crypto trading bellwether Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). While COIN stock touched all-time highs of over $340 per share in late 2021, a few months after its IPO, it plunged to levels of around $30 by early 2023 – a roughly 90% collapse. A deep downturn in crypto markets or weaker interest income could push the stock down further. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said it agreed to form a joint venture with Crypto.com that will invest in the exchange's CRO token as a treasury asset and go public by combining with a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC). As part of the agreement, Trump Media will buy about $105 million worth of CRO, roughly 2% of the token's total market cap, while Crypto.com will buy $50 million in Trump Media stock. The venture will be called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy Inc. and plans to merge with Yorkville Acquisition Corp (YORK). It will trade under the ticker MCGA, which stands for “Make CRO Great Again,” Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said on X. The trend was kicked off in 2020 by Strategy (MSTR), which now owns $69 billion worth of BTC. More than 3.6 million BTC valued at $396 billion is held in treasuries across 174 public companies and 60 private companies, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Several companies are also buying altcoins, with billions of dollars being spent acquiring tokens like solana SOL$193.52 and ether ETH). Marszalek described the initiative as “a historic day for CRO,” pointing to an initial $200 million in cash earmarked for further token purchases, plus additional commitments that could bring total available funds to around $420 million, alongside a $5 billion credit line. “This presents a differentiated opportunity for investors in the digital asset treasury space,” he said, adding that the mission of Trump Media Group CRO Strategy is to maximize what he called a “flywheel effect,” which involves raising funds to acquire more CRO. The deal includes the creation of a new rewards system that will allow users to convert platform “gems” into CRO tokens, with further plans to enable subscription payments and discounted services using CRO. Trump Media said it will custody and stake its CRO holdings with Crypto.com for additional revenue. Trump Media Group CRO Strategy announced a $6.42b U.S. Dollar treasury play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum, ETH Treasuries at 'Good Entry Point' After Market Pullback: Standard Chartered Ethereum's pullback from all-time highs creates a "great entry point" for investors, according to Standard Chartered. Kendrick argues that this buying pressure has played an instrumental role in helping the world's second-largest cryptocurrency surge to $4,953 on Sunday—eclipsing the previous all-time high set in November 2021. "Although these inflows have been significant, the point is that they are just getting started," he added. Last month, Kenrick had predicted that treasury companies will soon own 10% of all ETH in circulation—and now, he says that target is well on track to be met. Kendrick previously argued that it makes more sense for treasury companies to hold ETH rather than BTC as a reserve asset. As such, we think ETH treasury companies have even more growth potential than BTC ones," he wrote in a note on July 29. That hasn't deterred investors from gaining exposure to ETH ETFs. And while BTC ETFs suffered outflows throughout the whole of last week, ETH funds managed to attract more than $628 million of capital across Thursday and Friday. ETH has rallied by 32.6% in the year to date, considerably ahead of Bitcoin on 17.3%. The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

At the end of last week, statements from Fed chair Powell at the Jackson Hole meeting were seen as a clear sign of an interest rate cut in September, which was positively received by risky markets. Ethereum, meanwhile, is looking to maintain its short-term upward trend after nearly reaching $5,000 on Friday. Solana has been trying to break into the $200 range since July. Recently, it made a strong attempt to stay above $200 and was performing well over the weekend. As a result, despite growing interest from institutions, SOL's price dropped sharply to around $185. Recent price movements indicate ongoing selling pressure in the $4,670-$5,000 range, marking it as a strong resistance area. This alignment with Ethereum's short-term trend suggests that it has been following an upward trajectory due to increasing bullish momentum since last month. Globally, many believe that the Fed will soon start cutting interest rates, particularly after Powell's comments. This positive outlook has prompted signals that Ethereum's upward trend might continue. However, a surprise event yesterday caused market instability, causing the Stochastic RSI, which was rising, to shift back into the selling zone. If Ethereum (ETH) can maintain daily closes above the $4,320 support level, it could continue its uptrend. This stability might encourage more buying activity, potentially allowing ETH to test the resistance levels again. On the downside, if selling pressure persists and ETH falls below $4,320, it could first drop to around $3,980. During the recent sell-off, it found some stability at an intermediate support level between $835 and $840, which aligns with the Fibonacci 1.414 level. To confirm this, short-term support levels will be monitored closely. If BNB closes below this level, the correction might become more noticeable. Conversely, if BNB experiences a strong buying wave this week and rises above $840 with significant volume, it could attempt another move towards the $900 level. SOL has been trying to break the Fibonacci 0.618 level at $200 since last month, maintaining its uptrend that began in April. If SOL stays above this level, and if the market can overcome the negative sentiment, it might make another attempt to reach $200. However, the market is currently more sensitive to negative news. So, if global market conditions worsen further, SOL's price could drop to its second support level at $165, continuing the downward trend. On the other hand, if SOL remains above its rising trend line during this week's market fluctuations, its chances of establishing a base around the $200 mark will improve. ****InvestingPro provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help investors make informed decisions in any market environment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of the Treasury has opened a request for comments on ‘innovative or novel methods, techniques or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.' The move fulfils a requirement under the relatively high-profile Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act), which was signed into law by president Donald Trump last month (18 July) to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the US. In particular, the Treasury Department is asking for views about ‘application program interfaces [APIs], artificial intelligence, digital identity verification, and use of blockchain technology and monitoring,' the department highlighted in a press release (18 August). ‘Innovative tools are critical to advancing efforts to address illicit finance risks but can also present new resource burdens for financial institutions,' the department states. ‘As required by the GENIUS Act, Treasury will use public comments to inform research on the effectiveness, costs, privacy and cybersecurity risks, and other considerations related to these tools.' STABLECOINS & APIs: EXPLAINED Stablecoins are a type of digital asset / cryptocurrency, minted on a blockchain network, that seek to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. The world's two biggest stablecoins (by market capitalisation) are Tether and USD Coin – both are, like most stablecoins, pegged to the US dollar |An API is a connection (or type of software interface) between computers or between computer programmes. Trump backs the GENIUS Act ‘because it protects consumers from nefarious actors in financial markets,' the White House continued in the fact-sheet, explaining that the law – which requires stablecoins to have 100 per cent reserve backing with ‘liquid assets like US dollars or short-term treasuries and requires issuers to make monthly, public disclosures of the composition of reserves' – will ‘ensure [stablecoins'] stability and trust through strong reserve requirements.' Under the new law, stablecoin issuers ‘must comply with strict marketing rules to protect consumers from deceptive practices', the White House stated, explaining that ‘they are forbidden from making misleading claims that their stablecoins are backed by the US government, federally insured or legal tender.' RELATED ARTICLE Trump signs stablecoin act into law as Washington steps on crypto gas – a news story (21 July 2025) on the presidential signing of the GENIUS Act into law On the challenge of ‘combatting illicit activity in digital assets,' the White House highlighted in its fact-sheet that the new law explicitly subjects stablecoin issuers to the Bank Secrecy Act, ‘thereby clearly obligating them to establish effective anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance programmes with risk assessments, sanctions list verification and customer identification'; and stated that it also improves the Treasury Department's ability to tackle illicit stablecoin activities by ‘enhancing its sanctions evasion and money laundering enforcement capabilities.' Meanwhile other government agencies worldwide are stepping up their use of identity verification to tackle financial fraud. For example, the UK's Companies House confirmed earlier this month (5 August) that legal requirements for directors and ‘people with significant control' of companies to verify their identities will begin on 18 November. ‘Companies of all sizes will benefit from more accurate and trustworthy register data and greater protections against fraud,' the agency said, explaining that people can verify their identity through GOV.UK One Login or through an ‘Authorised Corporate Service Provider' (ACSP).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bringing Crypto & Finance Closer to You The Middle East is emerging as a pivotal region in global crypto regulation. Governments are crafting frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. In sectors such as real estate and payments, we've already seen tangible usage, while CBDC pilots offer a glimpse into future financial infrastructure. Crypto regulation across the Middle East is shifting from ambiguity toward structured frameworks. Licensing regimes, from VARA in Dubai to Bahrain's CRA module, are enabling legitimized platforms, drawing both startups and institutional giants. Clear tax positions, such as Saudi Arabia's zero personal capital-gains policy and Bahrain's tax-free atmosphere, further attract digital investment. Meanwhile, GCC-wide CBDC pilots and growing KYC enforcement indicate a region preparing for a digital financial future. As regulatory clarity continues to converge, the Middle East stands poised to lead in regulated crypto innovation and adoption. Bringing Finance Closer to You.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But SEC Chairman Paul Atkins' announcement this summer of a new “Project Crypto” initiative is the latest and clearest signal that there's a new sheriff in town with a pro-reform agenda. Instead of another warning shot, the SEC is launching a Commission-wide initiative to modernize securities laws so America's financial markets can move from off-chain to on-chain and be positioned as the global leader in crypto markets. Atkins framed it simply: Despite what the SEC has said in the past, most crypto assets are not securities. But confusion over the application of the Howey test has led some innovators to treat all crypto assets as such. Chairman Atkins stated that these entrepreneurs need and deserve bright-line rules for determining whether the securities laws apply to their businesses. This is a sharp turn from the days when every token distribution risked being labeled an unregistered offering. With Project Crypto, the SEC is signaling that it wants innovation in digital assets to happen in the U.S., not overseas. Project Crypto calls for bright-line rules to end the guessing game. That includes tailored disclosures and possible safe harbors for early-stage tokens. In other words, the SEC wants to protect the right of investors to hold their own digital assets, while also fixing outdated custody rules so institutions can safely offer crypto services. Right now, crypto activity is fragmented: staking here, trading there, lending somewhere else. A key priority for Chairman Atkins is to allow market participants to innovate with “super-apps”, platforms that can offer multiple services under one roof, with regulators coordinating across agencies like the CFTC to make that possible. Securities intermediaries should be able to offer a broad range of products and services under one roof with a single license. Arguably the most ambitions component of Project Crypto is the “Innovation Exemption”, a fast-track pathway for new crypto projects to launch without being crushed by legacy compliance obligations, so long as they meet core investor protections. Under Chairman Atkins' vision, innovators would be able to enter the market immediately with new technologies and business models by complying with certain principles-based conditions designed to achieve core policy aims of the federal securities laws. These conditions may include, for example, a commitment to make periodic reports to the SEC, incorporate whitelisting or “verified pool” functionality and restrict tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features.tokenized securities that do not adhere to a token standard that incorporates compliance features. Chairman Atkins stated in his speech that he has directed the SEC staff to draft clear and simple rules for crypto asset distributions, custody and trading, and submit those rules for public comment. He also stated that as the SEC staff works to finalize these regulations, the SEC and its staff will in the meantime be considering using interpretative, exemptive and other authorities to make sure that archaic rules and regulations do not smother innovation and entrepreneurship in America. While Chairman Atkins' speech announcing Project Crypto doesn't immediately change current rules, it does instruct the SEC staff to focus on critical areas of digital asset regulatory reform. These include safe harbors for token issuance, authorization for custody and trading and the development of on-chain securities markets powered by decentralized finance or DeFi, an emerging financial system built on blockchain and cryptocurrency that aims to remove intermediaries like banks from financial services. A well-structured safe harbor would allow tokens to be created and distributed with clear guidelines, avoiding outdated securities laws.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Bitfinex report anticipated more significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins later in the cycle. Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates near current levels as capital inflows extend along the risk curve toward Ethereum and broader altcoins, according to Bitfinex Alpha's Aug. 25 report. Bitcoin declined 4.5% from the weekly open on Aug. 18 until Aug. 22, sliding to local range lows as investors de-risked ahead of the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium. The asset reached $111,990 amid renewed weakness in US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) flows, with Bitcoin ETFs recording $1.18 billion in net outflows over the week. As of press time, BTC lost the $110,000 threshold and is priced at $109,795.71. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole triggered a sharp rebound in risk assets, sparking a broad-based short squeeze across crypto. Ethereum led the recovery, surging to a new all-time high of $4,958.70 on Aug. 24 and demonstrating its role as a liquidity driver for institutional markets. However, Ethereum treasury companies absorbed substantial selling pressure, with preliminary estimates suggesting meaningful institutional support. Corporate treasuries, including SharpLink Gaming, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, and BTCS, accelerated accumulation, with on-chain treasury balances exceeding $10 billion. Bitcoin's realized cap expanded at 6% per month during the current move, compared to 13% monthly growth during late-2024 breakouts above $100,000, indicating more cautious investor appetite. Global liquidity conditions remain supportive, with the combined M2 money supply from major central banks approaching $100 trillion. The structural upward trend in global liquidity reinforces the long-term bullish case for digital assets, though capital allocation has become more selective. Solana climbed above $200 to reach $212.60 as the broader digital asset class pushed higher alongside equities, reflecting tightening correlations between crypto and traditional risk assets. Meanwhile, network development continues to advance, showcased by DBS Bank's recent tokenized note issuance on Ethereum. The report anticipated more significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins later in the cycle, with broader market re-rating dependent on renewed Bitcoin ETF inflows and new altcoin investment vehicles.
