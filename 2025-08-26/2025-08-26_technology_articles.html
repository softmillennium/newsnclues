                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Melania Trump has picked her project as first lady: proliferating AI. inclined that will task K-12 students with using AI tools to solve community-based problems, and made it clear that she will be the face of the Trump administration's AI push. Firstly, she'd be right for just about any cause you put in front of her because she is simply an ambient human. She can serve as the face of just about anything, and it is acceptable to most audiences because she's a largely inoffensive and sometimes even sympathetic figure. She's basically always polled with higher approval ratings than her husband despite standing by him for everything, like she's lovely wallpaper placed on the wall of a torture chamber. During her modeling career, she served as the spokesmodel for Camel cigarettes and faced basically zero pushback or objection for doing so because the attitude of the general public seems to be, “Who cares what Melania Trump does or did?” She's done everything from fashion to taking a page out of her book and redesigning the White House Rose Garden—the Melania's take is much less serene and more concrete, a real “paved paradise and put up a parking lot”-ass interpretation of Kennedy's work. Trump has even insisted that Melania is the “Jackie O” of our time, which, much like AI chatbots, is an innovation most of us simply never asked for. She also famously plagiarized a speech from Michelle Obama, which is a quality befitting the plagiarism machine that is AI. That whole situation also raised some interesting and previously underconsidered questions about copyright, which is something Big Tech firms (sucking up as much data and information as possible, regardless of copyright protections, to train their large language models) can certainly relate to. She got hit with plagiarism charges again in 2018 when she launched her first cause as First Lady, tackling cyberbullying, after it was discovered that her “Be Best” campaign bore a striking resemblance to an almost identical initiative that was started during the Obama administration. Melania told the New York Post that she hopes to become the “First Lady of Technology,” and she's already done a fair amount of embracing tech with very little discernment as to whether it's actually good or not. She's got some ideas, to be fair: the TAKE IT DOWN Act that she backed in an effort to stop non-consensual deepfakes of people from proliferating has its intentions in the right place, whether the approach is good policy is another question, and her anti-cyberbullying campaign had the right spirit (though she should maybe talk to her husband about his social media presence). But she's also happy to embrace tech without any real consideration of the consequences, whether that is the mostly harmless decision to publish an audiobook in which an AI model trained on her voice serves as the narrator or lend her name and likeness to a crypto memecoin that cost people millions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move will allow Anthropic to avoid what could have been a financially devastating outcome in court. In 2024, three book writers, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, sued Anthropic, alleging that the startup illegally used their work to train its artificial intelligence models. In June, California district court judge William Alsup issued a summary judgment in Bartz v. Anthropic that largely sided with Anthropic, finding that the company's usage of the books was “fair use” and thus legal. Alsup ruled that the book authors could still take Anthropic to trial in a class action for pirating their works; the legal showdown was slated to begin in December. Statutory damages for this kind of piracy start at $750 per infringed work, according to US copyright law. Because the library of books amassed by Anthropic was thought to contain approximately 7 million works, the AI company was potentially facing court-imposed penalties amounting to billions, possibly more than $1 trillion dollars. And the company recently hired a new trial team,” says Edward Lee, a law professor at Santa Clara University who closely follows AI copyright litigation. “But they had few defenses at trial, given how Judge Alsup ruled. So Anthropic was starting at the risk of statutory damages in ‘doomsday' amounts.” The Authors Guild, a trade group representing professional writers, sent out a notice alerting authors that they might be eligible earlier this month, and lawyers for the plaintiffs were scheduled to submit a “list of affected works” to the court on September 1. “That will be a very important barometer of where copyright owner sentiment stands.” Anthropic is still facing a number of other copyright-related legal challenges. One of the most high-profile disputes involves a group of major record labels, including Universal Music Group, which allege that the company illegally trained its AI programs on copyrighted lyrics. Settlements don't set legal precedent, but the details of this case will likely be watched closely as dozens of other high-profile AI copyright cases continue to wind through the courts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle-area tech veteran Matt Fisher is joining immersive media startup Adventr as a late-stage co-founder to help the company evolve how people use AI to create and interact with games, videos, music, movies and more. “What we're building takes the jump from just watching movies, videos, and games to actually stepping inside them. Suddenly, every player or viewer isn't just along for the ride, they can shape their own version of reality.” Fisher is especially bullish about how voice will be the dominant method of building content as well as interacting with it, especially in gamified media. And voice will drive “play” inside that specific piece of content. The company has already launched Adventr.tv, a streaming platform for console-less gaming. “We're strong believers that voice tears down the old walls and flips audiences into creators, opening the door to generative, interactive worlds that feel real,” Fisher said.

The Sonos Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is 20 percent off from Amazon, bringing it down to just $359 and tying its lowest-ever price. That's a great deal on our editors' favorite surround sound Sonos speaker, and it would make a perfect upgrade to your existing Sonos configuration or a place to start building your audio empire. The big draw here is spatial audio, which our team feels performs even better than Apple's Homepod (5/10, WIRED Review) when it comes to filling a room with sound. That's largely thanks to the array of drivers, including six speakers, four tweeters, and a pair of mid/bass drivers all packed into one vaguely robot-butt-shaped device. We also appreciate that the Era 300 has physical controls, in case you need to make quick adjustments without pulling out your phone. There's also Bluetooth pairing if you want to skip the Sonos app altogether and just hook your phone up directly. The app (now finally working again after some woes last year) provides a lot of value, though, letting you connect all of your speakers together for whole home audio, and it supports distinct speaker types, like soundbars and bookshelf speakers. They even found their way onto our favorite Bluetooth speakers list, despite having their own protocol for home audio. Our reviewer was particularly impressed with the audio quality on the Era 300, saying it sounded detailed and expressive whether they were listening to music or spoken word and calling it a “poised and eloquent listen.” Make sure to check out the full review for more details on why we like this speaker over the many other Sonos options.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charles Borges, the Social Security Administration's chief data officer, said in a newly released whistleblower complaint published Tuesday that other top agency officials signed off on a decision in June to upload “a live copy of the country's Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,” despite Borges raising concerns. Borges said members of DOGE, the team of former Elon Musk employees appointed to government under the guise of reducing fraud and waste, copied the sensitive database to an agency-run Amazon-hosted cloud server “apparently lacking in independent security controls,” such as who was accessing the data and how they were using it. Borges warned in the complaint that if this information were compromised, “it is possible that the sensitive [personally identifiable information] on every American including health diagnoses, income levels and banking information, family relationships, and personal biographic data could be exposed publicly, and shared widely.” The complaint said any compromise or unauthorized access to the database would have “catastrophic impact” on the U.S. Social Security program, describing a worst-case scenario as potentially having to reissue everyone's Social Security numbers. This is the latest accusation of poor cybersecurity practices by the administration and its representatives, including DOGE, since President Trump took office earlier in January. High-level career SSA officials have administrative access to this system with oversight by SSA's Information Security team,” the spokesperson added. In 2023, TechCrunch reported that the U.S. Department of Defense publicly exposed thousands of sensitive military emails online due to a security lapse. While the email data was stored in Microsoft Azure's separate cloud dedicated for government customers, a misconfiguration allowed the contents of a military unit's emails to publicly spill online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Low-price discount makes Samsung's 1TB drive one of the cheapest ways to add storage capacity to your laptop or desktop computer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Samsung's hybrid 990 Evo Plus SSD has hit a wonderful new all-time low price. We're outside of any sales event, with Labor Day being the next opportunity to pick up some sort of tech bargain if retailers participate. But that doesn't stop Amazon from offering this drive at the best price we've ever seen for this particular SSD. 1TB SSDs are very reasonably priced these days, with 1TB being the minimum size you'd want in a modern computer, as just the operating system can take up a hefty portion of the available storage, and only a couple of AAA games sucking up the rest, thanks to their ever-increasing installation sizes. With an original MSRP list price of $104.99, you're saving around 38% or $40, but the 990 Evo Plus has been selling regularly for around $74 - $79, so a more realistic saving discount is $10 - $15. The Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB is now available at an all-time low price, boasting speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s, a five-year warranty, and PCIe Gen 5x2/4x4 hybrid functionality. Similar 1TB options in the same price range can have less performance, feature slower QLC flash memory, and don't have PCIe Gen 5 and Gen 4 compatibility. This 1TB variant shares the same 236-layer (V8) V-NAND TLC as its bigger brother, the 990 Pro, which also boasts 600 TB of write endurance and a five-year warranty. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus is one of our favorite SSD drives thanks to its price and capacity ratios. Chuck into the mix that you can install this SSD in either an older Gen 4 system or a newer Gen 5 build. This is a great low-budget option for an easy storage upgrade.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“These are pragmatic programs that can be implemented quickly,” the document noted. “They will generate significant material improvements in our nation's cybersecurity almost immediately. “These steps will also put our nation's intermediate and long-term security on a measurably effective and economically sustainable path that will enable us to address newly growing threats of systemic failure,” it continued. “A recent GAO analysis found that among just four major federal agencies, 49% to 79% of cybersecurity requirement parameters were in direct conflict with each other,” he told TechNewsWorld. Some companies are spending nearly half their entire cybersecurity budget just filling out duplicative compliance reports.” “When cybersecurity professionals are buried in paperwork instead of defending networks, we're essentially doing the attackers' work for them,” he said. “Eliminating these duplicative requirements would immediately free up billions of dollars in resources that could be redirected toward actual threat detection, incident response, and security improvements.” The problem is not only that duplicative regulations waste time for anyone involved with them, but they are often different and sometimes at cross-purposes with each other, added Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist at KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider, in Clearwater, Fla. “NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] recommends not having a minimum password size, removing the need to change it on a periodic basis and removing the complexity requirement,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Most other cybersecurity guides, including many governmental regulations, require the exact opposite.” “The OMB's role is to coordinate regulations and look to see if they're inconsistent or duplicative or whatever,” said Berin Szóka, president of TechFreedom, a technology advocacy group, in Washington, D.C. “They can't repeal regulations as this document claims.” The ISA is also recommending that a cost-benefit analysis be required for all cybersecurity regulations. “Traditional cost-benefit frameworks, like OMB Circular A-4, break down because cyberattacks are low-frequency, high-impact events with cascading second-order effects.” “That said, forcing agencies to at least articulate assumptions, model scenarios, and test proportionality would raise the quality of regulatory drafting,” he told TechNewsWorld. Companies may argue that unless you can prove a breach will cost X amount of money, the regulation isn't worth it. NJIT's Bader agreed that the risk of using cost-benefit analysis to avoid necessary regulations is real and concerning. “Many cybersecurity benefits are preventative and systemic, making them difficult to capture in traditional economic models,” he said. “However,” he continued, “when properly implemented with methodologies that account for these uncertainties, cost-benefit analysis could actually improve cybersecurity by ensuring resources go to the most impactful security measures. The key is developing models sophisticated enough to handle the unique characteristics of cyber risk, rather than applying standard regulatory cost-benefit frameworks that weren't designed for this domain.” The definitions of what constitutes shareable cybersecurity information are too narrow for today's threat environment.” “With the advent of AI and the ability to build malicious code a lot faster than we've ever seen before, traditional ways of sharing information can't keep up with the threat,” added Matt Stern, chief security officer at Hypori, a mobile infrastructure security firm, in Reston, Va. “If we're going to even get parity with the threat,” he told TechNewsWorld. Fenix24's Renfrow added that private sector participation in sharing is still weak under the existing act. “Modernization should include liability safe harbors for companies that share indicators of compromise in good faith and reciprocal obligations for the government to return actionable intel in real time,” he said. In return, the students would be required to perform a specified amount of government service. “The PIVOTT Act's apprenticeship and rotation model is promising because it treats cyber talent like a renewable resource,” Renfrow said. “You move skilled practitioners across agencies rather than each agency trying to grow its own siloed pipeline.” “Four years is optimistic,” he added, “but without structural change like PIVOTT, the problem will persist indefinitely.” “Most people do not realize that just getting technology training at a university, college, or community college is not sufficient if you don't have a certification,” she told TechNewsWorld. It advised the National Cyber Director to collaborate with federal government agencies to promote a more sophisticated cyber risk assessment methodology based on the proven NACD-ISA framework. “We desperately need a national cybersecurity dashboard because our current approach to cyber risk assessment is fundamentally broken,” Bader said. “Right now, we have dozens of agencies doing their own cyber risk assessments with no coordination or common methodology. “The NACD-ISA framework that would underpin this dashboard has been independently validated by MIT and PwC research,” he continued. “Organizations using these principles have 85% fewer cyber incidents and significantly better risk management outcomes. This isn't theoretical — it's a proven approach that works at the enterprise level.” His areas of focus include cybersecurity, IT issues, privacy, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence, big data and consumer electronics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Framework, the company behind several generations of ultra-repairable and modular laptops and mini PCs, is the only company that can call its devices an option if you demand true customizability. The company is back again with a new iteration of its Framework 16, packing new CPU and GPU options with a full-fledged removable Nvida option. The GPU is mostly limited by its 8GB of GDDR7 VRAM, which is going to hinder it for higher resolutions and for real future-proofing. If you don't want to upgrade for a while, you're better off with a discrete graphics processing unit with at least 16GB of VRAM. Instead, Framework's modularity means that you could upgrade your GPU rather than having to buy an entire new and increasingly expensive gaming laptop. This module will support up to 100W TDP, which on older modules would push the fans to jet engine levels. Framework claims it reengineered its thermal design to keep the device cool while being less noisy. The last-gen Framework 16 made use of an AMD Radeon RX 7700S graphics module. It was enough for some graphics scenarios, but in the end it wasn't nearly as capable as a full discrete Nvidia GPU. While AMD still has not offered any hint it plans to bring its Radeon RX 9000 series desktop graphics cards to laptops, gamers' only choice for mobile graphics capable of playing the latest AAA releases is still Team Green. Now that it's inside a removable module built for Framework's laptops, I can already see it becoming a go-to for DIY builders trying to come up with their own unique PCs. If you don't want either, you can go for the Expansion Bay shell with room for other components. As for RAM and storage, you can opt for RAM up to 96GB and up to 10TB of storage through the two M.2 SSD slots. There's something intrinsic about knowing you put something together—that you know what's inside it and how to take it apart if necessary. That sense of ownership unfortunately comes at a premium. The device comes stock with a 2,560 x 1,600 IPS LCD panel that goes up to a 165Hz refresh rate with Nvidia G-Sync. Gaming laptops that range from $2,000 on up normally offer mini LED or OLED displays with better contrast and/or brighter screens. The starting price is $100 more than the 2023 model, and you can expect individual modules will cost more, as well. Still, the thought of finally having a true gaming-ready laptop with Framework's customizability is enough to spark a hint of joy, even from somebody who has clacked away on way too many gaming laptops in 2025 alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Built on Intel's 18A node, the all-E-core Xeon packs 288 cores per socket and promises big efficiency gains. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Intel pulled the wraps off its first all-E-core Xeon at Hot Chips on Monday, August 25, in Cupertino, California. Scheduled to ship in 2026, the processor packs a punch with 288 efficiency cores and a two-socket ceiling of 576 cores, as well as over 1,152 MB combined last-level cache. The new Darkmont E-cores offer a wider 3x3 decode engine, deeper out-of-order windows, and enhanced execution ports, resulting in approximately 17% better IPC than the Crestmont generation. Clearwater is one of the first real-world testbeds for Intel's 18A node, which pairs RibbonFET transistors with backside power delivery. This is effectively Intel's answer to the density and power efficiency questions that have enabled TSMC and AMD to dominate in recent years. By separating power and signal routing, Intel claims higher cell utilization and lower IR drop, features that hyperscalers care about when power bills stretch into megawatts. Compared to AMD's 128-core Bergamo, Clearwater plays an entirely different game. AMD cores support SMT, AVX-512-class vector units, and higher single-thread performance. That means Clearwater might not top benchmarks in HPC or AI training, but in raw thread count and total throughput, Intel says it's well ahead. A two-socket Clearwater box can theoretically support over 1,000 vCPUs per rack, while Intel is claiming 3.5x better perf-per-watt versus its previous Xeons. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The bigger question is whether customers buy into Intel's efficiency-first bet. For decades, Xeon has been synonymous with P-cores, but Clearwater is different. It's a data center processor that doesn't care about prestige benchmarks, but rather how many workloads it can cram into a rack without blowing the power budget. If Intel's numbers hold, the firm expects Clearwater Forest to redefine what Xeon is supposed to be, rather than simply being a new iteration. Although his background is in legal, he has a personal interest in all things tech, especially hardware and microelectronics, and anything regulatory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Long Island UFO hunters have been called upon by some domestic law enforcement to investigate unexplained phenomena. On a Friday evening last December, every tier of US law enforcement—federal, state, and local—was dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a military research installation outside Boston. A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base's restricted airspace. One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he's ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick's municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump's golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. The Tedescos' roving aerial surveillance unit, which they've dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. “It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who're telling me that there's this ship in the ocean that's launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.” The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard's alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don't know how much you've talked to those guys. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.” As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren't so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights. “It wasn't actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It's an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today's more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like Star Trek, Chiller Theatre, and Lost in Space. The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler's roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”) Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses. They've used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. They've also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can't explain. “We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.) The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos' “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.” But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said. Ultimately, the Tedescos didn't have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach's Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025. The Tedescos couldn't use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they've picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters. I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It's used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast. “For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment. Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. It's hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute's b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law. At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers' Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I've seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I'd say some are certainly ours.” “It's one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn't go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they're being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There's things they can do that will end NSA's ability to collect.” “We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO's former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. On another podcast, Phillips said AARO's own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town's fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful. When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos' equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team's consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Lauzon, Natick's deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos' “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don't have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA. But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all. “We're seeing anomalies in our airspace and we're just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me.
