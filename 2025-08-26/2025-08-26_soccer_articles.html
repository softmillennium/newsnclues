                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic is back with the U.S. men's national team after skipping this summer's Gold Cup. But there was no place for Pulisic's fellow 2022 World Cup starters Weston McKennie and Matt Turner as USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino named his 23-player roster for the Americans' September friendlies against Korea Republic and Japan. Also returning are 2022 veterans Tim Weah, Sergino Dest and Josh Sargent, who will get another chance to compete for the No. 1 striker job with Gold Cup starter Patrick Agyemang still recovering from hernia surgery and Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi having just returned from serious injuries of their own. Like Balogun and Pepi, Fulham left-back Antonee "Jedi" Robinson will also remain with his club during the international break, having just seen his first Premier League action of the season on Sunday. So will Malik Tillman, who has yet to debut for new team Bayer Leverkusen because of a calf problem. McKennie played only the final minutes of Italian titans Juventus's Serie A opener last weekend. So was Johnny Cardoso, who joined Spanish power Atlético Madrid for $35 million last month. Cardoso has started each of Atléti's first two La Liga matches. Gold Cup depth center backs Mark McKenzie, Miles Robinson and Walker Zimmerman were passed over in favor of Hawaii-born Noahkai Banks, an 18-year-old who made eight Bundesliga appearances last season for Augsburg, and Vancouver Whitecaps journeyman Tristan Blackmon, 29. "We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall," Pochettino said in a statement. Banks and Blackmon are among four uncapped players on the roster. Forwards: Damion Downs, Southampton (England); Christian Pulisic, AC Milan; Josh Sargent, Norwich City (England); Timothy Weah, Marseille (France); Alex Zendejas, Club América (Mexico) Doug McIntyre is a soccer reporter for FOX Sports who has covered United States men's and women's national teams at FIFA World Cups on five continents.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pulisic will be back with the US after asking out of summer games However, in a surprise move, Juventus midfielder Weston McKennie was not named among head coach Mauricio Pochettino's squad. The federation did not elaborate as to whether this player could be McKennie, a US regular who came on as a sub for Juventus over the weekend, or some other player. Goalkeeper Matt Turner, who made an offseason loan move back to MLS in search of regular playing time, misses out, as will strikers Folarin Balogun, Ricardo Pepi, and Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Malik Tillman, and defender Antonee Robinson, all of whom are either injured or returning to action after time on the sideline. That includes Norwich City's Josh Sargent, who has been on fire to start the season, scoring in all four matches he's played in all competitions for the Canaries. Sergiño Dest also makes his return to the US team after recovering fully from last season's ACL tear. The squad is also notable for the holdovers from that Gold Cup squad: 12 in total, including goalkeeper Matt Freese, defenders Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten, and Nathan Harriel, midfielder Jack McGlynn, and striker Damion Downs. There are also a couple of surprise inclusions: 18-year-old center back Noahkai Banks, the Hawaii-born German-American who made his Bundesliga debut earlier this year with Augsburg, and goalkeeper Jonathan Klinsmann, the son of former US head coach Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann may still be most notable to many US fans for his jab at Landon Donovan on social media after his exclusion from the 2014 World Cup squad – an incident that occurred when he was 17. Celentano will be looking for his first cap with the US, having only appeared in training camps before. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Noahkai Banks (FC Augsburg), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando City), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace) There are some regulars in this group one would think could easily start at the 2026 World Cup (Richards, Ream and Dest), but the rest are all players looking to secure a spot on next year's roster. Tristan Blackmon, 29, has been rewarded after years of solid center-back play for the Vancouver Whitecaps. Banks is an intriguing prospect who has made appearances for the US youth teams. McKennie misses out, as does Milan's Yunus Musah, Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson, and Atlético Madrid's Johnny Cardoso, with the latter two having been on the 2025 Gold Cup roster. Damion Downs (Southampton), Christian Pulisic (Milan) Josh Sargent (Norwich), Tim Weah (Marseille), Alex Zendejas (Club América) He'll have a point to prove in this camp, where he'll be joined by the red-hot Sargent and Weah, who moved from Juventus to Olympique Marseille over the summer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>East Coast Friendlies vs. World Cup Qualified Nations Korea Republic on Sept. 6 in New Jersey and Sept. 9 in Ohio; CONCACAF Gold Cup Best XI Man Luna Returns to RSL Ahead of Next MLS Match ATLANTA / HERRIMAN, Utah (Tuesday, August 26, 2025) – Real Salt Lake star Diego Luna has been named by U.S. Men's National Team Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino amongst the 23 players selected for upcoming U.S. friendlies on Sat., Sept. 6 and Tues., Sept. 9 against World Cup-bound opponents Korea Republic and Japan. A total of 22 players have been rostered, with one addition to be confirmed. “We have a number of players just returning from injuries or who have had very limited minutes in the last couple months, so they can take this moment to continue to build fitness and sharpness for the upcoming opportunities in the fall.” Real Salt Lake (9-14-4, 31 points, 10th West / 20th Shield) will host a “mini-preseason” the next few weeks, with four of its next five matches to be played at home beginning with a Sporting Kansas City visit to America First Field in Sandy on Sat., Sept. 13. The USA will first host Korea Republic, presented by Haleon, on Sept. 6 at Sports Illustrated Stadium in Harrison, N.J. Kickoff from the home of the New York Red Bulls is set for 3:00 p.m. MT, with the match broadcast live on TNT and Telemundo, and streamed on Max, Universo, and Peacock. USA-Japan, presented by Allstate, comes nearly 25 years after the USMNT's first visit to Columbus, Ohio and what has become a special place in U.S. Soccer history. Both matches will be carried live on radio as Westwood One Sports delivers English language commentary from on-site for the first time while longtime partner Fútbol de Primera has the Spanish language call. Luna – RSL's leading 2025 scorer with eight goals and five assists this season, equaling his goal output from last year in half as many MLS matches – is one of 12 players on the friendly roster returning from the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup runner-up U.S. roster. Luna is one of two players –joining defender Chris Richards – who were named to that tournament's Best XI. Richards started all six matches and scored two goals, while Luna tallied three goals and two assists and earned Man of the Match honors after scoring twice in the semifinal win against Guatemala. Earlier this year, Luna earned the game-winning assist during his first 45 minutes played under Pochettino, suffering a shattered nose in the process, during a January friendly against Costa Rica. During the CONCACAF Nations League consolation match, Luna was bright and assertive against Canada, as the 2024 MLS All-Star selection and reigning MLS Young Player of the Year continues to press for 2026 FIFA World Cup inclusion. DEFENDERS (8): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew; 10/1), Noahkai Banks (FC Augsburg/GER; 0/0), Tristan Blackmon (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 0/0), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven/NED; 33/2), Alex Freeman (Orlando City; 7/0), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union; 1/0), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC; 74/1), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/ENG; 31/3) MIDFIELDERS (6): Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/ENG; 50/2), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/CAN; 6/0), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC; 31/1), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake; 12/3),Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo; 11/2), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew; 1/0) FORWARDS (5): Damion Downs (Southampton/ENG; 5/0), Christian Pulisic (AC Milan/ITA; 78/32) Josh Sargent (Norwich/ENG; 28/5), Tim Weah (Marseille/FRA; 44/7), Alex Zendejas (Club América/MEX; 11/1) Christian Pulisic leads all players on the roster with a total of 78 appearances. SergiñoDest will be looking to add to his 33-cap total – more below - while Luca de la Torre and Chris Richards each reached 31 caps during this summer's second-place finish at the Gold Cup. After two years at Juventus in Italy's Serie A, forward Tim Weah is back to France and Champions League football. Marseille finished second in Ligue 1 last year behind Champions League winners PSG. Damion Downs' Southampton will be looking to make a quick return to the English Premier League after being relegated at the end of last season. Tim Weah spent a year in the same academy before beginning his European adventure at PSG. Meantime, Max Arfsten and Sean Zawadzki currently lace them up for the Columbus Crew. Alex Zendejas appeared in each of the first four matches during Mauricio Pochettino's tenure last fall. The 27-year-old had 12 goals in 48 matches across all competitions for Club América last season. The MLS duo of Roman Celentano and Sean Zawadzki took part in the 2024 January Camp with Zawadzki earning his first appearance on Jan. 20 against Slovenia. Tristan Blackmon gets his first crack since January of 2022. • Ten players are based outside of MLS: England (4), Italy (2), France (1) Germany (1), Mexico (1) and Netherlands (1). • Forward Alejandro Zendejas earns his first camp call-up of 2025. The Club America attacker was last summoned in November 2024 and came off the bench in both Concacaf Nations League quarterfinal legs against Jamaica. • Having begun their professional careers as members of the New York Red Bulls in midfielder Tyler Adams (2015-2019) and defender Tim Ream (2010 will return to Sports Illustrated Stadium on Sept. 6 against Korea Republic.

Matt Freese follows close behind with seven clean sheets for New York City FC. • Seventeen players on this roster took part in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, with 12 coming through the MLS Academy ranks: Tyler Adams (New York Red Bulls), Max Arfsten (Cal Odyssey), Sebastian Berhalter (Columbus Crew), Roman Celentano (Chicago Sockers), Luca de la Torre (Nomads, San Diego Surf), Alex Freeman (Weston FC, Orlando City), Matt Freese (Philadelphia Union), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union, Clearwater Chargers), Jonathan Klinsmann (Pateadores, Strikers FC), Diego Luna (San Jose Earthquakes, Barcelona Residency), Jack McGlynn (BW Gottschee, Philadelphia Union), Christian Pulisic (PA Classics), Chris Richards (FC Dallas), Josh Sargent (St. Louis Scott Gallagher), Tim Weah (BW Gottschee, New York Red Bulls), Sean Zawadzki (Columbus Crew), Alejandro Zendejas (FC Dallas).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yunus Musah joins "The Football Reporters" podcast to explain why he chose not to be a part of the USMNT's 2025 Gold Cup squad. United States and AC Milan midfielder Yunus Musah's target for the next year is as clear as it is ambitious. "The nearest goals and achievement for me are winning trophies here at Milan," he tells ESPN. "This season we have the possibility to win three trophies [Serie A, Coppa Italia, Italian Supercoppa]. I'd love to win all three of them. So, a club treble in Italy followed by the FIFA World Cup? - Is Gladbach the place to revive Reyna's beleaguered career? The likelihood of that scenario becoming reality has been tested at both club and international level this summer. As Musah sits down in his Milan home for an interview on ESPN's "The Football Reporters" podcast, there are two pressing issues to address. Firstly, the reason for his omission from the USMNT squad which reached last month's Concacaf Gold Cup final, losing narrowly 2-1 to Mexico. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino said Musah had "communicated to us a personal reason, so he needed to withdraw from involvement." "The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team." It was a decision criticised by some but in an era where concerns over player welfare are often voiced but rarely acted upon, the 22-year-old took charge of his situation. "It was a very tough decision because people could easily say 'everyone else is playing, why aren't you?' But no one else is in my body, no one else is in my head," Musah adds. "Everyone that knows me knows I am honest and a hardworking guy but when times are like how they were and I couldn't carry on playing for that summer, I had to take that decision for myself. "No one else knows how I feel and I hope that people understood my decision and it was about taking care of myself and being able to come back ultimately and be able to give my best for the rest of the season." Musah now looks likely to begin that task at Milan despite encountering difficulties since Massimiliano Allegri replaced Sérgio Conceição as head coach in May. The following month, Milan sporting director Igli Tare claimed Musah "doesn't have the characteristics" to play in Allegri's preferred three-man midfield, hinting strongly at his departure. Napoli, Nottingham Forest and, most recently, Atlanta have all been tracking Musah but, amid reports that Allegri is more inclined to utilize him this season, remaining in Italy is clearly the player's focus. I'd love to win some great things here. It felt really nice winning the Super Cup last season so I'd love to win more things. This is what we're expected to do here. I am just happy here and I am looking to work hard and be a main player in the team." He has had Christian Pulisic, who arrived in the same summer two years ago, for company and the USMNT pair have become closer over time. "We've actually bonded very well since both joining AC Milan," Musah says. I get to learn a lot from him every day and in the matches. He has had a great seasons here. He's a great guy so I am enjoying playing with Christian." Musah's positive and measured response to recent challenges is indicative of a player who has long demonstrated bravery beyond his years, right back to when he turned down a new contract at Arsenal to join Valencia in 2019 aged just 16.

"My parents weren't so keen because it wasn't like Arsenal were releasing me or anything," says Musah, who was born in New York City to Ghanaian parents before moving to Italy and then to London aged nine. "There were a few hard things in that process, like convincing my parents and then settling in at Valencia, settling in with the language, the style of play, new people, new surroundings. His Muslim faith is extremely important to him. "When tough things happen to me, I might dwell on them for a minutes but afterwards I understand there is a bigger purpose. And yet, talking his parents around was not easy. Ultimately, we managed to convince them somehow. My brother [Abdul] was with me, he was on my side and we managed to convince them." Yunus Musah names a list of Premier League and Serie A greats who helped inspire him to become the player he is today. Musah cites Mesut Özil and Yaya Touré as inspirations growing up watching the Premier League and remains fond of Arsenal -- friends, even, with several current players including Bukayo Saka. He reached out to in support after the England winger was racially abused following the Euro 2020 final defeat to Italy in which Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho all missed in the penalty shootout. Musah simply saw a quicker route to first-team football in Spain. I would stick to the plan until it worked," he said. Dan Thomas is joined by Craig Burley, Shaka Hislop and others to bring you the latest highlights and debate the biggest storylines. So much so that international teams began circling by the time he was 17 with his nomadic life to that point creating eligibility for four nations: Ghana, the U.S., England and Italy. Musah played for four England age groups up to the under-18s but first contact by the USMNT came in 2020 through assistant Nico Estévez, who had connections at Valencia after eight years working at the LaLiga club. Then Gregg Berhalter, head coach of the USMNT for five years across two spells, began his charm offensive. "Gregg called me and that was really huge for a 17-year-old to get a call from the men's national team coach," Musah says. He said there were no strings attached, I could just come to the camp, see what it's like, enjoy it and that's what I did. And also I had an amazing time with the England setup. I went to so many camps, played with great players, great coaches and ultimately I started my career playing in Valencia's first team and then Gregg called me to play for the [U.S.] men's first team as a 17-year-old. Musah went on to play at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and would win that year's U.S. Soccer Young Player of the Year award. Berhalter has since been replaced -- via interim stints for B.J Callaghan and Mikey Varas -- by Pochettino, who led a run to the final of the Gold Cup earlier this summer in Musah's absence. "I have a lot of love for Gregg," Musah says. I had most of my caps under Gregg. We have a great manager again now so I am lucky to be able to play under two great managers. "First of all, we train very hard. We work very hard in training so that we are prepared in matches to be able to play at that intensity. He is very keen on the energy we bring out on the field and how much we want it. That's something that we have to bring back in our team, the fire we bring into matches that helped us in a lot of games against the big teams. Mauricio is trying to get that fire in us and make sure when teams come to play us they have a really tough time." And Pochettino, formerly head coach Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, is not shying away from the expectation of the biggest tournament of all on the horizon: next year's home men's World Cup, hosted along with Mexico and Canada. "But we've seen it time and time again where you can say the underdog goes on and does it. We go into the tournament with that belief. I think if you go into the tournament thinking you are not going to win it is quite pointless, so we will go into the tournament thinking we can do it and give our fans, ourselves, our families, the best satisfaction we can. "I know that non-football fans, celebrities, you name it, are going to be behind the team just because we are the U.S..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY, Mo — We are less than a year out from the FIFA World Cup taking center stage in the Heart of America. We know, Kansas City will host six matches including two knockout games, but what can we really expect a year from now? Chris Donahoo lives in Kansas City and to say he's a die-hard soccer fan is understatement. 20 years ago, he and a group of 9 friends grabbed their passports and traveled to Cologne, Germany for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. "We traveled there, there wasn't a lot going on as far as fandom around the World Cup for Team USA, and when we were there, we were thinking the whole time, how cool would it be if there was a meeting place, or some kind of event set up for the U.S. for fans that are going, because we'd see U.S. jerseys, we'd run into U.S. fans everywhere, but there was no organization," recalled Donahoo. He's part of the KC chapter, and his passion for all things World Cup has even taken him as far as Brazil in 2014. He says it was a life-changing experience that led him to attend men and women's World Cup tournaments across South Africa, Brazil, Germany, Quatar and more. Roger Espinoza, Sporting KC legend who proudly wore an Honduras jersey during the 2010 and 2014 World Cup tournaments and represented La H in the 2012 Olympics tells KSHB41, playing in the World Cup was a moment he has been working for all his life. "As a little kid, you just dreamed of that, and being able to get to that level in 2010 and then 2014, it just brought back all the memories, when you were young, dreaming and working hard. KC 2026 estimates 650,000 fans will come to KC for the biggest sporting event in the world, which is why Donahoo's biggest piece of advice is securing a babysitter and planning to be at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, if you're lucky enough to score a ticket. "I'm going to take my oldest son, so I'm going to be working with a babysitter for my youngest son, so my wife and I will probably be heading out to Arrowhead very early," said Donahoo." It's going be the summer, there's going be some heat, but I promise you will not regret getting out there early and taking in all the things, all the activities, talk to as many people as possible, welcome people to our city. Austin says if you don't have tickets, the FIFA Fan Fest at the World War I Memorial will be a fiesta you don't want to miss. "You can watch all the games, you can be around all the fans, it's a free experience to participate in, so I think that's certainly one way that locals can enjoy the World Cup," said Austin. "But I also think already you're seeing cities and the business community plan events to be able to embrace the visitors that are here. I think you're gonna see a huge amount of interest, and you're gonna see a lot of different activities and events available for the community to participate." The final match of the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held on Sunday, July 19, 2026, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. But once the tournament is over both players and fans believe KC will be triumphant in winning the hearts of all that came to visit. "I have no doubt that it will be a very loud stadium, fans traveling, but you know, every country has its unique way, and I think that any country that Kansas City hosts is going to be  a special moment and the United States being a country of immigrants, I don't think any team will have a problem having fans," said Espinoza.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlo Ancelotti is aiming to continue a strong World Cup qualification campaign after naming his Brazil squad for the next round of matches in September. Former Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti, 65, was appointed as the head coach of Brazil in May. Ancelotti changed that and recalled Casemiro, along with Antony, to his first squad as Brazil boss earlier this year. Before Ancelotti's arrival, Antony and Casemiro missed out on a place in Brazil's 2024 Copa America squad and had not represented their country since 2023. Meanwhile, Antony was rejuvenating his career on loan at Real Betis, earning a recall by scoring goals and assists in La Liga before returning to Old Trafford at the end of the season. The 26-year-old has shown encouraging signs in his first two competitive appearances for United, although he is still waiting for his first win since joining the club. Cunha has done enough to warrant a place in Brazil's squad for Brazil's final round of South American qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup against Chile and Bolivia. Matheus Cunha and Casemiro have both been called up to the latest Brazil squad 🇧🇷❤️ pic.twitter.com/FRY0FswSlh Brazil have already booked a place at the World Cup next year, which allows Ancelotti to experiment with his squad over the next two matches. The latest Brazil squad will come as a blow for United outcast Antony. As a result, Ancelotti has had no other choice but to overlook the winger, as he's missed pre-season and is not playing regular football for his club. That is why it was important for Antony to secure a move away from United earlier this summer. Antony's chances of representing Brazil in the near future are slim if the tricky winger fails to secure a move to a new club.</p>
