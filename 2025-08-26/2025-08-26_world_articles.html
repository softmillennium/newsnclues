                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,' Trump tells education secretary in cabinet meeting Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in federal funding to the Ivy League university. “Don't negotiate with them, they've been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in a cabinet meeting. Trump's comments came amid reports that his administration and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end to their months-long battle over the government's allegations that Harvard has not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests. The university has argued that the administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the university in retaliation for the school's refusal to comply with a series of demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force. Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions practices. A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the Department of Justice last month. The Department of Justice has argued that the federal government has the authority to cancel grants when institutions violate presidential directives, and have cited Trump's executive order purporting to combat antisemitism. However, key terms reportedly remain unresolved, with negotiations still continuing. In July, it was also reported that Harvard agreed to comply with federal demands to turn over employment records for thousands of staff members. Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have made unprecedented efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite universities over their handling of the pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, DEI programs and more. Several other universities that have faced federal funding cuts – including Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have reached settlement agreements with the administration to restore research funding. However, some education advocates decried that deal as a blow to academic freedom. The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal watchdog investigation into former special counsel Jack Smith's two prosecutions against President Donald Trump is based on “imaginary and unfounded” accusations, attorneys for Smith said in a letter obtained by CNN. Smith spearheaded the two federal criminal cases brought against Trump - one for allegedly mishandling classified documents and another for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were abandoned by Smith after Trump won reelection. Smith followed well-established legal principles in conducting the investigations into President Trump, and the courts presiding over the resulting prosecutions have already rejected the spurious allegations that the manner in which Mr. Smith prosecuted these cases was somehow improper,” his attorneys Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski wrote. Trump's tortured history of legally targeting his foes Trump appointed Greer to the role in an acting capacity after he fired the previous head of the office, who was appointed by President Joe Biden for a five-year term. Greer's office has launched an investigation into whether Smith improperly engaged in political activities through his prosecutions against Trump. The investigation was made public after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed that “Smith used his DOJ role to influence the election” in favor of Biden's and Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 presidential campaigns. Smith's attorneys this week said that the investigation is “premised on a partisan complaint that suggests the ordinary operation of the criminal justice system should be disrupted by the whims of a political contest.” “But the notion that justice should yield to politics is antithetical to the rule of law,” it says. The Office of Special Counsel declined to comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, DC, a move that could run into significant obstacles with city juries. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, DC, we're going to be seeking the death penalty,” the president said during a meeting with Cabinet members Tuesday. The president did not immediately outline any specifics, but called capital punishment a “very strong preventative” measure. States, he said, “are going to have to make their own decision,” though in the nation's capital, prosecutors would seek the death penalty. “We will use all legal sanctions and sentences called for by law,” US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a press conference on Tuesday, when asked about her office seeking capital punishment in DC cases. Actually getting a death sentence, though, might not be so easy, as prosecutors would have to convince jurors to sign off. Historically, prosecutors have faced challenges in convincing special juries to impose capital punishment in DC, even if they vote unanimously to convict the defendants, multiple people in Washington's legal community have told CNN in recent weeks. “It's going to be difficult to find 12 people in DC who are going to do that,” said Jon Jeffress, a former federal public defender-turned-private defense lawyer in the city. The federal court in the District of Columbia hasn't held a death penalty trial since 2003, when Rodney L. Moore was convicted of 10 killings and Kevin L. Gray was convicted of 19 killings, according to multiple people familiar with the court and that case. In that case, the jurors said they couldn't agree unanimously on death sentences for the two men rather than life imprisonment, court records show. “This is an issue that's sanctioned by the law, and gives us the power to do that. If not us, then who?” she added. In recent months, the Justice Department has indicated in at least three cases in DC's federal court that it may seek the death penalty, according to court records. One of those cases is against Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of shooting two Israeli embassy staff members leaving a Jewish community event in May. The Department of Justice is also actively considering seeking the death penalty in DC District Court for two Mexican nationals who were charged in 2008 in a gang case and recently brought to the US, and for two young men who were indicted for a 2023 carjacking, according to court records. This comes at a time where the federal death row is down to three, after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of about three dozen federal inmates who had been sentenced to death.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reporters demand apology from Tom Barrack, US special envoy to Syria, after his remarks at Beirut press conference Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation's meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We're going to have a different set of rules ... please be quiet for a moment. “The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we're gone,” he said. “Act civilised, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what's happening in the region,” added Barrack, who has recently been leading talks with Lebanese officials. The Lebanese presidency in a statement on X expressed regret at “remarks made inadvertently from its podium by one of its guests”, affirming its appreciation for the journalists and media representatives. The photojournalists' syndicate called Barrack's comments “a direct insult” that set “a serious and totally unacceptable precedent”. In a statement, it demanded “an immediate and public apology”, rejecting attempts to “downplay the seriousness of what happened or let it pass without accountability”. The press editors' syndicate also called for “a public statement of apology” and floated a boycott of the envoy's future visits and meetings. The union of journalists in Lebanon said Barrack's remarks were “a reflection of an unacceptable arrogance in dealing with the media” and also called for an official apology.</p>

Israel missed its own deadline to respond to a temporary ceasefire and captive release deal that Hamas accepted over a week ago, with Israeli authorities appearing “unwilling” to accept the framework despite Hamas saying that the agreement contains significant concessions in Israel's favor. Qatari officials said on Tuesday that they have not heard from Israel about the framework, presented by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, even though Israel said that it was going to respond by Friday, August 22. Israel appears “unwilling to reach an agreement,” said Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari, per Al Jazeera. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “We are in contact with all parties in pursuit of a ceasefire agreement, but there is no official Israeli response — neither acceptance, rejection, nor the presentation of an alternative proposal,” al-Ansari said. Hamas announced over a week ago that it has agreed to the latest proposal. Qatari officials say the proposal is “almost identical” to one put forth by U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, in June. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, however, imposed a new condition on the framework last week, insisting that it involve the release of all Israeli captives — likely a nonstarter without a plan for a permanent ceasefire agreement, especially as Israel escalates its campaign to raze Gaza City and annex the Strip. The introduction of a last-minute demand echoes a tactic taken by Israel numerous times amid the genocide, of insisting on a condition that Israeli officials know will be rejected out of hand right as negotiations are nearing completion. Former U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently effectively admitted that this is a known tactic of Netanyahu's to allow Israel to continue its genocide. Drop Site reported last week that Hamas agreed to provisions like allowing Israel to continue its occupation of Gaza's border with Egypt, known as the Philadelphi corridor, which was previously a red line for Hamas. The top negotiator for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed resistance group in Gaza that has participated in ceasefire negotiations, said that Palestinian negotiators are effectively daring Israel to finally accept a ceasefire deal. There is no longer any room for concessions or futile negotiations,” the official, Mohammed Al-Hindi, told Drop Site. By demanding that all of the captives be released and delaying an agreement, after all, he is ensuring that numerous Israelis remain in captivity in Gaza indefinitely — potentially facing injury, famine, or death at the hands of Israeli forces.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We don't just charge people criminally and then say, ‘Oops, my bad,'” US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. US President Donald Trump has attempted to portray his deployment of National Guard troops and other federal agents in Washington, DC as a boon for public safety. Inside DC courtrooms, however, judges and defense attorneys have expressed alarm at the tactics being used by law enforcement officers to unfairly charge local residents with serious crimes that carry lengthy prison sentences. NPR reports that US Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui expressed incredulity on Monday while dismissing weapons charges against a Maryland resident named Torez Riley, who was subjected to what the judge described as “without a doubt the most illegal search I've ever seen in my life.” “A high school student would know this was an illegal search.” The Department of Justice had agreed to drop the charges after body camera footage of Riley's arrest showed officers searching him without probable cause, but Faruqui said that was cold comfort for a defendant who had already spent the last week behind bars. “We don't just charge people criminally and then say, ‘Oops, my bad,'” the judge said. “I'm at a loss how the US Attorney's office thought this was an appropriate charge in any court, let alone the federal court.” In its report, the Times focused the arrest of 28-year-old Amazon delivery driver named Mark Bigelow, who was hit with federal felony charges for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officials who were attempting to detain him over a misdemeanor offense of possessing an open container of alcohol. “As he was placed in a vehicle, the handcuffed Mr. Bigelow became belligerent, twisting his body and yelling, ‘Get off me! Federal public defender Elizabeth Mullin said in court last week that Bigelow would never have been charged with a federal felony were it not for the president's decision to send federal agents swarming the streets of the nation's capital. “He was caught up in this federal occupation of DC,” she said. The Times also reported on Monday that federal prosecutors had reduced charges against a woman named Sidney Lori Reid, who was accused of assaulting an FBI agent during a protest against Trump's immigration policies last month. Attorneys Tezira Abe and Eugene Ohm, who have been representing Reid, said that the grand juries' refusal to indict their client on three separate occasions indicated fatal weaknesses in the government's case.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has made four attempts to speak with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the phone in the past weeks but the latter did not take the calls, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported, citing sources. The paper points out that earlier, Trump shocked India by imposing the country with 25% tariffs and calling it a "dead economy." "There are signs indicating that Modi felt insulted," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes, adding that Modi's unwillingness to hold a phone conversation with Trump demonstrates the extent to which the Indian premier was irritated by what the US president had done. The newspaper also notes that the way Trump is perceived in India has considerably changed, particularly due to his statements about plans to boost relations with Pakistan. India and the United States launched talks on a large-scale trade agreement in February, following Modi's visit to Washington. India's delegation made several trips to Washington to hold talks on the document; a US delegation's visit to India for the sixth round of talks, set for August 25, was canceled. On August 6, the US raised tariffs on Indian goods by 25% to 50%, citing New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil and petroleum products. Trump criticized the South Asian nation for having always purchased the bulk of defense equipment from Russia and being the largest buyer of Russian energy, alongside China. The Indian Foreign Ministry condemned criticism from the US and the EU over Russian oil imports as unjustified. The increased tariffs are set to take effect on August 27.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asmadee Bueheng sells T-shirts in Pattani, Thailand, where he lost a job as a journalist after U.S. funding cuts shut down media outlet BenarNews.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail It had always been a hobby, finding items emblazoned with music bands or other designs that make them rare. In deep southern Thailand, on the border with Malaysia, he would sift through bulk shipments of used clothes – sold by weight in bundles of up to 100 kilograms − and pick out shirts he knew had value. Then, Donald Trump returned to the White House, with a new administration that cut deeply into U.S. spending overseas, including the funds that supported BenarNews, a media outlet operating in Islamic regions of southeast Asia that published stories about Muslim society in Thailand. It was funded by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. “It was the essential platform for local stories like this to be told.” The cuts shut down Benar in April and left Mr. Bueheng unemployed. Trump administration ends some USAID contracts providing life-saving aid, officials say Selling T-shirts is now his main work, searching through bags brought in from Pakistan and Malaysia and posting good finds for sale on Facebook Marketplace, rather than reporting on issues like a project to develop local hydro dams. The Malay Muslims of southern Thailand occupy a region that has been wracked by violence and political instability, home to a separatist movement that has attacked civilians and institutions of the central government. Today, military checkpoints with armoured vehicles and defensive installations are installed across roads through the area. Soldiers with assault rifles are visible walking through local forests on patrol. Southern Thailand is home to a separatist movement against the central government.TUWAEDANIYA MERINGING/AFP/Getty Images Few foreign tourists travel here, and the Thai government has been suspicious of Western influence in the region, in particular human-rights advocacy. “Many international organizations could not do anything here,” said Yasmin Sattar, a political scientist at Prince of Songkla University who has conducted an assessment of United States Agency for International Development spending in the Thai south over the past decades. But the U.S., through its funding of BenarNews and money that came from USAID, found ways to deliver funds that supported local organizations and government administrators. Among Western donors, “we could say that USAID is the biggest,” she said. Around the world, cuts to U.S. foreign funding have been rapid and severe, with the shuttering of USAID cutting off money for critical medical supplies and life-saving food. Slaight Family Foundation to give 13 organizations $1-million each after ‘horrifying' USAID cuts “When young people get the sense that they can engage with their own local government, at the end of the day they may not feel like they want to engage with violence,” said Prof. Sattar. But years of investment began to bring change in perceptions. “Foreign aid can be a soft power,” she said. “But when Donald Trump returned, everything just turned back.” Months later, “there is still no replacement for the USAID funding,” she said. Her organization, which published a guide for women's participation in public life, was in the past visited by the U.S. ambassador to Thailand. “It is not against Islamic law for women to have a greater role in society.” Foreign cash is particularly key in an area riven by sectarian strife, she said. Community groups that receive government funding can be seen as allies with a government that some here perceive as oppressive. The disappearance of U.S. funding has also come at a sensitive time in southern Thailand, where a long-standing peace process has been suspended since late last year. Civil-society groups, including those that have been funded by USAID, have played a role as independent monitors of what is taking place in the Thai south, where martial law has “allowed government security forces to do whatever they want − enforcement of the law without any discretion,” said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, director of Deep South Watch, which monitors conflict in the region. They know that USAID has stopped giving money to the local civil society,” Mr. Jitpiromsri said. Nonetheless, Mr. Jitpiromsri said, “Trump's new policy has effects on the human-rights movement.” Among those who feel newly vulnerable is Mr. Bueheng, the journalist. Mr. Bueheng says he faced criminal charges and was accused of obstructing justice after the news outlet that employed him was defunded due to USAID cuts.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LATEST: Polish president's veto won't threaten Ukraine's Starlink access, Nawrocki's office claims. Editor's note: This story was updated to include another law signed by President Karol Nawrocki the same day and a comment from a diplomatic source.Polish President Karol Nawrocki on Aug. 25 vetoed a bill that would have extended financial support for Ukrainians fleeing the war, a decision that officials warn will also cut funding for Ukraine's Starlink internet service starting Oct. 1. Poland has been supporting Ukraine's internet connection since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion by financing Starlink systems, which are a lifeline for soldiers fighting on the front line. Karol Nawrocki turns off the Internet in Ukraine with his decision, because de facto it means his decision on the law on assistance to Ukrainian citizens," Polish Deputy Prime Minister Krzysztof Gawkowski wrote on X. This is also the end of support for storing Ukrainian administration data in a safe place." "I can't imagine a better gift for (Russia's President Vladimir) Putin's troops than cutting off Ukraine from the Internet," he added, accusing Nawrocki of "helping Russia" by blocking support for Kyiv's communications infrastructure. The Polish president's decision to veto the bill "means that as of Oct. 1, Warsaw will not be able to continue paying for Ukraine's Starlink subscription," a spokesperson for Poland's Digital Affairs Ministry told TVP public television on Aug. 25. "Therefore, there is currently no legal basis for funding this from Oct. According to Polish outlet Onet, Nawrocki said on Aug. 25 that Poland's strategic interests have not changed, and Russia remains "the greatest threat to security." Ukraine relies heavily on Starlink, the satellite internet system developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX, to maintain connectivity in front-line areas and support government communications. Ukraine's Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov announced on April 3 that Poland had supplied 5,000 additional Starlink terminals for critical infrastructure. Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Ukraine has received over 50,000 Starlink terminals, with Poland providing nearly 30,000 — the largest contribution by any single country, according to Fedorov. Among other measures, Nawrocki announced the submission of his own bill that, among other measures, would extend the period required to obtain Polish citizenship from three to 10 years and introduce harsher penalties for illegal border crossing. The controversy over historical symbols has long complicated Polish-Ukrainian relations. "In order to eliminate Russian propaganda and set relations with Ukraine on a mutual respect, I believe we should also include in this bill an unambiguous slogan 'stop Banderism,'" the Polish president declared. Nawrocki, a right-wing nationalist backed by the opposition Law and Justice party, narrowly won Poland's presidential election on June 1 with 50.89% of the vote, defeating liberal rival Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. According to the data provided by the prosecutors, 202,997 criminal cases have been opened into unauthorized abandonment of military units, also known as absence without leave, from 2022 to July 2025. A total of 15, 564 people have been officially charged with the crime. Men aged 25 to 60 can be conscripted into the armed forces. Initial findings suggest the drone may have been intended to strike targets within Russian territory. The Estonian police say Russian electronic warfare, including GPS jamming, could have diverted the aircraft off course, causing it to stray into Estonian airspace. "At that time, 146 miners were underground; their ascent to the surface is ongoing." Thirty-three-year-old National Guard soldier Vladyslav survived after Russian forces slit his throat and threw him into a pit, believing he was dead, Suspilne reported on Aug. 25. The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to organize peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian presidents in its effort to end Moscow's full-scale war, while Kyiv awaits a proposed framework for security guarantees from its partners. State-owned and private processors, including energy giant Reliance Industries, plan to trim daily purchases to 1.4-1.6 million barrels from the current 1.8 million barrels, Bloomberg reported. The deals were reportedly offered as incentives to push the Kremlin toward a peace agreement and to provide Washington with justification for easing certain sanctions on Russia. The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. During his tenure, Igor Krasnov oversaw the arrest of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when he returned from Germany.</p>

MOSCOW, August 26. /TASS/. First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Denis Manturov did not rule out the resumption of aviation cooperation between Russia and the United States, but he stressed that it is too early to discuss the possible format of such collaboration, he said in an interview with TASS CEO Andrey Kondrashov ahead of the Eastern Economic Forum (EEF).

"Perhaps the resumption of aviation cooperation cannot be ruled out. But in which areas and in what formats - this is too early to discuss for now," he said.

Earlier, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and special presidential representative for investment and economic cooperation, stated that direct air service between Russia and the United States could resume by the end of 2025. Saint Petersburg may serve as one of the hubs for flights to the US. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, discussions on resuming flights between the two countries can take place only after Aeroflot is lifted from sanctions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. ALEXANDER GABUEV is Director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. In the lead-up to the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this month, things did not look good for Ukraine. Yet the summit didn't end in a major disaster for Ukraine. Trump didn't negotiate with Putin on Kyiv's behalf; he didn't agree to start normalizing relations with Russia before the war in Ukraine was resolved; and on August 18, he received Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a phalanx of European leaders at the White House, where they collectively managed to throw the diplomatic ball back into Putin's court. But although Putin now knows that his aspirational Plan A, in which Trump would simply impose a deal on Kyiv written in Moscow, is unlikely to materialize, he has shifted to his more workable Plan B, in which Trump will lose patience and significantly reduce U.S. assistance to Ukraine. In the Kremlin's calculus, this still counts as winning, and Putin's diplomatic strategy is still following the three-pronged approach that my co-authors and I outlined in Foreign Affairs a few months ago. Moreover, Russia is catching up in drone warfare, denying Ukraine its competitive edge. Moscow doesn't want a cease-fire to stop the war right now—unless, of course, all of its political demands are simply met. But despite the country's confidence, it's not clear that Putin has a realistic contingency plan should Kyiv prove able to hold on, as it has for the past three years. If, for example, the EU speeds up delivery of ammunition and drones from existing stock and extends a financial lifeline to Kyiv by confiscating the $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets sitting in its banks, the Kremlin may not achieve its strategic goal of Ukraine's subjugation. Despite putting Russia's economy and society on a war footing, Putin may need more than just time to win. Early engagements with the second Trump administration seemed encouraging for Moscow's Plan A. Trump appointed his friend Steve Witkoff as a special envoy for negotiations with Russia, and Witkoff visited Moscow several times and spent hours talking to Putin. Between Trump's inauguration in January and the summer, the U.S. and Russian presidents had three lengthy phone calls, and Putin's talking points clearly made an impact on his U.S. counterpart, as painfully evidenced in Trump's dressing down of Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28. The Kremlin suggested seeking peace in Ukraine in tandem with a broader normalization of U.S.-Russian ties, which would include reopening the consulates in both countries (which have been closed since 2017), restarting arms control talks, and boosting mutual trade and investment. By summer, however, it had become apparent that the Kremlin's charm offensive was faltering. Zelensky, with a lot of counseling from European leaders, had managed to patch up the relationship with Trump by signing a mineral deal that provided the United States with preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources, particularly rare-earth minerals. In return, the White House has continued Kyiv's access to U.S. military assistance, including American intelligence and the ability to purchase U.S. weapons with European money. And on July 14, speaking alongside Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of NATO, Trump threatened “very severe tariffs” if Russia didn't agree to an unconditional cease-fire. In 2024, Russia exported a meager $3 billion in goods to the United States, so even triple-digit tariffs would not seriously affect the Kremlin's budget. The decrease in oil and gas revenues is already affecting the war economy: some of the Russian regions that previously offered lavish payouts for military recruits are reducing sign-up bonuses because funds are drying up. It will overshoot even this target; in the first seven months of this year, the budget deficit already amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP. The United States, for instance, has not yet blacklisted Russian energy giants, such as Rosneft and Lukoil, but such a move would put significant pressure on the Kremlin's cash flow. As Alexandra Prokopenko wrote in Foreign Affairs in January, the Russian economy has enough steam to support Putin's war machine for another 18 to 24 months, but the situation is worsening. This reality presented the Kremlin with a dilemma of whether to continue the hard-nosed course, ignoring Trump's threats—or try to assuage him. The Kremlin invited Witkoff to come to Moscow, where he was presented with a semblance of an acceptable deal on August 7. The Russians also suggested a meeting with Trump, which was hastily organized in Alaska. The usual Russian mantra that leaders' summits must be carefully prepared—a justification that the Kremlin uses to explain Putin's reluctance to meet with Zelensky—was tellingly abandoned. After a three-hour conversation between Putin and Trump, the Alaskan summit's scheduled working lunch was canceled and the press conference downgraded to official remarks by each president. This was a clear signal that Russia's attempts to compartmentalize the Ukrainian war and to normalize ties in other areas had failed. But that was the only notable underperformance by Putin's team. Despite Trump's previous claims, as well as urging by European leaders and Zelensky before the summit, the White House has imposed no punitive measures on Russia over the Kremlin's refusal to agree to a cease-fire. He matched Trump's performative diplomacy with performative negotiations, essentially tricking the Trump administration into believing that he was making serious concessions. According to Trump and various U.S. officials, such as Witkoff, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Vice President JD Vance, Putin signaled in Alaska that he was ready to climb down from some of his maximalist demands—demands that were absurd to begin with. Putin apparently suggested that he is also willing to trade other parts of Ukraine that Russia occupies, including pockets of the Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy, and Kharkiv regions. These land swaps would see Kyiv surrender a land mass nearly ten times as large as what Russia is prepared to give back. (There are no major fortification lines beyond the “fortress belt” that Putin wants Kyiv to abandon.) Another key issue discussed in Alaska was postwar security guarantees for Ukraine. Witkoff told Fox News that “epic progress” had been made during the summit. According to him, Putin agreed for the first time to the concept of security guarantees for Ukraine, and the result could be even stronger than NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause—without actual NATO membership for Kyiv. Moreover, according to Witkoff, Russia agreed to enact a law that it would not take any more land from Ukraine after a peace deal or “go after any other European countries.” These promises were greeted as “groundbreaking” by Trump's team, and the U.S. president presented them as a major achievement during his August 18 meeting at the White House with Zelensky and a group of European leaders. According to him, Moscow's idea for a security guarantee is not a set of bilateral commitments between Ukraine and the U.S. and European governments with formulations similar to Article 5, but rather a consensus-based agreement guaranteed by the UN Security Council's five permanent members—with the Kremlin holding veto power. Moreover, Moscow insists on seriously limiting the Ukrainian armed forces—both in numbers and equipment—as well as their ability to cooperate with foreign partners in arms procurement, intelligence sharing, weapons design, and training. As first described in Foreign Affairs by Samuel Charap and Sergey Radchenko, those negotiations ended with no agreement in part because of Moscow's and Kyiv's inability to bridge the very same gap over security guarantees. For Putin, ending Ukraine's security partnership with the West remains a core goal. But from Kyiv's vantage point, the size of its army and ability to maintain ties to NATO's militaries are a prerequisite for retaining sovereignty and thus nonnegotiable. Moreover, Ukraine has reasons to believe that its negotiating position is stronger than it was in 2022. Unlike three years ago, European countries are finally ready to provide the security guarantees Kyiv seeks—or at least they now say so. It is unimaginable that Kyiv would abandon this partnership voluntarily. But if the Europeans' Plan A fails—if Trump doesn't blame Putin, or if he merely loses interest—they are developing their own Plan B. At the very least, they plan to maintain current levels of military support to Ukraine and increase the sanctions pressure on Russia (although the EU's sanctions toolkit is far less powerful than Washington's). If key European countries agree to step up the pressure, they could also share more of their existing military equipment stock with Ukraine, temporarily reducing the combat readiness of their own forces but keeping Ukraine in the fight at this crucial juncture. They could also provide a long-term financial lifeline to Kyiv by seizing the nearly $250 billion in state Russian assets frozen in the EU, allowing the purchase of U.S. weapons without reaching deeper into European taxpayers' pockets. Europe's Plan B probably will not deter the Kremlin: given Putin's demonstrated ability to stomach pain and keep plugging away at an elusive victory, the Russian leader may instruct his generals and economic team to simply carry on. His government can navigate the deterioration in public finances by cutting expenditures on education, health care, and infrastructure, as it has throughout the war. Putin is also prepared to tap into the deep well of Russian manpower by force if the financial incentives dry up further. In July, the Kremlin launched digital draft notices to push more Russian men into the army; the moment a future recruit receives an electronic notification that he has been called up, Russia's borders are closed to him and there are various penalties for not serving. The Kremlin is obviously preparing money and troops for a protracted war in which its only strategy is to outlast Ukraine militarily and economically. A plan, in other words, for the possibility that Ukraine's defense lines don't crumble after all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's actions in occupied Ukrainian territories further underscore its disregard for international protections. Former Kherson Mayor Volodymyr Mykolaienko was detained by Russian forces on April 18, 2022. Russian troops were unsuccessful in pressuring Mykolaienko to cooperate with occupation authorities, and he was targeted for his pro-Ukrainian views, his niece Hanna Korshun-Samchuk told the Kyiv Independent. A Russian serviceman claimed to have participated in the May 2024 killing of five captured Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk Oblast, Polish-Belarusian media outlet Vot Tak reported. Roschyna's body was returned to Ukraine in February with missing organs. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. According to the data provided by the prosecutors, 202,997 criminal cases have been opened into unauthorized abandonment of military units, also known as absence without leave, from 2022 to July 2025. A total of 15, 564 people have been officially charged with the crime. Men aged 25 to 60 can be conscripted into the armed forces. Initial findings suggest the drone may have been intended to strike targets within Russian territory. The Estonian police say Russian electronic warfare, including GPS jamming, could have diverted the aircraft off course, causing it to stray into Estonian airspace. "At that time, 146 miners were underground; their ascent to the surface is ongoing." Thirty-three-year-old National Guard soldier Vladyslav survived after Russian forces slit his throat and threw him into a pit, believing he was dead, Suspilne reported on Aug. 25. The Ramstein summit will take place as Washington is trying to organize peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian presidents in its effort to end Moscow's full-scale war, while Kyiv awaits a proposed framework for security guarantees from its partners. State-owned and private processors, including energy giant Reliance Industries, plan to trim daily purchases to 1.4-1.6 million barrels from the current 1.8 million barrels, Bloomberg reported. The deals were reportedly offered as incentives to push the Kremlin toward a peace agreement and to provide Washington with justification for easing certain sanctions on Russia. The attacks have disrupted Russia's ability to process and export oil and created gasoline shortages in some Russian regions, as well as in occupied Crimea. During his tenure, Igor Krasnov oversaw the arrest of late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny when he returned from Germany.</p>
