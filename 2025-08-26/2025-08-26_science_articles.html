Saxitoxin (STX, 1), a potent neurotoxin from shellfish, first isolated in 19571, offers immense pharmaceutical potential due to its interaction with voltage-gated sodium channels2, that are ubiquitously present in all excitable cells of the central and periphperal nervous system3. Hundreds of synthetic studies towards this end have been disclosed thus far, yet, a fully modular and scalable approach to the family remains elusive4-12. Thus, here we show how a tactical combination of radical retrosynthesis, biocatalysis, and C–H functionalization logic can be combined to solve this problem resulting in a scalable approach to the STX family in less than 10 steps including the first total synthesis of neosaxitoxin (neoSTX, 4), a hydroxylated naturally occurring STX analog previously under clinical investigation13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If true, it could explain where dark matter comes from, and a possible twist in our understanding of neutrinos. Scientists believe there could be an “anti-universe” somewhere out there that looks like the mirror image of our own universe, reciprocating almost everything we do. If this theory holds true, it could explain the presence of dark matter. Most agree that matter exploded forth, but there are different opinions on, for example, whether the temperature was extremely hot or absolute-zero cold at that initial moment. There are also disagreements about what may have happened prior to the bang itself. Dark matter is, if such a thing exists, maybe even more perplexing to scientists than the Big Bang. That's because dark matter is a key piece that helps to complete an unclear puzzle— the question of what forms the universe around us today, not billions of years ago. How is dark matter hidden in plain sight, and what are its qualities? These are huge mysteries upon which a ton of other ideas must rest. For the time being, one way to describe dark matter is very literal: by “dark,” we mean that it is not luminous, which is the technical term for matter that doesn't reflect or emit any photons in a way we can identify. But we can measure the physical (not visual) effects of dark matter in things like gravitational waves. Could it be that an “anti-universe” might run parallel to our own universe, but backward in time? “Among other things, we shall describe in detail a remarkable consequence of this hypothesis, namely a highly economical new explanation for the cosmological dark matter,” the researchers write. One cool thing about this model of the Big Bang is that it removes the need for what scientists call “inflation,” a period of time in which the universe massively expanded in order to account for its size soon after birth. Today, we know about neutrinos, extra-tiny mysterious particles involved in gravity and weak interaction only. If this sounds like wild and heady stuff, you're absolutely right. But iteration using this kind of new theory is a critical part of cosmology, because scientists must have existing, published theories in order to study them and decide what their next theoretical step is. It's so much easier to do that by responding publicly using your own observations and measurements, and that leaves a beautiful trail of ideas over time as we refine our understanding and develop more sophisticated ways to observe the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time, a research team at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities demonstrated a groundbreaking process that combines 3D printing, stem cell biology, and lab-grown tissues for spinal cord injury recovery. The study was recently published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The method involves creating a unique 3D-printed framework for lab-grown organs, called an organoid scaffold, with microscopic channels. In their study, the researchers transplanted these scaffolds into rats with spinal cords that were completely severed. "Regenerative medicine has brought about a new era in spinal cord injury research," said Ann Parr, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Minnesota. While the research is in its beginning stages, it offers a new avenue of hope for those with spinal cord injuries. The team hopes to scale up production and continue developing this combination of technologies for future clinical applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Derivatives of indole, where hydrogen atoms are replaced by various chemical groups, are naturally produced by plants, fungi, and even the human body. Some approaches introduce new groups directly onto the ring, while others involve temporary structural changes through intermediates. In a recent study, researchers at Chiba University, Japan, reported a method for selectively attaching an alkyl group to the C5 position of indole using a relatively inexpensive copper-based catalyst, which produced the desired product in yields of up to 91%. This method offers a more affordable and scalable approach for modifying indoles, which could be especially valuable in drug development. The study, led by Associate Professor Shingo Harada, included Mr. Tomohiro Isono, B.Pharm., Ms. Mai Yanagawa, M.Pharm., and Professor Tetsuhiro Nemoto from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Chiba University, and was published online in the journal Chemical Science. "We developed a direct, regioselective C5-H functionalization reaction of indoles under copper catalysis. The resulting compounds contain structural features commonly found in natural indole alkaloids and drug molecules, highlighting the usefulness of this approach for making biologically important compounds," says Dr. Harada. The reaction uses carbenes, highly reactive carbon species that can form new carbon-carbon bonds. They tested the reaction using a model compound, N-benzyl indole with an enone group, together with dimethyl α-diazomalonates as the carbene source and different combinations of rhodium, copper, and silver salts as catalysts. Initially, the desired C5-functionalized product formed only in small amounts, with yields up to 18%. The reaction proved to be highly versatile, working with a wide range of indoles. Successful reactions were also observed with indoles bearing other substituents, such as methoxybenzyl, allyl, and phenyl groups, opening the door to the synthesis of structurally diverse molecules. This copper-catalyzed strategy offers a reliable and cost-effective approach for modifying indoles at the C5 position, producing compounds that closely resemble biologically active indole-based agents. Dr. Harada highlights the method's potential for drug discovery by stating, "While it may not cause a significant shift right away, it could foster steady progress in drug discovery, leading to a small yet beneficial long-term impact." The team is continuing its research, exploring other metal-carbene reactions to develop more selective and efficient strategies for constructing indole-based molecules that might one day contribute to the treatment of specific diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DMT is a mysterious neurochemical that may ferry us to the great beyond, some researchers say. DMT (N,N-dimethyltryptamine)—the mysterious psychedelic molecule that occurs naturally in plants, animals, and possibly the human brain—plays an intriguing role in guiding consciousness at the moment of death, research shows. A 2018 study in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, for instance, hypothesized that DMT could induce a state as intense as an actual near-death experience (NDE), suggesting that it may play a role in the vivid euphoria many survivors report at the threshold between life and death. “There is good indirect evidence to suggest that DMT is released in greater quantities at the point of death in the human brain. “These include mystical experiences characterized by feelings of unity and timelessness, ego dissolution where a sense of self merges with a larger reality, and encounters with entities or presences.” While the idea of DMT as the chemical behind NDEs is compelling, it's just one part of a much larger puzzle. According to Luke, animal studies have shown that their brains at the point of death undergo a cascade of neurochemical changes, including massive releases of serotonin and noradrenaline—brain chemicals that help regulate mood, emotions, and stress. In other words, Luke suggests, DMT could indeed act like a psychopomp—a creature, spirit, or deity that transports the newly deceased to the afterlife. But the story of death doesn't end there. This distinction could influence the experience, with NDEs more likely to evoke autobiographical and relational memories tied to loved ones. “By contrast, 5-MeO-DMT tends to induce archetypal or abstract encounters, perhaps due to its intense focus on ego dissolution and the broader existential dimensions of experience,” Michael says. In his seminal book, DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Rick Strassman, MD, a psychiatrist and clinical researcher, attributed spiritual connotations to DMT by virtue of the engrossing and transcendent experiences it's reported to induce. Since then, some scientists have ramped up the conversation by finding that DMT may be released in large quantities at death. Despite that, some still say we know nothing about the role of endogenous DMT. DMT is structurally similar to serotonin and has been detected in human blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, but most of the research is in animal models. “They can have distinctly different ways of producing neurotransmitters and metabolizing compounds,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aging is hard enough—losing your mental faculties makes it even harder. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Sadly, one truth is well-known: As we age, so does our brain. Because this all-important organ filled with 86 billion neurons forms our experience, dysregulation within the brain has outsized impacts on someone's quality of life. For years, scientists have tried to find ways to stave off these negative effects and make a person's healthspan largely match their ever-increasing lifespan. By analyzing how genes and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said in a press statement. “We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age. It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging.” To test this idea even further, the team artificially stimulated the production of FTL1 in young mice, and soon, their mental abilities began to match those of older rodents. When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.” The authors also note that a 2015 study found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. The researchers hope that by targeting FTL1, future therapies may not only improve natural cognitive decline, but will also benefit people with neurodegenerative diseases. As this study—and many studies before it—have clearly demonstrated, there is no singular cause of mental decline. But with each new study, scientists work toward a holistic picture of neurodegenerative decline as we age, and with that new perspective comes the hope of new therapies that could make cognitive decline a thing of the past. Did Scientists Just Find a Way to Reverse Aging?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You're a sophomore in high school again, begrudgingly getting out of bed after snoozing your alarm one too many times. You may be tempted to squeeze and prod at the lump until it pops, but a recent account suggests you should hesitate before your next skin-picking session. One woman, Lish Marie, tried to pop a pimple beneath her nose and ended up in the hospital with facial paralysis—and experts say the infection could have been deadly. While pimples primarily occur during puberty, they can appear at any time on anyone. Puberty in particular causes hormone changes that can lead to sebaceous glands becoming overactive. Typically, healthy sebaceous glands produce oil to keep your skin from drying out, but when the glands are overactive, they can get clogged, leaving your back, face, chest, and shoulders riddled with those painful red spots. Its main job is to drain blood from the brain, so if an infection is introduced to the area (like it was in Lish's case), there's not much in its way before it reaches your body's control center. “There is the possibility for a facial infection to become an infection that impacts the rest of your body,” dermatologist Alok Vij said in an interview with Cleveland Clinic. Luckily, Lish unknowingly followed Vij's advice and sought medical help pretty much right away. She was treated with multiple antibiotics to fight the infection, and now claims that while the crooked smile and inflammation caused by the infection remained for a few days after treatment, she ultimately received a clean bill of health. Now, before you spiral over how many times you may have unintentionally put yourself at risk in the name of a satisfying pimple pop, know that cases like Lish's don't happen every day—otherwise, millions of teenagers would be at risk each year. “Thankfully, it's relatively unlikely,” Vij explained, “but whenever there's a violation of the skin and interaction with bacteria, there's always a possibility for infection, which can lead to greater health concerns.” So, next time you go to pop a pimple, wash your hands and maybe avoid the triangle of death. Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics. When she's not writing, Emma can be found hopping between coffee shops on the hunt for the world's best oat milk cappuccino.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) has successfully completed filling its 20,000-tons liquid scintillator detector and begun data taking on Aug. 26. Initial trial operation and data taking show that key performance indicators met or exceeded design expectations, enabling JUNO to tackle one of this decade's major open questions in particle physics: the ordering of neutrino masses -- whether the third mass state (ν₃) is heavier than the second (ν2). Prof. Yifang Wang, a researcher at the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and JUNO spokesperson, said: "Completing the filling of the JUNO detector and starting data taking marks a historic milestone. For the first time, we have in operation a detector of this scale and precision dedicated to neutrinos. Located 700 meters underground near Jiangmen city in the Guangdong Province, JUNO detects antineutrinos produced 53 kilometers away by the Taishan and Yangjiang nuclear power plants and measures their energy spectrum with record precision. It will also open new windows to explore unknown physics, including searches for sterile neutrinos and proton decay. Within 45 days, the team filled 60,000 tons of ultra-pure water, keeping the liquid-level difference between the inner and outer acrylic spheres within centimeters and maintaining a flow-rate uncertainty below 0.5%, safeguarding structural integrity. Throughout, stringent requirements on ultra-high purity, optical transparency, and extremely low radioactivity were achieved. In parallel, the collaboration conducted detector debugging, commissioning, and optimization, enabling a seamless transition to full operations at the completion of filling. A 41.1-meter-diameter stainless steel truss supports the 35.4-meter acrylic sphere, the scintillator, 20,000 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 25,600 3-inch PMTs, front-end electronics, cabling, anti-magnetic compensation coils, and optical panels. "The landmark achievement that we announce today is also a result of the fruitful international cooperation ensured by many research groups outside China, bringing to JUNO their expertise from previous liquid scintillator set-ups. Such an upgrade would probe the absolute neutrino mass scale and test whether neutrinos are Majorana particles, addressing fundamental questions spanning particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, and profoundly shaping our understanding of the universe.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While that's an acceptable timeline on geological scales, this rate of evolution isn't going to cut it for biotechnology companies. Instead, these companies rely on a technique known as directed evolution—the process of rapidly evolving proteins, introducing beneficial mutations, and selecting advantageous variants. While this can drastically speed up the clock (at least, compared to Mother Nature's method of doing things), directed evolution can still be a pretty long process. Luckily, scientists have been making some pretty astounding progress. In May of this year, a study led by the University of Sydney and published in Nature Communications detailed a process called PROTein Evolution Using Selection (PROTEUS) that leverages chimeric virus-like vesicles to rapidly evolve biomolecules. Now, a second study (led by Scripps Research and published in the journal Science) showcases yet another method for directed evolution called T7-ORACLE. According to the researchers, this breakthrough behaves like an “evolution engine” capable of introducing mutations 100,000 times faster than normal. “You can now evolve proteins continuously and precisely inside cells without damaging the cell's genome or requiring labor-intensive steps.” Schultz's team circumvents typical directed evolution bottlenecks by engineering the bacterium and model organism E. coli  to host what they call a “second, artificial DNA replication system derived from bacteriophage T7.” T7 phage is a virus that infects bacteria and has been widely studied, as it's remarkably good at that particular job. This system is orthogonal, meaning it operates outside of the cell's own biological machinery, and it also targets only plasmid DNA—small, circular DNA that replicates separate from a cell's chromosomal DNA. “This system represents a major advance in continuous evolution,” Christian Diercks, another co-senior author of the study from  Scripps Research, said in a press statement. “Instead of one round of evolution per week, you get a round each time the cell divides—so it really accelerates the process.” So, not only can T7-Oracle be an important tool for developing new medicines, it could also give scientists a better understanding of how antibiotic resistance builds up over time. “What's exciting is that it's not limited to one disease or one kind of protein,' Diercks said in a press statement. “What matters is that we can now evolve virtually any protein, like cancer drug targets and therapeutic enzymes, in days instead of months.” Did Scientists Just Find a Way to Reverse Aging?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microplastics are seemingly everywhere—and now growing research suggests they could be breeding grounds for drug-resistant bacteria For bacteria, microplastics are the perfect meetup spot—tiny, intimate surfaces where microbes can cling, huddle close and swap genes. And these crowded bacterial breeding grounds may pose a threat to human health. A growing body of new research shows that microplastics may fuel antimicrobial resistance—the phenomenon in which pathogens adapt to withstand drugs, making it challenging to treat infections. The growing antimicrobial resistance crisis claimed about five million lives in 2019, a number projected to double by 2050. In an August research review, scientists called attention to the “silent tsunami” of plastics-driven antibiotic resistance. Several other recent papers suggest microplastics serve as better homes for pathogens than some natural substances do, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. “We've just really scratched the surface,” says Timothy Walsh, a microbiologist at the University of Oxford, who has previously studied antimicrobial resistance and microplastics. In a biofilm, bacteria live close together, making it easier to transfer genetic material from one cell to another in what's “basically bacterial sex,” says Emily Stevenson, a public health researcher at the University of Exeter in England and lead author of the August review paper. The more chances microbes get to swap genes in general, the more chances they have to spread DNA that codes for antibiotic resistance.

Scientists in Germany, Costa Rica and the U.K. first detected the troubling trend in 2018, when they showed that bacteria on microplastics were more inclined than free-living bacteria to exchange genes encoding resistance to trimethoprim, an antibiotic commonly used to treat bladder infections and traveler's diarrhea. Other research has since shown that antimicrobial resistance genes were more common in the plastisphere—the community of microbes living on plastics—compared with those in water or soil. But scientists have questioned whether detecting high quantities of antimicrobial resistance genes actually translates to higher amounts of resistant bacteria—pathogens surviving despite being doused with drugs. A study published in March offers strong evidence that it does. They found that pathogens in the plastisphere not only grew faster—reconfirming earlier research—but, importantly, were harder to kill when treated with several different antibiotics. Researchers in Germany and Poland added microplastics to water samples taken from the Oder, a major European river. The results suggest that biofilms containing metabolically active, resistant bacteria were about 10 times more likely to form on microplastics than on natural surfaces, equating to about a 10-fold higher human health risk, according to the study authors. So how do antibiotic resistance genes arise on microplastics in the first place? A July study in Scientific Reports investigates one theory: antibiotics can cling to microplastics, too. As they age, microplastics become rougher and more electrostatic, which makes them even better at trapping antibiotics. Stevenson says that the question of whether microplastics are significantly better at spurring antimicrobial resistance than other surfaces such as wood or glass is far from settled, but the mere fact that plastics have the potential to carry both dangerous pathogens and antibiotics is reason enough to worry. Microplastics have been detected in nearly everything from air, water, plants and food, and as they are ingested, they bioaccumulate in animals' tissues—including human brains. A preliminary mouse study suggests that microplastics in the gut microbiome may also be fertile ground for antibiotic-resistant bacteria: mice exposed to both microplastics and tetracycline had more antibiotic resistance genes in their gut microbiota than rodents exposed only to the antibiotic. Microplastics' potential to shuttle antimicrobial-resistant bacteria around the globe makes Zaman particularly worried about plastic pollution that may pick up pathogens in wastewater treatment plants, hospital sewage or refugee camps—the latter of which he is currently investigating. “I think it's pretty clear that you see an enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes on plastic particles,” says Johan Bengtsson-Palme, a microbiologist at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, whose research focuses on antibiotic resistance. But how much of a threat plastic-derived drug-resistant pathogens pose to humans is a question that remains to be fully understood, he says.

Nature Chemistry (2025)Cite this article Azoles are important synthetic targets due to their diverse applications in areas ranging from human health to food security. Accordingly, access to N-functionalized azoles is an essential goal in modern synthetic chemistry. Surprisingly, however, the relied-upon azole N-alkylation strategies fundamentally limit the structural diversity of these important compounds that can be synthesized and studied. Here we introduce an approach to prepare a broad array of important but difficult-to-access N-alkyl azole compounds. We accomplish this through the introduction of a base-catalysed hydroazolation of readily accessible alkenylthianthrenium electrophiles. This strategy circumvents the classical challenge of azole alkylation regiocontrol through an unusual reversible C–N-bond-forming step that exploits the thermodynamic differences between azole N-alkylation isomers. This reaction furnishes a class of versatile azolothianthrenium building blocks that provides a general platform to investigate diverse N-alkyl azole molecules. More broadly, the distinctive approach outlined through this project is poised to impact the design and development of diverse regioselective alkylation reactions.

These typically suggest the presence of secondary flows, smaller in magnitude than the primary motion but driving complex three-dimensional internal structures. While one can infer such behaviour from boundaries or simulations, we have not previously been able to directly observe secondary flows experimentally. In this paper we present an experimental confirmation of secondary kinematics within granular media using dynamic x-ray radiography, without needing to stop motion for tomography. Specifically, we create a bulldozing mechanism of conveyor-driven grains. This generates a non-uniform, indented free-surface, hinting that secondary mechanisms are at play alongside the primary regime. Discrete element method simulations are shown to be consistent with this secondary-flow explanation. We then probe further experimentally using two perpendicular x-ray source/detector pairs to measure the velocity inside the bulk. This indeed unveils a complex three-dimensional flow pattern that deviates from the primary vertical planes and must include vortices and convection rolls. This advancement is pertinent for industrial and natural scenarios where grains impact obstacles, and has broader relevance for studying the rheology associated with secondary flows in other amorphous materials such as emulsions, pastes and colloids. Understanding the complex behaviour of dense amorphous soft materials, ranging from granular materials to emulsions, remains a fundamental challenge in soft matter physics1,2. These materials exhibit intricate flow dynamics that significantly influence their macroscopic properties. This is particularly apparent in granular media3,4, which are ubiquitous in both nature and industry, appearing in forms as diverse as sand, mineral ores, and cereals. The physical description of these materials is challenging due to their propensity to transition between solid-, liquid-, and gaseous-like phases based on external excitation rather than on their thermal temperature. Modelling the fluid-like phase of granular materials is particularly involved when one wishes to take into account the complex interactions with boundaries. For instance, when a geophysical granular flow encounters an abrupt change in topography, or when grains on industrial conveyors impact an obstacle, the flow can exhibit a sudden change in surface height, known as a shock or discontinuity. It is widely understood that such surface discontinuities conceal complex interactions and displacements beneath the free surface, yet measuring the corresponding internal flow field remains a significant challenge. A commonly proposed internal flow mechanism in granular systems is ‘secondary flows'. These represent displacements in directions different from the flow's primary component that are typically smaller in magnitude. For example, grains in a granular avalanche predominantly move in the downslope direction, but there may also be smaller recirculating or convection-like motion in the transverse or normal directions to the slope5,6,7. Secondary flows are not unique to granular media; they also occur in classical Newtonian fluids such as water8, where they are much better understood thanks to the water's transparency, which allows for extensive volumetric observations9,10, often through the use of tracers11,12, and thanks to the well-established rheological properties of water13,14. Our understanding of secondary flows in water currents is crucial, for instance for designing open-channel structures15,16,17 and in fluvial geomorphology18,19. However, the experimental study of secondary flows in granular media remains challenging due to the opacity of the grains. We often rely on numerical simulations, usually in the form of particle-based discrete element method (DEM) computations. While these provide valuable insights into the internal flow, they only represent a simplified model of the actual physical system. On the other hand, we can make experimental observations at either the free surface or lateral sidewalls to deduce the existence of secondary flows. For example, Forterre and Pouliquen made surface velocity and thickness measurements to infer the existence of longitudinal vortices20, which accurately matched the results of a linear stability analysis21. However, boundaries are known to alter the flow itself due to the formation of granular boundary layers22,23, and therefore, such measurements do not provide the full internal picture. There have been some experimental studies of secondary flows in granular suspensions using refractive-index-matched particles submerged in viscous fluids24,25. However, in these regimes, the development of secondary flows cannot be attributed purely to granular effects, as similar flows inevitably occur in pure fluids12. The experimental study of secondary flows underneath the free surface of dry granular media requires advanced imaging techniques capable of seeing through the bulk of opaque grains. One such method is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has been used to effectively measure internal particle velocities in continuously flowing Couette geometries26 but has not previously detected the existence of secondary flows. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is another non-invasive method that constructs a three-dimensional (3D) density map from which grain locations can be retrieved. This technique works by successively capturing x-ray radiographs from multiple directions, which requires intermittent pauses between flow periods to accommodate the extended time needed to obtain such radiographs without grain motion and imaging artifacts27,28,29. For this reason, most research on secondary flows in dry granular media focuses on quasi-static conditions, such as those achieved using a Couette cell30,31,32,33,34,35,36. While much can be learned from this approach, the majority of natural and industrial granular flows are continuously moving, which presents a fundamentally different deformation regime that is never left to relax to a static state. Up until now, investigations of secondary flows in continuous flow configurations have been limited to DEM simulations or inferred from experimental observations at boundaries. Here, we advance the experimental investigation of the development of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media. This is done without requiring interstitial fluid or intermittent halting of motion for volumetric measurements. Similarly, the methods presented here can be applied to any form of granular media – whether dry, saturated, or partially saturated – as well as to general heterogeneous flowing media, such as foams and active matter. The particular laboratory setup consists of a bulldozed granular flow in an open channel, which is established by driving grains from the base using a rubber conveyor belt and colliding these with a perpendicular wall. Crucially, the flow is significantly faster than in the Couette cell geometry previously used to investigate secondary flows. Similar conveyor-belt-driven configurations have previously been used to examine strain localisation at sidewalls using optical particle image velocimetry (PIV)39. Here, we instead use fast x-ray radiography from two perpendicular positions and develop a measurement technique to study the 3D shape of the strongly deformed free surface. This suggests the presence of secondary flows beneath the free-surface, which we explore with DEM models. We then experimentally measure the 3D velocity field along the main flow direction using x-ray rheography40. When combined with velocity fields averaged across both the width and the height of the flow, this provides a robust experimental volumetric observation of secondary flows in continuously flowing granular media. The experimental setup giving rise to secondary flows is sketched in Fig. The configuration is an open flume positioned above a conveyor belt, imaged through two x-ray radiography systems. The flume has a reservoir of grains at one end, and a wall suspended with a gap from the conveyor belt at the other. An initial pile of grains is carried by the conveyor belt and forms a heap upon reaching the suspended wall. Radiographs are obtained during motion from two perpendicular directions: vertically through the conveyor (z direction), and horizontally through the lateral sidewalls (y direction). Panels (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 show example radiographs obtained for the corresponding two x-ray detectors. Note that a third detector parallel to the x direction is not considered as the x-ray beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir, which would attenuate the signal too much to make meaningful measurements. Supplementary Video 1 is also available online, showing the two sets of dynamic radiographs alongside the physical experimental setup. A DEM simulation is also conducted that complements the experimental flow observations. Technical details of this simulation and of the experimental setup and procedures are described in the Methods section. While the results section focuses on a single set of parameters, the robustness of the findings is further illustrated for other values in the Supplementary Information. Here, h is the flow thickness, L the heap length, and h* its height. a and b show example radiographs captured during the steady state for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. Coordinate systems (η, ζ) are local to each x-ray detector. The experimental geometry and radiographs are illustrated using Supplementary Video 1 (available online). The granular flow was first analysed by developing an x-ray image reconstruction method with which the 3D details of the deformed free surface along the heap were measured, as shown in Fig. The technical details of this reconstruction process are described in the Methods section. a and b show the experimental free surface and relative height profiles at various x-positions, respectively. c and d display the free surface in the DEM simulation using coarse-grained density field and synthetic radiographs, respectively. The different colours in the three free-surface plots represent the relative heights at each given x-axis position (h(x, y)/hmax(x)). After the heap has fully stabilised in the flume, it exhibits a relatively uniform appearance across the width. This can be seen in the 2D height profiles at different positions, depicted in Fig. Note that there are also smaller fluctuations in the free-surface profile that are attributed to the discrete, granular nature of the material. These are not fully smoothed out when averaging the x-ray intensity over time, especially at the slower-moving section near the wall. Note also that the height profile displays a minor overall slope across the width, which is also apparent in the supplementary tests. This is attributed to x-ray scattering or to the conical shape of the x-ray beam, leading to uneven illuminating intensity in y. In light of past research revealing secondary flows under non-uniform free surfaces30,32,33,34,41, the dip at the start of the heap raises the question of whether such flow might develop beneath the bulldozed grains. In this scenario, the primary flow moves along the x direction, as it is primarily driven by the belt, and in the normal z direction, as the development of a heap necessitates particles climbing upwards to conserve mass, irrespective of secondary flows. Conversely, any bulk motion in the transverse y direction should be attributed directly to secondary flows, as this direction is orthogonal to the main stream of material. To investigate the possibility of secondary flow, we thus focus on the coherent existence of velocities along the y direction. We begin by developing a DEM simulation, which is designed to replicate the experiment. The DEM simulation was first used to evaluate the free-surface x-ray measurement technique described in full in the Methods section. To achieve this, the free surface in the DEM simulation was analysed using both its coarse-grained density field (Fig. 2c) and the same x-ray technique applied to synthetic radiographs, which were generated from the DEM model as in previous work40 based on particle positions and assumed x-ray attenuation properties (Fig. The strong agreement between Fig. Second, the simulation also allowed us to obtain the three velocity components Ux, Uy, and Uz parallel to their respective axes through the flow. 3 in order to highlight secondary flows. Indeed, the Uy velocity field and the cross-sectional streamlines display strong evidence of secondary flows. The cross-sectional streamlines at this position reveal a flow directed upwards, displacing horizontally from the walls towards the centre. The secondary flows are around one order of magnitude smaller than the basal velocity Ub driving the primary flow at this position. a–c show the value of Uy on three different slices along the flume at xa = 41.8 cm, xb = 34.1 cm, xc = 20.5 cm from the exit wall, respectively, as well as cross-sectional streamlines of Uy and the vertical (Uz) velocities. Moreover, the secondary flows are not constrained to only this position. Figure 3a reveals that the incoming flow before the heap also displays secondary flows, this time even smaller at around three orders of magnitude below Ub. These weak secondary flows are in the form of small rollers near both lateral walls, rotating inwards toward the centre of the flume. Elsewhere at this x position, the flow established by the DEM model is influenced predominantly by the conveyor belt with minimal vertical or transverse displacements (Uy ≈ 0, Uz ≈ 0), and hence the streamlines in Fig. Here, there is only a weak signal of secondary flow, again in the form of convection rollers near the lateral boundaries. Supplementary Video 2 (available online) illustrates the emergence and disappearance of these different phenomena when moving along the flume in the x direction. Having obtained strong evidence of secondary flows in the DEM simulations, we now return to the experimental configuration to establish whether we can detect similar secondary flows in the physical system. A 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity field was obtained using the two perpendicular sets of radiographs and the x-ray rheography technique developed by Baker et al.40, with the results shown on Fig. Below  ~ h1, the average velocity of the flow is slightly below Ub. The thickness of this horizontal shear band appears to be influenced by the heap's weight. Above  ~ h1, the flow shows little motion. The x-axis velocity fields (Ux) derived through the experimental x-ray rheography technique and the discrete element method simulations are shown in a and b, respectively, with additional slice views in y − z and x − z planes. The arrows indicate the direction of the conveyor velocity (Ub), which moves from right to left in all panels. Despite both tests producing similar heap height, h*, the experiment exhibits a shorter heap length compared to the DEM result. In addition to the 3D reconstruction of the Ux velocity component, we apply correlation-based particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of the two sets of radiographs to obtain Uy and Uz velocity fields, depth-averaged in the direction of the x-ray beams23. This complementary imaging method provides insight into all velocity components, which strongly consolidate our finding of secondary granular flows in the experimental setup. For the purpose of cross-validation, these analyses were conducted on both real experimental radiographs and simulated radiographs, the latter based on particle positions from DEM and assumed x-ray attenuation properties. Technical details are available in the Methods section. The Ux velocity fields present multiple similarities, as displayed in Fig. 5a, b, e, f, consistent with Fig. When viewed from above using detector 2 (see Fig. When viewed from the side using detector 1 (see Fig. 5e, f) both cases show a similar shear band between the bottom of the flow and the heap, where the lower material flows at velocities close to Ub. These results are cross-validated with the corresponding depth-averaged velocity fields of the discrete element method simulation (right column), recreated from artificially generated radiographs. a and b refer to the x-axis velocity fields (Ux) seen from the top (detector 2). Similarly, c and d display the y-axis velocity fields (Uy). x-axis velocity fields from the side (detector 1) are shown on e and f, and z-axis velocity fields (Uz) are displayed on g and h. All velocity fields are normalised by the velocity (Ub) of the conveyor, which transports particles from right to left in all the above panels. More importantly, as depicted from the top view of detector 2 by both the experiment and simulation in Fig. 5 are normalised by the belt velocity Ub, allowing easy comparison of the corresponding magnitudes. This indeed confirms that the secondary flow is significantly slower than the primary conveying motion, being an order of magnitude less than Ub. This transition is more prominent in the experimental velocity field in Fig. 5c, implying potential issues of replicating the exact boundary conditions and particle interactions in the DEM simulation. Side-view analysis from detector 1 of the Uz vertical velocity fields in Fig. 5g, h shows a robust upward flow where the free surface starts to ascend, with higher magnitude in DEM simulations compared to the experiments. In addition, a pronounced downward flow is observed near the outgoing gate, influenced by the exit wall. The area of this downward flow is more extensive in the DEM results. Note that, in general, x-ray rheography can be applied to recover the full three components of velocity in three dimensions40. However, this requires three mutually perpendicular imaging direction. For this particular experimental setup, this would involve positioning an x-ray source and detector along the x-direction, meaning the beam would have to pass through the full length of the chute and reservoir. This would have caused excessive attenuation, making it virtually impossible to measure the components Uy and Uz in 3D. This paper has presented experimental confirmation of a secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media. Using a confined chute and conveyor belt to establish a bulldozing mechanism, we are able to probe the system through a variety of x-ray radiography techniques and establish the presence of secondary vortices within the dry granular bulk. These techniques enable such secondary flows to be internally measured experimentally without having to artificially change the system (e.g., restricting to quasi-static motion, as in CT) or change the material (e.g., add viscous interstitial fluid, as in refractive index matching scanning). Note that several methods exist to estimate grain velocities along the surface of a granular bulk, and these measurements have previously been used to infer secondary flow within the material20,21. However, in general, two significant limitations exist from such a surface measurement approach. First, surface velocity measurements must carefully account for and exclude the effects of particles seeping into or emerging from the bulk. Second, and more critically, surface measurements alone cannot provide conclusive insights into the flow within the bulk because surface particles represent only a negligible fraction of the total particles in the system. In fact, visual inspection of our system has revealed surface disturbances in the form of localised and often gaseous backward-avalanching surface-grains that, in isolation, would mislead conclusions about the flow within the bulk. Similarly, bulk quantities such as depth-averaged velocities are not necessarily related to boundary or surface measurements. For example, in the rotating cylinder system previously investigated by Baker & Einav42, positive and negative displacements cancel each other out, making the beam-averaged velocity equal to zero. However, just measuring from the sidewall of the cylinder (if it was made of transparent material) would suggest all lateral velocities are non-zero and moving in the same direction. In contrast, the method proposed in this article directly addresses these limitations by considering the flow of all grains throughout the thickness or depth of the bulk, rather than focusing solely on surface particles. As such, the results presented here offer an experimental validation of secondary flow within the bulk of continuously moving granular media. In establishing the presence of secondary flows in this system, we have developed an x-ray methodology for measuring the 3D surface profile of flowing granular media. This could be useful beyond the specific geometry and material investigated here, for example where the free surface is obstructed by airborne grains or rigid structures making optical imaging difficult but where x-rays could still be transmitted through. We have also applied existing dynamic x-ray radiography23 and rheography40 methods to a new geometry, further strengthening the value of these tools both in isolation and, crucially, in conjunction with each other and the free-surface measurements to build a more complete picture of the secondary flows. A further methodological innovation is the use of dynamic x-ray radiography to measure depth-averaged velocities. While the same approach has previously been applied to compute quantities averaged in the lateral directions (avoiding sidewall effects)23, depth-averaged quantities are of particular interest because they can be compared directly to shallow-water type flow models. These models have been particularly pivotal in studying geomorphological changes caused by soil erosion and landslides, as well as glacial landforms and snow avalanches43,44,45. Combining the x-ray method for 3D free surface profiling with the application of x-ray radiography for measuring depth-averaged velocities provides a powerful means of comprehensively evaluating the predictions of shallow-water-type models. The experimental observations made in this paper allow us to investigate the secondary flow patterns and mechanism. To further our understanding of this and other geometries, it is important to isolate the controlling factors that determine the presence and magnitude of such secondary flows. Since the secondary vortices are confined and placed symmetrically between the lateral sidewalls, a key question here is whether these boundaries are required to produce such flow patterns. To this end, we have also studied the dependence of the secondary flows on sidewalls using DEM simulations of a similar configuration but with either frictionless sidewalls or periodic boundary conditions in the lateral directions (see Supplementary Information). In the frictionless sidewall case, some traces of secondary flows could still be detected. On the other hand, the analysis using the periodic boundaries appears to entirely eliminate the secondary flows, suggesting that the boundedness is indeed a necessary condition and that secondary flows would not form spontaneously in an unconfined setting. A more comprehensive study of the exact role of the wall properties in the development of secondary flows remains open. While most bulldozed grain systems will, in practise, be bounded by the finite domain of the bulldozer cap, this observation helps inform higher-order constitutive models incorporating, for example, non-local effects4. These models can, in turn, contribute to our understanding of other potential secondary mechanisms in unbounded flows, such as the presence of longitudinal ridges on Martian landslide deposits46, which have been postulated to occur during the transition from thick to thin flow regimes. Building on the results presented here, future work could apply the same general tools to different materials to investigate, for example, the role of grain shape and convexity, which has previously been found to induce qualitatively distinct secondary mechanisms27,30. Furthermore, the complementary imaging approach, key to the success of this study, could be extended further to allow us to study an even broader range of granular and glassy media. In particular, to elucidate whether the granular or viscous fluid phase drives secondary flows in suspensions, one could combine the dry granular tools presented here with submerged refractive index-matching scanning experiments. This would provide insight into the behaviour of saturated and partially saturated systems. The experimental flume is divided into three sections: a reservoir to supply incoming grains, the flow region of interest, and an outflow region where grains leave the system and fall into a bucket. The conveyor belt is made of rubber with uniformly distributed asperities of size 3 mm. The two cross-flow walls and the flume are all made out of 1cm-thick acrylic sheets, whereas the front wall, which accumulates the heap, is made of aluminium. To avoid vibrations during tests, the flume was first pressed against the conveyor belt under its weight and then anchored tightly using beams at the top of the system, out of the line of x-rays. This anchoring approach prevented grains from slipping under the walls or even getting stuck during the tests, thus averting any potential belt damage. The granular material comprises spherical glass beads with an average diameter of d = 3 mm. The test is set up by first filling up the reservoir with grains, as well as placing an additional pile of grains with a height > h1 next to the reservoir gate, inside the flow region of interest. As the belt starts moving, the new grains entering the flowing domain join the pile and eventually either impact the outgoing wall or flow through the downstream opening, so their aggregated bulk eventually forms a steady heap a few seconds after impact. The online Supplementary Video 1 captures this process. Through trial and error it was found that by taking h2 = h1 − d/2 the flow maintained a sufficiently prolonged steady state geometry for x-ray imaging that lasted up to 2 minutes, limited by the capacity of the reservoir. Multiple tests were performed, all with the belt velocity Ub fixed at 2 cm s−1 to eliminate motion blur on the x-ray radiographs. On the other hand, we varied h1 from 25 to 60 mm, and the height of the heap h* from 50 mm to h* ≈ 100 mm by changing the initial amount of grains on the conveyor belt. Given this trend, a single test is analysed in this study, with h1 ≈ 25 mm and h* ≈ 77 mm. The x-ray sources were positioned ~2 m from the flume to minimise non-parallel beam effects. Similarly, the x-ray detectors were situated around 20 cm from the flume in the opposite direction of their respective sources, as depicted in Fig. Steel panels were positioned to prevent undesired illumination of the detectors from their non-associated sources. During tests, the sources were set to produce x-ray at a maximum energy of 190 keV and 4 mA current for source 1, and 190 keV and 5 mA for source 2. Radiographs were captured at a frequency of 30 fps with a resolution of 960 × 768 px at 16-bit with a spatial resolution of 0.29 px mm−1 and 0.22 px mm−1 for detectors 1 and 2, respectively. In addition to the full, flowing system, radiographs were also obtained of the empty chute to aid subsequent analysis. The accuracy of the 2D and 3D velocity measurement methods presented in this work has been studied using known velocity fields23,40. While the methods sometimes introduce quantitative errors, they qualitatively recover a range of underlying fields and therefore the secondary flow findings in this paper are believed to be robust. Here, we introduce a reconstruction method for establishing 3D profiles of free surfaces of granular flows using x-ray radiography from two orthogonal directions. In the case of detector 2, assuming that there is no significant spatial change in the volume fraction of the dense flowing material, Eq. where hBL(x, y) is the theoretical Beer-Lambert surface height profile, and μc is the effective material absorption of the grains on detector 2, which is assumed constant. The radiograph intensities Ii, used in this process, are depicted in Supplementary Video 3, along with their values normalised by Ii,R. In order to capture additional effects such as beam hardening and x-ray scattering, which are not considered by the Beer-Lambert law, we consider the following empirical linear relation for the actual surface height profile: In order to obtain μc and βc, we first calculate a nominal profile of the averaged height along the y direction, \({ < h > }_{y}\equiv { < h > }_{y}(x)\) using detector 1. This is done from direct thresholding of the time-averaged absorption field \({ < \ln ({I}_{1}/{I}_{1,R}) > }_{t}\), and is well-defined thanks to the very different absorption of air and grains, and the fact that the material height does not vary much across the y direction of the flume, even near the dip. To first order, the surface height at the centre of the flume is estimated by \(h(x,0)\approx { < h > }_{y}\). Then, the effective material attenuation coefficient μc on detector 2 can be found by fitting a linear law from the time-averaged absorption field observed at each pixel along the centre line: where we obtain μc = 0.01117 mm−1, as well as βc = 0.2304 which was introduced to allow for additional effects of beam hardening and x-ray scattering. The fit can be seen in Supplementary Fig. As a last step, h(x, y) from Eq. (3) is smoothed with a 2D Gaussian filter of standard deviation 6 px. The simulations involved N ≈ 120,000 spherical particles, which were modelled using a viscoelastic contact law with a linear spring for normal contacts and a Coulomb threshold for tangential contacts49. These particles have the same average diameter 3 ± 0.75 mm as the glass beads used in experiments, with some added polydispersity to avoid crystallisation while preventing segregation. Their interparticle friction was set at 0.5, their stiffness at 1 × 107 Pa, their density was set at 2500 kg m−3 to mimic the material and ensure maximum interparticle deformation of 10−4d. The normal restitution coefficient was set at 0.5, and the Poisson's ratio at 0.3. To mimic the geometric effects of the rubber conveyor belt, its texture of was simulated using a set of spheres with a fixed spacing of every two rows along the y-axis, at a height z = 0, with a longitudinal row at a height of z = − d. These boundary grains were set in motion at velocity Ub and had an increased friction coefficient of 1.0. A similar friction coefficient was set to describe the acrylic walls, aligning with literature values for the friction coefficient between glass with acrylic and rubber50. Fictitious rolling friction was not implemented since the boundary spheres provide an actual physical rolling resistance. However, different friction coefficient values and belt arrangements were tested, with the stated combination of parameters above exhibiting the closest similarity to the experimental result while also aligning with the physical properties of the simulated materials. The experimental setup for the simulations mirrored the physical experiment: a reservoir initially filled with grains and a pile of grains situated inside the flume. The pile height was adjusted to match h* upon reaching a steady state. Once a constant state was achieved, the grains' locations, velocities, and radii were recorded to a file at a frequency of 30 fps, mirroring the experimental setup. 2700 frames were used for the simulations presented in this work. Next, a coarse-graining method51 was employed to obtain the velocity and density fields of the recorded flowing spheres, using a Lucy windowing function with a radius of 2d. Synthetic radiographs were generated from DEM data as in previous studies40,42 using the sphere positions and radii to calculate the attenuation along the x-ray path. This was based on an idealised system where the sample consists of solid particles, each of the same uniform x-ray attenuation coefficient, and interstitial air of negligible attenuation compared to the solid phase. Assuming a parallel x-ray beam with no scattering, the Beer-Lambert attenuation law then simplifies to where I0,DEM is the initial x-ray intensity before travelling through any grains, μDEM is the constant attenuation coefficient and D is the total thickness of grains that the x-ray beam travels through. This thickness will depend on the pixel position (η, ζ) in the local imaging coordinates and can be calculated by summing each of the N projected particle thicknesses. For detector 1 the depth is then given by and similarly for detector 2 the depth is where (xi, yi, zi) and ri represent the position and radius of particle i. These two thicknesses are calculated for each frame and Eq. (5) is then used to generate the corresponding artificial radiographs with an arbitrary attenuation coefficient of μDEM = 10, initial intensity I0,DEM = 100,000 and spatial resolution 3 px mm−1. The absorption fluctuation field (μfluct) is then calculated by as depicted in Supplementary Video 3. We focus on the x-axis velocity component, which is common to both imaging directions. X-ray rheography is a correlation-based algorithm that first reconstructs the distribution of in-plane displacements through the out-of-plane direction by solving a deconvolution problem42. It then solves an optimisation problem to combine velocity distributions from two perpendicular directions and reconstruct internal velocity fields. The accuracy and sources of errors of x-ray rheography have previously been investigated for both the initial distribution reconstruction42 and the whole rheography process40 (see Supplementary Information within). Here, we apply the initial correlation analysis on successive pairs of images using an interrogation window size of 32 px and a maximum displacement of  ±16 px. The deconvolution process was conducted utilising regularisation parameters α = 0.1 and p = 2.0 (see Baker et al.40), and this was repeated for multiple pairs of images to improve accuracy, up to a maximum of 100,000 evaluations. The optimisation problem was solved by averaging the best 100 configurations with the smallest errors from a total of 10,000 to give the resulting internal x velocities. Note that this velocity field assumes a uniform free surface across the width of the flume, and thus disregards the obtained dip along with any other variation in the free surface. The calculated velocity fields are therefore trimmed using the free surface measurements in order to eliminate extrapolated velocities out of the granular domain. The experimental depth-averaged velocity fields were computed from successive x-ray radiographs using the methodology developed by Guillard et al.23 for granular silos, which was validated against known flow rates from a mass balance. For the DEM radiographs, the analysis was conducted using auto contrast, with FFT window deformation as the PIV algorithm. The interrogation width area was set at 64 px with a step of 32 px for the first pass, and a width of 32 px with a step of 16 px for a second pass. A Gauss 2 × 3 point for the sub-pixel estimator and a standard correlation robustness setting were applied. Similar settings were applied for the experimental radiographs, with the addition of a CLAHE filter of 64 px during image preprocessing. For the side detector analysis, a mask drawn at the free surface of the side view detector (1) was implemented to ignore all displacements above the free surface. Obtained displacements for detector 1 were calibrated using height h2 and for detector 2 using the known flume width. The final results were averaged in time with no additional filtering. Source data are provided with this paper. The open source code developed for estimating the free surface using two orthogonal x-rays has been added as part of the PynamiX toolset, available at: https://github.com/scigem/PynamiX.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are common over-the-counter medications that many of us reach for when we're sick. In the first study of its kind, researchers found that ibuprofen and acetaminophen are not only driving antibiotic resistance when used individually but amplifying it when used together. It's an important finding that has serious health implications, particularly for people in aged care homes, where multiple medications are regularly administered. The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019. "This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications -- not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure -- making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. "In this study we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut or urinary tract infections. "When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and acetaminophen, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery) , temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant). "Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore," Assoc Prof Venter says. "This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications -- particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments. "This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics -- and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations." The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.
